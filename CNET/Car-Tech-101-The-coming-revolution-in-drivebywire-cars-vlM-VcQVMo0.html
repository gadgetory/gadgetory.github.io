which is also known as ex by wire
sometimes is to replace all these
physical controls in the vehicle like
steering braking an accelerator which
are mechanical now with systems that are
electronic or electromechanical getting
rid of the physical linkages and
inserting a computer between you and the
vehicles drive systems get into your
vehicle and I hit the accelerator pedal
you're not pulling a throttle cable to a
carburetor or fuel injector system
anymore you're telling a computer what
to do I'm a shifter in a lot of modern
cars like in any recent BMW that paddle
shifters not moving linkages it's just
moving electrical contacts and telling a
computer how to handle the transmission
are the good conceptual demonstration of
drive-by-wire in general is the
steer-by-wire setup in this development
cars is the x1 at the Stanford
automotive innovations lab now it starts
off with a traditional steering wheel
turns out round still works well but if
you think it's like a game controller
it's a very different feel it has weight
it has feedback it has mass to it now
here's where things are very clearly
different at the end of this there's no
more steering linkage and that's where
drive-by-wire really becomes by wire
things look and feel very similar
professor Chris Gertie's at Stanford has
been working on assisted driving systems
like this for some 20 years what does
the computer do so the computer is
sending commands to these amplifiers
which are connected to the motors and so
the computer will command a certain
amount of torque to turn the wheel and
then it will look at the position of the
wheel and see if it's gone to the right
place if it hasn't gone to the right
place it'll compensate in the control
algorithm to apply a little bit more
torque to turn the wheel until it gets
to the right position the benefits of
drive-by-wire include better response
faster more precise actions by car
systems can be handled by computers than
by us some of the active safety systems
that we've been working
with will steer the wheels in the event
of an emergency and we can steer the
wheels the proper amount in an emergency
much faster than most human drivers
could judge that and then actually move
the wheel
Automation when systems are filtered
through computers to either make our
driving better or to recognize things we
haven't seen yet and react to them so
this is a very similar to the brake
assist systems which sense that the
driver is intending a panic stop and
will put the brakes on fully even if the
driver is still ramping up with that
command in dangerous situations
the electric motor triggers a full
braking maneuver from the booster in the
blink of an eye automation can also tune
driver inputs to maximize performance
efficiency and reduce emissions
ergonomics the controls you touch in the
car can be made to feel best for the
task so maybe you want something it
gives you a lot more assistance so that
you're decoupled from the road that
would be very easy to program or maybe
you actually like feeling the road and
want something it feels even closer to
manual steering that would also be easy
and finally weight a major reduction can
be achieved by replacing heavy metal
linkages and parts that exist today with
more compact electric servos that live
at the point of action the challenges of
drive-by-wire include communicating the
perceived benefits so many of these
things really are most evident to people
designing the cars and selling the cars
from the drivers standpoint they'll
understand that things are different you
know they'll see a difference in
steering feel but in order for them to
really find that to be an advantage it
has to be better trust consumers and to
a degree automakers don't trust this yet
the automaker will redesign accelerator
pedal especially in light of the recent
Toyota Gate situation we're just the
idea that some bad software in a car
could cause runaway acceleration spooked
a lot of people and I think it's natural
for people to approach cautiously the
automakers have been fairly slow to
introduce steer-by-wire for exactly that
reason the question of can they offer a
great enough benefit to the driver for
them to overcome any sort of hesitation
they might have
and finally fault detection your current
car has limited if any of this but in
the drive-by-wire world there has to be
a lot of fault vigilant technology and
built-in backups and all of it done
economically by many estimates the
amount of software that it takes to run
the basic functions of steering and
throttle is only about 10 percent of
what's on there and about 90 percent is
fault detection fault recovery the sorts
of things that you need to handle
situations where things are not working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
