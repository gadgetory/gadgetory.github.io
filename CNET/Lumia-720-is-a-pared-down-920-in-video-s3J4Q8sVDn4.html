Mobile World Congress in Barcelona we're
at the Nokia stand and we're taking a
look at the Lumia 720 now the best way
to think about the Lumia 720 is the sort
of light version of the 920 because it
feels broadly the same and the design is
very very similar but the specs are just
a little bit more modest you get a 1
gigahertz dual-core processor this 4.3
inch screen has a resolution of 800 x
480 pixels so not quite as high as the
720p on the 920 it still looks quite
good though it's a very bright colorful
screen so that's a positive sign
certainly on the back there's the option
to get wireless charging covers so
there's no wireless charging built-in
but you can get this optional cover for
it which means you'll be able to put it
on a docking station and charge the
phone without plugging it in around the
back is a 6.7 megapixel camera and
there's a front-facing camera as well
there's eight gigabytes of on-board
storage and brilliantly there's a
microSD card slot so if that's not
enough space you can bump it up yourself
as savvy tech fans will have already
noticed the Lumia 720 is running Windows
Phone 8 which is Microsoft's mobile
operating system is very colorful you
get these live tiles on the front feels
very smooth to move through and nokia
has made a real effort to stick some of
its own apps on here to try and really
sell this particular brand of Windows
phones so you get things like Nokia
music which streams and pre-made music
playlists to your phone you also get all
of Nokia's Maps applications Nokia is
quite big into mapping and navigation so
that's things like here city lens here
maps and here drive+ which is in beta at
the moment and you also get some camera
tweaks like Nokia's various lenses and
this cinemagraph app which creates a
still image with a part of the picture
that moves it's a little bit like the
cinema Graham app that you might be
familiar with if you own a rival
operating system so that's pretty
standard so far there's not a lot that
this phone offers over other Windows
Phone devices but it does have one trick
up its sleeve and that's the price this
phone is going to be on sale for 249
euros which I
we think is quite a good deal for a
phone that feels every bit as slick and
speedy as what a couple of years ago
you'd be paying a lot more money for and
certainly windows phone is doing better
in the budget market some recent windows
phones that are a bit cheaper have been
very good very good performance so that
is quite exciting i'm excited about the
low price this phone should be out
before the summer i'm luke westaway for
cnet and this is the Nokia Lumia 720</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
