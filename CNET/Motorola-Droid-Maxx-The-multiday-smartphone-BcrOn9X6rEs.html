and right now we're taking a first look
at the Motorola Droid Maxx what you see
before you is the top dog in Motorola's
legendary droid smartphone lineup for
2013 shipping now on Verizon for two
$99.99 with two-year contract this
gadget doesn't come cheap so what does
the Droid Maxx offer to justify its
steep sticker price quite a bit at least
on paper first off the new Max sports a
huge 5 inch 720p HD OLED screen the same
display you'll find on it's less
expensive sibling the Droid ultra it may
not have the full HD resolution of the
samsung galaxy s4 or HTC One that said
the max is screen is big produces vivid
colors and has high contrast and deep
blacks the phone runs Android jellybean
version 4.2 - not the freshest iteration
Android 4.3 even so just like the Droid
ultra the max of software is close to
stock of course Motorola throws in some
wild droid themed wallpapers and
ringtones I especially like this one
that looks like Skynet's global control
center or something you might expect the
Droid Maxx to use a high-octane
quad-core processor like the Galaxy s4
and HTC One not so the max relies on
Motorola's new x8 mobile computing
platform that's built around a dual-core
1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon CPU that
doesn't mean the max is underpowered the
system boasts discreet quad-core Adreno
graphics along with a processor for
interpreting natural language and one
for contextual computing it's the same
technology motorola integrates into its
flagship the Moto X and the other new
verizon droids the droid mini Android
ultra as a result the Droid Maxx feels
nimble and responsive and thanks to
motorola officially becoming a google
owned company the maxx enjoys tight
integration with the Google now advanced
search application call touchless
control speaking the phrase okay Google
now at the phone will cause it to wake
up from slumber ready to leap into
action you can ask for directions
facts or set reminders just to name a
few options an active display feature
uses only part of the screen to show
notifications and alerts touch items to
see more details or dismiss them the
idea here is to fire up the phone less
and save battery life above the screen
is a two megapixel front camera while
below it sit three capacitive buttons
for basic Android control around back as
the Droid Maxx is 10 megapixel main
camera and LED flash there's a big
speaker here too which pumps out a huge
amount of volume motorola simplified the
camera app for greater speed so you can
spend more time taking photos and less
time messing around with the camera
settings you can also activate the
camera by picking up the phone and
twisting it in your wrist while you
can't adjust image size you can toggle
modes for HDR and panorama on or off I
also like the Droid Maxx is traditional
Kevlar fiber coating on back which
resists both scratches and fingerprints
at 0.34 inch thick the Maxx is
remarkably trim especially considering
it packs a ridiculously high capacity
3500 milliamp battery tipping the scales
at almost six ounces however the max is
hefty motorola says the maxes enhance
battery provides a long 48 hours of
mixed usage it is not removable though
so you can't swap in a fresh battery in
a jam the Maxx also comes with 32
gigabytes of internal memory
unfortunately the phone lacks an SD card
slot to add additional storage and like
all the new droids the Droid Maxx links
to Verizon's 4G LTE network for fast
data
I'm Brian Bennett for cnet.com and this
has been a first look at the Motorola
Droid Maxx
