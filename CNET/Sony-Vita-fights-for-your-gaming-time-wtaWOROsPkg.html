with its 5-inch screen and it feels good
with its advanced controls a mimic a
gaming console but is anyone going to
buy it time is the real commodity that
everyone is trading in I've got 15
minutes am I just going to pull my phone
out and play a game or am I going to
reach into my backpack and grab my
playstation because it won't fit in your
pocket that's the inherent problem with
the Vita its size and singular function
you don't need it for anything else it
is really just the games device what a
lot of people are coming back to is well
why my phone does it and then there's a
cost the base model is 249 dollars plus
a 100-dollar memory stick plus forty
dollar games at a time where we're all
playing jetpack joyride for 99 cents or
a bunch of games for free or you know we
bulk at paying 699 for a downloadable
game on our iPhone suddenly a forty
dollar handheld game seems a bit like
good recently gamespot conducted a
survey with 2,500 gamers worldwide and
asked them if they would buy the Vita
only twelve percent said yes people in
downtown San Francisco seem to agree i
have a iphone so I'm just wondering why
do I need a PSP because I have iphone
ipad true laptops I'm pretty well geared
up I would rather have just one device
but Sony is betting that people want to
in San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi
