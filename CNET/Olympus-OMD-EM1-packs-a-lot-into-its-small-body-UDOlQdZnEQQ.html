is the Olympus om-d e-m1 the em1 is
great micro four thirds camera it's
gotten an entirely new 16 megapixel
sensor that doesn't have one of those
blurring anti-aliasing filters and it
has a new combo phase detection contrast
autofocus system that's designed to make
shooting with the company's older four
thirds lenses a lot faster that of
course does require a mount adapter the
magnesium alloy body is freezeproof down
to 14 degrees and weather sealed and
though the buttons feel a bit mushy the
camera overall feels really solid and
substantial with a grip big enough to
make using a mid-sized four thirds lens
pretty comfortable I also really like
the new 12 to 40 millimeter f28 lens
that Olympus made to pair with this
camera and it's the first of its pro
line of lenses and it has great build
quality and great image quality and a
manual focus cuff that you slide to
enable or disable manual focus and a
custom settings button the body design
has some nice touches like the toggling
locking mechanism on the mode dial that
you don't have to hold down while you
twist simultaneously and the novel
interface for fast color and white
balance adjustments and effects which
the company dubs color creator there are
tons of useful features including Wi-Fi
time lapse in auto HDR along with
Olympus's nice set of in camera effects
and filters both the EVF and the tilting
touch screen LCD are bright and
contrasting and very good the camera
could use a second card slot though
there are a gazillion ways to program
the controls many of which can also take
context-sensitive settings based on this
lever in fact there are so many ways to
program the body it's hard to keep track
if you're not using it constantly well
the image quality is excellent Olympus
earns my double facepalm award for its
default settings out of the box fine jpg
is your best option and those are pretty
disappointing but there's a setting
hidden in the custom menus to enable a
super fine jpg given the price of this
camera that should be the default and
it's ridiculous that it's not even
visible
performance is excellent as well then I
didn't get to test it with this best
quality JPEG but it's fast on Raw so it
should be comparable the autofocus
system operates quickly and generally
pretty decisively and though using the
slow for thirds lenses hold it back a
little it's still fast enough for most
needs you can even burst it about 40
shots with full auto focus at 6.5 frames
per second the one disappointment is
battery life which is bane of
interchangeable lens cameras thanks to
power sucking lcds etfs and AF systems
well it's really a great counter for the
money with excellent raw photo quality
host of useful features and speedy
performance are you ended up docking the
om-d e-m1 a point in design for its
needlessly complicated configuration
options and it's poor choices for
defaults I'm Lord Gerin and this is the
om-d e-m1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
