Electronics Show it screens screens and
more screens CES 2013 is all about tvs
we're seeing more bigger and expensive
TVs than in years past but these
televisions aren't just impressing with
brawn and beauty they're stuffed with
cutting-edge technology like 4k or ultra
high-def and OLED and are finally ready
to take home well 4k is actually
inevitable so it's four times the number
of pixels on a standard TV which is
about 1080p so the idea is that you have
a lot sharper picture OLED is organic
light-emitting diode and it's kind of a
very thin technology and it really
improves upon the current picture
quality of plasma and LCD every major
television manufacturer at CES was
showing off its offerings into this new
entertainment frontier for customers
that are looking for the best in color
and black levels I'll let it's really
that product to go for for somebody
that's looking for the highest
resolution at eight million pixels uht
is definitely going to be that product
here at Samsung they're not yet
releasing the prices for these 85-inch
UHD TVs but we hear that they're
starting at $25,000 not quite sure how
many of them are going to make it into
our living rooms just yet but perhaps
smaller 55 and 65-inch models will when
different manufacturers release them for
a pretty penny later this year in Las
Vegas I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS
