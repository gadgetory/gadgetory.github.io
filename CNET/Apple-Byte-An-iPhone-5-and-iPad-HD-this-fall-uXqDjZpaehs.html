the Apple buy for all the good and bad
stuff inside the world of Apple
now it's another plate full of iPhone
rumors or news to feast on this week and
we start off with the Wall Street
Journal who's reporting that Apple is
preparing a thinner and lighter iPhone
with an 8 megapixel camera sensor for a
launch in the third quarter of this year
the new info might squash the debate
between the next iPhone having the same
form factor or not depending on who you
believe but according to the journal
Apple has a goal to produce 25 million
units by the end of the year the new
iPhone was planned for summer launch but
it wasn't ready in time and their
sources say it still could be delayed if
hon high-precision the company that
assembles the iPhone can't improve their
production rate now another nugget in
the article also says Apple has been
experimenting with a new charging method
for their revamp of the iPhone in 2012
Apple has already filed patents for
wireless charging and syncing to I
devices when it makes contact with the
docking stand it's currently being used
with the HP TouchPad and pre phones so
it's a realistic possibility but let's
not ignore the iPad 2 when it comes to
the rumor train this is my next blog
says that the iPhone isn't the only new
kid on the block this fall
yeah I knew that guys all right a new
member of the iPad family called the
iPad HD will sport a double resolution
screen aimed at the pro market for video
and photo production the report says it
is not the iPad 3 but in addition to the
current product line now this is almost
hard to believe there's really no need
for Apple to do this right now but we'll
see how this rumor shakes out now story
is based on actual facts a patent
application by the big a the deals like
heated wireless stylus concept for the
iPad and iPhone Steve Jobs hasn't been
the biggest fan in the past we're gonna
use a stylus No
who wants a stylus you have to get them
and put them away and you'll lose him
yeah but this concept would allow the
heated stylus more precise interaction
to enter data or perform actions without
actually touching the device or
specialized paper all right let's take a
quick break with a how-to for
controlling your PC with what else the
iPad even though your iPad lets you you
tons of great stuff when you're out and
about there are plenty of reasons why
you might want to access your home
computer instead I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com with an easy way to control any
computer with your iPad
first of all if your mom is always
asking you for tech support it might
just be easier to take control of her
computer instead to do this I'm going to
use a free program called TeamViewer any
computer you want to control needs to
have this program installed and it's
compatible with mac and pc go to
TeamViewer comm and download the program
on your computer when you open it you'll
see an ID and password we'll come back
to that in a second now go to your iPad
and get the free app from the App Store
launch it and enter the ID and password
from your computer hit connect and watch
the magic happen you'll see a helpful
screen with gesture tips for instance
use one finger as your mouse pointer
drive with two fingers to scroll pinch
to zoom and double tap and drag to move
Windows so now you can show your mom or
a friend how to change a setting or
maybe even send yourself a file from
your computer but what if you want to
actually stream media from your computer
to your iPad remotely instead of taking
up space on your iPad by storing movies
on it you can stream from your desktop
computer with air video go to end
Metacom then downloads and grab the air
video server for mac or pc open it and
you'll see a window where you can add
folders you want to share with your iPad
it's pretty neat because you can even
share iTunes playlists right here now go
to the remote tab and check enable
access from internet also make sure
automatically map port is checked make
note of the pin and we'll be using it in
a sec next head over to settings and
check require password make sure you set
a strong one unless you want to give
hacker as a free pass to your computer
finally make sure the server is turned
on now head over to your iPad and
download the air video app which is
actually compatible with all iOS devices
hit the plus button and select enter
server pin enter that pin you noted from
the remote tab and you'll be given
instant access to videos on your
computer just remember that your remote
computers will need to stay on and
connected to the internet for this to
work and that if your iPad isn't
connected to Wi-Fi while doing this
you're definitely hogging your data
usage all right thanks miss Sharon
and some cool news for blu-ray fans it's
still not coming as a built order option
on your Mac but a company called matte
go has released the first universal
blu-ray software for the Mac and PC now
you'll need an external blu-ray drive
and you can find one cheap for around 75
bucks on Amazon the software is free for
the first three months and 39.95 to
purchase but it's a legit solution for
watching blu-ray on your Mac now the
battle with iTunes for digital music
continues Spotify the music subscription
service made it official they're coming
to the u.s. to take on iTunes the Europe
based service offers cloud-based
streaming of more than 8 million songs
for free with AD support and Spotify
gave no official date except for the
date of soon and Amazon is making sure
there'll be a serious player as well by
offering unlimited storage for mp3 and
AAC music files for people who upgrade
their Cloud Drive service to 20 gigs of
storage it costs $20 per year you can
access your music anywhere through a Mac
or PC Android device and it's also iPad
compatible alright let's check out some
quick bytes jailbreaking fans the
jailbreak me comm 3.0 browser-based
jailbreak is available for iOS 4.3.3
users and it also works on the iPad 2
Apple is already working on patching
that hole so you guys better get on this
while you can and Skype 5.2 for the Mac
is out and you can upgrade to a premium
account that's about 50 bucks for the
group video chat feature it also allows
you to share screen and documents to
multiple people now unfortunately the
standalone app doesn't appear to be
compatible with the recent Facebook
Skype announcement and only the Windows
version supports it at the moment and in
kick-ass gadgets that we have to have
check out this aluminum keyboard case
for the iPad 2 from our good friends at
Mi C gadget they're also the creators of
the Steve Jobs statue it's $50 and the
slickest keyboard case we've seen so far
so you want to check it out and finally
we leave you with the story of a 15 year
old boy named Edward Saakashvili son of
the Georgian president but get this he
set the Guinness world record for
fastest typing on the iPad he typed out
the alphabet using the software keyboard
in just 5.26 seconds and beat the
previous record holder by over a second
who really cares about that kid I was
breaking World Records on my own last
weekend so make sure you study single
API provides me route count
I'm going talk a little talking like you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
