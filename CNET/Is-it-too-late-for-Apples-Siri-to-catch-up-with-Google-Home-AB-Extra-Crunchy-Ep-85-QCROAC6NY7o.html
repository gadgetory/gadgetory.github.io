Interactive building in San Francisco
California it's the Apple byte extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr. Brian
Tom oh oh we're innocent we're in the
building we're in the building Bay he's
in the building yeah
Steven Beechum's in the building yeah
we're here you could tell it's it's like
getting the band back together you know
someone's been away from the office a
little bit it has to come back once in a
while so welcome to the show everybody
it's Apple white extra crunchy episode
85 here again this is all about you all
we had tons of calls we loved it we
appreciate them number is 1-866-376-8255
enlike don't be in this little hole
don't be in this like little tunnel
vision right there so let me just jump
into this at least when we talk about
some
Apple News are leading this week a
report out of Bloomberg says Apple is
planning to announce new MacBooks
MacBook Pros and possibly a MacBook Air
at WWDC and I think the MacBook Air is a
little surprised there but here's what
the thinking of is the MacBook Pro will
get the faster cabie Lake processors
that's what we've kind of we were hoping
for yes but it will be coming at least
this year this is according to Bloomberg
again we'll expect to see that also
they're working on a new version of the
12-inch MacBook that's the super sleek
they're super ultra thin laptop and then
with a faster intel chip but they didn't
identify the Intel chip for that model
yet and then in addition that Apple is
considering updating the aging right we
know the 13-inch MacBook Air which was
kind of like the super thin MacBook
before that happened right it was a kind
of concept ultra-thin laptop that they
put it in a manila envelope to kind of
tout look at how thin this is that was
honestly like one of the coolest things
because at the time yeah they just
weren't that many thin laptops right
Steve Jobs did it on stage the debate is
that it would come with a new processor
because sales of Apple's cheapest
MacBook which is the air right now still
remain surprisingly strong so that's why
there that's why they're considering
doing that in addition look the Mac
lineup generates about 11 percent of
apples revenue now in the scheme of
things that's not that big right yes I'm
small it sounds small but you can't just
a alienate 10% of your user base we know
that Mac users in general have been
frustrated with apples what Apple has
been doing with the Mac so not only do
they need to address the MacBook Pro
category and give us the yearly refresh
that people typically expect but also
right we're still waiting for a Mac Pro
update we're still waiting for iMac
updates Lord knows we're gonna see a Mac
Mini update yeah we don't know what
people call them for that because Mac
minis are cool a lot of people are using
that too so at least we have indication
that the Mac books we'll get an update
that's a good thing um it comes into
port in time to Microsoft just released
their surf
laptop which is kind of like you know
running a Windows 10 s kind of a more I
don't want to call it a skinnier version
but a more streamlined version and the
surface laptop has a lot of buzz around
it still you don't see people jumping
over completely to switching but this is
just kind of like keeping up with the
Joneses keeping your product line
updated and there's plenty of people
that pretty much ask me every week
should I buy blank product or wait and
clearly you gotta wait so just hang out
WWDC is opening on June the 7th so we'll
see it then June 7th that's that way
that's coming up like two weeks which
means I'll be back here in two weeks bro
yeah yeah a live show live we do alive
so there you go that's that's what the
latest is shakin bacon with the MacBooks
now another story this one comes out of
Boyd genus report they're citing a
source close to Apple that claims that
then 7.9 inch iPad Mini it's currently
in its fourth generations the iPad Mini
for the report says they are planning to
phase out that product matter product
line
the iPad Mini there is no actual
timeline as to when the iPad Mini will
be discontinued but it will remain on
sale for a period of time but the
writing's on the wall we've seen how the
numbers of the iPad Mini there's two
there's two things that are hitting it
the large screen iPhones have kind of
cannibalized some of those sales in
addition to the fact that we know this
we say at every show now tablet sales
continue to decline definitely so now's
the time to buy an iPad Mini Man or at
least wait a couple months when they
like really knocked the price yeah I
mean it's the iPad Mini is a more than
cable iPad for your kids you know if
you're some rich person that's like oh
yeah I want to get iPads for my infant
sons and daughters and I know there's
people listening right that are like oh
I'd like to get an iPad movie for my
two-year-old kid get a really desert in
case for they've been a really good kid
they deserve that this is not a terrible
to Z kid this this guy deserves an iPad
Mini so that it's not surprising to me
it's one of those things where there
have been reports that part of the
reason that iPad sales have dropped is
because they haven't released a new iPad
Mini well but I don't think so
no I don't think so at all I think
that's someone that's faking use bro
that's making you totally fake news so
um just just expect that the iPad Mini
we might have to do a rest in peace
segments eventually for it oh yeah like
we can pour some out we can do a whole
ceremony man pour some out all right
sorry I just coughed directly in your
ears everybody uh in another story this
is a little survey according to Morgan
Stanley 92% of iPhone owners because we
know that everyone is just waiting
waiting for an iPhone but according to
the study for Morgan Stanley 92% of
iPhone owners are somewhat likely or
extremely likely to upgrade their
smartphone in the next 12 months hmm to
another iPhone I believe that I believe
that here here's father it's also
interesting right because we see oh do
people have iPhone fatigue the clear
answers no it's always ecosystem tied
Apple's loyalty rate jumped up compared
to last year which was at 86% according
to study that the survey pulled 1000
smartphone owners aged 18 and above that
own iPhones so is 86 percent last year
and it's 92 percent for this coming year
that's crazy how it's going up in you
know in the wake of all this bad apple
news the last few years of like people
being upset with Apple and like where's
the innovations they had like jabbers
they have you know and it's still their
loyalty is going up it is how that's
weird can't stop won't stop can't stop
won't stop
it's pretty amazing man the other thing
that you know I think a lot of people
when I think the headphone jack yeah
that's probably one of the biggest
things that people still can't get over
like I can't get over it still yes I'm
I've run into the problem ill often it
was just like you're like what the hell
so the here's the thing about the new
iPhone and if this is again most likely
for the iPhone 8 right this 5.8 inch
OLED super glass screen blah blah blah
we know all these details that phone is
expect to get wireless charging now I'm
not saying that I if it does have
wireless charging
they better not make me buy another
wireless charging pad which they
probably will they won't throw there but
if you want to be super like Kay the
headphone jack is kind of coming back
you can if you want to twist this the
way that you want twisted if the phone
has wireless charging that means that
lightning port is going to be available
and that means you can plug your
headphones into the Lightning port there
you go
I'm just saying I'm just saying now
while is charging though at least up to
this point doesn't charge nearly as fast
as just plugging it directly into the
cable yeah let alone like you have like
USB charging 3.0 charging with the iPad
which just charges that thing to half
times faster than just a regular USB
cable because of the voltage it supports
so again I'm not saying it has a
headphone jack but I'm saying it kind of
does yeah the new one will yeah if you
if you charge a lot wirelessly because
right now you still can't technically
charge it while using a headphone jack
at the same time if you're that type of
person that then you have to like listen
to your phone on your nightstand where
your charger lives where your wireless
charger lives yes you know you're still
you're still kind of stuck yeah that
place you are stuck here's a cool story
coming out from another report from boy
genius this also kind of answers a
question that one of our sometimes we
answer questions within the show that's
why we don't actually play your
voicemails as well so one of our
listeners of Apple byte nation called in
and said like I think that Apple could
do something cool like are they going to
do smart you know smart watchbands and
we've seen at least first of all
indications that the Apple watch was
capable of doing this underneath kind of
underneath it you know where it connects
to one of the wristbands there's an
actual a port in there that can be used
to transfer data
it's that has been revealed but again we
don't use it as a consumer yet so what's
going to happen according to this report
is that Apple is said to be working on
implementing new glucose monitoring
features and interchangeable SmartWatch
bands that could add health
functionality to the Apple watch
including glucose monitoring and other
types of smart bands we've we've heard
these rumors a lot but boy genes report
is now putting the
had in there same like it is going to
happen according to their sources now we
also know that Apple is going full
throttle with their biomedical engineers
and their team they hired something
around more than 200 PhDs in the health
field last year
with an aim and a focus of innovating in
the health space right the Apple watch
is their gateway into that we talked
also about was it last last week where
we talked about how a study by
University of California San Francisco
found that it was able to detect like
irregular heartbeats 97% right yeah
those last week that was last week so we
have we have that as this is this is
trunk kind of their play in the health
space other options that boy genes
reports that some of these other bands
could be would be how about a bat band
that extends the battery life a band
with a camera in it like remember that
product that I was all hyped up about
yeah yeah if we got it was called it was
actually called camera but CMR AI amaura
yeah yeah and they were touting oh it's
video chatting with your you know with
your watch but then it really was just
video messages and they actually used
Clips former Applewhite show to like
promote the product oh yeah usually were
doing some urschel's for them yeah they
basically turn it into a commercial but
then I'm like I cancel my order because
it only does video messaging it doesn't
you can't use me I'm I said oh no and
that's honestly it sounds some people I
think it's a gimmicky that's what I want
that's what I think that's what
everybody would just make it just fun
quirky cool yeah like those are one of
those things that I would love to have
an addition right better battery life
blah blah blah but that's just one of
those things I just want to have a Dick
Tracy watch man you too man that's that
I'm sorry if that sounds stupid I just
want a Dick Tracy watch maybe they're
speaking to me with that so it's not
clear if these new Smart Watch bands
that boy genius report is reporting will
be available for the third generation
watch which is expected to come out
sometime you know in the fall of 2017
which they normally do we don't know
that yet we expect you know kind of some
of the minor updates when you talk about
you know battery life and performance
you know maybe a tweak and I don't think
they're still going to change
they shouldn't change the form fact
I don't know maybe they'll surprise us
but we haven't really heard too much
around the Apple watch at least from
leaks from a manufacturing standpoint
and I in a weird way now these days I
kind of like it when we don't hear as
much you think so I actually like it
because they're talking about disrupting
the health medical organization in
America and I'm all for that because
it's clearly broken right because he
heard about on the news all the time are
you gonna talk about well you know who
again no are you talking I know yeah I'm
just saying like if they could have
apples trying to disrupt health health
care in our country that's a good thing
yeah yeah it is it is a good thing so
we'll see we'll see how that plays out
this is a really cool article actually
no before they before we go to this we
need a I forgot that we need to read

we can't we can just do crunch we'll
jump on a phone call with them and
straight that out hey Hachi all right
this is a really cool story that I think
all of you at least that care about
Apple in some way shape or form have got
to seek out this is a story in depth
behind the scenes of Apple's new campus
from Wired magazine I'm look it only
looks like a spaceship man I tell you I
yeah that is that is this enterprise
like on the ground easy yeah you know I
tell you guys I love my iPad because I
read comics but I love it because I read
magazines on it too when I'm traveling I
do subscribe to Wired digitally like
Empire magazine entertainment week I
mean there's a few of um GQ John I don't
read GQ as like look at the pictures
right but this is a great article it's
called titled one more thing by Steven
Levy and Wired and it really is talking
about the process and gives us a hand in
to kind of really the psychology of this
building and it started as an idea right
it was started in Steve Jobs brain all
the way back to 2004 he and Johnny I've
were like discussing this reimagined
headquarters but it wasn't until they
hired architect Norman Foster in 2009
that these plans began to ramp up so
there's a if you keep scrolling them
these there's this one picture yeah so
for people that are listening just
listen people that are watching you can
watch so they had a bunch of different
concepts and we always see about how the
Apple campus was a circle but what
actually it started as was these kind of
three little pods I would be joined and
it kind of looked more like a like a
what do they call it a propeller so if
you imagine like three circles and then
they're kind of joined with curves you
can even see it in the middle of a
diagram here you listening yet it's
think of it just like a propeller
what's compacity yeah exactly it's it's
that but as time evolved the building
ended up becoming a circle no one
actually takes credit for how it ended
up being a circle but the designers the
architects and people that around Steve
say yeah this this was meant to be a
circle now here's here's what I love
there
this is an excerpt from the piece again
it's a long stretching piece and it
talks about some of the details a really
when we talk about Apple pre Jobs versus
Apple now I can't tell you the attention
to detail and anal retentiveness that
came along and because Steve Jobs was
that way we all benefited okay so
whether you like the guy or not as a
person whether he was easy to work with
the result of what we saw as a consumer
that was just amazing right it's
beautiful right so this is a great this
is a great um little excerpt I'm just
gonna read from this article so they'd
have meetings just to update like how
are things going with the project and
this comes from the wired article the
meetings often lasted for five or six
hours consuming a significant amount of
time in the last two years of jobs is
life he could be scary when he swooped
down on a detail he demanded at one
point baling one of the architect
designers recalls jobs discussed the
walls he had in mind for the offices he
knew exactly what timber he wanted but
not just I like oak or I like maple he
knew it had to be a quarter cut it had
to be cut in the winter
ideally in January to have the least
amount of SAP and sugar content we were
all sitting there architects with gray
hair going holy that's that is
Steve Jobs right there all right that's
the fun that's it right you hear that
iPad a genius I mean that's what
geniuses do right they're totally like
that they they know you know even the
person who is responsible for the
landscape and the trees it was said that
he even said that Steve Jobs had more
had a better eye and better finesse in
some of the other arborists that this
gentleman had worked for when you're
talking about landscaping right like
Steve Jobs was better than his
contemporaries and peers that are in the
actual industry because of the knowledge
I Steve Jobs talked about you could
never replace and a treat like a tree
was like a piece of art to him it's like
an an age weathered twisted tree that
had this look and feel that was unique
to it you couldn't just be like oh just
putting this new sapling tree right
so this whole idea of this you know
headquarters was to build this space
that combined like this feeling of like
being in one with nature but also one
with this futuristic building I think
what's also interesting that the article
touches upon is maybe some of the
underlying is there I don't want to say
controversy but for example this is a
project that is roughly five billion
dollars I bill to build that's in crown
it was it was started what it's been
five years since Steve Jobs was that I
believe he went to Cupertino City
Council and kind of proposed it it was
towards you know towards the end of his
life and whatnot
yeah but some people like when I read
this article and I really encourage you
all to read this article yeah the first
thing that I thought about was like dang
are they paying this much attention to
their products right now I know right
thanks Lee they talk about just some
amazing things this this headquarters
has shaped like a circle or a ring and
they talked about how they had to make
sure the slope of the glass in the inner
circle and outer circles of the UFO were
angled so that when rain hits it it
streams down it and doesn't just get
stuck to them because they're straight
right yeah you can't have any you can't
watch droplet hell no you know is this
is this building ip68 rated or ip67
that's what I want to know they talked
about the air flow that they took
inspiration from formula 1 racers about
how air flow moves sucks in from the
bottom and then the exhaust comes out of
the top just a lot of even I don't know
if you can scroll down Beach but there's
a picture of like a stone wall oh yeah I
was looking at that um outside the gym
yes and so this is another great I loved
this little excerpt from it as well um
talking about the stone gym here I'm
going to read this part the stone X the
stone for the exterior of the fitness
and wellness center was sourced from a
quarry in Kansas and then distressed
like a pair of jeans to make it look
like the stone at jobs his favorite
hotel in Yosemite ah that's pretty cool
this is the detail we're talking about
people okay and then if you scroll up a
little beach there's this circular thing
this is what I also love the cafeteria
workers who want to take the café's
Pizza back to their pods Apple created
and patented a container that lets air
and moisture escape so the crust won't
get soggy that's crazy only at Apple
Park okay like I want to visit this
building quite honestly it sounds
amazing
I think all Pizza Pizza joints should
adopt this design patented a patented
okay how did they exist you know Apple a
lot of money the but it would also made
me laugh about that is I don't people
recall but a long time ago
Johnny Ives basically said he'd love to
design like cups or like like coffee
like coffee makers or like coffee mugs
Oh didn't he do a cedra or something
like that or maybe I'm thinking of the
cup yeah it was things like that he want
to do that and so I'm I got imagine some
of his passion was channeled into making
this pizza crust preap preventative
soggy crust pizza container it's amazing
so again let's check this out there are
so many nuggets inside this article um I
enjoyed reading it and there's what this
one picture towards the bottom that
makes me laugh because it's like it's
like Tim Cook looking like a really
hardcore badass oh you know weird it's
like weird yeah it's like dude he
doesn't look happy at all it's like it's
like the photographer said get me Tim's
get me look tough this is tough Tim oh
it's like playing an ad it's okay don't
you worry about so check it out on the
wired article is called Apple's new
campus an exclusive look inside the
mothership and definitely is definitely
worth checking out for people that are
watching tough Tim Cook he's like he's
he's mugging man he's mugging he's
mean-mugging apples also bring in some
new action to their Apple stores I
really like this because this harkens
back to kind of the original Apple
retail store days which I was a part of
in the øg øg days Apple is bringing
this new program that they've launched
around the world called today at Apple
but what makes this different is in the
past like when the stores first opened
we used to do these classes like on
iTunes and iLife and then there were
these like summer workshops where we
taught kids how to use the apps and
adults and they still kind of have those
mini workshops but they're very
self-contained there in the stores there
at a table but now with this today at
Apple program and there's a video clip
that I put on their beach on the side
you can like go out on the streets and
take a photography session there's stuff
about like drawing or designing with the
iPad there's programming classes this is
all trying to bring people into the
Apple stores every day to learn new
things I think that's really important
to kind of make it kind of have this
like cultural this culture around the
store that you can connect to in these
communities I don't think there's that
they have the unique opportunity to be
able to do this there's gonna be you
know more live contraband every yeah
something everyday like try you know
people want to do things hey how to use
your iPad pro pencil beyond just
scribbling yeah stuff like that so I
think it's really cool I'm a fan of this
I don't I'm gonna I don't know if I'm
gonna go check out a class thing there
was even like we should they're even
classes like I believe there was some
class about like taking you know DSLR
photos just stuff like that right like
and it's totally sure you take a class
and then you say don't make some video
if they let us you know no we don't tell
them who we are oh we secretly we
secretly okay yeah let me Beach and tong
undercover so check it out it's there
today an app at Apple classes around the
world I think it's worth signing up I
got to check out something like that and
then I'm in kind of the last fun story
of the day I love this because it
totally would make sense and would be
like this perfect sounding Jeff Goldblum
could have been the voice of Apple could
have been the voice of Apple he blew it
now this is what happened in a recent
interview on The Today Show in Australia
Jeff Goldblum was being interviewed and
he kind of brought this up and it was
kind of set in passing but he says Steve
Jobs called me up a few decades ago to
be the voice of Apple that was early on
and I did not know it was Steve Jobs
so so you know fine it wasn't meant to
be but could you imagine like couldn't
you hear Jeff Goldblum's voice as your
Siri Oh totally guys your
assistant yeah we like so pleasant and
so smooth I'm like man that would be
awesome that would be awesome he so did
he ever talk to Steve Jobs or no they he
didn't know he said he didn't even know
it was Steve Jobs that called him man
that's crazy right like huh so you know
he probably just thought it was someone
from Apple and I was like and who knows
he may not may or may not do this is two
decades ago but it it's kind of funny
how it all plays out instead now you can
find Jeff Goldblum in TV commercials for
men you log a local food ordering at
he's also gonna be in a new movie I
figure which movie it is uh he's gonna
be a lot is he gonna be in the new
dinosaur movie right well he's coming
back for Jurassic world world - he's
gonna be uh the Grand Master in Thor
Ragnarok who is the collectors brother
in the comics and he's gonna play a role
in that movie let's hear his voice for
saying a tap to order delivery because
at this moment silence is old silence
this Goldblum I'm hungry
could about that could have been my Siri
Siri that would have been gone oh well
alright do you want to jump the phone
calls man yeah let's do some okay let's
get smells thank you all for calling yes
yes get some good calls today here we go
captain you're gonna go pick up a moon
turn this off no you're still listen to
Jeff called emojis he's stuck on loop in
my world here we go hey this is roadie
from Tampa I just had a quick question
on what you guys may think about the new
Apple Siri echo kind of speaker I was
wondering if by them canceling the
airport Express and time capsules if
they have an idea of maybe making that
Smart Hub this series speaker also being
a Wi-Fi router so maybe they're trying
to do two devices in one where they can
have the Siri speaker be a hub for your
home but also control your devices
because it's already a router and access
point as well anyways love the show let
me know what you guys think
thanks love this idea I'm 100 for it I
you know I don't we don't know what's
going to happen with the whole router
situation right we we've heard all those
reports that they are going to
discontinue it there were
ports earlier that Apple Siri like
speaker might be part of a new Apple TV
you know I think whether it's an Apple
tea it's whether to integrate it into an
Apple TV or whether it's integrated into
a Wi-Fi router we even know that there
are reports that Google might be working
on a future product that is integrated
with their white Google Wi-Fi as well so
it makes sense just because of where you
could locate these things in a central
spot with your voice we'll see if it
happens but I love the idea that
thinking is right on the money so I know
I don't think this would happen actually
because it would be a for cost a fortune
right a fortune yeah I mean it'd be a
speaker and a router so Apple would
definitely price it high and then and
rich people would buy and rich rich
people would buy it but it would it
wouldn't compete with Alexa and Google
home which are a lot cheaper like I got
my echo for like 30 bucks or something
like if you got a dot it was like 50
yeah sorry yeah but I got like a deal I
got I got some deals Oh like glitchy so
they wouldn't compete right away you
know I feel like people were gonna
easily go for the cheaper thing that's
more fleshed out at this point then
buying something really expensive from
Apple that is two things in one
I don't know that's that's I think well
I think that you're right and I also
think that the Apple community should
never be underestimated true I mean
$0.99 approval you buy an Apple product
because it's an Apple product I think
there's a lot of people out there
whether you want to call them sheeples
or not that don't even think other tech
companies really exist that's right and
still will but like so when Apple says
here's our series here's our series
speaker they're gonna be like oh I kind
of heard about this virtual assistant
like I'm gonna give it a try Wow Wow
Apple you really did it and it's like
I'm sorry but if you saw we didn't even
talk about it but if you saw what Google
Google's assistant did and what it is
doing and how it integrates with not
only how smart it is but how it can use
your TV as a screen kind of like what
Phil Schiller was alluding to a
sometimes you need a screen yeah um
Google's assistant is available on iOS
they just made available as an app which
is not going to be integrated directly
in your phone so it won't really exact
we behaved the same but I encourage
people to download the free Google
assistant app to understand how much
better the AI on that is compared to
Siri I went looking for that last night
and I couldn't find it and now in the
Apple Store
it sits on the Apple Store I have a
direct link also on my I tweeted it out
but I'll send it to you it's just you've
got to try it out you'll see things that
it can do that it can't do but you'll
ultimately you'll be like wow this is
just smarter than Siri yeah right
it has like for example even something
as stupid is if you ask Siri for
directions she's gonna throw you into
Apple maps right if you ask the Google
assistant for directions it's gonna
throw you into Google Maps yay that's
what I want like that to me is a big
deal that is a big deal so um check it
out the tech and Google's assistant just
got significantly crazier and better
especially with their Google lense
platform that will blow your mind
cool I can almost say about that next
call Brian Beach Bob call from Waikiki
thanks so much for what you do with the
Apple bites and yak pedal bike extra
crunchy I am scooping what you're
digging loved it for a long time Brian
you're on the Markman QC 35 boughs best
headset out there and love watching
reading comics on my iPad pro however I
think you missed the mark on the iPod
ear pods these things are great big
question for you though is are they
going to be included with the iPhone 8
or are we going back to the wires they
did remove the headset jack is it
because the next generation is going to
be only pods or is there going to be an
option for it thanks for all you do guys
you guys are awesome out
Aloha ba Shaka Bob not Shaka brah Shaka
Bob hey uh I mean I'll never count them
out of making it an option but there's
no way they're gonna bundle them in
there because they cost too much money
they want to make that money well there
was there's a story that the next iPhone
is gonna cost like $1,000 maybe they're
just building that price into the phone
you know what I mean so it's kind of you
know I'm saying no I know what you're
saying oh that's possibility scooping
I'm scooping
why your nation scooped up with a stupid
what you diggin Bob also look Bob for
the record I say that the air pots are
very very good I just don't think
they're great and I think second
generation they have a chance to be
great but they're good they don't work
with Skype calls we yesterday we did
Google i/o Scott Stein Skyped in from oh
they don't work with skyping don't work
with Skype calls he Skyped in from
Google i/o and we we did a test and the
air pods
we're not working properly so we went
with wired but they can get better from
a functionality stamp I'm sure like an
update or something we'll fix them but
yeah it's weird they I will say though
when I say never underestimate the power
of Apple I'm telling you right now if
any other company made those ear pods
the way they looked people would have
been like totally grossed out because
they you know they look like q-tips or
whatever but because it has Apple it's
like there's almost dislike oh yeah
where those and then when you wear them
you actually forget what they look like
yeah you don't remember what they look
like
I see people wearing them just all the
time like they don't even take them out
it's just part of their ears now yeah we
don't I don't talk about alright that's
cool thanks for calling Bob check out
Bob all right also guys George from
Seattle here hey you know I've been
interested in buying air pods since they
came out but I was going to wait for the
second generation because
second-generation products seem to be so
much better than first gen why Apple and
I was looking forward to some of the
touch sensitive controls and Brian puts
them about in the first generation I was
hoping for a different color and and I
was thinking was going to be a year
until the second generation came out but
now that Apple has taken so long so you
get the production ramped up for the
first iteration I'm wondering when is
the second generation going to come out
so anyway I wanted your thoughts on that
and also I wonder what do you think it's
facing and so was that the one yeah yeah
that's fine I mean they're they're not
gonna they're not gonna have them
they're not gonna have anyone in another
year they don't have enough so you know
when you ask oh what's taking them so
long
clearly whatever their suppliers
whatever components that they're working
with maybe it's honestly the w1 chip
that they can't manufacture enough
because it is a new chip for a new
product that hasn't been
in any of their products before we also
know the w1 chip is in some beats
product so you're also like spreading
that inventory across multiple product
lines that could be part of it but
they're waiting for iPad air pods is
still six weeks there's still a six-week
wait from the time you order them online
so that's what the demand is obviously
exceeding the supply I think that they
could get away with having these air
pods for literally another year I think
they could leave these out for two years
before they do anything to it and if
that means that they're gonna make a big
improvement to them then that's fine
like I said they're really really really
good I just don't think they're great
great like when I call something great
it's basically like the best in the
industry and it doesn't have many flaws
yeah I mean I feel like they will try to
get him out sooner I mean I'm probably
totally wrong but you know Tim could
call them a what do you call him a
cultural phenomenon you know yeah he
called him that so why wouldn't they try
to rush to get in the second gen pair
out you know so boba is the cultural
only the barrier what's boba I don't
even know the tapioca balls with the
drink with the big straw your Sona your
your anti bubble you don't like you
don't like putting balls I don't like
any like liquid that has a ball in it I
don't know i don't like chewy balls in
your mouth oh hell you don't like chewy
balls huh okay just want to make that
clear I'll eat a meatball
give me a meatball sub yes all right
thanks Karl all right hey guys love a
show mat here in Wilmington Ohio we've
gone about the Apple Alexa type speaker
thing as someone who's in the ecosystem
who also owns an echo I I love my echo
but I think where Apple can really kind
of make this work is to really fold
everything into the ecosystem I just
learned that Alexa can make calls but I
thought immediately how cool would be is
if the Apple product could integrate
iMessage could work with iCal which
Alexa doesn't really do very well so I
think there's if they really want to
kind of jump into this as the third
kind of thing in the market I think they
could do a good job to really fold in
all of the things in the Apple ecosystem
and get some potential customers that
way so well the show Thanks have a good
day
great call hundred percent agree it just
to me look the ecosystem is never
underestimate the power of the Apple
ecosystem and its users I think in order
for them to to make Apple users feel
good about something like this they need
I want Siri needs to improve
significantly it just comes down to that
in the arms race of who's the best
virtual assistant to me they're
somewhere around third or fourth place
you have Amazon you have definitely
learned you have court on court court on
is just not used as much but I argue
that Cortana actually is a little
smarter than Siri yeah Cortana is cool I
mean you know just ask it to like pull
up an app on your computer and it
happens it works a lot of ways saying
the same as Siri but it is a lot smarter
yeah and you know on our video show it's
all about the ecosystem I say that all
the time I said that with the serious
beaker so my friend you are right on the
money and we'll just we'll see what they
do there are rumblings that we might see
the series speaker at WWDC in addition
to a new 10.5 inch iPad those stories
have also been thrown out so uh let's
have to wait and see but uh we're in the
midst of the AI wars oh this is fun well
you know what that's it that's a great
point you make and I think that whenever
there was a big kind of technological
jump or let's say revolution it had to
do with like you know IO so what I mean
by that is like we used to have a
command line then you went to a mouse
interface right a point-and-click mouse
then you had like touchscreen
touchscreen touchscreen change the game
and that was it and look the key the
keyboard and mouse thing was an Apple
thing you know you'll find it was Xerox
before Apple but the mouse was
popularized popular popularized for the
mainstream consumer by Apple so was
multi-touch well now the new interface
is voice and it's not something that's
going to just take over in in a year
that you can tell a lot of these people
that are doing voice assistance they're
evolving over time but to be the winner
for this next kind of great race you've
got to be
got to be the winner in voice and I
think right now Google is on top of that
and Apple who had the mouse Apple who
had the multi-touch if they're not ahead
of the game maybe the power of their
ecosystem can help drive that through
but it's no longer the technology that
is the best that's pushing them forward
it's the fact that they have a large
ecosystem which is kind of a little
different so they still have to work it
they still have to make it great but
right now they're trailing from the
voice assistant in this from the
standpoint of the wars and if you look
at the interoperability of how Google's
assistant works not only with the home
product but then talks your TV can talk
your phone I talk to other speakers like
that's they're trying to build like what
the star journalism yeah you're trying
to try to build computer right exact
that's what they're doing Apple doesn't
even have a product out there yet no so
and then and they're really behind and
you know Google's expertise is all this
data and neural networks machine
learning and that's what AI is all about
that's why it's like kind of hard for me
to see Apple make a big jump but they
can do some great things with the
ecosystem you know the Google lens thing
that they talked about was something
I've been wanting a long time and that's
a big deal you know like I always look
for an app like I know they used plants
as an example right and I've looked for
an app to identify plants and there's
nothing like that anywhere and then
Google like has one you know so that's a
big deal you know yes just that alone
there google lens using your camera and
being able to because of their image
recognition
um again neural networks and machine
learning platform can Spotify it's not
spot if I can spot specific types of
flowers using the GPS on your phone and
then using your camera it knows where
you are and then when it sees certain
buildings it knows oh it's this business
let me show you some ratings for it like
that's crazy not as crazy like and it's
working it's working it's not like oh
this is five years like this is coming
like this summer yeah so just be ready
just be ready like hey I is it's scary
it's also very scary like we're seeing
some amazing stuff but it's kind of
scary like how much do you need to know
to show us that stuff well what's Steve
Steven Hawkings saying like a eyes gonna
end and humanity you know like you
straight up saying that
we gotta get off this planet in a
hundred years he said right he said that
we're like headed we're on a speeding
car headed towards that as fast as we
can right now you know that's great I
mean I know I won't be alive so I'm kind
of cool with that
honestly I'm like I'm cool with that no
my kids my kids are three and five years
old and they're talking to robots on a
regular basis all the time you know like
they tell us they the favorite thing to
ask is Alexa play everything is awesome
that's their favorite thing you know or
turn off the lights but I mean they're
that young and they've already know how
to use an iPad touch screen they know
how to interface with computers they
know understand uploading downloading
and they're talking to robots it's
happening yeah you know so totally have
any I'm sending in the Space Camp as I
said if it is that affordable well you
know I we're gonna have to get off this
planet I want my kids to be ready man
seriously all right so I think that's
gonna do for this right we don't have
any more calls that's it yeah awesome
awesome
