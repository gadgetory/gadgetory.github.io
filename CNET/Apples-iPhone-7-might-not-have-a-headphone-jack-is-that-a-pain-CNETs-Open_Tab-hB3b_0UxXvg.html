Apple not having the best WWDC
conference and that leads into apple's
iphone 7 which is coming probably
September right that's safe to say some
rumors are starting to really pick up
some some momentum including the one
that boggles my freaking mind the notion
that they will somehow take out the
headphone jack is that is that the
reality we're headed I mean Motorola's
already done with one of their right but
motor you sure okay um I mean if if
we're going along the ways of trying to
like finally make it water resistance
and just wrote a resistant and try to
minimize ways for liquid to get in there
I'm all for it I currently use bluetooth
headphones all the time anyway siren
right but this but let's all specially
but we have the I'm saying we have the
headphone expert here with us well the
noise is the the dongles that's what's
annoying there's gonna probably be like
a 30-dollar lightning to 3.5 millimeter
dongle life definitely with like fifty
dollars for the lightning to hdmi right
Justin on a scale of garbage to crap
what is Bluetooth audio sound like a
horrible it's pretty bad it's like the
hot garbage hot steaming trash well I
mean but awful don't care about the
audio quality because i think the
convenience of having wireless it's
gonna sort of Trump that well but I
agree with you the dongle is gonna be a
huge hassle really cuz you're not guilty
but here but here's the measuring stick
that a lot of people fail understand is
like a lot of people they drop X amount
of hundreds of dollars on their iPhone
or their Samsung device and some of them
come with these crappy headphones and
begin with the Apple earbuds aren't that
bad but you have bluetooth headphones
that are Kabul to the sound that you get
from those so people don't really have
the measuring stick or they're not as
fortunate is let's say doesn't that
who's put on a pair of like $1,500
headphones like wow these blow my mind
um so with that said and also that with
the marketing campaign behind beats and
now Apple owning beats and and people
seem to be more infatuated with the
flavor of their headphones rather than
the south although that beats brand not
exactly
I got any forefront dije my favorite my
favorite over your headphones of the
parrot Zeke's I love those things hands
down but I do use the power beat
wireless tues because they have the
little clips that go around by ear and I
ride my bicycle a lot and you know
people perspire and ones it just go on
your ear constantly popping out right ok
guys we have some comments on my jump in
for you guys on this subject sure we
have a so we've Neal says that he'd
prefer to have more battery over having
a headphone socket earlier in the chat
jeff says if people don't like the idea
of not having a headphone sophocleous
are simple to not buy one yeah I mean
have that's fine well the thing is like
wait so the the first comment was about
Moorhead more batter right which you
saved that's the thing you have to
really look at us all the benefits
you're gonna get you know yeah it's
gonna be a hassle to have the dongle for
sure Kuwait you're gonna have to move
over which people have done before with
Apple products in the past with firewire
and even jumping over to the lightning
cable from the 30-pin connector or
whatever so with the Lightning jack it's
going to have a lot more cooler features
i think that will make people forget
about the inconvenience of not having a
jack any more like battery life like
having you know but health kid and
things like that integrated into your
headphones now which would be cool noise
cancelling headphones right now even if
you have wireless ones they always have
that big battery package yeah but the
Lightning jack obviously carries power
with it tues that you're going to have
much smaller headphones that can do more
and I think those things will hopefully
make people forget about that they still
need to make good right like they still
have to take care of the people yeah who
do have those five hundred dollar pair
of headphones that want that wired
connection i'm sure they'll sell
adapters or wherever they got to do to
make it work but like you can't just
leave those people behind and be like f
you go figure it out yeah i mean come on
like it right i guess some audio files
would be happy about switching over to a
lightning cable because you could have a
you know a digital audio converter sure
side of your headphones yeah and not
have to carry around like a big separate
power pack right word which is it's
pretty nice well I member alegre p in
the earlier in the earlier days of
bluetooth headphones blue and australian
hit phone manufacturer yeah they
actually had bluetooth headphones that
came with a dongle that you can actually
plug your wire headphone in
they would transmit the right I remember
that so I mean if they could if they
could find a way that maybe trim
something like that down I mean you're
like you know we have a short that's the
thing like apple hates thing dongles
like they don't mean they didn't they
don't I have I have to say I just
recently got the Apple pencil why I
don't know and that thing nothing that
thing's atrocious how do we have it yeah
you buy is very nice first of all this
sure that's day inaccurate good right
let's just set the man out here dan
ackerman your ups Oliver yeah that perk
if this was seventy bucks I would buy
this Oh having me you pay seventy
dollars is a cool speaker talking afford
a good at will babe a man what's up
anyway that's where it does belong all
right back but um what we're talking
about a chilly cut me loose dongle
toggles um what doc what you're saying
like Apple I said they hate dongles all
you say oh yeah what's with the pencil I
mean like um there's a little adapter
that you could put on the end of the
pencil so you could plug a lightning
cable directly to it if you're not going
to drive better enjoy sharing but then
once you plug that in then you have the
little cap that comes off for the pencil
it's just a hot mess um there was just
this the system we're testing in house
right now it's under NDA it has like a
little magnetic sleeve that adheres to
the cover and you can slide the pencil
on that which i think is really pretty
cool I think they could have been a
little more creative it doesn't have an
erase this wasn't my son he's a pencil
he flipped it over said no no eraser
sorry okay now Microsoft one-up them on
that um I think they're getting a little
sloppy yeah i mean i'll be over or maybe
they've been getting a little sloppy but
now it's just becoming more and more
noticeable because it's more
consistently right and let's shift back
towards the iphone itself I mean let's
not beat around the bush here this
company in my opinion has not been the
most exciting company in the last two to
three years yeah there is a certain
magic that is I you know were they will
use that word all right there's a
certain kind of like special sauce Xena
sequa Genesis that is not really hanging
around the company and I get it like
they're still obviously of the behemoth
they are but this iphone 7 now they've
talked about the fact or at least
there's been reports that this isn't
going to be that like huge step up this
is going to be another sort of iterative
you know
upgrade that's that's kind of a bummer
yeah people are very frustrated because
there's it's like do you care about us
you care about your stockholders it's so
I cure mental and it's becoming
inconsistent like the iphone 6s is going
on a year we've seen the ipad pro 9.7
come out after that it does not have 3d
touch on the fewer device that every
detach the few devices developer is
going to develop apps for so here I have
a phone with a feature that is a and and
and you're starting to see like a lot of
fragmentation with a lot of their stuff
and it's just not as seamless as it once
was hey guys Kenny and our chat is
saying that he says it feels that he's
seen rumors that there could be wired
headphones through lightning I could
detach and become bluetooth sounds like
a convenient solution yeah and to be
fair Motorola is coming out with their
moto z phone which uses USBC headphones
instead of a headphone jack what would
be you think what would be the most
ideal solution what would need exists
now to make the changed away from a
headphone jack much easier for people
what I definitely think that headphones
wired headphones as they exist today are
just painful there's a lot of negative
stuff that we don't really talk about
like the fact that you have to replace
your headphones every few years or even
every year because a lot of times the
jack will run out and have you ever used
up share of headphones all of a sudden
only the left or the right year will
play music which is really annoying
that's a that's a term inside of the ear
bud or something random like that Jack
will lose a connection and you wouldn't
get rid of all that stuff with Bluetooth
and now with glitch with fog coming out
next year you're gonna have faster data
transfers better sound quality hope for
a greater and greater range yet they're
going to quadruple arrangement so if you
have a down to blog we realize you
forgot your phone so it's really a
matter of the Bluetooth technology
coming around and improving over those
fidelity issues and then Apple you know
really educating their customers on how
I mean transition that's gonna be the
biggest hurdle a benefit to having
bluetooth headphones you at least in
cramped areas like New York City San
Fran you know Chicago get mass transit
when you're on the train I see so many
people when people are getting off the
train up their headphones are going with
the guy getting of the train and that's
one handling that's one happy thing
about what my bluetooth headphones i
never have to worry about somebody
snagging the wire right now
running behind them again you think yeah
I don't stealing head no no like 10 know
like when you're on the when you're on
the train it's so crowded people get off
sometimes their bag of bird gets caught
in the wire wow that is a packed train
ya know what you trust me I'm trusting
you very upset 6 Ryan gets pretty packed
I guess so oh that's have you ever had
headphones ripped out of your ears yeah
I that it's not even from the jack has
done stupid elf you violated it yeah
you're like hall yeah like someone
pulled your pants it feels like you're
like oh oh wait um okay we should go
around and start doing that sharking
