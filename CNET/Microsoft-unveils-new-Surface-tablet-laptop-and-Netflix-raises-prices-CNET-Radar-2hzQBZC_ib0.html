laptop Facebook may use emojis Netflix
raises prices and what flew under the
radar Microsoft held a big event as
expected there's a brand new surface pro
tablet the surface pro 4 packs a 12.3
inch screen in the same size as a
surface pro 3 which had a 12 inch screen
there's a new type cover to go along
with the pro 4 with a larger trackpad
and a redesigned keyboard however the
big surprise with Microsoft's first
laptop this surface book it's got a 13.5
inch screen there's actually a hybrid
laptop the screen can be removed and act
as a tablet not all the guts are in the
screen the GPU is located in the
keyboard bass so the machine is more
powerful when docked microsoft also
showed up three new phones there's the
5.2 inch 950 and the 5.7 inch 950 XL
both can be attached to the new
microsoft display dock which allows
these phones to operate more like
desktop computers the budget lumia 550
was also introduced but it can't act
like a desktop facebook is now testing a
new way to share your emotions instead
of the like button it's a collection of
six emojis they're like love haha yay
Wow sad and angry the test will take
place in two markets Spain and Ireland
this sounds like a good approach we'll
see if it becomes a standard Facebook
feature Netflix is raising prices its
standard price now costs 999 for new
members in the US Canada and Latin
America that's up one dollar per month
the company already raised prices in
Europe earlier this year existing
members won't see the price hike until
some time later it's time to go rapid
fire here are some more stories you
should know Roku introduced the Roku for
a 4k media streamer Twitter named
interim CEO Jack Dorsey as its permanent
CEO and the latest version of Android

Nexus devices here's were flew under the
radar say hello to the light l16 camera
