laptop you could take anywhere that
could also transform into a powerful
gaming PC when you get home this is the
Razer core v2 a box that gives your
laptop the power of a desktop graphics
card just by plugging in a single cable
you get four USB ports for your
peripherals wired internet and you can
add multiple external monitors to it'll
even charge thin laptops without a
separate power adapter you do need to
provide your own graphics card though
practically any GPU will fit so we
decided to go all-out this here is a
$1200 NVIDIA Titan XP one of the fastest
graphics cards ever made I can
practically feel your jealousy through
the internet but before we unleash the
Hulk let's see just how well this razor
blade stealth can game on its own
yeah those integrated Intel graphics
kind of suck but if you plug in the
Razer core we can crank up the
resolution to 1080p and max out the
settings and this game all of a sudden
gets beautiful and butter smooth if you
turn off the laptop display and use an
external monitor it's even faster
because unlike the laptop screen
the monitor is directly connected to the
GPU in fact the razor court works well
enough to hook up a VR headset without a
hitch as long as we're talking about an
HTC vive instead of an oculus rift but
you also don't need a $1200 Nvidia
graphics card to get value out of the
core when I slotted in a cheaper AMD rx
580 this puny laptop suddenly became
powerful enough to play the notoriously
PC unfriendly player unknowns
battlegrounds at 1080p and medium levels
of detail you don't necessarily need to
use a Razors laptop with the core either
my own personal Dell XPS 15 worked great
after I installed the right drivers you
just need a PC with a Thunderbolt 3 port
that supports external GPUs although
it's a little hard to tell which ones
those are even a macbook pro can work
the only certain models and with certain
GPUs so what's the catch first off Razer
cheaped out a bit on the Thunderbolt 3
cable it's super short which means
you'll probably need to clear space for
the core on your desk plus the core can
get pretty noisy with all those cooling
fans inside also you won't get quite the
same performance from your graphics card
as you would just sticking into a desk
and there's price core costs $500 for
the box alone
add the laptop and graphics card and you
could probably buy a more powerful
desktop PC for the same money but tell
me I want a gaming desk
and do this one messenger bag all I need
in my next retro Lander</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
