photos on social media I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update my photos are
taken with the iphone success and
they're the closest thing we have to
those moving photos you see in Harry
Potter movies it's a still image but
when you press on the screen you can see
about a second before and after it was
taken just a moment in time and it also
records audio it's basically a mini
movie only the newest iphone 6s models
can create these and they could be
shared with another iphone or ipad with
iOS 9 but they could not be shared to a
social network until now tumblr just
updated its app to include 3d touch so
you can press a photo to make it come
alive Android users those still only see
a regular non-moving photo there are
workarounds to share it with the world
because the iphone is really just saving
this as a dot mov video file you can
hook it up to a computer to import the
movie file and then use a gift making
tool to turn it into a looping image you
can find more tips on how to do this at
CNN now tumblr which is owned by yahoo
is the first network to work with these
live photos and that's not all Yahoo's
up to these days yahoo mail now supports
gmail as in you can put your gmail
inside of the main Yahoo Mail app along
with AOL Mail and some outlook accounts
and it's all in one inbox back in
October Yahoo redesigned its mail app
but gmail wasn't compatible until now
and speaking of Google the google photos
app is getting a new feature that would
be very handy for holiday parties google
photos now has shared albums which lets
multiple people at photos into one album
here's what I mean five people are at an
event everyone snapping pictures and to
share everyone can dump the photos into
one shared album a creator will invite
people to join a shared album and
everyone can select the photos they want
the group to see there's no limit to how
much you want to upload it's free and if
grandma doesn't use Google well you
could just send her the URL link later
and if you need to pay back someone for
a gift you can now just text them the
money with google wallet the Google
Wallet app will let you send a text
message to send money to any phone
number the recipient will get a text
mess
edge with a link so they can enter in
their debit card info to claim the money
the updated Google Wallet app is now in
the Google Play Store and it's coming to
apple's app store in a few days that's
it for this tech news update and there's
more at cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
