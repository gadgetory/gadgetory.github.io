still playing it so sorry yeah it's
wonderful I'm pretty I'm Donnell Bell
you're watching crave Who am I with are
you with me eric franklin and Banita I'm
glad we're all here yeah I made it back
you made it back we made it back from we
survived CES once another one once again
it is us who loves who is triumphant am
I the only one who actually didn't walk
the show floor more than like maybe a
hundred feet I think probably know I was
pretty deep I know this is the first
year that I went in yet although that
implies no well what I know no I walk
the show floor is what I'm saying yeah
that's what I heard you know yeah why'd
you make that face you made that face
you want me to go further no they did
know you want yet hold it you wanna meet
holy say so how was it how was it out
there cuz i am at well you probably i
don't know maybe we saw more than I did
you know is less crowded then I felt it
was less crowded than previous years I
remember being on the show floor a
couple years ago and just wanting to
start kicking kneecaps in because of the
amount of people that were around me by
adding adding get that I think of that
feeling this year because I had room to
move around that's good yeah all right
depending on what hall i was in North
Hall was ok ok I didn't want to like
hurt anybody yeah when we were walking
through south hall and central yeah was
that little town for a little bit too
much ok because I felt like that was at
the whole Bonnie back a couple times
exactly anybody get groped just me
that's why the show up like I didn't
even a like this yeah the entire time
I'm staying I can't have this just
walking out yeah they'll enjoy that yeah
like just doin me yeah exactly where
we're good we naked why travel light I
travel light oh yeah really ah ok I've
talked to your wife mother
well if it means one naked day out of
the entire time there I figure that's a
reasonable one less outfit to pack yes
okay all right I'm sure everyone is
probably sick about hearing us talk
about sea or everyone talk about ces
basher nonetheless toast of what we're
talking about today is a roundup of the
things that at least escaped me while I
was there with my blinders on just
looking at tablet news yeah all the fun
wacky craveable wonderfulness there was
a lot of mystic yeah there's a lot of
that yeah first up the samsung smart
window totally miss this yeah is it
either but say a window that goes in
your home that happens to be able to
double as a touchscreen and I think
android-based touch screen for you know
doing all of your wonderful all your
futuristic the future of Minority Report
multi-touch needs you know yeah sure I
mean the neighbors have to see you
linking at porn or whatever happens to
me your time your web site of choice
when you're browsing well the internet
the thing the thing is just like yes
sure I always love to look at recipes
while I'm standing by my window yeah or
get on Twitter as I'm holding my laptop
by the way I don't it just seems kind of
weird to have it um I mean I understand
why they have in the window it's it's it
v.v.v future implications of this are
more exciting to me than the window like
having everything unlike maybe a wall i
can go to any wall you're in your own
site you're just gonna get ya what they
call the gorilla arm when your arms just
kind of stretched out and doing yeah
exactly yeah you're really gonna do but
where would be cool be the shower right
could they do a shower version of that
sure sure sure I'll get them right on
that some people's have have the robot
shower that scrubs you say that your
hands are free to just kind of check you
know Twitter and your newsfeed yeah so
is that is are you checking the like the
shower wall at the side wall that would
you checking that was how are you
looking the door right the glass door
yeah okay I don't have a glass door oh
yeah you would need a glass people and
then you didn't replace
I do not think about that the Ricci's
over here would you read Donald rich and
Bonnie rich sorry what about uh what
about mirrors I could be good too yeah
maybe we could but then you have a
two-way mirror a gorilla Harmer's thing
well the grill arms whatever will get
stronger well we'll get used to it i I
just like I like the idea of having
being able to connect with any part of
my house of your house yeah and me
that's that's at least how I see this
panning out in the future I just like
offending my neighbors with my browsing
habits isolate on my window who knows
some poor baby but really obnoxious
screensavers just running on my window
all the time well ones that point of
like you something well I mean you be
like of yourself you know it I think I
think people will you know they'll
respond positively to it kids love porn
that's almost a show title but yeah
right now oh my gosh that the people who
are gonna find the podcast or not the
audience we want to have they go like
this one all right well I do love though
is 3d r2d2 approved display technology
you know ya know what okay well wait
hold on let me let me before you shatter
my enthusiasm I was going to is Rona
that's right this is the the Holy Grail
right for completing the the r2d2 3d
laser projection holographic II future
hope right help me obi-wan can i right
so there's this company burden not the
snowboard company burden but another
company I think they're from Japan that
has created this laser display
technology that can both like ionize the
little particles to make a projection
substrate and then actually project
laser on to it to illuminate it and then
move it around and so you get the the 3d
you get the whole barrage action huh d
lunch and apparently it can
in water or in air and if you make a
strong enough late if they use a
stronger laser they can actually project
into like far into the air on anything
like into the sky like you could have
your 3d projected laser shark coming to
devour city later shark that differs
from sharks with laser beams and yes
totally different yeah I so so I these
are these are hundred thousand dollars
3d in this grant we say yes they
actually in three dimensions these these
projects right that's right application
for this is that you could and they get
a venture to like a free a face that
looks pretty so um you can you could
actually use this for modeling safe the
Death Star yeah its various weaknesses
it all comes back to stop behind
everything yeah yeah well yeah I mean
this this is yeah it's it's just kind of
funny to think that you know what was it
was it almost is over 30 years ago now
that uh Lucas a you know dude it came
out with all these ideas or had all
these ideas in a movie and back in the
day i was thinkin like we were only
we're on the cusp of that you know when
I was a kid I was like we're gonna
that's that's coming out soon they're
gonna have that kind of stuff we're
gonna be shooting late like 10 years
yeah it's like 37 years later and we're
just now getting to the point where
maybe it's possible to put it in you
know I don't know the tabs I'm kind of
like your mainstream application of this
it just kind of it's kind of weird I
don't know I its kind of pointing that's
taking this long so I'm saying yeah well
this is the same old jetpack rant where
it's like where's my flying car right
yeah as promised exactly but at least to
Lucas's credit he did put this in like
technically place the movie well like a
long time ago like alternate universes
it wasn't saying like this is coming
into year 2012 yeah wasn't it is like
you ruined my childhood said that these
things are gonna be here they're not
here where's my lightsaber yeah mr.
Lucas no I'm not saying I'm just saying
this I
I I kind of had expectation myself I put
that myself so I'm saying and I
shouldn't have right yeah all I'm saying
is that when I retire and I have nothing
to do with my time except to build my
authentic r2d2 replica they will now
have the technology for me to be able to
put in the laser 3d projector and I can
I can rest happy yeah I I've done it is
this before after your wife has left you
this is after she's left me but both
like once I made enough money that can
also provide r2d2 right with the serving
tray yeah like who and also the rocket
why do you need a wife you got our two
of you know I'll be asking our to that
very question why do I need a wife are
you are too why am I so sad do I need a
white what where did she go I have you
should be happy why is my son embarrass
of me my artoo will be like projecting a
3d holographic image of my wife likes a
small on the kitchen table and all this
because I can almost anyway I'll be
great so yeah right now the the frame
rate on this is kind of the Khan ugly
part of the Isle of 10 to 15 is 30
second that's not that they're hoping
over time that they'll be able to get up
to get up to 30 yeah but I mean what's
insane is that it's like the frame rate
is the frame rate is measured by how
many times the lasers can basically like
set fire to the air right right right
it'sit's yeah the the way they're using
to kind of gauge frame rate is it that
amount of itself is impressive you know
it's just like it's kind of crazy it's
not just refreshing the screen whatever
there's no screen Donald there's
particles those man who knows what else
is kind of know all right another part
of the future we were promised yeah yeah
more sophisticated skateboard technology
i remember back to the future too yeah I
remember that too um now thanks to
chaotic moon labs yeah there is a
connect powered motorized skateboard
that you and Sharon both took a ride on
yes jealous should we cut to the video
sure didn't do it it's amazing exciting
stuff check it out the video oh there's
this video well there's this video yeah
this is amazing settings this no I I'm
not being facetious when I say this is
amazing exciting I was being facetious
about the video I'm in um that remain so
motorized all-terrain skateboard here
sure with ya goes up to like I think 35
miles per hour or 32 miles per hour or
something like that they're actually
working on a version that goes up to 65
miles per hour and necessary I don't
know i don't know if i said i don't know
this is necessary to be honest but it's
pretty cool um it uses a uses a android
tablet and wrote i buy windows 8 tablet
and a knex um you know sensor and
basically you can control your speed by
the distance your hand is away from the
actual sensor so you push your hand down
towards the sensor you go faster you
pull away you slow down gosh it's really
cool so but steering at all based on mr.
ciabatta you should arrange i think i'm
right now is my concern is that yeah if
they've made it peel out its steering
left or right based on your hands going
left to right and not your body going
left or right right how does that not
just deer away from you and yeah exactly
so you only control the speed with you
you're like a jealous be with your hands
you control everything else with your
body weight um i have to say this is one
of the coolest we got like it's
literally the coolest thing i saw the
show this is me my first time we didn't
we didn't actually get footage of me in
my second time as much more confident to
second check I didn't want to like go
crashing but there's other people around
the comedian so anyway we'll crashing
that guy or other things and I was kind
of scared too yeah so you still look a
little more confident the chair and I
saw Sharon's take we have that video oh
yeah their shoes you'll hear me laughing
at her it's nice
well she she starts way I want to go
auditions she did almost fall it's okay
know if it's the most intuitive way to
control a skateboard I could get used to
it I yeah I don't know I didn't think
this is gonna be impressive and when she
told me about I was like ah whatever
then when he brought it by actually got
on i was like okay this is this is
pretty i am curious like with the
maneuvering how ya like when you got
your hands like controlling the speed
and you're like sure Ryna like maneuver
i am not an experienced skateboard the
guy who did this worley i think his name
was I don't know that's it that's when
he went by Worley he's an experienced
skateboarder yeah so even an experienced
skateboarders I used to skate boarding
with wheels this big and it out windows
8 tablet or whatever right the nose of
your skateboard yeah I think you
probably get used to where you because
there's a hitbox and you place your hand
into you can see on the screen there you
probably used to wear that hand is now
after a while still like what's it with
how is that much better than having like
a little thumb accelerator if it's just
a matter of school it looks like your
Jedi looks like you're making it go with
your mind your mind powers instead of me
you know clicking Utley trust man I was
not a believer at first either Janet
until I tried it once you try it
hopefully I don't want to like break
your enthusiasm for it but you guys
don't look that cool like even
experienced guy in a video he doesn't
look that cool on it I agree hey it
looks pretty it looks kind of goofy just
doing it I think once i get used to it
though and i'm able to like you know
look cool at all able to i'll be able to
look cool you're gonna work on you you
want to look at you were on a Segway
yeah I think you go too far that but i
think uh i think it was things like you
you you can you can get used to write
using that kind of thing and they're
coming out with they're gonna now
something on februari third uh they
didn't want to reveal it to me that this
is the this is this is the why and then
what will you find out why they did to
the same basically in fact that there's
no in phone like with us coming no i
cater no no no but fair we're gonna now
something some look at we have a lawyer
i hope it is very good great you just
he's letting anyone get on it questions
like chicks and high heels and stuff and
like are you doing like a lawsuit would
be the best press we have yeah exactly
Oh anyway it was cool all right here uh
is something that i think is going to
change more lives anything we thought
and a connect controlled all-terrain
skateboard all right this is coming and
I'm saying this we're even putting a
gizmodo story in the lineup here how
much is that important it is a toilet
seat not a toilet but just the seat
attachment right that has a built-in
motorized bday in it yeah this is a
company that is so inspired that Mark
Cuban is part of the financial backing
for this company oh really yeah wow
that's that keeps going doesn't it yeah
this is it is a nap doesn't it is I
think it's like a 40 it's like what a
lash heated spray of water so you're
never gonna run out of warm water
hitting your butt and it's got the
remote control Wow well I 249 and all of
America can enjoy the warm jet but
cleaning experience I gotta say that
might be worth it to be 94 that is
surprisingly yeah all thing my bday is I
i I've never actually used of a day I
don't I don't know
I'll trust it that's the thing America
can't get on board cuz we're all were
all eight of our nether holes being
violated by jets and water right why
don't mind that part I don't trust it to
to do the job thoroughly is what you
have control over so salty language what
you need is like a version of this with
a gopro cam yeah that's right all right
sure the brightness can't really good I
don't know to say you know and like nope
combining you know when you when you add
more wetness yeah things can get messy
is all I'm saying yeah that's that's
what scares me about the days that's all
I'm saying I won't say anything I
understand yeah yeah yeahs apprehension
yeah yeah sure ok Donald apparently
doesn't he's all about it I I could be
terrified by this thing I don't know but
and savings using it right now yeah but
no I think this is one of those those
things that if it really does come in is
which is on the shelf at home depot I
think it says here in this article that
the entry entry level version could be
as low as a hundred and seventy nine
dollars yeah it could be this could be
America's new obsession yeah yeah at
that price and Italy's really it works
okay you know there is a nasty targeting
is not to get really discussing but or
offensive but there's a portion of
America that can't kind of reach behind
to do such a great job that's that true
I I knew someone like that this could be
a product that person really bring them
closer to their loved ones yeah I didn't
even of you know it's their cleanliness
oh so yeah I right right now that was a
problem that was a problem with this
person I knew that the there was yeah
because of the lack of yeah flexibility
here afterwards you didn't want to
necessarily stand around them yeah yeah
so this could be the toilet seat that
brings all of America
to a new millennium of freshness yeah
nothing oh sure she was the movie that
had that like the three shell technique
that the future that can clean your butt
with like three shells no one uses
toilet paper anymore with with my
Stallone in it that one demolition man
Demolition Man yeah this is the this is
one step closer to that that revolution
of cleaning yourselves this also one
step closer two cops that look like
Sandra Bullock when she was like 22
because I'll support y'all martyr that's
whether you get you on board a bit we'll
make it happen yes all right good all
right now I've got a section here that
I'm a two-story section that i am
putting under the umbrella of zombie
tech zombie apocalypse tech not for
zombies but for us in case when we're
camped out into our neo Amish up you
know enclaves and you know the power
grid has failed us and we we need to
build a key part our small band of
humans alive right power Trek is there
for us this is a fuel cell recharger
that Rafe was able to get a demo of at
CES that is like a hydrogen cell
charging station for your gadgets it's
being sold at rei and it's one of the i
guess they're selling it under the idea
that it's the most reliable outdoor
power solution if you need to keep like
your gps technology try running your own
or your ipods because you know you why
is it so reliable because it like a four
dollar little cartridge in here you plug
it in you put in some water assuming
that no matter where you are you can
find water or this is the tie back to
the last story you can pee in it you can
use here urine oh yeah alright you can
pee in the little cup and then you plug
in that canister and you've got a steady
a little power station back in i think
you know repower your abs a couple
different eric you guys are like my
parents yeah like trying to channel
spent maybe more come to appeal like
and y'all good there and just sit up sit
down and just pee and you're good now of
course in the zombie apocalypse will
have to keep this particular
manufacturer cigna chemistry up and
running to make the cartridges for us
and that's right of those yeah well we
run out of those were screwed I like it
I like it I just don't go don't go pee
by yourself yeah during the zombie about
yes you know you always want someone
like watching them back yes exactly and
I was double double tap as well yeah all
right so that exists it's two hundred
dollars for the unit and then for
dollars per cartridge coming to an rei
near you stock up because those zombies
are coming another thing you should get
is this spare one cell phones from xpel
power that could hypothetically function
for up to 15 years in storage if you
have a little lithium ion cannon ee back
totally better yeah yeah and uses some
kind of weird i don't know it's just
like a fool head or what maybe it's a
hand it i think i figure i think you're
going to the right duluth thing and I it
looks like some kind of like some
interdimensional demon yeah looks like
the that's coming through go through
that ate the chumby like you know it's
those damn mages you know the Chantry
which is and they'll get a little more
hard edge on those mages and you know
shut them down and you know let's let's
um let's make them all tranquil that's
what I'm saying guys right no no no
one's getting that reference tonight now
ten hours of talk time off of one double
a battery and also if you if you're
using a lithium you know I honor this
particular ones like a energizer lithium
ion yeah yeah you can get a shelf life
of up to 15 years in theory in theory
right wait even if it did five years
that's pretty good and it simply means
it's a cell phone compare
phone it's not like a wireless phone to
a landline exactly yeah right now you
one has to hope that the the network of
so your cellular network is gonna be up
and running right right yeah that's
that's the question is everything else
know about that little happier friends I
mean it CES was already bad enough right
satellite was directly communicating to
a satellite you know that would be
that'd be different yeah yes but it's
not so uh likely price around twenty to
fifty dollars based on their features
Tibet available soon there's a 911
feature provide your own sim card sure
this is the I'm just glad that our demon
overlords are looking out for us that's
that's the most important thing to take
this end and in that apocalypse when
there's only you know three of us
remaining they will all look to this
Cthulhu logo as Arnie Arnie forgot a
beer it all starts here all right I
think if you're willing to do it Eric
this is the time where we go to a little
segment that I like to call yeah alright
well I'm not willing to do it on the
show now or all right all right no no
not much in geek news this week that's
interest interesting me I did see I did
find this a really cool clip though I
saw Rise of the Planet of the Apes
recently and I really like that so I've
seen it twice now the second time is
even better and the reason I you know
the reason I hold in such high regards
because of anti circuses performance as
Caesar um its officers Oscar season
they're trying to get the the Academy of
voters whatever they're called to kind
of look at his performance you know
because they took his his action
performance then they made a CG
character and kind of you know basis
performance-based that seedy characters
performance off of his something he did
it's kind of hard to wrap your head
around that like is that really him is
it how much of is it is that his
animators or the CG artist whatever and
this video kind of
straits how closely his acting was to
the final product you got and Stephen if
you can play that not sure if there's a
commercial or something in front of
hopefully lasted like cases the best
Andy Serkis in jail and I would not have
expected they'd be able to be able to
put pull from that footage yeah like I
like what you go with it you know he did
this in lord of rings to ease he was
golem they actually had a someone
listening some podcast recent lanes
where someone so when some woman was
like oh you know I loved you in low
degree I love you how you play Gollum in
Lord of rings he was like no madam I am
golem that's that is me that was that
was I did everything you know as I was
that character mascot oh yeah oh I don't
remember the intro there is this on a
whim same page okay right now this is
like some trailers i'm not sure what
this is is this are you on the hit fix
page but i think there's uh huh yeah no
no I'm seeing it here okay I'm enjoying
that though yeah other music about you
reenacted fun yeah he did you do you do
that algeciras I'll do see me goodbye
yeah what I will say though what I will
say like and I feel like a lot of people
kind of well that allowed people but
I've heard people kind of make fun of
this guy okay oh that's what he does
know you just do stuff but i think i
really think that like going forward
we're gonna want more out of our cuz
that's that's not going away CJ
characters on going away we're gonna
want more from our CG character is we're
gonna want more like um emotional
investment this is the only way to
really do that to have some person
actually plays was it opens up it opens
up the playing field for actors for you
know the the more average-looking among
us yeah sure to be able to lay you know
leading roles in movies sure get cg din
to be later monsters or apes or
beautiful people yeah sure beautiful
blue people there you go there you go
hey go okay my mama for it
a brilliant young scientist will play by
James Franco saved Caesar from the lab
and along with a primatologist Caroline
because you should be shooting so we
better get on thing I mean I think we're
just having technical difficulties wait
wait I mean I'm able to semen sure he's
never seen it but he's sure that it's
coming up right now okay um no this
isn't it then it is it that it this is
just like a scene I don't know why this
now this is the scene but the video i'm
watching right now it shows any circus
playing that seeing purse oh I see yeah
you know what I mean like screw James
Franco like pretty blab yeah like the
next generations James Franco is Frank's
gonna look like any circuit in these
words yeah yeah cuz we don't need oh
there it is oh forget it give up anyway
it's pretty compelling check out the
link will have the link in the show
notes uh right Donald yes okay anyway
moving on last thing I wanted to show
there are paramount released this
awesomely cool picture of Captain
America from The Avengers he looks
really badass really war-torn he has his
great moon on his arm and he's all dusty
and and whatever his hairs all messed up
and whatever the meso looks like kind of
perfect but um he fears bidets he tears
he's looking out for the day's a
metaphor for America like I will retain
I will protect you from the water that's
trying to go up your butt oh this shield
is really geared exact water from the
water in this yeah uh so yeah I just
wanted to show that picture because I
kind of like you know people are really
kind of thinking like it's gonna be all
like light and whatever but it looks me
gritty looks pretty cool I think I like
that picture a lot because it really
shows Captain America how I envisioned
quezon America is just complete devoted
um badass so okay there you go I'll take
it yeah you will that's all I got
