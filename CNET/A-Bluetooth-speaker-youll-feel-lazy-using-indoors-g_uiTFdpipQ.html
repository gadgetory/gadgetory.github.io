Bluetooth speakers to distinguish
themselves from the rest
but philips has managed to break off
with a new design in their shock box SB
7200 this speaker is wrapped in a hard
mesh grille and durable rubber making it
one of the toughest portable speakers on
the market right now and it's a good
idea to bring to a hike the beach or
anywhere else you want to soundtrack
it's only 7 inches long and 3 inches
wide making it really easy to put inside
a suitcase or a backpack as well there's
also a small metal clip on the side that
you can string a carabiner through for
personal carry but I doubt serious
hikers are gonna want to carry it on
long trips it does weigh a little less
than a pound the speaker comes in purple
white black and olive color options I
personally chose the golden green for
its military style that goes well with
its toughness you pair it and control
the speaker using this single button on
top along with a volume knob on one side
with a series of ports on the other it
charges via USB and there's also a line
out port for hard lining and non
bluetooth audio source
now pairing the device is really easy
all you got to do is hold down the power
button and it'll go into discovery mode
then just go into the Bluetooth settings
on your phone or your computer click on
the corresponding icon and the shock box
does the rest the speaker also verbally
confirms your button presses and
acknowledges when you've made a
connection which is cool but it's also
lacking in details for example you can
press it once again for a battery check
but it'll give you the reading in vague
terms like plenty of life instead of an
exact percentage half way on battery
then there's the smart sensor that's
this thing right here it's on the side
and it lets you control playback using
hand gestures just swipe down a pause
and swipe left to right to advance a
track at cetera and as you can probably
tell it doesn't always work as
advertised actually it's just a lot
easier to control your music using the
music source alone assuming that's close
by so how does the speaker sound well
even though it only has 2 4 watt
speakers inside this is actually one of
the best speakers I've heard at this
price and with these features the rubber
encasing also grips whatever surface you
put it on and that resonates the bass a
little more than your average Bluetooth
speakers but as always
keep in mind that you're gonna lose some
sound quality over the wireless
connection and while this isn't really
gonna blow out your windows with sound
it does get pretty loud you can check
out all the details in my full review on
CNET but that's gonna do it for me I'm
Justin you you just took a first look at
the Philips shock box SB 7200 bluetooth
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
