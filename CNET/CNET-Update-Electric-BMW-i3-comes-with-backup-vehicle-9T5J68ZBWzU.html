car I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update BMW unveiled its first
mass-produced all-electric car the i3
what's unique about the car is that it's
made mostly of lightweight carbon fiber
and the inside is made of renewable
materials you'll notice it also has
coach style doors now when it comes to
the performance stats the i3 range is
similar to the competition it's said to
get about 80 to a hundred miles between
charges but for about 5 grand extra
there's the option to add a small gas
motor in the car so you won't be limited
and it's reported that BMW wants to give
owners the option to rent an SUV for
several weeks a year for those times
when you want to take a long road trip
the car costs more than the competition
but maybe perks like the SUV rental
would sway people to pay more it'll
start at forty one thousand three
hundred and fifty dollars when it goes
on sale in the spring of next year but
you do get tax breaks on electric
vehicles which drops the price by
several thousand dollars of course we'll
have to wait for the test drive to
determine if the BMW has a better ride
that's worth that higher price apple is
expected to show off new iphones this
fall and we are already seeing images
posted online about these new models the
latest is the plastic packaging that has
the name iphone 5c which was posted to a
chinese discussion forum the 5c could be
the long-rumored plastic iphone that
will be a little cheaper many expect the
higher end model to be called 5s that is
if Apple follows its naming history
microsoft released the official prices
of its Xbox one accessories and no big
surprises here the five-hundred-dollar
console will come with one controller
but a second controller will cost sixty
dollars if you want a controller with a
charging kit it's $75 and the Xbox one
chat headset will be $25 and looking
ahead this week we will finally get the
official word on the worst kept secret
in tech the Moto X smartphone Motorola
will unveil the
phone on Thursday but there has been
leaked after leaked about this phone
there's been a video that accidentally
posted early about what it can do Google
chairman Eric Schmidt was flaunting the
phone in public a few weeks ago photos
have been posted to Twitter and the
latest is from a former editor of the
blog Android in me who is saying the
Moto X will have a special version of
scratch resistant Gorilla Glass called
magic glass that wraps around the sides
the blogger Taylor Wimberly posted
several images to his Google+ page the
phone could go on sale right after the
announcement so check in with seen at
