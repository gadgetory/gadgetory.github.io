it's episode 250 the big to 500 of the
359 podcast and as would see fit we've
been cursed we apologize for the delay
for whatever reason Ben is pointed out
that we always have something
technically go wrong that the lazy
starting of the show on the big
landmarks good morning everybody thanks
for coming back to us after the long
weekend what's up guys first up how are
your weekends fine I was in Canada my
very patriotic you are I don't have I
don't have a hangover but I have a
freedom over freedom over don't know
what that is but too much freedom this
weekend at tiny bald eagles that could
veer towards some dark territory anyway
should actually be a cocktail anyways
why don't we get started we were talking
about the delays in Samsung's this bixby
digital assistant special deals that you
can only get special prime day deals of
them deals vixx and and lastly the the
real threat of Goldeneye or not Pecha
one of it's called something called own
eyes a much cooler name for the
ransomware attack that happened last
week but I've lost the branding battle
and everyone's calling it not Petya
instead alright so we're going with as
always if you have any questions leave
it in the comment section Brian will get
to the best and we'll try to answer them
in three minutes in 59 seconds from 3m
or after yeah most likely after three -
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon I'm Alfred Eng remember
big feasts keep going keep it going all
right so remember Bixby probably not but
it's samsung's digital voice assistant
they talked about it as sort of one of
the marquee features of the galaxy as
eight i've despite the fact that the
phone has been out for months
Bixby is still nowhere to be seen the
Korea Herald has a report out saying
that they're having issues with the
English language version they can't get
enough data basically that buzz would be
in Korean it doesn't work in Korean but
it doesn't work here and that's delayed
to launch
they said initially it was supposed to
be in April
then and spring and now it's you know
then June and now it's obviously July
and we still haven't seen it still no
word from Samsung on when this comes out
I mean are you surprised I
I mean why why they can't get this right
I'm pretty simple like that's surprising
because this is a major tech Titan just
get your deadlines right I mean what
happened what's the matter how did
Amazon get the data for Alexa though
because it kind of just came out of
nowhere with that I I imagine Samsung
had the same like ace up its sleeve or
something yeah it's a good point however
people tend to forget that when the echo
first came out it was only did yeah it
only 14 skills it was super basic and
they were able to build it out as they
continued to get data yeah because big
speed does not have that option because
it has to be much better coming out of
the gate but has voice recognition
technology and voice assistants are much
more developed and much more complex
than they used very interested that you
know they were able to develop a working
version in Korean first I mean I
understand that they're based out of
Korea and they have a lot more users
there but from what my understanding is
I feel like Korean is a much harder like
speech recognition part of the problem
and the Korea Herald kind of breaks this
down is us engineers have been trying to
work on this in English but they've had
unsurprisingly communications problems
with the managers back in Korea I think
it was a lot easier to do it with with
the Korean language because you know
most the upper staff engineers there are
all speaking Korean so the more data
they had I think they probably have a
friendlier base of users in Korea for to
understand they had launched a beta here
in the u.s. to a couple of sort of early
access customers and so far the results
of the mixed yeah I would like to throw
out there that I kind of feel like
nobody really cares to a certain extent
about pick speed because you've already
got Google assistant on those phones
yeah you can also get Google assistant
on an iPhone which I would strongly
recommend you use instead of Siri so I
don't think a lot of people are waiting
around for yeah it's funny because I
mean Sam the Galaxy has a it has a
dedicated physical bixby button on the
side that does nothing that's true
that's right but if you want a Google
assistant all you have to do is tap the
home button and you're good to go
so like why would you want to use Bixby
even if they were working yeah so
real challenge also in more voice
assistant news if you're interested in
prime day because God knows I my wife is
all stoked right so Amazon Prime day
which starts on the like at night on the
10th and it goes into the 11th you can
ask your echo or your echo dot or
whatever other Amazon devices that you
have for special deals on Alexa so just
these are all Alexa only Alexa only
deals and the the reason that this is
interesting is is that Amazon just
continues to try to make voice shopping
a thing so it's trying to create special
discounts and deals to get people
interested in doing this I mean clearly
they're just training people to get
comfortable
yep using their echo to buy stuff
admittedly I mean I have two echoes in
my house I do not do a lot of voice
shopping I always want to price compare
so really I don't do it that much well
yeah well unprimed a I'm very surprised
that they said more than three million
people like there's been more than three
million like Alexa what are your deals
like commands right since it's been
released and it's just I can't believe
that many people would shop like that
there are a lot of there are a lot of
echoes out there alright so lastly we
wanted to talk about not petya or gold
annoy or whatever you want to call it
that massive ransomware they hit last
week
Albert you had a story breaking down the
real reason why this exists so
essentially the idea is that this wasn't
really a ransomware attack but a way to
wipe out data in general ransomware in
its essence like locks up your data and
like you know encrypts it so that you
can't get it and then ask you to pay up
so you can get it back the idea behind
this is they used to ransomware as a
cover so they could just delete your
data in general and if you looked at the
code behind it and if you looked at the
emails where the ransom was supposed to
go to it was really bad and they never
really existed to be kiddin really try
that yeah so it's becoming very wise I
can't say Russians theory the uranium
police blamed the Russians for it but
there's no definitive proof that it was
that interesting alright so for more of
these stories check us out and see that
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred aying thanks for listening
so what shall we open back up with for
cheddar today I know we have a limited
amount of time yeah sorry guys we've got
I've got a beginning in about six
minutes so this is really short if you
got any questions about prime day about
this video or about Bixby I know right
now Harish is asking when will Bixby be
available in India and that's it's all
available cream having trouble with
English so I have to imagine other
languages are way in the back and you
really can't it must Samsung's like
predicted dates on this considering that
they kind of missed the mark already on
yeah why seal it could be rolled out to
India in English though right maybe
that's what he was asking about way
behind the curve the legend 34 says I
like the name Bixby I know we've given
in a lot of a lot of guff a lot of guff
in the past it was chosen because it was
millennial friendly it was kind of
hipster name it was also a gender free I
don't get have people started naming
their kids big SPEA
no after the actor who played the
Incredible Hulk
wait yeah who I know the original
Incredible Hulk actor who was that he
went to my high school we were like a
graduate from there I don't I remember
it's only good now Bill Bixby played
Incredible Hulk
you tell of the original movie Hulk no
I'm talking about the TV show Hulk guys
more questions what are you guys looking
forward to at for prime day this year I
don't even a chance to look at the the
alleged deals the oligo the chef's hat
that's like 50 cents off this here
because I don't like you last year they
were kind of like oh this is just kind
of like a garage sale for the past two
years has been that where like they're
basically trying to clear out their
warehouse I did notice the deals that
were being offered is Alexa deals a lot
of that stuff was smart home delayed it
was a lexer Elena that's true so they're
really trying to push I mean we were
thinking about stuff like that
connected yes or whatever they're I
think they're really smart plug yeah
which cost like thirty five dollars and
you get seven dollars off if you order
it through Alexa I mean like it's still
expensive
I saw a plug but it's Wi-Fi connected
smart plug I can turn off that plug with
my phone is that how it works yeah yeah
yeah or with Alexa
so anyway sorry we keep triggering your
Alexa's people not doing it on purpose
mathew dieter is asking is primed a
really anything more than just splurge
spending lightning deal for something
that you don't really need well I don't
know late last year those diapers we're
on discounted that was harsh to be fair
I think they sold out on their Roomba
vacuums in like three seconds or
something the problem is and they did
get better with this the second year
around where they had really hot deals
they were like the doorbuster deals yeah
but they had such low inventory that
they sold out of them immediately they
increased the inventory but still sold
out of them immediately the second year
but you had a bit of a less of an excuse
that like you you missed out but they
had like both years I spent hours like
just browsing for like good a single
thing I waited for previous years I
waited to buy stuff that I wanted and lo
and behold like none of that stuff was
actually on sale so you just probably
never come Black Friday yeah you you
invariably end up just like purchasing
stuff because you've got like the sunken
cost that you've been sitting on Amazon
just like how they get you ten chefs
hats now well you wear though what
everyday did three for backup I just
like walk are like who is the chef in
this house right but going back to the
voice shopping stuff like if they
definitively can say like hey this is
gonna be discounted from what the
regular price is for something then you
don't have to price compare as much and
maybe you can voice shop with a little
bit more certainty or like price
guarantee or something that's pretty
interesting yeah I very least if you
know that it's discounted 20% off of
like the regular market rate then like I
would be much more likely
shopping make makes a lot of sense I
think you're shopping blindfolded Wow
like it does if you if there are certain
like staple goods right like milk like a
bowl of cereal
I don't know Bowl sir you know maybe a
box of cereal you know like like like
you know because of a boy I would do
voice shopping if it was for food like
like if I could order like a pizza from
like my local like pizzeria I think you
can do that like ya know you can totally
do your echo I think Domino's Pizza I'm
doing it Papa John's I think ya might
people miss Papa John's is infiltrative
just about everything yeah hey we got a
rabbit us in the house wait more Christ
Papa bless we got one more real good
question before we wrap it up
speaking of voice assistance Kellan's
asking would any of you guys personally
use Bigsby on a daily basis now bet I
know you adhere to the the Church of
echo so well we haven't really tried
nixb so it's hard to say again makes me
a little different it's supposed to be
an assistant that helps you control your
phone like you'll be able to run
searches for specific photos in your
phone or it's not it's less about search
and more about sort of it helping to
manage your device yeah but how often do
you use the voice like assistant on your
phones anyway ever
yeah that's your thing Siri does a
pretty good job of like helping me call
my wife I mean like that's basically a
tap to call yeah
Mike I don't do a pretty good job of
that as well all right so would you
usually that way we know no because new
voice assistants
I would say are gonna be very shaky for
at least the first couple months I if
not the fire we got to wrap things up
like we go so if you like anything you
saw or heard here check us out a CNET
our podcasts off available iTunes tune
in stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner and
google play music we'll try to do better
tomorrow have a little longer of a Q&amp;amp;A
session everything run while Roger jumps
on out of here we do want to remind
everybody that we are going to be going
on a brief hiatus starting next week
through the week following but we are
pre taping a few fun episodes to kind of
fill in the gaps while we are out of the
office yo do we want to do
3:59 after dark take a few more
questions
Roger bales what they if you want to
yeah or dude yes do we need to turn the
lights off no not at all okay false
ending everybody more and this is like
the after credits
oh no we ain't finished so here's I
thought though before we do wrap it up
for the day if you have any requests as
far as like a fill-in kind of Evergreen
show we have a couple of entertainment
based topics that we are going to be
publishing during the hiatus that we've
pre-taped if you have any great
suggestions you want us to cover go
ahead and throw them on into the
comments ahead in the comments when this
posts on demand shortly and maybe we'll
try to gladly get to any of this but um
so as far as what do you use your your
assistant for because personally I just
checked the weather check the get my
news occasionally play music that's
heimer that's a lot of the basics I
remember the name of the Hulk guy now
it's Lou Ferrigno he went to your school
he went to my high school yeah no
kidding
I think I wasn't there the same time I
love that guy so he was actually the
Hulk yes he was David Banner aka Bruce
Banner ok David Bruce Banner ok so say
reg no that's pretty cool he's a guy
he's a pretty chill dude yeah I mean I
the one thing that I use my echo for
that's at least slightly more advanced
is to turn on and off the lights in the
living room and that's not even that
you're like you're like futuristic I've
got some idea I will say this set up
like a philips hue bridge and frankly i
don't i don't really recommend it that
much to people unless they're really
really into it because you can either
screw in a light bulb and turn the
lights on and off or spend 20 minutes
setting up a smart light yeah it's nice
when i'm coming in the door with like an
armful of groceries you see i agree once
it's set up great but it's my kids to
make sure that they don't like you know
grab something that they're not supposed
to whatever so you often times I'll yell
to my echo just to like find out what
time it is
yeah like what's the weather gonna be
but like yeah there are like more than
10,000 skills on it and I probably use
five or six like it's really not that
exciting you can say that about a lot of
things there's like probably like
millions of apps out there and you use
like 13 so yeah it's just a fair
assessment
we do have a request for an evergreen
show recording uh Dre Frey just says
comics comics I can handle that I know
you can't
I could you still alpha do still
reprinted things yes your book right now
a book that I got through so here's my
policy on printed books versus ebooks
right I live in a neighborhood where
people leave they're like just like
leave used books out on their Stoops a
lot and those are pretty much the only
like printed books that I read it people
like leave them out on their Stoops or
some of the books that we have in this
office it was like mostly like romances
don't judge what I read okay one more to
expand on a request from fumar says DC
EU or MCU so we could do comics in the
comic movies we're talking about movies
DC expanded universe to Marvel Cinematic
Universe we do have a little Comic Con
related stuff coming so stay tuned for
that yeah I mean I could talk about the
comic-book stuff didn't I tell you about
a little bit about this it's it's a
little easy but not bad you know I
stopped reading Marvel comic Wonder
Woman long time ago and switched over to
like Dark Horse and yeah the other ones
image I used to read a lot of Dark Horse
when they still had Star Wars yeah I've
read of I went into the Indies I'm sad
did not really take off I mean like one
DC
I love rydw though the Garfield extended
universe is probably the best comic book
adaptation into like films sure you
wouldn't already signed on to that
project normal normal you know like a
three part movie series that's free I
think Sony actually has the rights to
the OD we're sorry and we're sorry right
so that's actually probably a good point
to really wrap it up right but we're not
we're not gonna do the out try again but
thanks everybody for your suggestions if
you have any more for an evergreen show
you want to hear us do - yeah
fill in for the i8s send those in you
know
after the piece posts on YouTube yep and
yeah we'll have one more regularly
scheduled show before the hatest hiatus
baby haters hate is in the house
tomorrow so we'll see you back here
bright and early tomorrow morning
pending nothing breaks again and I don't
cut my hand open again trying to fix it
so alright later everybody thanks I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
