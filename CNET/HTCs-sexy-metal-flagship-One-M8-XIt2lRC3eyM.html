HTC's latest metal-clad flagship phone
the One m8 now physically it's easy to
see what it's being cut from the same
cloth as its predecessor cuz he on the
front it's got the dual front-facing
boom stand speakers HTC reckons that
these have been made even louder than
before still made from metal but that
now curves around the sides to meet the
screen at the front which makes it
extremely comfortable to hold and I
think that the brushed effect on this
slate color looks really slick as well
the screen has been slightly stretched
to five inches which is up from the 4.7
inches of before and it has the same
Full HD resolution now you might have
noticed the two camera lenses on the
back now the main one here is a same
four ultra pixel sensor as before
although HTC reckons that it has
improved the clarity of its shots now
the other one above it is best thought
of as a depth sensor if you snap a
picture of your friend for example the
phone is able to tell that your friend
is closer to the phone when the
background is now that allows it to
separate the two so you can edit the
background without altering your friend
or even take your friend out of one
picture and put them into another
another fun trick is hitting the edit
button on a picture and moving the phone
around to artificially change the angle
of the picture inside the phone is a
quad-core 2.3 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor and it comes
running the latest Android 4.4.2 kitkat
software you'll also find HD sees latest
Sense 6 interface onboard so you'll see
things like the blink feed news
aggregator and there's extra tweaks like
being able to change the color palettes
and fonts of the interface now HTC
hasn't packed the want MH with arguably
quite gimmicky features like fingerprint
scanners or heartrate monitors but what
it has done is make a few key tweaks to
what was already a gorgeous phone
whether that's enough to keep it
competitive against this year's
flagships remains to be seen when it
goes on sale here in the UK this week
i'm andrew hall for CNET and this is the
HTC One m8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
