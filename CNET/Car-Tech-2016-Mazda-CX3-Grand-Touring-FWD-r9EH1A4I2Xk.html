and European car market right now you're
almost certainly going to end up what
they call the subcompact crossover
like the Honda HRV the Nissan Juke or
the new Jeep renegade notice Mazda is
not on my list
well they are now let's drive the cx-3
check the tech
now a subcompact crossover is subcompact
this guy's based on a Mazda two that
fits in your pocket I swear a lot of
folks buy cars in this class cuz they're
kind of like Hot Wheels you just want to
collect a bunch of them that said I had
tons of head room in the front honestly
too much 2nd row seats credible rear
cargo bay is stubby but it's got this
cool Smuggler's box full width in the
back overall good space use now Mazda
does some really handsome sporty cabins
these days I think and I would not have
said that about them even three model
years ago this is a nice step up
unfortunately they let you screw it all
up with color schemes
this car is mica blue with black and
ivory and burgundy are they kidding this
looks awful luckily the technology has
improved quite a bit beautiful tight
resolution display this little things
what they call the ad display it's a
poor man's HUD leaves me kind of
underwhelmed it shows too little
information with too little resolution
on too little real estate luckily you've
got a touchscreen and you've got some of
the better voice command in an
affordable car I find it's quick to
recognize phrases addresses as a single
throw unfortunately though the prompts
are horsey and rigid for the things you
can say and it's not online search so
you're gonna have to pull out your phone
and search for the address and then put
it in here by then you're just gonna
stay on your phone the home menu is
logical the map looks really clean apps
primarily live under entertainment and
include Pandora stitcher and AHA both
are excellently integrated I found there
is an apps menu but it's nonsense
it's more like a few vehicle services
screens all this is controlled by one of
the more awkward knob sets in the
business straight down in front of the
armrest first thing I see is what I
don't see cuz I'm blinded by this
amazingly shiny bezel on top of the
screen how did that get through wow when
the Sun is just right you can't even see
the screen because this thing's glaring
you so much Mazda's tend to be taught
compared to their competitors also
didn't have a growl
note this is not a car that tries to
isolate out the powertrain like so many
other vehicles I let you know it's
whirring and grinding and buzzing away
in there that can be a little atonal
when you step on this under my right
hand is a real 6-speed automatic by the
way not some kind of CVT or otherwise
newfangled gearbox it's got real bite
between the gears it's bright perky
overall it's just a vehicle that feels
tight and well sprung and kind of honest
and unfiltered that's kind of a Mazda
trait ok now out of the freeway listen
to this sounds like I got a bad
subwoofer channel or something that's
actually what they call a rumble sound
to alert you that you're drifting across
the lane it's passive but it sounds
weird and to me it doesn't sound like a
lane warning I'm not sure it's good HMI
or not the optional driver assist
technology continues from there to
include smart city brake support from
around 2 to 18 miles an hour a
forward-looking laser detects if you're
about to run into something gives you a
warning pre charges the brakes and then
brakes on its own if you don't also
includes adaptive cruise control blind
spot warning technology and adaptive
steering front headlights to do a CX 3
CNET style you're starting about 25 9
delivered that's for a Grand Touring
pretty well loaded another 1250 for
all-wheel-drive that's your call just
under 2 grand for the adaptive driver
assist technologies the price isn't bad
there and I'm at about 27 eight out the
door</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
