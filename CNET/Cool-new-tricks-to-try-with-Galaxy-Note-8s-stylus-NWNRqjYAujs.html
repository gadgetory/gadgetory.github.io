some of the best technology you can find
in a phone but it's the stylus or s-pen
is something called it that makes it
stand out from the crowd one neat new
feature is called live memo with this
you can hand draw a reply to a message
which will be turned into an animated
gif for your friends to watch back it's
largely a bit of fun but it's also handy
to take a screenshot of a map and draw a
route to stand when they watch the gift
they'll be able to see the exact route
they need to take the new translate tool
is really neat with this enabled you can
hover the S Pen over a word in a
sentence and using Google's translation
skills you'll see the translated word in
the language of your choice pop up over
the top you can also select entire
sentences to translate in my hand on
time I found this feature worked well
note users have already been able to
make quick notes in the screens off with
a note 8 expands that by allowing you to
create up to a hundred pages of screen
off memos great for jotting down a
really long shopping list you can also
screenshot and cut out a specific part
of the screen to save and send rather
than simply sending a shot of the entire
screen the pen up app satisfy the
cravings you've had since you were a kid
to color things in as a range of outline
drones to choose from and fill up with
color the stylus itself has seen some
upgrades the nib is finer and it has
over 4000 levels of pressure sensitivity
which makes it feel much more like
writing with a real pen when you pull
the stylus out you'll have access to
this wheel of action to the form making
it really easy to quickly write a note
or use a new translation tool for more
