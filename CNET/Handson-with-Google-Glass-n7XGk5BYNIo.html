Google glass do I look like a cyborg you
probably seen a lot of these things
around and this is Google's attempt at
bringing maybe a little bit of a sci-fi
head-mounted future to you there's a lot
of intimidation going on here you may
think I'm scanning you or have descended
from some Star Trek movie in reality
Google glass is a very specific set of
things that may not be exactly what you
think it does yet for instance it does
not scan everything around you in
reality it actually just hangs an image
up here on the screen and it does
interact with Wi-Fi and bluetooth to
your phone or to your home Wi-Fi network
or laptop to do a variety of things you
could place texts you can make a phone
call you can engage in a google hangout
video chat where they see what you're
seeing or you could search google get
turn-by-turn directions but it's a
pretty limited set of uses right now and
none of them involve Google Goggles
style analysis of the environment
popping up information or any sort of
weird world where things you see start
interacting with things virtual again
not yet because Google glass is an
explorer's program looking to develop
apps and while Google has expressly
discussed the ideas of privacy and the
concerns regarding that certainly seems
like it could open up to gaming or other
interesting applications as the next
year goes on is a $1,500 device right
now this is only meant and can only be
gotten by people who have signed up for
the explorers program or through
Google's hashtag campaign trying to win
a pair for themselves when the right to
purchase one and at that price it's
really not designed for consumer use in
the next year will these be something
different than what we see now or an
evolution who knows but what you're
doing now is you are getting that
projected screen interacting with a in
almost a video game-like way with a
combination of voice and touch there's a
touch pad over here a four-way touch pad
that you can use to scroll through menus
and talk to it and between that and a
bone conducting speaker in the back and
microphone you get an audio visual
depiction of what you want to see and
can browse to some extent through
content so it's a bit like a bluetooth
headset it's a bit like a SmartWatch and
it's a bit like something else entirely
different who knows what we'll see stay
tuned for a lot more coverage on cnet as
we look at this over the next week or so
I'm Scott Stein with the first look at
Google glass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
