tweets about it when the news broke
yesterday what happened the cake boss

think this guy's a terrible person I
don't know him personally do you seem to
be taking a lot of joy in this new I'm
only picking a little smile on your face
you never you won't see the smile before
after that's all it's not like this is
all self-inflicted so i can take joy in
it no because of the stupidity involved
I gah I can't I can't feel bad for
someone who drives drunk I could feel
bad for someone who's addicted to drugs
that could feel someone who's like got
mental issues or like problems with the
family but this is all self-inflicted so
it's like I have carte blanche to just
be like haha you asshole why this guy in
particular cuz I honestly don't even
know why I hate him anymore even hate
think I know I hated him I don't know
why I back to hoboken because his bakery
attracts the worst kind of people and
they all like infiltrate my town and
they they dirty up the streets with
their contacts and their their garbage
that they put everywhere with this a
bunch of Cake Boss boxes anywhere when
they're done we're and it's just like
and you you're like going down the train
you know who's going to the bakery I'm
like oh it's that way my god and I point
to the Hudson that way this keep on keep
walking and you'll find a 70 buck sonic

and his voice is terribly like he's like
a vapp allocate boss a lie back babe I
made a cake for the mayor is this could
have caused more people to show up I
don't think so and now he's a criminal

edible paper I think he'd make money on
it here's the best part of it all his
real name uh well he goes by buddy I
forget his real name uh where what's his
what's his freakin real Nate doesn't
matter is that Buddy Valastro right so
he's getting arrested and apparently
allegedly he's as he's getting
handcuffed and booked he yells out to
the cops you can't arrest me I'm the
Cake Boss that sounds like a Batman
villain oh yeah you'll never get away
with it habla Cake Boss hey here's a
deal he said that because he's supposed
to say that that's how silly this man is
he's is he's a caricature of himself I'm
the Cake Boss if I'm the cop I'm like
who gives a shit sir even more reason to
arrest yeah so you're the big boys now
we're gonna make an example out of let's
like tell you what when we put you in a
Cell will be like hey everybody do you

course get a freakin car man why are you

anything you have money they've got a
like a flagship um what Yuma call it
like memorabilia sort of crap store in
the base of the Port Authority Otis the
cake ball cake boss it's this guy must
be making money that we will never even
understand but he gets drunk and drives
in his car the criminal complaint
endangering the lives of innocent people
who don't need to be bothered hit on him
a BAC 0 point 0 9 percent New York is
point Oh
eight percent so he was just I'm over

couple hours yeah maybe I mean he
probably just jumped in his car shortly
after having a drink or some what I said
he was driving crazy right right yeah he
was formally they should not must be
more than our he totally she had a
couple of drinks well what does anybody
would anybody say that well I've had
like 12 yeah that were you gonna say

there's cake here it's not like if this
is a murder scene murder case if you're
gonna go in it's like you gotta go to
where he was arrested and go oh can we
buy a cake here might be surprised man
on tenth that they're going to Port
Authority the worst place on earth
that's pretty much all right you know
it's either that or Times Square worst
place imaginable but listen high school
you know was gonna be mulling around
like a budgets you know you don't go
there on purpose I don't I can't really
put my finger on it like why I'm so
against Pete like you know tourists
coming to hoboken mage and the thing
about is like his stores right when you
get into hoboken from the path so it's
like you don't even take in hoboken you
go three blocks you buy the cake you eat
it on a bench cuz that's what you do
these people do and you leave the town

perfect I needed um you can just hang on
the TV lounge just watch exact 65 inch
tvs the whole night yes of that one
moving back into the studio will set
forth a brand new sort of era for the
show where it goes into the future so
stay tuned to all that and um yeah it's
a very exciting time so we don't move
this table anymore no what a crazy idea
nope yeah we'll try and do like a tour
as my guess we couldn't the table if you
want to do now I way this table she
didn't want to just I mean we stole the
only reason is here cuz we stole it
where's it from it was from like the
first breaking ground of the
construction
they were this was in a room a couple
conference rooms you know down there and
I was like that looks like a good like
this till tea table I like this they
don't mess with the gravity here is it
like Star Trek know kind of a little bit
anyway um alright so that's that
congrats to the four winners of the
contest they've been in touch I don't
know if everyone wrote us back but
sounds like that's well on its way so
thanks and congrats those guys are call
duty next week we said that all right
time to get into the stories of the day
Oh caster Akhtar how about jeopardy
first I know if you want to talk about
let's do the first thing there will get
all the LSU have a list that I don't
have up ok that's why yeah alright so
there's this story ok this is exciting
it's on a list i see ok it is stupid
little earpiece you can put in your ear
called a bit bite it's on a kickstarter
right now and what it does is it can
actually tell what you're eating how
you're eating how you're chewing and the
idea is it's a nutrition thing so
there's a video of it you can see this
guy he's got this earpiece in and it can
detect what you're eating by its sound
waves you're eating an apple it can pick
it up it can figure out what you're
doing if track shear your eating habits
and if they notice that you have like a
ten o'clock eating habit it might
suggest a 930 you eat something else
this is in room this is real the bit
bite you can't hear an apple when you
get here now I can hear an apple in real
life black could be anything like a
potato what are you gonna eat that
sounds like an apple care hair you could
probably correct it in the app you know
well no no man no come on who are you to
put a diet monitoring thing in your ear
also it is it is a bluetooth earpiece so
if you wanted to make calls on it it's
got another function bit bite it's like
of course it's called the bit bite
that's what you call your your your
product I just wonder how picks up quiet
foods like cake yeah maybe forget e
what's up you that's a slur for sent you
no way I don't slurp when I it's gonna
like buzz you're like no improper for
would you understand like the dumb it
like
we've clearly already debunked it most
food is silent well it doesn't just do
it can actually detect the movement of
your jaw and come on what it can tell
you how often you're chewing I'm not
making this stuff up this is what they
claim in this little thing can do come
on your argument while incredibly valid
it is now I'm it's self-explanatory what
else is it supposed to do I think it's
just that it's just a nutrition buddy
just tells you hey don't eat that stuff
I don't think has a voice or anything
get everyone choose differently man what
if I'm chewing gum I don't know I think
you'll totally break it at that point I
have no idea what happens with gum this
is a really good question can't hear me
eating a donut you silently donuts I
don't it's not audible pretty sure it's
audible special they were like Jeff
sounds like you're having a donut maybe
cuz I'm just like do you want something
be able to smell what you're eating is
that what you're looking for it's just
not the way to do it what was that
product where you like point of laser at
it and I knew what it was like the
molecular composition I don't know yeah
yeah no idea no that's a real thing
that's a real thing you can buy so it
was a Kickstarter also it was that it
actually like coming to fruition think
it did it was like this bluetooth thing
there's like a little laser you put on
your keychain look it up I can't
remember it but look at us I'll you just
made it up I didn't these guys need for
bit by dennys sixty thousand dollars
with their goal they got 28 days left
they've got about almost 40,000 they're
gonna do it they're gonna do it I think
it's not bad I think I mean if you need
this thing in your ear to check like
you're eating too quickly or something I
mean that's simply a little usual I wish
them all the luck in the world get I
really do get in on this fed while you
can cuz it's it's ending because none of
this shit works there's there's no
there's nothing that proves that any
sort of fitness band or a pedometer or
whatever the hell is you got on your
wrist improves your overall well-being
there's no evidence there's no evidence
have you seen one independent study no
else I when we do it we don't we don't
say like oh our reviewer lost 30 pounds
in the course of a year using the mic
off band now cuz it's all unproven crap
we should try that though we suppliers
like a year was just say that a Graziano
he's a workout not right with a guy
injured now he's improv is freakin
Scotty can do damn thing he's off the
men he's back in it is on the men right
so he's off it now because on the man is
when you're healing he's off the men
he's not mending anymore okay I'll go
with this thanks but so he's back he's
gonna you know he I think he's starting
to review some of this wearable stuff
well fine if you lose 30 pounds it's
just right like how can you justify it
justifies I just want to see somebody
having all of these stupid things on the
earpiece like the 12 wristband right and
what else like that the one goes across
the chest for your heart writing know
that oh that's an old style yeah I know
that there's a really accurate go figure
you want an actual accurate when you
have to look like a fool cuz it was
cross your chest like I mean I get it I
know the ones that monitor your your
your resting heart bead in your active
or whatever it is like once you have all
that information and as well as the
device can do to present that
information to you in a useful manner
like what else can it do okay so I have
a I have one of these wearable things I
got the thing in my ear whatever I got
my heartbeat i know this i know that up
what do i do I have to start taking
prescription medication to lower my
blood pressure like is you know is it
help me correct any I think you're
worried about the apps but may look at
this this is effortless weight
management look at this lady she's she's
restless so as you so stressed she needs
the bit collage Donuts coming at her
face a problem this this is the you eat
healthier I me I'm telling you this is
gonna be what about drinks yeah what
about drinks arias filled with nothing
but quality questions they just got what
about drinks I'm having a milkshake
what's your sodas all day yeah he'll say
that I'm drinking water it'll be like I
can well if I drink water through a
straw I love all you guys asked me the
question says if I represent I have no
freakin idea why they're making this
stupid thing is your fault it is my
you're right I I decided you make my own
video brought the story to the show you
therefore represent that must be it no
like I can ever rag on something dumb no
but you're not allowed oh crap I've made
a human Arielle and I can do that
know your role I will enjoy wait i'm
supposed to enjoy things yeah see you
guys can dish it on them us a lovely not
connected okay magnifique that's a like
where this is going but here's a weird
story arm i was fascination with
jeopardy mostly with the interactions
that they do like that painful ass
little meanie interview that Trebek does
the column by is coming back from the
that like if if there was a hell right I
would imagine it would just be having to
watch jeopardy participant many
interviews but there are Alec sales
returns to give a shit about what sally
does in Oregon she doesn't excel one
does I hear you grow snow peas peas you
know how do you get this no pieces when
like you know if if I'm on Jeopardy I'm
gonna tell him some you know marginally
amazing about my life right be like
whatever it is I I wouldn't even know
what to do it never sounds as cool as I
think / underwhelming and they pick the
most mundane things to talk about you
know and anybody on Jeopardy got older
people it's just like they're like and
Richard it says here you took a plane to
get here what was that like it's crazy
it's crazy anyway you know at the end of
the show after Final Jeopardy there's
there's like a little huddle in check
back and uh and the three contagion runs
they sort of have this uh muted
conversation you're like wonder what it
is they're talking about yes I do wonder
this constantly well here is what it
sounds like at the end Jim what was your
daily double let you hit sorry what was
the Daily Double you hit the one I got
right was Brasilia the one got run was
spine it's fine yeah yeah I did should
have but Brazil I mean when I saw that
clue this morning said wrong how many
people know where the land is ya heard
of that that's not exactly something
that oh yeah London Paris warrant ville
em ah got to be in Asia it's gotta be
where who knows Alex Trebek so
holier-than-thou man you don't know all
this stuff all that dude does is act
like he knows all of the right answers
all the time right that is his job like
that but he's got the answers in
running yes questions in front of it I
love that correction i did i just wonder
how it however so stupid i call you a
bit you were thinking he's still trying
to feign interest in these people you
gotta imagine these people are like
South America but that was good so now I
don't know about the wagering if you had
been wrong she'd have won the game with
9100 really 9100 I don't know I would
have had more than double yeah I know
what never ends on the set of Jeopardy
at the end you feign interest these
people will never meet him again or
their torment they'll see him like what
five times in the course of a day five
in a row it just has to be like I guess
it says bleak and as boring as I feared
it would be well that's like I thought
maybe like have you guys seen Birdman
yet yeah exactly I got thought maybe be
something more entertaining but it's not
I don't say super boring because Alex
doesn't give a damn about these people
whether they live or die or survive the
episode yeah he's like what actually do
I know about these people i know that
you try to Daily Double you should go
more I paid attention to that yeah I
also remember the number that you you
what your wager was that's about it I
don't know anything about you but we're
gonna talk as if is we have to stand
here but it's such it's such a qward
banter I love it I think it maybe they
just all stayed there podiums yeah just
stare each other across the way just be
like you you I'm just glad he wasn't
telling them about like an overactive
prostate or something like that only one
video player this Creek my back I'm
pretty sure that would have been let out
somewhere yeah everything you might head
do a little TMI with these people uh I
don't know why this always happens uh
but we always kind of talk about this
one historical event that happened in
1986 the Challenger explosion new
information surrounding this horrific
day in space travel has come to light
and it's bizarre and it's awkward and
weird and will kind of perfect for our
show yes CBC News actually had this
profile on the guy who plays big burden
sorry to spoil that folks as a person
inside the suit Caroll Spinney spend 45
years as Big Bird's that's pretty cool
but in this like interview he has with
CBC's
morning st. John he explains how he was
offered a seat as big bird on challenger
in 1986 and a bid to get children more
interested in the NASA program when Star
Wars is all the rage and apparently
there wasn't enough room for the costume
because it's 8 feet tall so he had to
not go that's why Big Bird wasn't on the
Challenger is because he was too big
could you have any idea how screwed up
your childhood memories would be if you
saw Big Bird walking you know that that
platform over like the slow-motion
Armageddon thing right you're seeing
them do this and I guess I have his own
space suit is about an 8-foot spacesuit
on big bird going into this thing and
this thing blows up you're being told
the whole time like as it's launching
hey kids big birds on that big birds on
that hey kids you want to get into space
travelers on the day's travel is gonna
be fun big birds doing a that would have
changed a lot yeah it would have liked
you right we would have been able to be
on the show anymore right yes right
technically they would have made another
video questions it because they had mr.
Hooper's death yeah right mr. HYFR died
feels right continuity wouldn't have
allowed yeah exactly like in the episode
where bigger goes to space doesn't work
and it didn't work did it get back okay
it's like no no I did you see Oscar the
Grouch like morning morning I'm sorry
that would explain that should be like a
retcon explains why he's so grouchy he's
just like I don't know why I have such a
hard time yeah clearly can't laugh at it
cuz such it's just love it but the this
story is truly bizarre it says that we
were taping another episode of sesame
street at the time it went up and they
said the ship's about to take off so
we're going to punch the broadcast of
the take-off on to the monitors and that
in the set so we stopped working in
watch the monitors and when a blue when
we saw it blow up it was like my scalp
crawled says spinny that's miss them
that's gotta be I mean he's got to feel
lucky immunity it's akin to someone who
like was supposed to be on a plane on
911 yeah
is way weirder it's very sure the
circumstances who knew that big bird was
even invited that was the first thing
way you want to go into space sure are
you an astronaut no there's no yeah Big
Bird's center like a series of tests and
and and like you know equivalencies that
you have advice super physically fit to
go yes bae and mentally sound like i
would imagine space travel is among the
more mentally traumatising things i
would think a guy who dresses as an
8-foot bird is completely mentally sane
enough to handle anything spent half his
life inside of a inside of a fake bird
close the claustrophobia no issue that's
your crazy little kids all the time no
issue will know yeah we never heard of
Caroll Spinney punching in the face yet
drunk driving no I couldn't do it I've
thought about it go back and time ago
the Challenger no wasn't wasn't talking
about that specific time travel scenario
okay talk about like actually going into
space I do not believe I could handle it
I think the guy can handle this i think
i can handle it were like i'm in space
orbiting earth and looking down at my
home plan I just don't I i would go may
I would have space madness I think you'd
be fine I don't know man it depends on
the actual flight like if it's like the
address anyone can go up into space is
only a handful people talking on that to
make it more like more cynical totally
different like I couldn't be on Apollo
11 13 whatever it was you know the good
one the bad one that's who you should be
on those you know it being an astronaut
seems pretty rough i think i was
learning about it like oh by the way
when they have to pee they have catheter
something oh you know what that's that's
right there that forget it i don't care
about the explosion aspects I'm like I
don't want to do that least the least of
your problems know if I'm gonna go into
space I might as well just enjoy myself
Billy are you kidding why didn't you go
into space I as you have the after
didn't want to gather no although I
don't wanna go to jail uh that's just
that's crazy for me like uh I'm
terrified by like massive like massive
darkness I'm terrified of like uh uh
when I was on a cruise ship and I people
know this I went like on the deck at
night I'm just looking into the vastness
of the black ocean it's this
horrific feeling I get and I can't
imagine space being any more welcome
it's not like they gonna take you up
there doesn't energy like you I'll get
sucked yeah I in like there's an opener
just get out dis go check outside and
just like uh you know no oxygen to me I
gots important I freaks me out come on
no no no I'm right there with you man
paralyzed right on try the actual like
terrified like the Virgin Galactic stuff
that seems like its way simpler oh yeah
that worked out real well the other day
how many times is gonna happen I could
happen a couple times right apple with
plans it'll happen surest I'm in it for
the thrill of the launch in the same way
I'm i'm in it for like going a great
adventure okay on a six flags on a
roller coaster a minute for that once i
leave this planet not so sure i kinda
wanna see the the earth like that see
the curvature like that's what i'm
saying i couldn't pry wouldn't be able
to process it I would it would cause my
brain to turn to jelly and I just could
not deal with it how would that be
different than now yeah no not a job not
to mention the whole gravity thing I
nice to that I so better that it hit for
a couple decades it give me a while to
get used to it but I quite enjoyed I
want to try the vomit comet pretty
psyched about gravity pretty expensive
if I want fake if I want zero gravity
I'll do that skydiving simulator that
driver yeah dude uh-huh the simulator
don't don't smirk I don't actually gone
skydiving no go skydiving is way more
fun than assist in arrears I don't know
I just have no desire to do it and
that's also not like zero gravity
because you're getting like hit with air
right no yeah as opposed to just
floating around mm-hmm who's normally we
see people floating rather knockin can't
they do a thing with a with a standard
plane in like you know with the G yeah
the mama can they do that that I wanted
I would do that you'd do that yeah do
that okay I think they had the
mythbusters on there and that like just
stuff what were they busting I remember
okay moon landing all right i'll say
moon landing that's not fair what do you
mean I really happened how are you gonna
bust that myth they tried to if you want
the boring story they tried to recreate
it using film techniques they knew and
showed how was impossible to fake it
gosh that was the kid they
do I saw one that's pretty great there
you go not fake because the jury's been
out about that one uh all right again
McDonald's back on our radar not because
they've hired a mythbuster to man that I
still just like you the mcrib people
with that mcrib again yet would I would
about mcrib you what are you talking
about yeah well they had that I'm ahora
guy right yeah and and he had to go
around and basically prove to people
that this was food yeah like I think
you're in a bad situation you gotta
prove to everyone that what your
restaurant serves food mcdonalds in
particular is got a pretty good
reputation for having like really
bizarre kinds of food ingredients yeah
it's like oh yeah that that pink slime
that was this thing and that people
freak out about right like nah some pics
line so why are they back in the news
okay apparently McDonald is this is
another effort to get kids they wanna
get kids who are into health so what do
they do they made broccoli that tasted
like bubble gum okay apparently nobody
wanted to eat this it was a huge failure
test they wanted to see if kids would
get into this the CEO was defending it
like hey you know we were trying to give
people options so what we wanted to do
that's not that is not an option that is
a radical crazy idea that's not an
option an option is like with cheese or
without cheese not would you like this
broccoli to taste like bubble gum yes we
can do that why would you want to taste
like bubble gum in the first because
bubble gum is not something spoken
you're supposed to eat in the first book
drink please supposed to chew this thing
and then go wait if I swallow it
something bad happen mm-hmm got a bubble
gum so this is the wrong thing so if
you're gonna if you could have make it
taste like something make it something
you're supposed to eat yeah likely no
you want kids to eat it make it taste
like later we made we made these green
beans taste like toothpaste well yeah it
doesn't that's not a real easy does it
make sense to you it is still a
mouthwash milkshake you just spit it
right yeah I just love the idea that
they tried it and they may they were
successful in making broccoli bubble gum
have you ever seen like the food chemist
sort of process yeah they actually a
little bit eyedroppers yeah of stuff
like taste this piece of
this tastes like beer what's so weird
they're able to basically create any
taste known to man and the ingredients
that make up those tastes are almost
always never made up of what you think
they should spice that which is just
like cinnamon something else uh all
right it tastes like chicken i would but
i would still like yes we're making fun
of this and it's a it's a silly terrible
idea i still want to try it though it's
broccoli like that's good I like
broccoli right to me a weird mouthfeel
though yeah it's like a crunchy
bubblegum is not something all my do
unless is tops bubble tops bubblegum
things again with the baseball cards
bright is that a shatter and cut your
game yeah can you roofing in and never
liked the fact that that gum was just
pressed up against the last card in the
pack yeah it was open like it was a
separation is a good guy that's been
touching like my gum the whole time at
least I couldn't they just put maybe
just a thin piece of tissue pin it had
powder on it to keep it safe clearly it
was okay man you know this ages us
because there's a lot of strange candy
that we were privy to like the cigarette
gum that was awesome i love that was you
can blow the sugar out and it's think
about think about how effed up that as
you get that at kings plaza in brooklyn
yeah I but let me get get mad magazine
and candy cigarette that's what I would
buy so weird weekly what about big
league chew zest over Ali I think that's
a nice love that the pseudo tobacco yeah
exactly like I would just put such a
gigantic wat in my ex I ok then you you
know it up the bag later like there's
like half yeah and like a little smidge
of me I love uh um what was is the good
thick bubble tape bubbles a ya v bubble
gum did you ever just want you not to
take it out take it out and just take a
bite out of the damn thing I know yeah
that's uh that I gotta try that was just
the wrong way to do I really relates me
I know it's like if you think you are
hey man I was a trailblazer a good
person is like a I'm gonna try out this
tape okay i get it i would try to get
more tape anyway great let's just go
take it out like a like a pocket just a
goodbye to that while ruined is actually
i was no longer but we just pull the
tape anymore but yet concentric circles
uh what else what else is there those i
select a little orange juice oranges
containers they were little rocks of God
they still exist it tasted great for
like 10 seconds marine and that hit like
a lot more yeah I stopped that problem
with gum I go in and out of phases with
gum and if I get one that's just like
loses the flavor after five seconds I'm
like man it's 2014 you guys haven't
figured out gilman yeah they did that's
the point you want you to lose the taste
that's probably right cuz there's like
stride and that thing never loses taste
no they're not paying us but I've had it
it just doesn't ever end yeah that's
pretty good I'll me mail truck almost
choked on gum the other day that was fun
was it terrible i was exercising and
then i took a huge what's a worse way to
go being dressed as big bird dying in
the challengers fucking that's it
everyone know that is he joking on
stride gum me being big bird and then
dying on a spaceship that's a sad way to
go that's an epic ways i know that is
the wrong word how did Carol died people
would ask well he was dressed as big
bird going into space when it exploded
right that the Rockets look oh that's
crazy I did I as died well he was trying
to lose some weight he took a huge
inhale the gum lodge itself in his
throat and then he died found later with
his dogs licking him that is not the way
to die good bite in his ear it's I've
noticed you stopped chewing I've noticed
you stopped chewing and are you okay and
breathing are you here it sounds like
you're dead it's not like it's Clippy
