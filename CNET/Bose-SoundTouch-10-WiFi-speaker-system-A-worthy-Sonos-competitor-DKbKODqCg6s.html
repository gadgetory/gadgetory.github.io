and least expensive model in boses line
of Wi-Fi multi room speakers that now
all have bluetooth capabilities as well
at $200 the compact sound touch 10 which
comes in black or white competes with so
Knossos play one speaker and is similar
in size though the Bose is taller and
thinner like with Sonos you connect
sound touch speakers to your Wi-Fi
network and control operation via free
app that's available for Apple iOS and
Android devices while your phone or
tablet acts as a remote bose also
includes a small remote that mimics the
six preset buttons on top of the speaker
those presets can be mapped to playlists
from various music sources including
Spotify Pandora and deezer
as well as internet radio stations
though currently not apples beats music
service the only other thing missing
from the features list is an integrated
battery which would allow you to
untether the speaker from its AC adapter
bose has improved both the app and
software behind its Wi-Fi audio system
is now so Knossos most serious
competitor the wide range of speakers
and home theater systems that bear the
sound touch name and are able to
interconnect as part of a whole-house
multi-room audio system so how does this
compare to Sona cisplatin sounds quite
impressive is very strong in the
mid-range it's great with vocals in
acoustical material and as the
surprising amount of bass route size can
fill a small room with sound it's a
little more forward sounding than the
Sonos with a little treble push that
adds some clarity but can also be a
touch too edgy with certain tracks at
higher volumes the Sonos play:1 is a
little more forgiving and slightly
warmer speaker but both are excellent
for their size and this pose is one of
the best small Wi-Fi speakers we've
tested I'm David Carr Noy
