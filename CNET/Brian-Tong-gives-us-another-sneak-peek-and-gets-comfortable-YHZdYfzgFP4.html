southall oh my gosh guys oh we're at CES
aren't we okay okay let's see what we
got here okay guys CES 2013 I'm awake
I'm totally awake now that was a really
refreshing nap that i got from from
those sort of beds but check it out look
okay we're here in the south hall and in
the South Hall you have a lot of things
that you these aren't necessarily the
booths that have all the big bright TVs
or the you know all the set-top boxes a
lot of times you'll find smaller
manufacturers some big names no mobile
phones but case accessory companies and
even I've never knew serta beds had this
cool gel technology in it maybe I need
to get one but I it was clearly oh very
comfortable okay let's go let's go walk
down here so we're in the south all
right now there's two levels to the
South Hall there's an upstairs and a
downstairs so i'm going to show you kind
of just getting a feel of these smaller
boots that are setting up their still
pretty impressive but you know come on
let's be honest we're not going to see a
tree of laptops or wall of tvs so over
here spec they make cases for iphones
ipads honestly I kind of have some ties
with them from the past but they're
setting up their ball walls with all
those cases a lot of new stuff here
coming out here a lot of times when you
see these third-party case comes are
like why are they here at CES well
there's a lot of meetings that go on
behind the scenes where they're trying
to get their products into stores like
the big best buys frys electronics oces
does a lot for companies like that okay
so let's just keep on walking and you
know Charlie will just kind of scan
around and just show you what this whole
area looks like we're right in the
center pathway of the South all right
now so let's just some let's keep on
walking I know you won't always see like
the most exciting stuff but let's just
keep on going to see what happens here
alright tp-link we have a lot of
broadband wireless routers here I feel
like the theme of CES this year is a lot
of booths decided to go really bright
with the white coloring you'll see that
a lot all over the place but we have
some of their routers their Wi-Fi little
mobile link devices here just kind of
showcase in the center but these are
some of the things that you can come and
check out here all right and then GPS I
know GPS devices are really now in
everything but garmin still makes their
own unit so what we have here they're
setting up their booth still but we have
some of their devices here that they're
promoting like their prestige series
here also a little portable that their
new e-series here the 2013 new be with
our garmin interface I mean these are i
use garmin all the time when I'm on like
road trips I don't always use my phone
when I'm on road trips but garmin's you
know they hold it down they do their
thing so this is just kind of a preview
of their booth and also sometimes I
think what you see here in the South
Hall more than you do in onion any other
halls is if you look over here that this
garment sign you have two story booths
right down down in the lower levels
they're just big boost but here you have
two story booths so they can have a lot
of meetings a lot of schmoozing drinks
food all the above okay so going to keep
on walking down through here in this
area you can kind of just get a sense of
in the South Hall there because they
don't have as big of products or object
to set up I mean these are smaller boobs
with a lot of different smaller
accessories so you feel like wow the
central hall is already set up but over
here they're still working on getting
everything together so what's up guys
are you doing can I come over here and
talk to you real quick so how many years
have you been setting up and working
here at CES 15 years 15 years so um how
is just setting up the booth for you I
mean is a grueling are you all right
with it with a good with it yeah let's
see how good look at let's check out
these let's see how oh what did you see
those guns oh man see you just wanted to
flex for us alright guys keep it up
thanks appreciate it alright so you know
we have a lot of workers here that are
working hard sometimes I haven't found
one yet but there's this classic shot up
like the guy bending over on the ground
with his butt
you know we're gonna look for that we're
gonna look for that for you all right
specifically Bonnie our executive reser
she wants to see that I know you do okay
so going to keep on walking down here
just to give you a little more sense of
the South Hall you know there's not as
much big screen right stuff but again
you'll see a lot of more accessory case
we're gonna try and keep on making it
all the way down to the nvidia booth
they won't necessarily have much a show
right now because they're still setting
up what if you guys saw the nvidia press
conference that happened yesterday there
are a lot of cool things that they did
there with you know their their shield
project which is kind of their mobile
platform which it has like almost looks
like an xbox controller with a mini
screen on it they also talked about
getting their Tegra 4 processors into
new phones coming soon but they're still
weren't any actual phones that they
talked about and I also want to tell you
guys we're walking and talking the same
time you see how I'm walking in reverse
and I'm not even looking behind me I
have eyes on my head I'll see you okay
so just take a look here this is I like
the fact that this is like a more
original green colored booth because the
lighting and everything it looks a
little different but again this is in
video showcasing right there video card
technology that they have not only in
laptops but also television the set-top
boxes and then even in card interfaces
that we're going to check out a little
later so you know guys there's a little
look at the South Hall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
