dollar hairstyling kit is Dyson's answer
to achieving professional-looking
salon-quality hair at home as you'd
expect from dyson the packaging and the
products themselves are absolutely
gorgeous you get this nice tan case with
a felt interior to protect the product
and all of its various accessories the
wand here is it's just a single wand and
all of these different attachments
actually connect to it so it's really
easy and efficient so this is the dryer
you have a couple different curling
barrels for different size curls you can
have three different brushes these two
are more for straightening and this one
here is for cooling so you get a lot of
stuff in here all for a very high price
though the main selling point here is
that the air app uses lower heat and the
wands internal airflow to style your
hair more efficiently you're supposed to
start with the pre styling dryer which
takes your hair from out of the shower
wet to damp and then you're ready to
enlist one of the other attachments
there are two different curling barrels
a 1.2 inch version for tighter curls and
a 1.6 inch model for looser curls and
waves Dyson gives you 2 of each curling
barrel because the air flowing from the
wand
blows out from the curling barrels and
automatically wraps your hair around it
you need both because they wrap in
different directions this is an
intriguing concept but the barrels and
the wands integrated air flow effect
didn't always do a good job grabbing my
hair as someone with layered hair the
air app regularly grabs some hair and
mist other pieces resulting in an odd
uneven curl I regularly had to redo
I also found I had to use less hair than
I usually would the other tools like the
firm smoothing brush did in fact smooth
my thick wavy hair but it still had some
waves and texture so don't expect it to
actually straighten your hair like a
traditional high heat straightener in
some ways the air wrap delivers with its
attractive easy to swap attachments but
it's so what's so expensive and not all
of the attachments are useful even the
ones designed more for my hair type took
more work than
I expected I would definitely not run
out to get this thing instead ask if you
can test it out in the store ahead of
time before you buy because I don't
think it's worth it for most
