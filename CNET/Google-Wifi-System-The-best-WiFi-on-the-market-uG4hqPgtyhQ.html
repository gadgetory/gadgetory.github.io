get straight the point here this is for
now the best Wi-Fi system on the market
but first it's a system because it comes
with three identical unit you can use
any of these here as a first unit to
connect to your broadband modem and even
work like a normal router can cover
about twelve to fifteen hundred square
feet of Wi-Fi but then if you put this
two away from the first one they can
create a mess network that cover up to
five thousand square feet and by the way
if you happen to have the google onhub
which i do right here after an upgrade
the unhappy can also work with the
Google Wi-Fi like any of these unit
right here
ok now let's find out why the Google
Wi-Fi is the best first is the price you
can get three unit for just $299 if you
want just one unit one twenty nine now
for comparison the arrow here which is
very similar cause $4.99 for three units
and one nine I for just one unit second
is very easy to use as long as you have
a smartphone or a tablet and a Google
account the Google Wi-Fi app will help
you set up and manage anti-system vof
you tap the app can also help you
determine if you put the extender unit
at the good distant from the first
priority to make sure you have the best
coverage and performance and find the
performance the Google Wi-Fi actually it
was really fast for a system that
supports just the AC 1200 Wi-Fi standard
in my testing has the top sustained
Wi-Fi speed of almost 500 megabit per
second now obviously the further away
the slow of the speed gets especially
when the signal has to have from wanting
it to another but as long as your
internet speed is 200 megabit per second
or less this thing can deliver it in
full by the way the Google Wi-Fi app is
the only way for you to set up and
manage anti-system there's no other
option for it and before you can use it
you have to login to Google account
first
so yes the Google Wi-Fi system is
connected to Google at all time but and
we are already well if you think you're
not getting this we make sure that you
are keep the in mind but in return you
can manage your home system even when
you're away we cool feature like pausing
the internet for a group of devices
just put them into one group and tap one
to pass tap another one to unpause or
set a timer this is a great feature if
you want to make you kids your wife your
girlfriend or all of them in the same
time to pay you full attention and you
can do that with your voice too using
the Google home or the Amazon
Alexa I will show you that but the turn
out all of those female virtual
assistant you know katana Siri Google
assistant none of them can understand
the words that come out for my mouth I'm
just too sophisticated and that's
because I'm don't go and this is the
Google Wi-Fi system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
