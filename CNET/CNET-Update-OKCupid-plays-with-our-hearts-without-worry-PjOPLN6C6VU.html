hearts I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that update let's talk about
love the dating website okay cupid is
stirring up some controversy with a
little experiment it performed on its
users to see how much compatibility
tests matter it told people who were
thirty percent compatible that they were
actually a hot match turns out when
you're told you're a good match even if
you aren't you're almost twice as
willing to have a conversation with that
person OkCupid also tested the opposite
and told users that were a great match
that they were only thirty percent
compatible now some folks were
influenced and less willing to talk but
many still ended up having a
conversation so although it's good to be
a match it helps to be told you're a
match this is a fascinating experiment
but the way it was done was questionable
these folks didn't agree to be part of
an experiment unless you count agreed to
some vague legal statement in the data
use policy some say messing with human
emotions in secret is unethical OkCupid
often does light-hearted reports that
poll users and study how the site's
being used but this is a dating site
that doesn't take itself too seriously
but Toyne with love and emotions with
false match results falls into a
different uncomfortable category let's
back up to see the bigger picture here
okay Cupid's co-founder Christian rudder
says this experiment was done in the
quest to improve the services
matchmaking algorithm and that people
were later made aware of their actual
matches but the time is interesting he's
also promoting a new book in an email
rudder told me that out of the 1.2
million users that logged into okcupid
when this study was announced the site
only received two complaints from users
so we have to ask ourselves if okcupid
users aren't that upset well other
websites look at this example and also
try to get away with conducting similar
mind games warping the information we
see they say you can't believe
everything you read on the internet but
maybe we need to update that thought you
can't always trust what you read on the
internet because you could be part of an
experiment Facebook got heat recently
for a similar reason emotionally
manipulating users in the name of
science but Facebook will find a new way
to annoy some users this week it has
begun the process of forcing everyone to
download the messenger app to hold
private conversations users who have not
downloaded this separate messenger app
are getting emails nudging them that
soon the main Facebook Apple no longer
let you have private messages that's
your tech news update and you may have
noticed our set background is different
this will be my temporary home for a
while while our old studio is under
construction but in the meantime you're
still getting the same update flavor
just in a new limited edition package
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
