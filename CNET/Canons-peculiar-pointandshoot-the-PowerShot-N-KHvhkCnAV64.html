and this is a look at canons attempt to
stir things up in its point-and-shoot
lineup the power shot end it's
essentially one of canons ultra compact
elf cameras but it's been pared down to
just a lens and a screen the lens is an
8 X zoom that's controlled with this
ring right here the camera shutter
release is just right in front of that
just pressed down or up on it and it'll
snap a shot the 2.8 inch touchscreen on
back can also be used to take shots and
you can tip the screen up 90 degrees so
you can shoot below your eye line or
overhead since it has a sensor in it
that will write the picture when you
turn the camera upside down of course
with a camera this small there's not a
lot of room to hold on to it and the few
buttons that it does have are miniscule
it also uses a tiny battery pack that
doesn't last all that long and you'll
need a micro SD card for storage to go
along with the new design Canon added a
new mobile device connect button which
helps simplify connecting to iOS or
Android devices with the cameras
built-in Wi-Fi then there's the new
creative shot mode which takes a shot
analyzes the subject and then creates
five additional versions of the photo
with crops colours and filters photo
quality and performance are very good
though it's a little on the slow side
for pictures of kids and pets basically
if you're looking for something small to
supplement your smartphone photography
the Parishad and is a fine choice as
long as you don't mind the size and
controls
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the canon
