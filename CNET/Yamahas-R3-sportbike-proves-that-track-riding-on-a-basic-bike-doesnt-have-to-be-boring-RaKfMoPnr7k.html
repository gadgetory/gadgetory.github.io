have more than doubled over the past
five years thanks largely to the
successes of bikes like Kawasaki Ninja
250 and Ninja 300 Yamaha is finally
getting in the game for the release of
this the Yamaha r3 it's built around a
brand new 320 cc engine that gives you
the slight displacement advantage over
the competition Yamaha is not quoting a
power figure for the bike but figure is
going to be a little bit higher than
that of the Kawasaki or the Honda
competition somewhere around 30
horsepower no that's not a lot of power
but certainly it's more fun to ride a
slope bike fast and a fast bike slow the
most impressive thing about this motor
is how smooth it is doesn't bog when
it's down low and it doesn't get all
buzzy up high with the 12,500 rpm rev
limit that's an important thing you have
a high rate sit at 56 miles per gallon
we saw 52 and some spirited track riding
ultimately you can probably do
considerably better than that if you're
a little bit more judicious with your
right wrist we had a lot of fun out in
the street let's take on the track and
see how it does all right let's take you
for a lap around the west course here at
Thunderhill Raceway Park really tight
twisty circuit which is perfect for this
little Yamaha r3
we're just breaking through 80 miles an
hour in the front straight about all you
can expect out of a bike this size it's
not very quick but this course is not
about top speed it's all about handling
and despite the budget suspension on
this thing actually does a pretty good
job the brakes are also budget units
just a 2 piston caliper with a single
disc upfront the feel is not very good
but the performance is more than
adequate haven't noticed any brake fade
on this and I've been riding on this guy
for a while now very nimble as we go
through these s's very quick to shooting
direction that's coming from a bigger
bike it feels almost too quick took me a
while to get used to how quickly this
thing drops into the turn it wants to
turn tighter and tighter you almost have
to stand it back up again but it's a lot
of fun all right
tricky part is course you think you want
to go straight but you actually have to
go right
two more hairpins Oh me down and the
second one and we're back in the front
straight I'm going to say well you won't
be breaking any lap records with this
thing it's a pretty good track toy the
suspension is non adjustable in pretty
basic but does an alright job out there
and it's pretty compliant on the street
to the dashboard is quite comprehensive
see we've got a fuel gauge on there
overall it's not as quick as this big
brother the are one of course but at
four thousand nine hundred ninety
dollars it's pretty good value for money
I'm Tim Stevens with CNET and this is
