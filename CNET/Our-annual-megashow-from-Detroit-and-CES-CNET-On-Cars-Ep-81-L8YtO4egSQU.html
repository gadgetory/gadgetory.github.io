self-driving car is this the best EV for
the average driver and we could be at
the end of the era of the cracked
windshield it's time to check the tap PC
cars differently you love them on the
road and under the hood but also check
the tech and are known for telling it
like it is ugly is included at no extra
cost the good the bad the bottom line
this is cnet on cars welcome to cnet on
cars to show all about high-tech cars
and modern driving I'm Brian Cooley and
this is our annual special edition
coming to you from the Detroit Auto Show
and also rounding up my favorite pics
from the just-concluded consumer
electronics show in las vegas which is
also a pretty darn good auto show we're
gonna start here at Detroit though which
is where we came to launch our major new
Auto website if you haven't already
heard about it roadshow and you can find
it at the roadshow calm scene that's
never gone so deep into automotive I
think you're going to love it you will
still find cnet on cars at cnet on
cars.com and our content will be showing
up in rhode show as well so you can't
miss us now let's get right down to it
here at Detroit ok this is my pick of
the show not the most audacious car not
some supercar it's the new Mercedes
e-class this will be their biggest
announcement of 2016 for reasons why
this car is so important first of all
it's got advanced driver assist up to 80
miles an hour it'll maintain your lane
it'll also maintain your speed through
braking acceleration it'll even do
automatic lane changes something only
Tesla really have on the market until
now it's also got self parking outside
the car you use an app on your phone to
tell the car where to park that's pretty
advanced stuff as well inside look at
the LCD screens two of them as we've
seen in the s-class before but this one
is under one piece of glass to give it a
feeling of almost one super wide band of
interface and for the first time
Mercedes lets you choose different looks
for their instrument panel that's new
for them as well and finally a little
more ethereal is the idea of this being
the first production car with car 2x
communication that means it
can talk to other cars or up to servers
in the cloud initially that means that
these 17 es will talk to a mercedes
server to relay things that they've
learned with their sensors about road
conditions and that can be shared back
down from the cloud to other 17 ease
that have that technology it's very
narrow right now but it's a building
block for some big stuff in the future
now part of what they want to do here
with all this high technology and some
really nice lines kind of s-class like
is to lower the average age of the
buyers of these cars the e-class buyers
are on 55 years old average they'd love
to get that down to get more generations
of car buying out of that person arrived
summer of 2016 now as we flew her to
Detroit from Las Vegas and CES we knew
there was going to be a new e-class
coming I can't quite say the same for
what Lexus unwrapped here Alex Coy's got
the story of a car that perhaps for the
first time challenges Mercedes vaunted
SL head-on Lexus has pulled a blinder by
bringing this the LC 500 to Detroit now
it may look like a concept car but it is
actually a real car it's got wing
mirrors and doors and everything now its
power comes from a naturally aspirated 5
liter v10 with 467 horsepower and 390
eight pound foot Lexus says it's good
for nought to 60 in 4.5 seconds and that
gets the road thanks to a new 10 speed
transmission legs has also said that
it's actually stiffer than the LFA
supercar thanks to use of materials like
carbon fiber reinforced plastic aluminum
and super strength steel lexus is aiming
for some serious performance here the
car shop with Michelin Pilot Super
Sports and it said it's been tripled the
amounts of time developing steering feel
and handling than it usually does now
the interior looks stunning it's
absolutely beautiful almost as beautiful
as the exterior that screens everywhere
so you'll have all the information you
possibly need at your fingertips what's
heartening here is that this isn't the
porsche 911 fighter that you think it is
instead it's gone for luxury speedy
luxury but it's more looking at things
like the Mercedes s-class coupe a and
the BMW 6 Series
what Nexus is created with this is a
halo car a proper halo car but one that
the likes of you and I might one day be
able to afford the LFA you could look
but you couldn't touch once you figured
out how to get one well chances are it
was gone this though one day you'll be
able to walk up to a dealership and
exchange money for the keys to one of
these I can't wait it is beautiful
okay I brought you here to Christ or to
go a completely different direction to
the new minivan they just rolled out
this is the pacifica it replaces the
town and country this is a big deal from
the company that invented the minivan
this is a very different animal I think
the styling I'll be honest I was quoted
here saying it's a hot minivan I'll
stand by that it looks great they've
done some nice sculpting to get more of
a crossover look and look what they've
done with that rear back of the glass
and the deep pillar they gave it a nice
look that is more than just a box on
wheels this is an interesting vehicle
because it has 20s as one of its wheel
and tire options independent rear
suspension it's got a nice stance as
minivans go they want you to think
differently about the outside inside no
Android auto or apple carplay just yet
they'll get that in the next version of
you connect there are children screens
though in the rear including a are we
there yet map that's kind of cartoony to
keep them engaged now walk on the side
of this vehicle wag your foot under its
edge and the side doors will open
automatically that's a trick we've seen
in tailgates before but never before in
a minivan they've also got automatic
parking on this one inside while you're
still at the wheel for both parallel and
perpendicular spots now the big news
here on the powertrain is they're going
to offer the first-ever me man that is a
plug-in hybrid that guy will get 30
miles of electric running and 80 mpge
it's expected then of course the
standard gas v6 gets a little tweak to
get to 22 28 mpg if you get the plug-in
hybrid you lose the cool flip down flat
stow stow and go seats because the
batteries have to go in the wells that
those use so the second row become
traditional lift out seat watch your
lumbar the IC eversion internal
combustion engine goes on sale spring
early summer and then later in the year
we'll get the plug-in hybrid but they're
both coming up calendar 2016 now as you
may know most of us are carrying a
corning product called gorilla glass on
the front of our phones but as antuan
goodwin found out here at detroit's you
soon may be sitting behind it when
you're on the road and here are the
reasons why that will be very
interesting
so what's interesting about Gorilla
Glass is that there are three real cool
things about it for starters it is
stronger and more shatter resistant
we'll get to that later it's also about
thirty percent lighter in a car that
we're using a gorilla glass windshield
you can save about 10 pounds of weight
and that's going to save you a little
bit of fuel as you search for optimal
efficiency it's also a little bit
optically clear a regular glass has sort
of a greenish tint the gorilla glass is
a closer to a pure optical white we look
through it now in order to demonstrate
how strong guerrilla glasses we sort of
set up a couple of examples here first
we've got the standards soda lime glass
that sort of in the car that you have
right now but take it and I smash it it
does what you expect it's going to do
and it shatters we've got a nice spider
pattern there the next sample we have is
the strength and soda lime this is what
a lot of automakers are calling
strengthened windshield glass it's
supposed to be stronger than the
standard stuff if I take it in smash it
well pretty much the same thing happened
you get a spider web pattern and it
smashes predictably now we've got the
gorilla glass sample now all three of
these samples are the same thickness 1.1
millimeters another take it and put it
down on the pad and smash the crap out
of it and it's not shattered at all
those little divots you see are actually
in the plastic sheath it's really strong
we've also got two samples of windshield
material here is the conventional
windshield material here is the gorilla
glass they're both really strong but the
gorilla glass is a whole lot lighter and
if you look at the profiles you see that
it's also a whole lot thinner and here
we've got the actual what's known as the
gorilla glass layer this is what adds
strength pneus to gorilla glass you can
see that this is where the actual impact
sort of gets absorbed and spread out
through the material so the reason
Gorilla Glass is strong is this very
thin layer material right here it's
pretty cool and very clear now to
demonstrate exactly how strong this
glass is in the real world corning set
up this demonstrator right here where
they're going to do with spire a
hailstone a little bit larger than a
golf ball at this piece of Gorilla Glass
that about 50 miles per hour to simulate
what happens if you get hit by the hail
stone from hell while you're on the road
I'm gonna stand on the other side and
hope I don't damage anything
now before I walk you over to the
carmaker they just want our vehicle of
the Year award let me give you a few
quick notes on things that caught my eye
the Chevy bolt came here from CES with
some further updates like a fast DC
charger that'll give it 90 miles of
range in 30 minutes and cabin
customization based on you just carrying
your smartphone everything in the cabin
will remember you and customize itself
instantly Lincoln's continental arrived
in full production form a 400 horsepower
v6 a new seat with variable five
supports sync 3 and Android auto and car
play and they've moved away from THX
audio which I love to rebel audio the
new Infiniti q60 replaces what you
recall fondly as the g35 and g37 coupe
that left two three liter twin-turbo v6
s and a 2-liter turbo core they've
gotten from Daimler all with a 7-speed
automatic and infinities edgy
steer-by-wire view it once again stole
the show with the prettiest car here the
avista concept but unless they can bring
it to showrooms intact it won't matter
going into production they shows the new
compact crossover the envision truly a
brother from another mother in terms of
styling
we brought you an early peek at the
volvo xc90 some months ago I took you to
Los Angeles for an early taste of that
and here at the detroit auto show it
just won our first annual roadshow award
the shift award for the best vehicle of
the year impressive now let's meet its
sibling that's this guy right here this
is the volvo s90 sharing a lot of
technology with the XC but as you can
see a beautiful looking sedan going
after BMW 5 and how da 6 for example a
few notable things is the very large
immersive census connect display in the
console that's relatively new for Volvo
Android auto and car play going to be in
there they're really embracing it here's
what's really interesting they've got
advanced driver assist being able to
maintain your lane and your speed almost
completely up to at 80 miles per hour
and you got to stay engaged with your
hands on the wheel that's almost more of
a policy decision than a technology
requirement but so be it and that
advanced driver assist will be standard
on all s 90s no one else has ever done
that in the US market under the hood
fascinating three engines all of them
two liter four cylinders little bitty
guys the base one is a turbocharged
engine the next one up is turbo and
supercharger and the next one on top of
that adds electric motor so you work
your way up with how many layers of
boost you want to add to that small
motor the top engine by the way with
electrification gets over 400 horsepower
this is going to be no slouch
when we come back I'll take you to
another auto show that doesn't even have
auto in its name my car tech pics from
the consumer electronics show that just
concluded in Las Vegas when cnet on cars
returns
welcome back to cnet on cars I'm Brian
Cooley it's our annual special bringing
you the best of two mega shows the north
american international auto show where i
am right now in detroit as well as the
just-concluded consumer electronics show
from Las Vegas and we turn there now I
just mentioned we had a few new
announcements about the chevy volt
electric car here in Detroit but we
actually got a deeper drink in Las Vegas
Tim Stevens got an early ride and drive
check it out before electric cars really
revolutionize the market they need to be
two things cheap and practical a lot of
people have been waiting for tesla dope
crack that nut with the model 3 but
Chevy's about to beat them to the punch
with this it's the new bolt it has a 200
mile range we got to drive it I'm going
to start with an acceleration tests the
car will do zero to 60 in under seven
seconds and it's pretty good that's
certainly on par with pretty much any
other small economy car that you'd
expect in the segment Sam the car is
very nice and roomy flat floor as well
which makes getting from the lesson of
the car to the right side nice and easy
which given the partnership will lift
you can see being a good thing dropping
off a test means of God's wish I the
curb you're on you can adjust the
regenerative braking here by shifting
into low which means that the car will
allow one pedal driving meaning you
don't have to worry about using the
brakes too often it'll mean that the
brakes will last longer they'll also
mean you can go longer on a charge which
is good of course we're talking about
200 miles to a charge but of course
that'll depend on your driving
characteristics how have you are on that
right pedal inside the bolt we have a
customized version of chevys modeling
system which is completely different
than what we've seen in any other cars
it's actually quite customizable and it
looks a lot like Android as a matter of
fact you can actually choose a variety
of different layouts you can even do a
custom layout pick whichever widgets
that you want to these will then be tied
back to the driver profile so as you get
in the car remember who you are and show
you the appropriate things will even
remember what you were listening to when
you got out last time and being an EV of
course the car gives you plenty of
information about all the electricity
and where it's going in the car how
you're using it you can also get
information about you were driving
economy and also factors that will
impact your range things like terrain
and temperature basically things will
help you to have optimized the amount of
distance that you can get out of your
battery panel also some other nice
features in here like an LCD dashboard
and a pretty cool mirror that actually
uses a camera to see behind you instead
of just optics like the Model S the bolt
has its battery pack situated down low
in the floral this has a lot of
advantages one being handling it will
help the car to corner better but it
also means you get a lot more room
inside a nice flat floor Chevy isn't
giving us a formal price for the car
this is just a pre-production model
which explains why these headlights are
a little bit ugly and why there's lots
of vinyl everywhere but again they're
saying the price will be under thirty
thousand dollars after the federal tax
rebate and it will have over 200 miles
for the formal numbers we're going to
wait a little bit longer but for my
first time behind the wheel it's pretty
impressive little car by the way almost
the entire power train for that Chevy
bolt Tim just drove is made by LG the
electric motor the battery the inverter
that converts electricity for the motor
the control electronics and at CES
Samsung just announced they're making a
major push to grow their automotive
components business parts you won't see
but will be in the underpinnings of
vehicles if you wonder why we always tie
CES and auto shows together in the same
breath I think you see why now
now Toyota did not announce any new cars
here although that's not unheard of at
CES instead they announced a massive
investment in figuring out the real hard
work of the future of self-driving cars
a billion dollar investment in the
Toyota Research Institute was their most
recent news in partnership with MIT and
Stanford University to showcase that
they brought up the new CEO of that unit
Gill Pratt a guy really well-known i
think legendary is not unfair for his
leadership of the recent DARPA
autonomous vehicle challenges and his
theme was all about the fact that we've
done a lot of work in autonomous car
development but so far not really the
hard work that lies ahead so today I'd
like to tell you a little bit more about
what we are going to do with the billion
dollars we are going to have for initial
mandates number one we want to enhance
the safety of automobiles with the
ultimate goal of creating a car that is
incapable of causing a crash regardless
of the skill or the condition of the
driver number two we want to increase
access to cars to those who cannot
otherwise drive this includes people
with special needs and seniors that's
the area where we need full autonomy as
opposed to driver assist and stopping
accidents from happening number three we
are going to translate Toyota's
incredible expertise in creating
products for outdoor mobility like cars
and trucks into products for indoor
mobility finally we hope to accelerate
scientific discovery by applying the
techniques from artificial intelligence
and machine learning to other areas of
scientific discovery now beyond those
partnerships with MIT and Stanford
toward autonomy Toyota made another and
frankly more surprising announcement
here that they are going to partner with
one of their competitors to work on the
next generation of apps and infotainment
connectivity in their cars let's go see
who it is so here i am at ford talking
about toyota because toyota and ford of
announced are going to work together and
toyota is going to use the sdl smart
device link technology that is one of
the underlying components of ford's sync
3 and use that in toyota vehicles now
this is notable because you have two
very
competitors working together and one
using the other ones technology that
doesn't happen very often but I think it
gives you an idea how much toyota will
look even within its competitive set for
a hedge against another competitive set
namely apples carplay and google's
android auto there's a friction there a
lot of car makers have a very nervous
relationship with those two they want to
put them in the dash because we want
those sorts of systems to go with our
phones but at the same time they don't
want to go up too much valuable
connection to the consumer to these two
mobile and otherwise Silicon Valley
oriented companies now another
interesting angle to this is Ford also
announced that they have Android auto
and car play coming to their platform
sync three starting later this year on
ford escape and there will be a bit of a
retrofit program for your late model
escape to also have that added to it
retro actively
now as you may know I'm a big fan of
connecting smart home smart cars and
wearables down the road those just need
to all talk to each other a fair amount
of that pie has been sliced up by Ford
here at CES as they have announced
something really interesting working
with the Amazon echo by later in 2016
some ford and lincoln vehicles will be
able to integrate the alexa spoken word
technology alexa how many tablespoons
are in three fourths cup three fourths
cups is 12 tablespoons Alexa turn on the
lights that means you can be in your
house issue a voice command to your car
like car start now as you're about to go
to work get it warmed up and on your way
home you're a few blocks away you might
go to your dash and use the same
technology Alexa turn on the heater or
the lights raise the garage door this is
an interesting amalgam of technology
that isn't all just coming from for
they're working with a partner who's got
kind of a sleeper hit the echo sort of
came out of nowhere from being a goofy
gimmick last year to suddenly having
some real cred in the smart home
integration space ford also announced
their formal major push to put 4G LTE
embedded in many of their future car
something Audi pioneered a year or two
ago also $100,000 prize competition of
the team that can figure out the best
communications platform between Ford
f-150 pickups and DJ I drones to be used
by search and rescue crews and have good
communication between both those
vehicles BMW showed us some interesting
new tricks with mirrors or the lack
thereof at CES moving finally two
cameras and displays instead little
stubs remain on the outside of the doors
in their concepts but much smaller and
giving a three percent improvement in
aerodynamics which leads to a one
percent improvement in vehicle range on
a car like an i8 inside camera fusion is
conducted so the rear view becomes an
LCD display in backup mode it's much
better than the block mirror view you
have today when driving forward you get
almost a video game view of your own car
in real time no more blind spots in any
case and because these cams run through
a computer it can analyze motion alerts
about objects or cars that are closing
on you or that you're closing on
the MW thinks this might actually be
doable in showrooms by 2017 with
government approval and at CES BMW also
showed us their next steps into advanced
gesture command some that they just
debuted on the new 7 Series and they've
got gen 2 on the way Wayne Cunningham
takes a look the BMW i3 already has self
parking technology but you have to be in
the car to do it now at CES BMW is
showing gesture controlled parking with
an Apple watch when you're outside the
car to activate it I shake my wrist and
then I just sweep it away
but let's take a look at some other
gesture control technology that BMW has
here at CES now I'm sitting in the BMW I
vision future interaction concept car
which uses the air gesture technology
that BMW announced here at CES so with
air gesture I have sensors along the
dashboard here that can read where my
hand is and I've got a big screen up
here for my infotainment interface so if
I wave my hand across I can choose from
navigation media communication smart
home and I can choose sub venues in each
so if i go to communication and look for
my contacts i can press a button on the
steering wheel and open up a submenu of
contacts then i can wave my hand around
to choose the person i want to talk to
and once I find one I can push a button
here on the steering wheel again to
initiate that phone call BMW already has
some simplified gesture control in the
new 7 series but this air gesture
concept takes it a step further this is
something we could see in the future
that could actually eliminate a lot of
buttons and dials that we see in cars
today
so we think of autonomous technology
coming from mostly high-dollar makers
you expected at a high-end Mercedes BMW
or Tesla but here we are at kia where
they've made a big announcement of a new
sub-brand of technology within the kia
car brand called drive wise and they
have several milestones partial
autonomous cars in showrooms by 2020
full autonomous Kia's in showrooms by
2030 nakia is talking about five
particular behaviors that they're
working on right now and testing them
here in Nevada where they're pretty
liberal about licensing self-driving car
testing one is automatic valet parking
looking forward to that automatic
highway driving automatic urban driving
automatic car follow different than
adaptive cruise control this is for cars
to follow where there may be no or poor
quality lane lines and auto stop if they
detect that you our drowsy or you fall
into sleep the car could guide itself
safely to the side of the road and stop
avoiding a nasty action
let's be honest there is no hotter spot
on the CES show floor than here at
Farraday future this is their first
concept car the faraday future concept
01 the idea here is to have an audacious
start for a new car company that has
been widely talked about it now for the
first time tangibly seen this is an
electric race car don't worry this is
not their idea of a practical vehicle
1000 horsepower spread out to four
wheels around each corner a single seat
turns out 45-degree lean back isn't just
for homies NASA told them that's
actually the ideal performance position
as well it's got plumbing for air and
water into an advanced race helmet this
thing's extreme all over under the skin
it's got a variable platform
architecture that means they can almost
like a fancy Lego set dock and undock
components to get different wheelbases
which is the most defining single
characteristic of what kind of a car you
make in the future now we start here a
billion dollar factory coming to North
Las Vegas not far from here imminently
in the next couple of years and then
we'll see what they've got for the
average folks we're not driving
supercars most of us but there's some
interesting thinking going on here
thanks for joining us from the two best
auto shows in the world they happen to
be back to back here in Detroit and in
Las Vegas at CES and don't forget to
check out road show at the roadshow calm
scene that's major new auto site and of
course we're still here at cnet on
cars.com as well coming up next episode
we get our hands on the amazing
laferrari if you want to be here for
that one I'll see you next time we check
the tech
