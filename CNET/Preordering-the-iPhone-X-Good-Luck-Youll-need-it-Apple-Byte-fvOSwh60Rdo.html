welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
the iPhone 10 pre-orders are this week
at 12:01 a.m. on Friday October the 27th
and I'm pretty sure almost all of you
watching this will be at home on four or
five different screens on different apps
and sites trying to get through to get
the new iPhone 10 but Apple officially
announced that stores will have the
iPhone 10 available for walking
customers on its November the third
release day and encourage you to arrive
early and that's a good Apple yeah and
you know what who knows how many they'll
actually have but they'll have some and
arrive early means sit outside on a
folding chair like right now because if
you aren't in line watching this you're
probably already screwed but I'd
actually encourage you to all forget
about going online just go to the store
November 3rd so it makes my chance of
getting one a whole lot easier thanks in
advance but we know how tough this is
going to be with all the reported
production issues now the nikkei asian
review says that the iPhone 10 shipments
to customers will total around 20
million through the end of the year
making availability extremely tight
through the holiday season now that
number is roughly half of Apple's
originally planned amount for this year
so some of you who try to order online
if the shipping time is too far out
you're going to a store like I know you
are and that's how thirsty people are
going to be for the 10 this year like
I'm competing against someone's grandma
to try and get the iPhone 10 at midnight
like the thirst is real now just after
last week's show published a report from
the recorder says a Japanese company is
suing Apple over the an emoji trademark
a company called a monster came up with
the an emoji name in 2014 and registered
it with the trademark and patent office
in 2015 that's been using the an emoji
name for a messaging app that's designed
to sent animated text to people and it's
been downloaded 18,000 times now in the
summer of 2017 you know just before the
unveiling of the iPhone 10 and the
mainstream use of the word an emojis a
monster was approached by multiple
companies who were believed to be Apple
posing as companies with different names
like they attempted to buy the an emoji
trademark but he monster didn't sell and
these companies threatened to cancel the
trademark
well after that Apple themselves then
filed for a cancellation of the an emoji
trademark that cancellation is still
pending
so what did Apple do they just said eff
it and use the an emoji trademark as if
it was one of their own in the keynote
like you remember this so you know what
I have to say about the owner of an
emojis get paid and as for the Cupertino
kids that's a bad apple come on just
trying to be a bully for a feature
that's honestly stupid but exclusive to
the iPhone 10 totally worth it Apple and
we know about the revamped App Store in
iOS 11 according to 30 days of data from
App topia an app featured on the app of
the day during a weekday could see a
download boost of up to two thousand one
hundred and seventy two percent we know
games will always be popular but its
apps that see a bigger download when
they're being featured the biggest jump
for a free game was nine hundred and
sixty-three percent now there's no word
when I fart will get to be featured and
you know what that stinks for them and
if you're a holding on to the idea that
there might be another Apple event
before the end of the year for the home
pod or anything like that
Craig federighi has squashed that in an
email from a Mac rumors user that asked
him directly will we see in October
keynote federighi replied I think we're
all keynoted out for the season smiley
face you know what they always have to
appreciate an exec that uses a smiley
face and just a reminder this week on
Monday October the 23rd it was the
original ipods sweet 16th birthday it's
the device that set apple on a whole new
course focusing on consumer electronics
and it's still an amazing device like my
original ipod still works to this day
not the one that some of you actually
believed i broke by just droppin it come
on Apple by nation you gotta be better
than that alright and I'm in a giving
mood again this week so we have some
more awesome giveaways this time thanks

you up with their power station USBC x
XL that has enough power to charge a
MacBook with USB C 14 hours and iPad 20

additional hours like it's really nice
and covered in fabric and I know this
