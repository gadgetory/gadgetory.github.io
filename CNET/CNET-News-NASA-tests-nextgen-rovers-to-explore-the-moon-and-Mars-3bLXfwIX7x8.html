Silicon Valley scientists are developing
the next generation of Rovers to explore
the Moon and Mars k10 it's a planetary
rover it's designed to allow us to
explore natural terrains and it's
equipped with a number of different
robot sensors and scientific instruments
NASA's Terry Fong says the sensors make
it possible for the robotic rover to see
what's around it and where to drive to
understand its environment so we use a
lot of different cameras up here is a
stereo pair so a left camera on the
right camera that we use to image the
environment we figure out what's safe
what's not safe how rough is the
environment we also use on top here at
this the spinning sensor here is a 32
beam laser scanner it's collecting lots
and lots of 3d data in real time to
allow us to figure out also you know how
far away are rocks how steep is a slope
and that sort of thing today scientists
in a command station on the other side
of the NASA campus is testing the k10 on
the simulated moon surface there are
couple craters is a small hill here in
the next couple of months engineers plan
to perform the same test from the
International Space Station we've never
had robots controlled and a fully you
know interactive mode from space station
so we're trying to figure out are there
any differences are there things that we
might be surprised by things which we
actually have to plan and then design
future systems to be able to handle the
goal says NASA is to make robots like
the k10 ready for the next manned moon
mission in 2020 where they'll use these
new planetary Rovers to deploy
telescopes on the far side of the moon
so it's basically like a very large
ribbon cable and you can then pull that
out you can stretch this out create
these very long runs perhaps fifty
hundred meter long antennas that you can
then use for radio astronomy and then
the robot knows the school it back up
one of the experiment is finished yeah
in this case for our experiment I'll
know what to spoil it back up for an
actual mission of the moon what you do
is you would actually lay this out that
you would connect it up to a central
electronics box and then you have a
fully functioning radio telescope array
bong ads radio astronomy is one of the
fundamental scientific interests for
NASA going forward the far side of moon
is an ideal location for doing
Radio Astronomy you know it's radio
quiet because you have the whole mass of
the moon blocking stray you know signal
where you can make observations of
really the cosmic dawn so being able to
really look far far back in time and try
to understand what happened many many
billions of years ago in San Francisco
