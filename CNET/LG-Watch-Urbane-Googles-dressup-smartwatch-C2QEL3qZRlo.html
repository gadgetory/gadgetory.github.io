over a year now and where we add well
the Apple watch is obviously out and
Android wear has developed a variety of
smartwatches and they're getting better
and better the LG watch urbane it's
pretty classy watch this thing is steel
and it's got a leather band and it looks
like a round kind of dress watch and
that's where a lot of Android wear is
going to these watches that really start
to look maybe like The Watcher used to
wear that's a pretty good thing
especially for watch faces for a lot of
the apps there's some not really
optimized to take advantage of round as
much as I would like there's also the
fact that Android wear doesn't generally
change much from watch to watch this has
pretty much the same specs as the LG
watch our that came out last year this
is more expensive $350 you can get the
are for Less what are you adding here
it's the design and also the ability to
connect over Wi-Fi which is something
that's part of a new software set
Android wear has some new tools and
tricks that are coming out in the next
edition watches and this is the first to
demonstrate that you can have your watch
in a room on one Wi-Fi network and your
phone in another room or in another
house on another Wi-Fi network and have
the two connected with each other it's
kind of neat except these are really
meant to be near each other and
sometimes there are apps that ask you to
check back on your phone so you have to
set it up on the Wi-Fi network you have
to have that Wi-Fi network to be
recognized you can't connect anywhere
like on a Starbucks randomly so it's not
fully self sustainable but it could show
where these things might be going I
would hold off at this point getting one
just because in a few weeks Google's
gonna have its developer conference new
versions of Android wear watches
probably debuting you just want to wait
and see what's available and the prices
on all these watches since there are a
lot
keep dropping over time now keep in mind
that $350 this is the price of the
entry-level Apple watch which is not bad
but this is not necessarily anything
that you need it's classy looking but
these are really kind of over designed
accessories the LG watch urbane is one
of my favorites just because I think
it's classy and compared to an Apple
watch it's really not that
offensive so maybe take a look at it but
wait and see what the competition is
going to be like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
