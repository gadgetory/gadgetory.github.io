the headsets have always been too
expensive
well $199 oculus go might change that
we're going to unbox this for you it's
the first headset from oculus that's a
standalone device doesn't require a PC
doesn't require a phone or anything like
that
what comes inside for this reduced price
of $199 instead of the 600 you might pay
for a full-size PC headset in here we've
got the headset right away we can see
it's got some fabric straps on the sides
it looks like it's mostly a plastic
construction which is true of the other
oculus as well but a little bit cheaper
than some of those and then we also seem
to have a controller in here
I've got a little emotion controller
comes with each of these this is a three
axis motion controller that oculus is
giving you here so it's something where
you're going to wave it around the room
a little bit like this but you can't
reach out and grab things it's kind of a
stationary thing very much like the gear
VR if you've ever used a Samsung gear VR
looks like there's a little bit of
plastic on there we'll take that off the
Samsung gear VR didn't come with the
motion controller originally so all of
the games here you can kind of expect to
have that from the start I'm sure we'll
put some batteries here in a second to
show you how that works and then it
looks like we've also got a box in back
maybe it will have some battery and
instructions in here about how this
thing works at all we can see we got a
power adapter right away this will
probably be a USB charger for the
headset a little bit more plastic on
there to take off yep that looks like a
standard USB port there put that down
over in the corner and what's this oh
this looks like it's probably a face
piece to put in front of the headset
maybe to keep it protected or to keep
your sweat off we'll put that on later
go into the box a little bit further
we've got some manuals and some
batteries here's the double-a battery
for the controller we can put that in
there in a sec and charging cable
apparently of the micro USB variety I
can see right there it's got that old
connector instead of the new USBC one
you're finding in phones
recently it's a little bit more
ubiquitous still though so it's very
likely you still have a film that uses
microUSB and since you don't have to buy
a new phone for this you can hold on to
your existing one maybe use this cable
to charge it with looks like there's
some instructions on how to set this up
for your glasses ah okay so this is what
we've got here this right here is a
spacer you're gonna use with this
headset if you've got a pair of glasses
that you're wearing so you don't press
your glasses right into the lenses like
on some of the previous headsets they've
told us they put enough room in this
headset for glasses anyhow but that'll
be nice to have that in addition and
some kind of little cord I don't know
what this is wrapped up in here we're
gonna see where this fits in a sec but
some kind of oh you know I bet I bet
this goes with the controller there's
probably a little lanyard spot yeah
little lanyard spot there right in the
bottom for your wrist strap so if you're
swinging around the room and you decide
you're gonna throw a frisbee or you're
gonna throw a an axe at an enemy like in
God of War or something like that you
won't through the controller across the
room and hit your TV as well so and here
is where the magic is the oculus go and
VR headset I got a little bit of plastic
there looks like oh so this feels like
it might actually be metal I'm getting
some some cold feeling as I touch this a
surface right here this smooth surface
this might be a heatsink might act as a
heat sink VR headsets it's something
where they're gonna warm up as you use
them if you've ever used a gear VR with
a samsung phone in there it's one of the
reasons why I like having a headset
without a phone in it is because your
phone doesn't overheat instead it'll be
the circuitry in here and it seems like
they've also compensated for that a
little bit with the metal so take off
this little bit of cardboard which is
telling me I should download an app on
my phone to get started we got some
fabric strap nice three-point strap it's
a nice elastic mesh going on here oh
looks like can you take the top strap
off if you want so if you've got you've
got a big head of hair you got a
ponytail or something coming out you can
take the top strap off too I think I'm
gonna reattach it that I like having
three straps to keep this thing balanced
on my head
and there's a couple of covers on the
lenses I'm gonna want to take off
because I'd like to actually see what
the heck I'm doing in here
packaging always lots of packaging
oculus is also making a big deal out of
these lenses these are a custom hybrid
for an L design it's very much like the
ones in the full-size oculus rift but
it's actually a bit clearer then the PC
had said because the screen inside is
higher resolution and they're also using
a technique called a fixed fovea dren
during where it kind of enhances the
vision your vision in the center of your
eyes so you get more resolution there
where you're actually likely to be
looking and it doesn't use as much of
the processing power on the edges of
your vision and periphery where you're
not going to be looking all the time
so it makes more sense that way and when
you add that all together it's actually
a bit crisper than the full PC version
of the headset it looks like you're
looking more at another world and less
like you're looking at tiny little
pixels that are being magnified by
lenses inside of there so that's the
oculus go $199 it'll be out this month
and we're looking forward to seeing how
it performs in our full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
