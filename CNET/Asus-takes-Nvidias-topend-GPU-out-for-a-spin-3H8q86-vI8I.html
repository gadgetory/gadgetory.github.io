at the Aces g750 there are several
different configurations of this big 70
inch gaming laptop we've got pretty much
the highest end one you know it's got a
standard 17.3 inch 1920 x 1080 screen
got the latest 4th gen intel core i7
processor it's got to 256 gig SSDs and a
one terabyte regular hard drive blu-ray
burner so lots of good stuff there but
here's the real kicker is the first
laptop that we've seen within videos
brand-new top-of-the-line part of its
800m series graphics cards this is the
geforce gtx 880 em first laptop that
we've seen that in pretty much the
fastest video card you can get right now
at least part of invidious new lineup so
how did it perform you know very quickly
if you have two cards in the previous
generation like 27 80s and an SLI
configuration like we had in an Origin
PC laptop we reviewed last year that's a
little bit faster that's two cards vs
one but for a single card system this is
currently the top of the heap of course
being a big desktop replacement laptop
it's gigantic it comes up a full inch
off your desk in the front here and
about two inches in the back it doesn't
look as horrible as some gaming laptops
we've seen you know some brush metal
here on the wrist rest kind of a nice
matte black and kind of a matte screen
but nobody's really making these things
look good these days so even though all
these things together come to about
three thousand dollars that's a lot to
spend I did like a lot of the extras a
sous has some GPU overclocking software
they throw and you can play around with
and it's got not just HDMI and VGA it's
also got a mini DisplayPort /
Thunderball out so you do get a bunch of
extras that you're not going to find
even other high-end laptops I've been
Akron and that's the assist g750</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
