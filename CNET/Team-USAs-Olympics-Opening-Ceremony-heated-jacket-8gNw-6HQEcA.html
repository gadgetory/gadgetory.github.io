this is the official Polo Ralph Lauren
Opening Ceremony parka
the limited edition it's sold out but
it's high-tech and we get to check it
out so I'm gonna put this baby on this
is supposed to heat you with new
technology inside and I got to say
before I even put it on I was surprised
the the background that you I know about
this is that it's actually ink carbon
ink silver ink that's conductive and
sewn in and this is the part in the back
that is supposed to heat you up but when
I saw it in person for the first time I
was so surprised how flexible it is this
is not like wearing a big old funky you
know panel on your back this feels like
fabric it's almost like plastic so I get
to try it on and let you know how it
actually feels this is what the
Olympians are going to be wearing when
they're marching in the opening ceremony
parade and all right it's light now
where's the battery it's in this pocket
here so snap this open alright here's
the battery pack and this is also the
control they have a big hunky button on
here so that way if you're wearing big
gloves it's easy to still control and
there's a little this little polo icon
on it as well so let me turn this on
there's two settings there's low and
there's high so let's see how fast I get
I can feel it it's a it's kind of
instant they say you kind of feel it a
little bit
well weights like it's really toasty so
this cord is detachable if you don't
want to have a big battery in your
pocket that's kind of nice to have that
option but it's actually going through
the back into the panel you just saw
with the American flag logo and you
can't feel it but if you really squeeze
I guess I can kind of feel it there and
first question I have when I was putting
this on is okay
can I wash it like we're talking about
technology in a jacket like like can you
wash this if it gets dirty and yes it's
machine washable a gentle you would have
to just kind of probably take that wire
out before and like you know deal with
that because you don't obviously want to
wash a wire that would be bad but other
than that it's just like a normal jacket
I can kind of feel that it's getting a
little warmer it's very subtle it's not
like oh my gosh I have a toasty back
right now I kind of thought maybe you'd
be like I don't know what to expect
really but this is this is brand new
technology for Ralph Lauren this is the
first time heated clothing is being worn
by the athletes at the Olympic ceremony
and from what it was explained to me
this is actually military-grade
technology being able to have inks that
are you know kind of into the fabric
itself it's not having a bunch of wires
put in this isn't like your grandma's
electric blanket this is actually the
ink itself is conductive and this is new
this is actually a test for Ralph Lauren
what's interesting is when they were
kind of coming up with the design how do
we warm the athletes it's very very cold
but then you also don't know how to
dress them you don't want try some too
warm and heavy really bulky and ok cos I
can already feel like an even more
toasty as we talk you don't want to have
them get too bulky you don't want to
have it be maybe suddenly a little bit
of a warmer day on the ceremony day and
they're like feelings who like it's too
much by having this technology they have
more flexibility and also athletes they
have to keep their muscles warm before
they go this is going to help them if
they're about to go compete and they
want to you know be a little more looser
because you know cold weather look at
you all tied up so it's supposed to last
a while I believe you can go 11 hours on
the low setting and with a full charge
the extra toasty high setting would be
about 5 hours straight but going back to
this being really a test this is a
prototype for the company I mean they
are looking to the athletes when they're
marching on Friday and
- the crowds they're gonna want feedback
there ralph lauren's asking hey what did
you like what did you not like so when
they get back from the games they're
gonna take all this information that
they learn from the athletes and apply
it to something that we could see next
year you know the company wasn't sure
when it comes to wearable technology
what do people want do they want
something that he - do they there's lots
of different things right now with
wearables and tech and you have to find
that sweet spot of what's useful what
people want to see what will they pay
for because it's a little expensive
these are limited edition jackets and
they were about $2,500 or so and they
only made a small amount to be sold in
some stores and they sold out instantly
and so that got Ralph Lauren excited and
thinking hmm maybe we should make them
for next season so they are looking at
this and they want to learn from it you
know they say that and when they take
this technology then the next step they
want to have it so you can control it on
an app you don't have to maybe have a
button maybe it's something that you can
control it more with more different
degrees on an app so they also want to
make it more affordable by mass
producing it
so maybe won't be $2,500 when you have
it in your technology if you want to buy
something next year so I'll have to see
where that goes but either way this is
all a big learning lesson for the
company so that's kind of neat right now
athletes have it it's limited edition on
the closing ceremony there will be
another kind of jacket that also heats
up it's actually right over here it's
this white like it's a little bit of a
bomber jacket ish but yeah this is also
going to heat up what I found
interesting is that if you go on eBay
now they're already going for a lot more
money I saw them for about $7,000 or so
so yeah I feel I'm pretty lucky that I
get to wear this now and check it out
but it you know I'm feeling I'm just
wearing it like short sleeves and
already talking to you all this time
kind of toasty you know like I don't
think I need it on the hot settings
anymore but it's going to do the job
when they're walking for hours in their
hours and
outside this is definitely gonna do the
job for them
and they have that option to just you
know keep it off or just turn it on when
they want to and I'll last the whole
time so that's pretty neat I think
everything else about it though just
your typical jacket now it it is extra
cold outside today I could take it for a
test spin let me turn that heat back on
let me see let me see how well it fares
it is a super lucky day outside right
now in New York so I feel like this is
the perfect day to test a toasty jacket
you know as I sip this up you haven't
seen a lot of tech and clothing I think
a big challenge is how do you do it
right how do you do it affordable how do
you do it where it makes sense sure you
can put technology and clothing but like
what you know what where's the use of
the factor so by getting it to be so
like like you can't even feel it back
here if someone touched me on the back
you can't really even feel it's hot I
just feel it on my backside
all right Oh
follow me into the cold Tundra I'm sorry
my producer is not wearing a jacket I am
sorry but yeah alright so you can see by
my breath it is really cold I'm not
faking it here and yeah this is
definitely nice I can see this being
useful for the team now one thing you
you're always thinking about with you
know like I might feel like I'm wearing
a heating pad now this doesn't feel like
you're wearing a heating pad this is
pretty this is cool or cooly cooly hot I
guess I was right anyways that's not
that's that's the first look at a at the
cool Opening Ceremony Polo Ralph Lauren
a jacket you may be seeing this
in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
