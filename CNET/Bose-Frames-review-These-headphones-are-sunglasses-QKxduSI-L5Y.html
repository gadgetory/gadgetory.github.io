sunglasses but not no I would not wear
these but I can't tell that they're like
high-tech glasses I guess just from
looking at them maybe on the side you
can tell something's going on here
these look like they came out of the
movie theater like 3d glasses you get
the arms are pretty thick I'm not a big
fan of that for style they're maybe a
little more masculine than I would go
for but you know I think you have to
sacrifice some things if you're gonna
get certain technology these are the
bows frames yes they are sunglasses but
they also have micro speakers and
microphones built into their frames and
technically this is the smallest Bose
audio system ever created the frames are
a little bulkier than your typical
glasses and way it touched more but they
don't feel too heavy don't expect the
two styles Bose is offering it launched
to fit the same I'm wearing the alto
style here it's got a little bit square
shape I do prefer its style though it is
a little bit big on my face the Rondo
style fits me a little bit better it's
got a rounded style as its name implies
and it is designed for smaller faces
Bo's bill Z says audio a are sunglasses
because in the near future their work
with Boz's upcoming audio augmented
reality platform it should be available
by this summer unlike video based AR
platforms of Bose AR delivers audio
feedback based on your phone's GPS
location and what's cool is that a nine
axis motion sensor built into the
glasses less apps know exactly which way
you're facing right now you can use the
frames to stream audio and make calls
there are no volume controls on the
frames but there's a little
multifunction button near the temple of
the right frame that allows you to power
on the glasses pause your music skip
tracks forward and back and answer and
end calls and if you turn your glasses
over and set them down for two seconds
they will automatically turn off so how
do they sound well better than you might
expect I was impressed but that doesn't
mean they sound great
this actually kind of feels like wearing
over their headphones I don't know if
it's because of the volume the music
quality how they've managed to handle
the the electronics of this but it's not
like wearing in-ear headphones but the
music is really going in here and you
can still kind of hear some of the
outside this feels like I'm completely
covered and it's hard to hear stuff
that's going on in distance oh now it
changes my perspective a little bit with
how good it sounds like maybe I would
wear these if I didn't have to like
fumble with earphones and if I charged
something else good it's really good
actually
it's interesting how I'm not actually
wearing earbuds and it's not actually
covering my hair but it feels like it is
sounds good I don't know how loud is it
did anybody else can hear it but it
sounds like it's pretty loud in my head
the volume is about at 60% I can't
really hear it can't really hear it
I can kind of hear it now it's really
loud well they don't sound quite as good
as Apple's air pods they can play pretty
loud although they sound best at around
60 or 70 percent volume levels not
cranked to the max one of their best
features is that even though they sound
loud to you they leak little sound so
people around you can't hear your music
or who you're speaking to on a call they
do work well for making calls and I was
able to hear callers reasonably well in
the streets of New York even though my
ears were open taking all the sounds
around me battery life isn't great beau
says that at average listening levels
they run up to 3.5 hours for playback
and up to 12 hours on standby and can be
fully recharged in less than two hours
using an included Pogo pin cable a
pretty swanky protective case is
included along with a cleaning cloth
alas Bose doesn't offer prescription
lenses for the frames yet but the lenses
which aren't polarized but seem pretty
decent do pop out and you could get a
prescription lens on your own know that
you will void the warranty if you do pop
those lenses out they don't offer a high
degree of water resistance there I px 2
certified but Bose reps told me I'd be
okay to run with them and I could see
people using them for running and biking
and other pursuits where it's good to
have your ears open so you can hear
traffic and other sounds it's hard to
give a full review of these guys without
experiencing the upcoming AR features
but I will say this is an interesting
wearable that has a chance to shake up
to the audio market in the coming years
I'm David Carr noise for cnet.com thanks
