autonomous vehicles for more than a
decade because for us it is very serious
work and you can see that in the
millions of Ford vehicles already on the
road with driver assisted semi
autonomous technologies and the
increasing levels of safety and
convenience that we deliver every year
for our customers now this is a stepping
stone approach to fully autonomous
driving and it's the prevailing approach
in the industry but there's much more to
ford's autonomous vehicle plan we're
approaching autonomous vehicles with a
dedicated research and development team
working on fully autonomous driving much
like we're seeing from the technology
companies and this summer in fact we
move from the research phase of
autonomous vehicle development to
advanced engineering and today we're
taking another big step forward in
making fully autonomous vehicles a
reality and to share more details I'd
like to invite Raj Nair our chief
technical officer to join me Raj
so today we're announcing that Ford is
tripling the size of our autonomous
vehicle testing fleet and we're
accelerating our on-road testing to
further advance our own self-driving or
virtual driver software capability we'll
have about 30 Fusion Hybrid autonomous
vehicles on roads and test tracks in
California Arizona Michigan including
the all-new M City a simulated urban
environment at the University of
Michigan this gives us the automotive
industry's largest autonomous vehicle
development fleet accumulating miles and
real-world testing and further honing
our software and today we're announcing
that we're equipping our third
generation fleet of autonomous fusion
hybrids with the most advanced lidar
from vela dean the new solid-state
hybrid ultra puck auto sensor and this
is also valid in√©s third generation
technology and as you can see here
they've made significant progress in
advancing the technology especially in
terms of the size you can see here on
the stage the first generation lidar
that we use on our DARPA challenge
effort with the Super Duty the
second-generation lidar in the middle is
now installed on our fusion hybrids and
we use four of them on every car and
here is the all-new puck you know this
all new sensor technology is elegant and
design but it makes a huge impact in how
it helps advance our autonomous driving
technology they're named the ultra puck
because they're the shape of a hockey
puck and fit into the cars sideview
mirrors that are developed specifically
for automotive use extending the sensor
range by 200 meters versus the last
generation and these sensors provide
even better precision which is critical
for mapping and creating accurate 3d
models of the environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
