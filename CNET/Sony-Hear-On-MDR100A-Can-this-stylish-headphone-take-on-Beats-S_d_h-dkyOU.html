headphone in standard charcoal black but
what makes it stand out is the vibrant
eye catching colors it comes in
including red yellow pink or the
Veridian blue you see here which has a
lot of green in it attractively designed
lightweight and very comfortable to wear
it folds up to fit in a simple but
stylish nylon carrying pouch sony calls
it a premium high-res headphone which
implies that to get the most out of it
you'll need a high res audio compatible
portable music player such as Sony's
Walkman nwz a 17 or the newer and more
affordable NWA 25 which costs around two
hundred and twenty dollars online if you
listen to this headphone in a vacuum
without comparing it to anything else
you'd probably think it's a very good
sounding headphone with good detail and
a fairly neutral sound profile neither
bass-heavy nor as transparent or
detailed as audio Technica's ath msr7
it's quite pleasant to listen to just
not incredibly exciting hopefully over
time it will come down in price to
around one hundred and fifty dollars
it's a likable headphone but faces stiff
competition in this price range
including from Sony's own mdr-1a which
doesn't cost much more online and sounds
richer and more open with their more
energetic bass and more detail I'm David
