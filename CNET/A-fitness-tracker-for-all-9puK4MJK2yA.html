and right now we're taking a first look
at the Fitbit zip at 5995 essentially
$60 this fitness gadget is one of the
most affordable smart pedometers around
the Fitbit zip is also the lowest price
product in fitbit's current health
tracker lineup which includes the Fitbit
one and the Fitbit flex wristband both
of which costs ninety nine ninety five
you do get a lot of capability for the
Fitbit zips low price the zip tracks how
many steps you take calories burned and
distance traveled the device is also
water-resistant so running in the rain
or subjecting it to an odd splash won't
be a problem there are no physical
controls on the zip to interact with the
product just tap it's small LCD screen
doing so will cycle through its various
screens that display your current stats
the zip will even stick out its
graphical tongue at you if it feels
you're not moving enough likewise the
zip will beam at you with a virtual grin
for good behavior
the Fitbit zip is encased in a silicone
sleeve with a clip designed to attach to
clothing Fitbit says the device will
operate if you just slip it into pockets
- there are five Fitbit zip hues to
choose from blue magenta white charcoal
and lime Fitbit bundles a
color-coordinated clip for each zip
flavor as well just like the Fitbit one
and Fitbit flex the zip syncs tracking
data to PCs iPhones and compatible
Android handsets via wireless bluetooth
connection to link to pcs the device
uses a USB bluetooth adapter provided in
the box through the app and desktop
website you have access to fitbit's deep
vault of data analysis tools you can
also leverage the company's large
database of food items to log what you
eat and see how that compares against
your calories burned unlike the one in
Flex trackers the zip relies on a
standard watch battery also included for
its power source
Fitbit says the three volt coin battery
offers about four to six months of
juice1 ability of the zip lacks one that
it's other Fitbit brethren feature is
sleep tracking that's a bummer for
someone like me who is always sleep
deprived and cost
