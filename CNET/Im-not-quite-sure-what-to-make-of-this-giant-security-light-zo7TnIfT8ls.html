two-hundred-dollar smart home kit that
includes a wired motion detector
equipped doorbell a 720p high-definition
security camera built into a
color-changing outdoor rated LED and a
plug-in Wi-Fi range extender but there's
a huge problem with this device it's
absolutely huge it didn't fit in my
porch lights at home it doesn't fit in
the porch lights at the scene at smart
home as you can see and even after a
trip to the home-improvement store only
the largest models they carried would
fit the torch pro is a cool concept
though because the doorbell and the
camera light hybrid device worked
together to watch over your front door
the doorbell detects motion sends you a
push alert and pulls up a live feed of
the activity happening outside from
there you can use the two-way audio
function to talk to the person you can
also schedule the light to turn on at
certain times keep in mind that the
camera automatically switches to night
vision mode when the LED is on and back
to regular day mode when it's off all of
this worked fine but the initial
configuration was seriously confusing to
the extent that I called customer
service to help me pair the devices but
even after setup the cluttered app
design made it hard to find what I was
looking for the torch pro also doesn't
work with any third-party devices given
that the app is hard to navigate and the
camera LED won't fit in most porch
lights I definitely can't recommend this
emoto torch pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
