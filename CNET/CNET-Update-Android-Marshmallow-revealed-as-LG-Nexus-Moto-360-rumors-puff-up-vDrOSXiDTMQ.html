and Google wants to help you go so I'm
Bridget Carey this is your see that
update the next version of android has
an official sweet treat nickname google
revealed the next operating system will
be called marshmallow every version of
android is assigned a code name of a
sweet treat and it's a fab ethical in
the early days we had android cupcake
donut Eclair Froyo then came gingerbread
honeycomb and ice cream sandwich j was
for jellybean k for KitKat the most
current version is l known as lollipop
and they make crazy statues to represent
all of these versions and they put them
on the Google campus lawn a pair of
Google employees nat and low posted this
behind-the-scenes video to YouTube on
the making of the statue but as for when
it's coming to your phone there's no
date it's still in testing and it's not
ready for the public but it will be out
sometime in the fall and it usually
first comes to Google Nexus phones
rumors are swirling that LG is making
the next Nexus a Google+ user from
Indonesia posted this photo of an LG
phone marked not for sale with the Nexus
logo could it be the next Nexus and this
looks similar to another photo of the
rumored phone posted by the Twitter
account on leaks whatever the final
product it'll arrives sometime in the
fall also in android rumor land
Motorola's next moto 360 SmartWatch
could come in two sizes documents filed
to Brazil's telecom regulator shows that
Motorola has a 360 s and a 360 L maybe
for small and large the 360 L is listed
with a larger capacity battery and it
seems Motorola accidentally spilled the
beans on what it's going to look like it
posted this image to Instagram with an
animation to show what you can do with
the watch but this is not what the
current model looks like the button is
in a different spot and it holds on to
the wrist strap differently the post has
since been removed from Motorola's
Instagram page oopsies and how about we
end on a bright note and it doesn't get
much brighter than the Sun google
announced a new service called Project
sunroof google uses Maps data to tell
you how much sunlight falls on your
home's roof and then it helps you
figure out how much it cost to install
solar panels and what you can save on
your energy bill it'll also show you a
list of installers in your area but this
project is very young and it's only
available to some people in Boston San
Francisco and Fresno California google
says it plans to expand it nationwide
that's it for this tech news update
there's more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
marshmallow not I probably shouldn't be
eating while I'm doing the news well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
