crave and I'm here at Itza which is a
fully automated restaurant that just
opened in San Francisco I'm here with
the CEO and co-founder of Itza Tim young
he's going to tell us a little bit about
the restaurant so tell us about the
concept behind Itza and how you guys
came up with the idea yeah so we wanted
to build a concept that was bringing the
speed and affordability that you might
find it
traditional fast food which might have
things wrong with it but the price
points are right and the speed is right
and bring that to a food that was both
nutritious and super delicious and
flavorful
and that is each other so once you've
placed an order how long does it take
for your food to come out of the cubby
so I mean it on a heavy day we're
thinking it's about probably three to
five minutes but on a light day all
right we're actually able to prepare the
food in probably 60 to 90 seconds when
they walk in store they're going to see
nine iPad kiosks that they can walk up
to and they're able to place their order
on those kiosks once they've completed
their order they'll walk over towards
where cubbies are which is where your
food comes out and above the cubbies is
a large status board that'll say all the
different orders that are up and where
where to find them so Tim why is in
cubby three you can look down go to
cubby three you'll see a graphic
displayed on the actual door you'll say
your name as well as the fact that it's
cubby three you tap it you get your food
and you leave so one of the the pretty
unique elements in our stores is the
cubby and so on the door of the cubby is
what's called a transparent LCD and
effectively it's it's an LCD that you
can see through and so what we've built
is is a way to see not just the digital
representation of your name but you can
actually look in and see that overlaid
on your food and quite frankly we've
been noticing our customers are pretty
delighted by it so we're really happy
with how how well it's been received one
of the
we wanted to use technology to automate
ordering besides making it a more
efficient process is we're actually able
to get to know our customers at your
average fast food or fast casual
restaurant you know that cashier isn't
necessarily able to remember every
customer that comes in the door we're
actually able to remember who you are
what you've ordered in the past so that
we can make it much faster for you to
get your favorites with OneTouch
ordering so as we were building this
obviously a lot of people equated us to
you know things you might see in Japan
the automat from back in the 50s there
were a lot of sort of correlations made
and absolutely we did our research I'm
not going to lie there was a ton of
research that went into building this
experience it didn't just happen and so
we absolutely looked at things that were
successful in the past what were the
pieces of that one that were successful
what could we do better how did it fit
with our freshly prepared food because a
lot of concepts like this are not about
freshly to prepared food that is made to
order but we are and so we wanted that
experience to evoke that as well because
it's absolutely important that our food
is made to order and super delicious
