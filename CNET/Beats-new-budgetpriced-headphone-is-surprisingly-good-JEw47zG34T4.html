cost more they're probably worth but
it's entry level EP headphone which
costs $100 is a surprisingly decent
value while this wired on ear model
isn't a swanky looking as beats somewhat
forgotten executive and pro models
thanks to its sturdy metal frame it
reminds me of a smaller low frill
version of those headphones by low
frills I mean it isn't incredibly
flashlight and doesn't pull flat or fold
up the headphone is available in a few
different color options and has an
iPhone friendly inline remote flash
microphone for making calls adjusting
volume and skipping tracks forward and
back a simple carrying pouch is also
included for an on-ear headphone the EP
is comfortable though not as comfortable
as it bows on your headphone it's
decently cushioned and fits snugly some
people might think a little too subtly
and I'm not sure these are the best
headphones for a person with a really
big head I like the way they sounded
they're pretty clean and open sounding
particularly for an on your headphone
and there's enough treble detail to give
them some Sparkle the base is a little
accentuated this is a beats headphone
after all but it's not bloated or boomy
you can of course find headphones
usually once a cost more that sound a
little cleaner more detailed more open
and have tighter base but the BTP sounds
as good or better than beats own solo 3
Wireless which costs three times as much
and delivers good bang for your beats
buck so long as you don't line that wire
I'm David Connor for cnet.com thanks for
