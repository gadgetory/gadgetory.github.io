to Google issues for everything inside
the room of Google if you like the
Google pixel and it's still the best
Android phone hands-down there's new
details for the pixel too from nine to
five Google now the googs will be
focusing intensely on the camera it was
already one of the best ones we've ever
seen in a phone and is being tested with
improved chipsets from two different
companies now the phone's camera will
not have a large megapixel size but will
bring extra features with the focus on
truly mastering low-light photography
now according to the report
waterproofing is still on the table but
not guaranteed just yet
but more disturbing the report says it
will also bring a higher price tag with
at least a $50 price increase you know
because 6:49 for a base-model pixel last
year wasn't high enough come on Google
now they're also testing lower end
pixels with lower specs with the idea of
selling a budget pixel internally
referred to as the pixel to be now we're
still a ways out from an actual product
release so any of this could change by
then and an update to Android nougat
7.1.2 is coming soon for the pixel Nexus
devices it brings bug fixes and
optimizations for carriers and users if
you're enrolled to the Android beta
program you can get it right now before
its official rollout or you can sign up
at this link right here and it will work
on the pixel pixel XL Nexus 5x Nexus 6p
Nexus player and pixels C but the Nexus
9 and Nexus 6 are not on that list they
released in 2014 and Google is no longer
pushing updates out for them but they'll
still continue to get security patches
until November of this year
all right Google Fiber launched in
Charlotte North Carolina last year with
internet speeds of 100 megabits per
second for uploads and downloads for
just $50 a month and then they had an
option for 1,000 megabits up and down
for just 70 bucks seriously
so where's their next expansion just 170
miles east in Raleigh North Carolina
congratulations you Raleigh
I'm jealous but I can take comfort in
knowing that the Bay Area still has
other things better than your Google
Fiber specifically my Golden State
Warriors who will dismantle the
Charlotte Hornets without
hands tied behind their backs this week
you can check the score all right
Samsung just dropped their mobile world
congress invite with a silhouette of
what's believed to be the new Samsung
Galaxy Tab s three that will be
announced on February the 26th how did I
know that I looked at the invite leaked
specs from Korean site neighbor have
revealed a Snapdragon 820 four gigs of
ram 9.6 inch display at 2048 by 1536 a
12 megapixel camera five megapixel
front-facing that's just five point six
millimeters thick now there will be both
LTE and Wi-Fi only versions with the
early pricing around 600 US dollars
which is yeah pricey but we'll find out
this month and next bit has been
required by a razor the Robin was their
first phone that brought cloud
integration to the Android OS so you
never run out of space on the phone
razor is known for their PC gaming
hardware and it's told TechCrunch that
it plans to continue developing mobile
phones under the next bit brand and
utilize their new talent support for the
Robin phone will continue through
February 2018 and you know what we
haven't seen a sketchy undercover
picture of phones before the release in
a while so behold the LG G 6 new images
from droid life show off what looks to
be an early prototype you can make out
the thin bezels on the front the rear is
unfinished but it also supports the
rumors of no removable battery dual
camera design and a metal frame now an
official picture of the top half of the
g6 already made it into the wild and
we'll get an official announcement at
Mobile World Congress this month all
right that's going to do it for this
week you can email me at Google issues
at cnet.com or to get Brian Tom thanks
so much for watching we'll see you next
time for some more of that Google issues
Duggal issues
