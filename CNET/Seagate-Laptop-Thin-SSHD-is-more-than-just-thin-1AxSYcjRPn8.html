seated laptop dean sshd so what is this
well it's not a regular solid state
drive like this one here nor is it a
regular hard drive like this is to come
by or both or a Seagate colleges is the
new solar state hyper drive
now this drive right here comes with 500
gigabyte of regular hard drive storage
and 8 gigabyte of NAND flash memory the
kind of storage you in most SSDs now
hyper drive our special but this
particular one here is actually very
special take a look at this it has
Seagate confidential which means you
cannot buy on a market in fact you have
to be quite special to have one like
this it's quite tempting you know and
whoops is gone I guess now you can
actually find one on eBay
but don't worry I have another one here
brand new I'm done no after all now just
for a right good you can buy it it's
just not the confidential version anyhow
this is actually the third generation of
hybrid drive from ceded previously it
was called momentous xt starting this
year all hyper drive an alcohol as at HD
this laptop thin sshd here as the name
suggests is thin only seven millimeter
thick some 2.5 millimeter thinner than
the previous generation it's about as
thin as most SSD on the market and that
means it can fit in our desktop computer
or laptop computers and some ultra books
now the new drive here is quite
different from the previous generation
first of all on the inside its spin as
only 5400 rpm as opposed to 7,200 rpm of
the previous generation it also kept at
500 gigabyte but there's also another
version of this droid called laptop SS
HD without theme that's offer 1 terabyte
so how is this new drive here better
than regular hard drive well the dry
come with
tegus adaptive memory technology that
automatically look for hard data and
copy that onto the NAND flash memory
part so the next time when the same data
is being requested it can be read from
the flash memory and hands improve the
performance so how much is this now this
drive here costs about $80 for 500 gig
which is slightly more expensive than a
regular hard drive but much cheaper than
an SSD of the same capacity and in my
testing it did indeed improve the
performance but for more on that and to
check out the full review etsy.com and
when you add it on the interwebs make
sure you follow me on Facebook or
Twitter you'd be glad that you do and
finally remember this is all
confidential don't tell me about it
we don't work on second thought go tell
everybody and why's that because I'm
don't know and this has been the first
look at the Seagate laptop thin
solid-state hybrid drive I have two of
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
