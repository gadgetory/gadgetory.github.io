today we're taking an early look at the
just announced Roku streaming stick this
is a new version of Roku's old streaming
stick but with two major differences it
now works with any hdmi compatible TV
and it's half the price at just $49 the
streaming stick hardware is pretty basic
the company's essentially managed to
squeeze an entire Roku box into a small
adapter it's not much bigger than the
HDMI port itself it connects right into
any spare hdmi port on your TV and then
it also needs power either by connecting
it to a USB port if your TV has one or
using the included AC adapter if that
design seems familiar that's because
it's awfully similar to Google's $35
chromecast and it's not hard to see the
updated streaming stick as a response to
Google's popular streamer but the Roku
streaming stick does a few things
differently unlike the chromecast the
streaming stick includes an
old-fashioned remote it's a pretty
standard Roku remote and it works via
Wi-Fi direct so it can still control the
streaming stick when it's hidden behind
your TV you will notice that the remote
doesn't have that neat headphone jack
for private listening so you still need
to step up to a Roku 2 or Roku 3 for
that feature another difference from the
chromecast is you get a standard on
screen interface which lets you browse
thousands of channels or use Roku's
excellent cross-platform search which
lets you find a specific movie or TV
show on whatever service that's
available on the streaming stick will
also have some chromecast like push
capabilities as both YouTube and Netflix
will let you cast from a mobile device
exactly like you would with a chromecast
in terms of the specs the streaming
stick will have full 1080p output dual
band Wi-Fi support and roku says the
internal chip is similar to the one in a
Roku one so it likely won't be quite as
lightning fast as a roku 3 the roku
streaming stick is scheduled to come out
in April for forty nine dollars I'll
have a full review with comparisons to
the chromecast as soon as I get my hands
on a review sample but at first glance
this seems like a very promising
streamer I'm Matthew miskovic and this
is
early look at the Roku streaming stick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
