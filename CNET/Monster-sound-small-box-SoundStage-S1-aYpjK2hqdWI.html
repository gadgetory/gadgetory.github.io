looking at the monster soundstage s1 a
wireless multi room speaker available
for 230 dollars while the speaker might
look like your standard Bluetooth
speaker it does that and a lot more the
s-1 is compatible with pol coms allplay
wireless standard a competitor to Sonos
and other systems such as DTS play-fi
and it allows Spotify connect playback
as well as streaming music from the
phone and the network plus support for a
handful of other apps setup is a little
trickier than most and needs the use of
the WPS button on your router or if you
don't have one of those the Chrome
browser on your Android phone as well as
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth the speaker also
allows you to stream Bluetooth sources
around the home in addition to
connecting USB devices optical digital
and other players via the 3.5 millimeter
input sound quality is generally good
especially if you like dance music with
very deep bass for such a small
enclosure thanks to the passive bass
radiator on the back and some over
height to travel it does have a very
beats like sound and goes very very loud
if you like any other style of music
though the combination of loud treble
and recessed vocals can actually get
annoying especially with acoustic music
and rock at a price that's a little bit
more than the play one the monster
soundstage s1 offers a different take on
the multi room speaker and the support
for high res music is excellent but if
you're looking for something more subtle
then Sonos is the better option this is
