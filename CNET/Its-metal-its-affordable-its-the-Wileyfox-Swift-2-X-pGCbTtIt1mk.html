only released its swift two-plus handset
in November last year and is already
here with an addition to the series
named the Swift 2x the 2x is the most
premium model in the Swift series
featuring more powerful specs and a
slightly higher price the phone runs on
an octa-core Qualcomm processor which
makes a sandwich n version of Android
marshmallow run smoothly in my hands-on
time on the back of the phone is a 16
megapixel camera and as an 8 megapixel
camera on the front for all those
grinning selfies the handset is wrapped
in an all-metal chassis that although
doesn't particularly stand out in terms
of looks does feel good to hold for my
hands the phone's 5.2 inch size is a
great sweet spot between screen real
estate and comfort when you're holding
it the display itself has a full HD
resolution there's also a fingerprint
scanner on the back which together with
the NFC allows you to use contactless
Android pay other features include a
three thousand and ten milliamp an hour
battery USB C charging and 32 gig of
storage that can be expanded with a
micro SD card while the phone isn't
going to trouble the light to the
Samsung Galaxy s7 it's got a solid
lineup of specs and it's only 220 pounds
SIM free from Wiley Fox's website it is
very affordable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
