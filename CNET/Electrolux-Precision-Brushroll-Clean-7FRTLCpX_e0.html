with a review of the Electrolux
precision brush roll clean this $309
vacuum sits in the mid price range but
it offers a lot of higher-end features
for starters let's look at design there
are a lot of things to look at here but
I'll just walk you through the key
features first of all the handle up top
doubles as a wand that you can release
easily to get it hard-to-reach places
the handle also has a feature where you
can adjust the amount of suction you
want it also comes with two different
attachments one is a dusting tool and
the other is a versatile so it can get
in crevices or on stairs other
hard-to-reach places I also really like
the bin on this vacuum cleaner it's
clear so you can see how much dust and
dirt you've accumulated and it's
incredibly easy to remove and snap back
into place this vacuum cleaner also
comes with the HEPA filter also unique
to this vacuum cleaner is the height
adjuster so you can get small and big
particles by far my favourite feature of
this vacuum cleaner is the brush roll
clean technology if your vacuuming up
stuff that gets stuck in the brush you
can just push down the brush roll clean
peddle and it will suck everything
that's stuck in there up into the bin so
you don't have to do it yourself so I
tested this $309 vacuum cleaner against
the six hundred and fifty dollar dyson
DC 41 the $399 dyson dc40 the $399 auric
bagless touch and the $199 shark rotator
pro lift away we tested how all of these
vacuum cleaners stand up against fruity
Cheerios sand and sawdust mix pet hair
human hair and a combination of washers
nuts and bobby pins you're welcome
and we tested all of those different
things on a short carpet a thicker
carpet and hardwood and what I learned
was that the Electrolux does incredibly
well it did have some problems
collecting clumps of pet hair and fruity
Cheerios from hardwood but I use the
brush roll clean technology and it
sucked everything right up
to the bin compared to the Dyson's and
even the Oreck vacuum cleaner it didn't
pick up as many bobby pins nuts or
washers but as a regular consumer I'm
not sure I really cared that much one
difference between the Electrolux and
the other four models we tested is
maneuverability the Electrolux does do
well but it doesn't have the same
rotator ball or swivel feature as some
of the others overall I really love this
vacuum cleaner I would highly recommend
it especially compared to the more
expensive models it still does
incredibly well and it's much less
expensive thanks for hanging out i'm
