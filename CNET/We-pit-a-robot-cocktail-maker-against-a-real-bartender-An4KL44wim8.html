out so I'm not much of a bartender
myself but hopefully bar psious this
robot bartender can fare better that's
what it's supposed to do automatically
and make cocktails on demand so it
brought up to an actual cocktail bar to
see how it fares against a real
bartender versus cost just over a
thousand dollars you can fit it with
five different alcohols along the top
then three mixers in two plastic
containers on the side and it makes
rates pretty quickly though it will
sometimes splash and drip you supply the
glass and some ice and bar tsa's takes
care of the rest
pouring out precise ingredients from its
recipe database and the results probably
better than what I could do
here's your bourbon and coke sir but now
we're gonna give this thing a real test
we're gonna pit bar --ss against an
actual bartender we're starting with
something simple a boulevardier which
calls for rye whiskey vermouth and
Campari we also told our bartender Brian
no garnishes as barsa scant add those on
its own and we're looking for an even
blind taste test
hmm okay
okay well I like this one because it is
it tastes there's more about complexity
going on they taste smoother and this
one was a little kind of just flatter
like a one-note kind of feel I knew it I
knew it
so bursts actually won that round but it
was very close and there were some
mitigating factors that Brian will talk
through later but now we're gonna
unleash our bartender and put no
restrictions let him make the signature
cocktail he wants to make and see if
bars can keep up with the first test
that we conducted there we're dealing
with three ingredients equal parts you
know everybody's palate is gonna be a
little different I don't know that our
judge had the best palate today so we're
gonna make a drink called a New York
sour which Parsis doesn't have in its
database fortunately we can make a
custom recipe using the app the drink
calls for sugar syrup lemon juice red
wine and bourbon we'll put the
ingredients here on the machine and on
the app we select to make a custom
cocktail and there we go
take it away versus something that's
holding us back here is that we're
limited to three mixers at a time and
these containers can leak Wow I mean
right away there's no contest I mean
look at the difference here
this one looks delicious and and and
it's actually full glass as opposed to
this one which is like a half of a drink
I'd be upset if I got this to the bar so
this one looks a lot better I have to
say
I don't know mmm
I mean it tastes like half a drink very
very little sour and just kind of no not
so impressive I'll try this one next
here we go
oh man that's good that is so much
better it is like rich and smooth and
has so many different flavors going on
probably because there's more
ingredients I think and the garnish adds
some kind of smell once you actually get
your your ear nose in the glass it's
very good very good you know I'll tell
you that I'm not worried about my job
it's very limited in what it can produce
it doesn't have a whole lot of options
for multiple ingredients different
techniques you know the person that's
gonna buy this is obviously has a lot of
disposable income and loves cleaning up
messes versus does a few things pretty
well you can search for recipes based on
what you have you can also search for
what you want to make and see what
ingredients you'll need to buy
unfortunately the app crashes and
freezes frequently it's supposed to save
the volume of each container but more
often than not that info is lost look I
get the appeal here especially if you've
got the money you want to save yourself
some effort on party night but aside
from the inherent limitations and the
too expensive price both the machine and
the app need another round or two of
Polish plus this thing is over a
thousand dollars and you can do
essentially the same thing with a shot
glass for measuring and google for
recipes Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
