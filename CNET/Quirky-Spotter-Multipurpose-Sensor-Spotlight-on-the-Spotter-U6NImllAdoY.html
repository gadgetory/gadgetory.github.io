is the spotter from the team of quirky
and GE this is a multi-purpose sensor
that can track light sound motion
temperature and humidity changes and
then use that to trigger your devices or
send you notifications now the spotter
is magnetic so you can stick it to your
fridge or you can mount it to the wall
using mounting screws or sticky tabs or
just sitting on a desk you can power it
one of two ways you can plug it in using
the included AC cable or you can use the
battery backup just to double-a
batteries and that'll keep it going on
battery mode though it'll only do motion
and light detection can't do the other
stuff now this is a very new product and
it shows a lot of promise and potential
it'd be great to have a sensor capable
of doing all the things that can do that
works reliably however the spotter
doesn't quite work as consistently as
I'd like at this point now in my tests I
found that it worked well when it had
the power plugged in and the batteries
out reason for this is that you reboot
the spotter by taking all the power out
of it no battery is no power cord and
then plugging that cord back in it'll
log on to the network download any new
firmware that's up there and get up to
speed and at that point it seems to work
really well but if you change the
battery status by adding batteries and
then unplugging it or if you move the
spot or somewhere that can kind of
confuse it and then it stops working so
reliably the a be used to control is the
wing cap from quirky and this is the
same map we saw with the pivot power
genius and with the egg minder we looked
at it's a great app it looks really nice
it gives you a lot of helpful
information but it's lacking some key
features it doesn't give you a timeline
of events won't tell you all the things
that happen during the day to the
spotter like when the lights came on or
when the temperature changed you can't
go back and view that history and that's
kind of a big omission in my book also
you can't check the status of the
spotter in real time it's got the
temperature sensor in there but you
can't log into the app and check what
the temperature is at the current moment
that seems like a big oversight in my
opinion we also saw some little things
that sort of threw us for a loop like if
you try and turn a trigger off that
you've set up and then exit that menu
when you come back that trigger will be
on again it's kind of strange and I
think it just needs another pass from
the development team now if you're an
early adopter and
you want to try out this new technology
quirky has a bunch of devices coming out
that are all supposed to work with this
so it could be very cool and like I said
it's got a lot of promise and a lot of
these problems might be fixed with a
couple of good firmware updates but
right now it's not working as reliably
as I'd like if I was gonna automate my
appliances I'd probably go with the
Belkin Wemo switch in motion which and
our tests did quite well so holidays are
coming up if I had to choose one to have
in my stocking and be belkin's but next
year don't be surprised if the spotter
ends up on my wish list you're seeing
that I'm right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
