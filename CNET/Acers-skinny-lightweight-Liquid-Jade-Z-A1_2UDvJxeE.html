Barcelona for mobile world congress
where acer has a brand new flagship
phone in the form of the liquid Jade
said now the headline future for this
phone is in the design now at 7.9 milf
thick it is very skinny but it's only a
hundred and ten grams which really is
extremely light you can carry this thing
around in your pocket all day and you'll
barely notice it's there it has a nice
rounded back which feels comfortable to
hold and the front of the phone doesn't
look too bad either it has a 5-inch
display with a 720p resolution now it
doesn't look quite as clear as screens
you'll find on 1080p phones but it's
certainly readable and considering from
much lower price that's probably a good
compromise to make what asa has done
though is minimize the gap between the
display and the glass coating meaning
that it cuts down on reflections a bit
so in bright sunlight this phone might
be a little easier to read running on
android 4.4 kitkat rather than the more
recent 5.0 lollipop now on a flagship
phone that is a bit annoying
particularly as ASA has got lollipop on
one of its much cheaper budget phones
the phone is set to go on sale towards
the end of March this year and should
cut around 199 euros which converts to
144 pounds or 223 dollars I'm Andrew
Horrell for cnet and this is the acer
liquid jazzy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
