the Motorola MOTO G five plus four years
Motorola's Moto G family of phones have
offered a perfect balance of features
and cost the Moto G 5 plus is the newest
members of the G family and comes with
premium features like Google Assistant a
close to stock version of Android 7.0
nougat more storage new moto gestures
and even 4k video all this without
raising the cost one of my favorite
features on the Moto G 5 plus is the
fingerprint sensor it's on the front and
works just as good as Apple's touch ID
on the iPhone but Motorola did something
really cool it added a bunch of
shortcuts that turn the fingerprint
sensor into a mini trackpad you enable
this in the Moto app and select
one-button app now if you tap on the
fingerprint sensor it brings you home if
you swipe left it shows your recent apps
if you swipe right it goes back and if
you long press you lock the phone the
Moto G 5 is a new 12 megapixel camera
and it takes great photos and focuses
fast sadly and low light without optical
stabilization some of my shots were a
bit blurry video and the Moto G 5 plus
is really nice there's digital
stabilization and if you want you can
shoot 4k video with pretty good results
okay google also has Google assistant a
peppy octa-core processor for gigabytes
of RAM and gets really good battery life
it lasted over 13 hours in our looped
video playback test remember this is a
budget phone and there were a handful of
times I was reminded of this though none
were deal-breakers the audio out of the
g5 plus speaker is very tinny
there's no NFC in the US version so no
Android pay the adaptive brightness
works great outside but not great
indoors but without it on you have
trouble seeing the display and sunlight
at the end of the day I really enjoy the
Moto G 5 plus I honestly don't know of a
phone that strikes a better balance
between features and costs really the
only question you'll have is what to do
with all the money you'll save buying it
