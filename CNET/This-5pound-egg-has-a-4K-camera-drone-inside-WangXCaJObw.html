probably think of something like this
but probably don't think of this yep
it's a flying egg the power egg from
robotics company power vision to be
precise in the search for a friendlier
and more approachable design that also
protects the drone when traveling the
company developed a camera drone that
starts life as an egg but quickly
converts to a quadcopter it's battery
which is good for up to about 23 minutes
of flight loads vertically in the top
and on the bottom is a removable shell
protecting its 4k resolution camera that
rotates 360 degrees as well as sensors
to help it fly under 12 feet indoors
when no GPS is available outside with
GPS assistance it will have a range up
to five kilometers about three miles
with HD video transmission to your phone
or tablet and although it doesn't have
collision avoidance it does have all the
automated camera modes you might expect
like follow me orbit Waypoint navigation
and selfie and it'll also take off and
land with a button press its control
system is unique to power Vision
separated the transmitter from the main
controls so you can use a standard to
stick controller or a one-handed gesture
controller called maestro that basically
lets you point where you want the power
egg to fly you can preorder one through
power visions website for one thousand
two hundred and eighty eight dollars and
it starts shipping in mid-october
