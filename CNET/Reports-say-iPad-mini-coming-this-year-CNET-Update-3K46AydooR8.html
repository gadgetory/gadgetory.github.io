rumors I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your sad update talk of a mini iPad is
filling the meaty air once again and new
details are coming from credible outlets
The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg
had sources saying that Apple's gearing
up for a smaller iPad and it could
arrive sometime this year the 7-inch
tablet is the hot area for competition
with a new Amazon Kindle Fire also
reportedly on the way this summer and
Google's latest Nexus 7 tablet this is
going to be the year of the tiny tablet
wars and you know what else is heating
up and iPhone which started smoking in
the pocket of a teenager from Finland in
this security video photos you can see
the iphone just instantly starts smoking
from his pocket and he quickly throws it
to the floor he told reporters he just
bought it three months ago but this
isn't the first case of an iPhone
spontaneously combusting last year an
iphone 4 caught fire on board a plane
and it was found to be caused by a
misplaced screw from a shot a repair job
if you've been hankering for the Google
Galaxy Nexus smartphone you gotta wait a
week a US district judge has ordered a
ban on selling the smartphone all
because of Apple's latest patent
squabble with Samsung this time it's a
patent that deals with Universal Search
so Google's quickly pushing out a
software change to address the patent
issue in order to sell the flagship
phone upgrade to the next version of
windows won't cost you as much as if it
in the past if you have windows XP vista
or seven you'll be able to upgrade to
Windows 8 pro for 40 bucks but you gotta
do so by the end of January otherwise
it'll cost seventy dollars in stores
also this cheap upgrade will include
media center for free how nice of them
microsoft said it was going to charge
extra for media center so perhaps
somewhat at microsoft's stepped up and
realized that the world would go berserk
over paying more just to play a DVD or
CD and let's see if they still charge
for media center later if you can't
connect to the internet on monday it's
because your computer is one of the
thousands still infected with the
malware called dns changer now this bug
found in 2007 was redirecting computer
traffic to rogue sites that illegally
drove up ad clicks for money the FBI
broke up the crime ring cleaned up the
servers and maintain the machines as a
temporary crutch to give people time to
clean up their computers well as of
Monday time is up and if it's not fixed
your computer won't be able to pull up
websites some internet providers have
been offering help and you can check if
you're infected and find a fix but going
to DC WG org security firms like McAfee
also have free tools to fix the problem
that's your tech news update for today
