Razer wants you to think
and it better be because this laptop
costs 37 hundred US dollars that's the
starting price for the Razer Blade Pro a
17.3 inch black aluminum laptop that
fits in nvidia gtx 1080 video chip with
8 gigabytes of memory into a frame
that's less than an inch thick it's also
got a 4k touchscreen with g sync
technology for smooth gameplay that
displays 100% of the Adobe RGB color
space which could come in handy if
you're doing some photo and video
editing you'll also find the SD card
slot you need to offload photos from
your DSLR all of that's powered by a 6th
gen quad-core i7 processor 32 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory and up to 2 terabytes of
fast PCI Express solid-state storage in
a raid 0 array which is a fancy way of
saying not only is it fast they've
hooked two of them together to make them
even faster you'll also find some
colorful mechanical keyboard switches
here the first mechanical switches in a
razer laptop and what razer says are the
finished mechanical switches in the
world it's a little weird at first to
get used to typing on these things they
require a bit of pressure to press down
perhaps I'll get used to them it's
amazing to me that razor managed to fit
all of this into a frame that's less
than an inch thick but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's portable it's
seven point eight pounds heavy and razer
isn't talking about the battery life in
here either it's not something you'll
necessarily take out for a full day of
work if that's not a problem with you
though and if it's not too rich for your
blood the Razer Blade pro is shipping
this November</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
