machines are formally recalled the
United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission says that Samsung has
received 733 reports of washing machines
experiencing excessive vibration or the
top detaching from the washing machine
chassis nine of those reports include
injuries to people one person had their
jaw broken another had their shoulder
injured Samsung says the recall is
voluntary let's talk about the washing
machines affected the recall applies to
certain top-loading washing machines
manufactured between march 2011 and now
so if you have a front-loading washing
machine this recall does not apply to
you 34 different models of top loaders
are involved in this recall a full list
can be found at cpsc.gov to check if
your top-loading Samsung washing machine
is a part of this recall you'll need to
find the model and serial number those
numbers can be found on your washing
machine in two locations on the back of
the control panel or on the back right
of the washer then you can check at
samsung comm / Us / tlw where you can
input those two numbers to see if your
particular washer is one of the unlucky
2.8 million so what happens if you've
got a defective washer you've got
options Samsung is offering free in-home
repair to reinforce the washers top the
second option is a rebate that would be
applied to the purchase of a washer from
any company if you stick with Samsung
Samsung is giving you a loyalty
incentive of up to a hundred and fifty
dollars also if you bought one of the
affected machines in the past 30 days
you'll be refunded the full purchase
price where you bought it in the mean
time if you still need your washing
machine and it's a part of this recall
Samsung says to use the delicate or
waterproof cycles when washing bulky
items like bedding and with that I'm is
actor and you can keep up with the top
