smartwatches recently that it's easy to
forget they're not the only kind of
wearable around we're here at E for 2014
in Berlin taking a look at Sony's smart
glass concept so for now the design is a
little clunky but what these basically
do is something very similar to Google
glass and that is to to project an image
in front of you in your field of vision
for now this is controlled using this
external pad here there's a touch pad on
there as well and a button to activate
the camera that you can see here on the
front however Sony tells me that
eventually these things will be able to
monitor your eyes movements to handle
things like scrolling that way so what
are you going to actually use these
things for well Sony's given us a few
examples for instance you could have a
recipe up on the screen to keep your
hands-free while you're cooking you
could wear them while out and about
walking down the street to use augmented
reality to identify what buildings
around you are or my personal favorite
because these things are in contact with
your phone you can use facial
recognition to look at the database of
the images in your contacts and
recognize the people around you and
maybe even tell you where you know them
from saving you social embarrassment so
as mentioned this is only a concept for
now so don't expect to be able to buy it
anytime soon but it's definitely a cool
demonstration of what some smart glasses
could do so stay tuned I'm the Westway
