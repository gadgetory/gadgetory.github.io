game I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update after much hype and rumor
the Moto X smartphone has been unveiled
and this is an Android phone that will
be a true challenger to Samsung's Galaxy
S line this is the first flagship phone
from Motorola Mobility since google
bought the company in 2011 the Moto X is
born from the union of motorola's
hardware strength with Google software
smarts the Moto X comes closest to
offering a clean Android user interface
that is aside from the Nexus phone there
are some software tricks that make the
Moto X Android experience a little
different and these are the same tricks
that can be done on the brand new
motorola droids at Verizon there's the
ability to twist your wrist to wake up
the camera quickly you can check the
time and messages on the unlock screen
and without turning on the phone it'll
respond to voice commands with three
magic words ok Google now so how can it
be always listening for your voice
command without draining the battery by
using a new tactic to separate different
elements of the system on a cluster of
processors the feature that listens for
your voice is powered on its own ship so
it doesn't burn through the battery the
Moto X is said to get one full day of
battery life with normal use so why
would you go with a moto x instead of
the droids at verizon a few reasons
software-wise the Moto X won't have any
verizon's extra junk pre-loaded on it
but it will be sold at verizon as well
as for other US carriers AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile
Sprint and US cellular Motorola phones
have previously been disjointed on
different carriers before and having the
same phone on every carrier will give
the brand more strength to take on the
Galaxy S and iPhone and the Moto X brand
will have more versions including a
cheaper one for no contract customers
the Moto X is assembled in America and
it has a 4.7 inch screen with a curved
back and that back side will be
customizable if you order through the
Moto maker website customers can pick
from a variety of colors and accents and
you'll be able to eventually order it in
different types of wood yes wood with
options like BAM boutique ebony and
rosewood customization will only
available at first for 80 the other
carriers will follow if you buy it from
a store the only options will be black
and white with 16 gigs of memory for two
hundred dollars under contract and these
phones will be rolling out at the end of
this month Motorola is working with Sol
Republic to make headsets Bluetooth
speakers and cases that match the Moto
X's custom colors that your tech knees
