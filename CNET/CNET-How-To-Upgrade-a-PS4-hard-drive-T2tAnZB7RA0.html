the Xbox one is that 500 gigabyte hard
drive can actually be replaced the
process is relatively simple but before
we get started let's take a look at what
you'll need to get the job done
the PlayStation 4 supports a normal
laptop hard drive or a solid-state drive
both of which measured 2.5 inches in
length the drive must be at least 160
gigabytes and no thicker than 9.5
millimeters we opted for 256 gigabyte
solid state drive which should deliver
slightly faster load times you'll also
need a USB drive with at least 1
gigabyte of space a Philips head
screwdriver and a computer with internet
access but more on that later with the
console laying flat apply slight
pressure to the glossy black cover and
slide it down
next take the Philips head screwdriver
and remove the single screw that has the
traditional PlayStation shapes on it
then just pull the hard drive tray out
and remove the four screws that keep the
drive intact
once it's out simply replace the drive
screw it into the tray and then secure
the tray in place getting the cover back
on to be a little tricky instead of
sliding it from the bottom come from the
top and snap it back into place now grab
your computer and go to Sony's website
to download the ps4 software update but
make sure it's a fresh install file
connect the USB to your computer and
format to fat32 this can be done on
Windows with a right-click on the drive
and selecting format once complete open
the drive and create a folder titled ps4
inside that folder create another one
titled update in all caps then place the
update file inside of it
make sure the console is turned off and
plug in the controller and USB drive
power the system on in safe mode by
holding the power button for seven
seconds tap the PlayStation button on
the controller when prompted to do so
and scroll down to initialize
PlayStation 4 from the safe mode menu
after installing the update from the USB
Drive the system will restart and boot
up as if it were the first time you
pairing it on if you have any questions
reach out to me on Twitter and be sure
to check out my article on how to
cnet.com for more detailed instructions
and that link you'll need to get the job
done
