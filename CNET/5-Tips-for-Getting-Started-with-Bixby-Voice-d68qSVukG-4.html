rolling out to users who signed up for
the early access beta here are 5 tips
and tricks to get you started with
Bigsby voice by default Bigsby voice has
an ombre purplish brown background you
can change the color to a blueish purple
by going to Bigsby home settings and
then background color 3 more color
options are available but only after
you've leveled up
that's right Samsung has gamified Bigsby
by rewarding users with XP for using
Bigsby to make calls send messages or
change settings
you also get xp for giving feedback
suggesting new phrases or responses like
Siri and Google Assistant Bixby can
control some of the settings on your
phone this is one area where Bixby has a
clear advantage over Google's voice
assistant for instance both google
assistant and Bixby can turn on the
flashlight
but Bixby can toggle the power saving
mode the same goes for the performance
mode blue light filter always-on display
Smart View Do Not Disturb and virtually
every other setting available on the
phone for other settings you just have
to be a little more specific with your
commands for example you can say things
like open settings and increase the font
size like with Google assistant you can
also create command shortcuts called
quick commands these are shortened
versions of a full command that might be
easier to say for instance instead of
open settings and increase the font size
you could just say increase the font
size
however unlike shortcuts for Google
assistant you can't just create a quick
command from scratch you must go to
Bigsby voice then history and select a
previous command or go to Bixby home my
Bigsby then quick commands then no need
to tap Add from there you have to speak
the shortened command instead of typing
it in when typing in any app with the
default Samsung keyboard you can hold
the Bigsby button to dictate you just
have to turn the feature on first go to
Bixby home then settings and tap the
toggle to the right of dictation on
keyboard to use dictation tap in a text
field in any app press and hold the
Bigsby button and speak your words will
be transcribed as you speak then release
the button when you're finished instead
of pressing the Bigsby button you can
wake your phone by saying Bigsby so long
as you have voice wake-up enabled so you
will need to unlock your phone
for most commands to work and it will
impact your battery life you can also
open Bixby voice by going to Bixby home
tapping the Bixby voice icon at the top
of the screen then tap the Bigsby icon
at the bottom of the screen to speak a
command if you don't want to speak a
command to Bixby or you want to search
for a command recommendation open Bixby
voice in full screen mode
then tap search commands you can also
press and hold the Bigsby boys icon at
the bottom of the screen and drag it
over the keyboard icon that appears once
the keyboard opens you can search for
commands or type out your own command
