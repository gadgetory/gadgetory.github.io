home security system you pick from a
number of different packages with
different configurations of sensors or
you build your own custom package then
you stick everything up around your home
packages start around two hundred and
fifty nine dollars and you get 24/7 live
monitoring for fifteen bucks a month or
twenty five a month if you want to be
able to monitor everything from your
phone to there's no contracts no
installation fees customers to DIY
monitored security the problem was that
the devices themselves were ugly as held
really dated designs now something safe
is trying to fix that this year with
third gen devices that look a lot better
and also promise better battery life
there's also a better variety of sensors
to choose from in addition to the usual
suspects like motion detectors contact
sensors and the keypad you can also add
in things like leak detectors freeze
sensors and glass break sensors
everything comes with sticky pads and
detachable backs making it really easy
to move sensors around as needed and you
can fine-tune all of it right from your
phone there's a lot of thought put into
the system and it's really easy to use
the base station talks to everything and
then connects with your phone over Wi-Fi
for security it also includes a battery
backup and a fee free cellular
connection with the company's monitoring
service even if the Wi-Fi or the power
goes out it can still call for help soon
you'll be able to arm your system with
Alexa voice commands - those are all
strong points and simply saves favor but
the system isn't perfect the contact
sensors and leak detector worked
perfectly in my test and the motion
detector did a great job at
distinguishing between people and pets
but the free sensor was too slow to
recognize temperature swings and the
glass break sensor though it does work
was a bit finicky you can add the motion
sensing simply cambiar setup for $99 but
we didn't like that one as much as
competitors like the nest cam or Netgear
are low and you can't add cameras like
that to the system the system also
doesn't do quite as much as competitors
like ADT to bring home automation into
play and let you incorporate things like
smart lights into your systems that
might soon change though along with that
upcoming Alexa integration and an
integration with the nest thermostat
simply safe says it has its own smart
lock coming soon simply say it has a lot
of new competition now but it's still a
very good home security system and a
good budget option that doesn't feel
like a budget option
the bounty of features and options for
customization give you plenty of control
over how you use it and in the end it
works reliably enough to provide peace
of mind against fire flood and a variety
of home invasion scenarios I liked it in
2014 and I like it now too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
