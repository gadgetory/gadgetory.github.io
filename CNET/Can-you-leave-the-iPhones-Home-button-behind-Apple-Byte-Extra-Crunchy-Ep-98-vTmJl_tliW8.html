the Apple by decra country podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tom what's up
everybody what's up welcome to the show
it is believe it or not episode 98 on
the Apple byte extra crunchy are
complimentary to our weekly show yo
Beecham 98 bro 98 we're getting close
we're getting close to what most listen
what's that timing wise 100 should fall
on the actual week of the Apple's
keynote announcement which has been
confirmed for September 12 but again for
all you guys and gals that are out there
to be a part of our show we got again a
boatload of calls the number to call us
is that as I read this one eight hundred
six one six two six three eight all you
have to do is leave your name where are
you from and get get to it about like
you know a minute if you have a good
point we'll let you go a little longer
but we had a couple people that were
clearly pushing the boundaries yes that
were unaccepting liberties I like to say
they're taking the race alright so we we
wanted to jump off in the show we have a
special guest today you've heard him the
man the myth the legend senior editor
Scott Stein covers really all things
Apple all things everything at CNET
Scott welcome to the show hey thank you
for the intro that is very ambitious
sounding I'm glad to be here well you
know yeah I'm business I mean myth I
think that's accurate then I'm a myth
that I review all things and only review
a small portion and I've seen it sings
but I do cover a lot of the stuff that
we're talking about and like the stuff
that Apple's getting into you is that
why we have you on the show typically
after keynotes or once and well because
it's related to Apple does that make
sense
I guess so absolutely all right so
everyone um
you know we wanted to jump into this and
talk about it Apple sent out their
official announcement for September the
12th this is something that's been
rumored I think what's exciting Scott is
you're gonna be going to the event but
this is the first time they're gonna
hold it at the Steve Jobs theater yes
Apple Park this is our entrance to Apple
Park which so
like we're gonna get like wristbands and
get to go on rides and stuff it is it's
the new campus and except for a few
behind-the-scenes peeks no one's gone in
fact it was not even some people thought
it wouldn't even be there
it was very up in the air about that I
feel like it would be because you know
10th anniversary of the iPhone or the
10th year anniversary edition they want
it to be there and so it is and so like
that'll be as much of a character in
this as anything you know what what are
they gonna show not just how comfy the
seats are you know like how are those
nice apparently $14,000 seats like we'll
talk about those but we'll also you know
will they give us a tour or you know
what other elements will be invoked
it'll be interesting
are you excited about going to the
campus and honestly like not many people
are gonna be able look I don't get
invites anymore because I have they
don't like my mouth okay but are you
excited about going to check this place
out oh yeah no they I'm really curious
about what what went into the design
here because you know there was a lot of
money there was a lot of design effort
like what's going on here what is this
theater does it all seem Apple Store
esque does it seem you know something
different
yeah so that's gonna be totally new
after a lot of years covering iPhone
launches but usually in places that are
like the Bill Graham Civic Center or you
know on Apple's older campus or like
more public spaces so you know I do I
can't say when I when I registered for
this the process was a little different
I got sent something to add to Apple
Wallet so kind of like Samsung's Note
event I got a little QR code thing that
I've gotten out of check-in so that's
new who knows what it would you know
what this is really entering though how
they're putting their pass and access to
the event on your phone because there's
actually sports teams are starting to do
this where basically you won't even be
able to get into the arena now unless
you have a phone like they're forcing
the ticket system to be directly on your
phone that's crazy
like I guess everyone has a phone but
still I know but still not everyone you
know you're right everyone has a phone
but not everyone that goes to sporting
events has
i phone unite or a current Android phone
like it's just kind of like the
assumption is now you have to have a
phone to get in I I think it's wild I
mean it's just one of those subtle
shifts that you're like oh yeah we are
moving forward you know you have to
order to print out that QR code and keep
it in your pocket or something if that's
even a possibility but yeah I'm curious
about the space and I'm obviously
curious about all the products you know
in the degree which there might be
surprises that we're not ready for yet
yeah yeah I think there's I think
there's a chance although we know a lot
of the rumors that are coming out
there's a chance that we're gonna see
some things that are gonna be that we
haven't heard about just I don't know
I'm honestly pretty geeked out about
this event I think there's gonna be
first of all Apple's gonna throw down
the hammer with pretty much the
remaining products that they haven't
announced yet so right we're expect to
see Apple watch Apple TV new iPhones but
even though we've seen what the iPhone
looks like it's different when you see
how they're actually gonna make it work
I did want to before we go on to talking
about that in a second I didn't want to
touch upon the invite that they sent out
yeah that the invite itself had this
like message on it that said let's meet
at our place and it was funny the first
thing that someone commented on it was
like keynote and chill it's very it's
very very very people first I think was
his name was Cody Armstrong he's like
keynote in chill I'm like wow wow it's
just kind of come on up for a drink yeah
very I don't know I I'm stoked to see
just the engineering to design that one
unto it
um let's jump into a little bit we're
gonna kind of touch upon one story it's
really the big story of the week from
Bloomberg and Mark Germann I don't know
were you able be able to see this how
they talked about some of the potential
new gesture controls that this new
iPhone will have did you I read about
that so I'm just gonna touch upon it
really quickly for people that aren't
caught up to speed that are listening
for the first time we know that the
iPhone 8 or at least rumored iPhone 8
iPhone future whatever they call it is
expected to remove the actual home
button all designs renders and
indications point to that it will not
have iPhone oh sorry a home button on
the screen where we're used to and
instead it'll be approaching it
some sort of you know software gesture
control or whatnot so according to
Bloomberg and according to mark German
the new high-end iPhone will actually
have a software dock similar to what
we've seen in iOS 11 and the iPad pro
and it does make total sense
there are some video concept videos that
are out there that are showing based on
using like the developer tools and kind
of the simulators what it might look
like but basically you're gonna have a
dock on your iPhone with a swipe up or
swipe down to you know to either unlock
potentially use to unlock your screen if
you don't want to use the face lock I I
think it's interesting though because no
matter what it appears that face unlock
is going to be really the the de-facto
method unless you want to swipe your
screen and then type in your code Scott
what are your thoughts on just the force
you know quite honestly just the nature
of yeah you can type in your digits but
this face not gonna be just like in in
our face the whole time on this thing
it's like hard to tell without trying it
you know it's something that sounds
annoying but then if it works really
well then maybe we love it so I think
it's always a bit of a risk when you
introduce some a new technology like
that nobody has used it and we don't
know how it's gonna feel if it's
essential then you know how do you how
do you live with that or do you like the
switch I feel like when Apple introduces
new tech usually they kind of start with
like small small steps into the tech
like touch ID even now you don't need to
use touch ID it's never like you know
connote you always have the password
passcode option it was only available
for a couple of things at launch and
then it opened up two more features
same thing with 3d touch well the 3d
touch still needs a lot of help but I
think that if you have face unlocked I
just can't imagine them getting rid of
touch Aidid completely because for
payments that's already worked into the
system to make a move away from that you
got to be really really ready for that
and then how do you manage between face
unlock security and touch ID security on
all the other devices so I still feel
like they might take baby steps of face
unlock and maybe it's like an additional
feature but you still have
touch ID until it moves it would just be
weird but I think the doc makes sense
I'm a little worried only in the sense
that I've been using iOS 11 on the iPad
and it's it's it's cool but it's it's
also very swipey you know there's a lot
of to me I I feel like they're one too
many swipes and if you start doing that
and we talked about the home button
going away for a while a couple of years
now we were thinking about this and how
does it how do you do it in a way that's
not annoying if you have too many
gestures then you're I'm worried about
like two of these equaling what was one
of those and like and then you're like
oh crap so I'm sure Apple's thinking
about that maybe you know some groups in
an Android already like a lot a lot more
like screen awareness that maybe things
start you know awaking on a tap bringing
up zones that maybe or where you tap
them like ways the screen could activate
more simply and I would like the dock to
be at least a lot more apps I like that
idea yeah yeah yeah we could have maybe
dial-up and like on a Mac each of the
apps kind of gets bigger and you could
kind of just bring your finger over and
launch the one you won Debbie guides I'd
you know to your point about iOS 11 for
people that haven't been able to play
with it as much on the iPad you can
flick up down from the bottom up to
reveal the dock but then you have to do
kind of like a longer from the bottom
and then all the way up to access right
the different like you know volume
control the control center type stuff
and there's times where you know that
subtle swipe versus the longer swipe can
be confused or just by habit you're
you're used to just doing a little flick
instead of a long flick and then you're
like which flicked you know it there's
those moments that I've had right also
like here's the other thing so touch ID
may not be able to be worked under a
screen but already the virtual home
button is just a slab that has vibration
if you have a screen that has the taptic
engine beneath it I'm not so sure that's
gonna feel any different you know I'm a
very home button feeling thing for all
the we say the home buttons going away
maybe you still have effectively a home
button when you when you
touch that area with 3d touch or
whatever it vibrates and you still get
that feeling of a tactile thing so I
have a feeling like it all it won't feel
it'll give you a tactile feel in a way
that will feel more satisfying than just
like oh it's just a screen yeah and so
you know for people that aren't super
familiar just go check out some like iOS
11 iPad videos to see in you know in it
from all indications it'll give us a
general idea we don't know anything
officially right this is all still why
we talk about it because it's fun and
everyone wants to talk about the
speculation around what is it really
going to actually function like we're
gonna find out and basically less than
less than two weeks now or two weeks
yeah about two weeks now yeah week from
next Tuesday yeah so um we're gonna find
out really soon but it's it's
interesting to see how that all is going
to play out um I did also want to talk
about this week there was kind of a big
push and a lot of articles around AR kit
because Apple actually showed off some
of the first AR kit apps to reporters
Scott you were one of those people and
so I kind of wanted to have you talk
about which of the apps you actually got
to see and what was your experience we
saw a our kit demoed for the first time
at WWDC in a very rudimentary just like
furniture light pieces but you saw some
more stuff well what did you actually
see yeah so I got to see a little bit
Shaun Hollister also got familiarized
with some things too and they weren't
all the same things were different
different places so what I got to see
mainly was the IKEA and it looked really
good and I was surprised because I've
already seen furniture placement apps
like this I've used Ango so I'm familiar
with the landscape I've used Lowe's
vision anything it's also like is it
Mayfair there's another one that deals
with furniture placement in the room but
Lowe's vision for instance you can place
a chair in the room and it looks cool
and it's a great example of how it stays
in space but that's using three deficits
and cameras on Apple's it's not using
depth-sensing in the same idea that
tango is it's it's a little more
simulated where the camera plus your
motion on the chip
do effectively the same thing so I mean
I picked a chair I put it down in the
room and I walked around totally held in
place and it looked good enough that if
I snapped a shot of it you'd probably
think that was a real chair in the room
like and that's the cool part as the
graphics are so much better in a are on
a our kit than they were on tango using
the one phone I use the fab two pro or
the Asus zenfone 4 what I used a little
bit that what was they they invited me
to kind of go up and look at the details
on the chair and that was where it was
cool because I got in really close and I
could look at the weave on the chair or
you could look at like the grain on it
basically the same way that the graphics
are rich in any iPhone game but now
you're combining with a sense of depth
and now you're like well now I can check
out a detail which is really useful so
that was cool and I also took it took
another look again at at Star Wars
holographic chess real that is a real
game coming out I thought was a demo at
first and now apparently it's a real
game and it's exactly yeah this is
holographic chess from Star Wars like
you're playing this on a tabletop you
put the board down you walk around it
holographic Jabba I think it's Java or
one of the huts is sitting across from
me and that's really cool it's kind of
oh it's not quite as impressive as the
IKEA one just because that you're
looking at a game the IKEA one is like
oh this is actually in the room and is
meant to look like a real thing is there
okay so you talk about you know the IKEA
one I totally I'm excited about that one
that was like when I heard that they
were doing one like that I was like oh
my gosh I was like this is this is a
perfect application for this but I'm
curious when you use the Star Wars
hollow chest game does it open up the
potential for like an accessory where
maybe you have your like phone mounted
unlike some neck strap so you can see it
here because I can't imagine you want to
play a hollow chest like yeah holding a
phone the entire it's chess where am I
doing this the whole time and I'm going
like extended periods of time
I think it
a real problem for design and I agree I
think there's a point what you just want
to turn holographic mode off and just
play star wars chess and you say I don't
need to hold this up I'm sure that that
excitement will fade but it does bring
up the thought of like when well you
know I'm sure it's in the plan sometime
for Apple then go explore
you know glasses or things like that but
in a new time how how quickly do we have
that urge to do it and will any
accessories support it an Apple does not
really has not said really clear yes or
no on that some AR headsets like the
mirror prism that I looked at which is
you know you pop your iPhone in and you
have like a kind of an AR or even you
know they said that they think that AR
kit is gonna really help them that they
think that you'll be able to combine AR
kit with theirs and so I'm curious like
you know I think if it is if it's a kit
and it's pretty open and my developer
maybe you can come up with ways to use
it the only thing I do know is that the
front-facing camera for the iPhone right
now is not set up to take advantage of a
our kit so if you flip it around it's
like the whole snapchat filter Facebook
filter idea it's not equipped for that
yet is that what you're saying exactly
yet I think with obviously 3d face
scanning and all that stuff if there's
any other shoe that Apple's gonna drop
it's going to be that the next iPhone or
iPhones have that built in maybe it's
not just the 8 maybe the others have
that scanning as well that could be that
could be the other surprise is that you
know maybe you know maybe they put that
face scanning tech into all the phones
and that creates a standard who knows
but um
total speculation but I I think that
that would be cool because then you
could have crazy face filters and who
doesn't like to look like a hamburger
well I think it'll make any easy
opportunity for all kinds of jokes and
lowlights of the keynote if we have to
start seeing Phil Schiller show off face
filters that the team is not turned into
a vampire
turn Elvis Presley yeah I'll leave that
to Craig federighi and everything um
that's really cool you know I also
thought was interesting just
industry-wide
is how right when we first heard about
air kid I mean you and I I remember when
we talked about it after it's like Apple
instantly has this huge install base
they can really push this forward
pokemons go was that was that killer app
that kind of unlocked people's brains to
be like oh now I understand how
augmented reality is cool in just this
real small example because the game was
so popular Google announced that they're
opening up a their own software
development kit to the public which is a
our core and I thought it was
interesting because right Google's been
working on this project tango thing
forever and it's always been this like
oh we're gonna create an augmented
reality phone all of a sudden Apple is
like hey we're just gonna make it
available to all our phones and this is
clearly a reaction to that I know they
have their own knowledge and information
and learning from tango but it's like oh
you know what what curious timing that
all of a sudden now they're like hey we
need to get a our core out to the public
because yeah apples kind of like has the
jump on us right now
yeah mindshare it's crazy that that
Google hadn't done that before because I
kept wondering like Facebook why did
they not enable this there probably is a
good reason in the sense that you could
see that Google was getting there
developing with tango being first to do
that and then when they announced at
Google i/o all the ars
the VR stuff that they were going to
have these standalone VR headsets they
use son called world sense that was
tango based to use dual cameras and I
was thinking like this is the beginning
of tango like drifting and I feel like a
our core is part of that and they keep
learning but also like Apple has said
with a arc it you need the graphics and
you this is like the hardware software
integration this is like apple like VR
VR is totally about finessing everything
to work seamlessly and with such little
lag AR is kind of like that too and so
Apple has a huge advantage designing
that Google could get there but with all
the different phones yep you have to
create a standards so I guess it's like
sa pixel for now but I thought they
would picked a dream as the standard but
maybe that will happen
it was weird though and it's totally
catch up and the Apple launched all of
its and
it's more of its apps as a counter
counterpunch and so it's like the air
Wars of 2017 yeah it's on it's on I just
I think it's really fascinating how in
pretty much less than a year all of a
sudden it's like just escalated right it
was like we didn't know what now once
they made those tools available and
people that are listening or reading or
watching they'll be like Oh
Google's copying Apple now Apple copy do
like ever guess everyone everyone copy
every popping everybody now is
everywhere hone away a good live stream
from anywhere you can from Instagram
YouTube you know there's like 20 places
to livestream face filters Facebook
everyone has it so that's what 2017 is
all about I guess everyone's getting
there at the same time or with each
other and then the other part that I
think is interesting about AR is that
it's kind of the beginning of a lot of
other things I don't think it's just
they are I think this is about the age
of super smart cameras so we see like
with Samsung and big sphere or the
promise of Bixby or Google ends the
ability to like recognize things and
tell you what they are and help you and
assist you I think that Apple's gonna
get into that a lot more too and
basically with computer vision the
smarter cameras are analyzing stuff the
more you can do augmented reality you
could also do other weird things once
those cameras it's like NAB you know
it's it's basically autonomous vehicles
and drones and any anything where the
cameras used to navigate I wonder if
Apple's basically going to be using its
next-gen cameras on the iPhone as the
first step towards that basically it's
not that far away from the idea of
assisted autonomous camera systems or
you know if you could have it apples
into accessibility maybe it would help
be an all-seeing eye to recognize things
or help with things maybe there's more
to that phone camera and what it does
than just the AR well I think also you
know when we talk about different
philosophies of how Steve Jobs and Tim
Cook have approached you know being the
CEO I think one of the things that Tim
Cook has really tried to emphasize is
the fact that like he's trying to make
you know for example his Apple watch
push
it wasn't like Oh part of it is yeah
sure we want to make a cool watch but I
think he was really more locked into
like focusing on the health aspects how
this can change the medical field you
know those were kind of the way that he
focus I think Steve Jobs not that he did
wouldn't care about those things would
probably been more focus on let's make a
really cool watch that you can do cool
things with that changes your life where
Tim Cook has taken the approach of let's
make this watch something that could
potentially revolutionize the health
industry you know and improve people's
lives and I think that when you talk
about the camera approach and a our
approach in accessibility and services I
wouldn't be surprised if you know he
sees it in those similar ways yes
there's games applications but in his
brain
it's more like we want this to go beyond
just fun we want this to like change
people's lives there's even indications
in the some of you know that firmware
that was released around the home pod of
how the camera was able to have code in
there to potentially detect not only
just different types of scenes but very
specific items and photos and it kind of
lends kind of another layer to what
you're talking about of the age of the
potential smart cameras trying to
develop or smart cameras in addition
what they are kit definitely I think
that's that's the whole other shoe
dropping with AR and those cameras that
they're gonna talk about I would expect
them to talk about at the show yeah so
um very very cool stuff around the AR I
did want to touch upon another point
before we roll out with you Scott you
just did a great story about the air
pods and I kind of wanted you to talk
about talk about just the story and what
you wrote about yeah so um you know
stalking with John Falcone at CNN we
were seeing this MPD report and it was
just based on that's at that report they
put out and we spoke with them about it
and it's just funny because a year ago
you know I was I was the the mean with
the air pods and I paw because I helped
that I helped that meme I helped get
them you launched the mean so we were
there we were at the beginning of that
where you put him in and everyone's like
what that it still though they still
look ridiculous on me so that hasn't
helped I've seen other people wear them
better but they become a relative
it's hard to say big success but they're
still really hard to find we don't know
the sales numbers sorry people listening
that can't see this we just posted the
picture okay continue on Scott I look
better since then I feel like I've
improved in a year now so I'll still
look ridiculous um so you don't know
what you don't know how many they've
they've sold but but the NPD Group does
retail tracking can you take me
seriously with these on and they said
there's like 900,000 they call it
totally wireless headphones so the
important thing here is that they're
dominating total total wireless
headphone sales in dollars in the u.s.
like so now not necessarily units but
the report was that they're the top ones
in the market which you'd kind of expect
because there aren't that many players
and total Wireless is just in fully
independent wireless headphones so it's
not all Bluetooth headphones but you got
like braggy and Samsung and others who
are in that space not a ton yet because
I mean Beats doesn't have its own low
pizza's Apple but I mean for instance
they don't have their own fully
independent in their brand but it just
points out this has become you see a lot
of people wearing the more I do I see a
lot of people wearing them now I think
people have gotten into them I would not
surprise me to see Apple launch a new
pair of air pods at this event
no really you think you might see that
I'm even if there's a four week wait
even with the four week wait yes
everyone thinks I'm crazy if I'm right
then yay yeah I'll bow down I'm bow down
I'll bow down if okay I'm gonna put that
down I said to John I was saying before
I thought there'd be a new Apple watch I
just think it's one of these products
that now it's become iconic for them
it's related to the iPhone and Apple
watch and it take a whole other year off
without a new version seems strange and
plus there are things you could actually
improve like for instance if they have
contact was charging why not make the
case contactless charging or one rumor
says the case charges the watch or the
phone may be of new colors maybe you
make these not so long or you add better
tips or you add heart rate tracking or
the yet most interesting part would be
better wireless connectivity because
Bluetooth five
has longer range better throughput and
these go out on me a lot and I don't
know myself
they blip they whip out a blip and it's
really annoying so what if they build a
more reliable one maybe in the new
phones have better Bluetooth which I
would expect better Wireless and that
would be a reason to get them maybe they
don't come out until like your just
because they were announced at an event
the products don't come out right away
maybe it's like that just like in the
WWDC thing where the imac comes out in
december a home pod comes out in
december maybe these come out in
december and these rotate scott scott
they actually did that last year with
the air pods exactly they come out until
[Laughter]
unintentionally or who knows yeah so
maybe they come out once again in
december like not a ret not immediately
but I just I just think that they have
the market for that lined up and I just
think they're gonna want to talk about
it or announce something I mean I be I I
agree with you I don't know if I'll
honestly I don't know if we'll see one
yet because their supply and demand is
still like has yet to even remotely
catch up so right even just from that
standpoint you know like the thing about
it is I think maybe olds like SJ star a
Steve Jobs would have probably pushed
for it but just seeing how Tim Cook
operates it's like you know because he's
such a logistical guy it's like
obviously they're working on new air
pods behind the scenes but it's like oh
we're still four-week catch-up we need
to close that gap it'll buy us more time
to get the new air pods right and then
finally when we've caught up and finally
when we see the numbers you know maybe
plateauing then we'll announce the new
one I you know I agree with you I think
the old school psychology of Apple would
have been like let's put out another one
in a year right but I think also because
of just all these different products
that doing it's different and I kind of
lean on how Tim Cook has shown how he
operates in the past to be like well
maybe they won't but if they do I mean
yeah I'll give you all the props man
earpods sport earPod plus if you call
them air pot airs it's so good the other
thing that
the other thing that I wanted to bring
up in your story just because it might
slip just to give you an idea you said
you know oh the majority of dollars are
being spent on Apple's air pods
according to report eighty-five cents of
every dollar spent this year on the
totally wireless earphone category has
gone to Apple 85 cents per dollar that's
huge that's well we they're the only
ones who I think have really carved out
a brand identity in down space I mean
I'm sure David Carr no doubt will yell
at me about that because he'll say this
is the sign I forgot but I think that
I've used here ones and I've used I've
looked at biragi and things like that
those are really fringe and Samsung is
launching a new version of its icon X
headphones but they're very sport
oriented so yeah I just think you know
they kind of stand alone in that in that
space which is why it's it's not a total
surprise and now yeah I just wonder
where else they're gonna do about it
maybe it's a new case it well it's weird
though because like you said right it's
not a total surprise we kept on joking
like oh guy those things look like
horribly horribly awkward and I still
think they do but we also agreed that
they're probably gonna sell a boatload
of them and it's true they have and it's
just like it just again it always
reminds you to never underestimate the
power of the brand like well they have
ineffectively they have a very long
battery life because you're basically
always recharging them fast in the case
they feel good in that regard they their
Auto switching is really cool not
between devices but just between ears
correct that stuff feels really new and
helpful but yeah exactly like what a lot
of it I think is just a bit about this
or phenomenon of the identity of the
product yeah I in a weird way I think
the the heavy the heavy hot take
opinions which you know that's that's
honestly part of our job to have fun
with those hot takes it brought more
attention to the category because I
think it people there once you say
something bad about it you're gonna have
people on the other side of the coin
that I'm gonna say good things about it
almost like they have to defend any
product that Apple puts out as
this is the product in much like phones
you know people really for whatever
reason still take it really personally
when you talk bad about a brand they
care about
I've always found that fascinating like
that they really based on how they talk
they really take it personally when you
just say oh this phone isn't as good as
this it's like really like is it really
is that how and it's not just kids it's
grown man
I think it's grown men oh yeah there's a
lot of there's a lot of passion about
this stuff I've ever talking to Samsung
gear watch owners who were like super
passionate remember the reviews and they
like talk about them and so I was like
that's cool there's like a following
that's going back to like the original
gear watch like they're the second
generation like not even recent 2014
yeah there's a lot I mean look the
reason it's good those passion I mean
we're passionate about it we just don't
personally attack people when they
disagree on it with us about a phone but
I think you know that passion is isn't
what why we do what we do and why it's
exciting to talk about this stuff if
people didn't care we would not have
jobs I mean I might have a job somewhere
else like selling pencils like I've said
but you know we would have less exciting
jobs either either this or that yeah so
anyway Scott thanks so much for hanging
with this um you know we love talking
you just a lot of great stuff and I'm
hoping if you're free that we can
actually talk to you after the keynote
but I know there's a lot of things going
on so uh well we'll try and get you back
in here but thanks a lot man that was
awesome no be great thanks thanks Jeremy
hey guys go both of you Brian - yeah
thanks all right
so okay we'll take a little break
is that one a doobie yes yeah we'll take
a break and then Scott you're free to go
my man alright yeah I'm Claire alright
thanks man
thank you alright guys we're gonna take
a little break for a second we right
back and we are back with mr. Brian Tom
we just want to say thank you to mr.
Scott Stein again for chiming in to the
Apple byte extra crunchy we also wanted
to note that this episode of the Apple
byte was brought to you by nobody and
now we return back to our regular
scheduled programming all right thank
you nobody thank you nobody really
appreciate the love but yes all right
let's jump back into the show um there
are more iPhone news stories we're gonna
kind of crunch through a bunch of things
but just kind of some quick notes to
make we know that Aoife is actually
happening in Berlin this is where a lot
of companies other than Apple right
Samsung Sony Huawei others showcase some
of their new goods and announce new
products but coming out from Aoife
according to some reports case makers
believe the names of the new iPhones
will be iPhone 8 iPhone 8 plus and
iPhone
addition in fact in fact some of them
have actually updated their internal
SKUs based on this information to
actively start printing packaging with
their new third party cases this remains
to be seen but that is what the chatter
is over at Aoife in Berlin I found that
really interesting
I love the iPhone edition it's catchy to
me I mean I actually have I have a song
lined up if that's what they're gonna
call it because but it moved away from
iPhone edition so then I kind of stopped
and I'm like oh man if they bring it
back we'll be ready to roll I kind of
like it too but it doesn't doesn't
really roll off the tongue iPhone
edition I don't know but are you
thinking of like a new addition song is
that what you're thinking about um not
really because it would have to the
lyrics would have to roll off the tongue
like you say but uh I got some I guess
but if they make it iPhone 8 then I'm
gonna have to start from scratch
that's all I'm gonna say right on it's
kind of tough um we also wanted to touch
base we talked about this last week but
really for some reason even though we've
actually been talking about it for more
like a month or so it really got
traction these rumors or rumblings that
the iPhone was going to cost somewhere
around a thousand dollars I don't know
if you saw people talking about it but
because the New York Times posted oh you
know we believe that you might have to
pay a thousand dollars this has been
talked about in the community on the
Apple byte within the rumor circle for
at least a month or so and then everyone
started you know my friends started
saying hey is the iPhone really gonna be
$1000 I'm like how much do you pay for
your phone right now I think that all of
a sudden this I'd this idea of a
thousand dollars is scaring people even
though they don't realize they're
already paying probably around $800 for
their phone yeah if you just break that
down overpayments yeah fine your bill
might be $10 more but I don't think
people are going to care I really don't
well when did when did the price go up
like the iPhone 7s went up right it I
think I recall the six was around six
hundred seven hundred dollars or
something like it around 650 700 at the
time yeah so the 7 was really the first
time there was a big sort of price
increase
I feel so to say yeah yeah yeah so now
the next thing Karen is gonna go over up
even more but that's just if you buy it
outright
right well even whether you buy it
outright or they they spread the
payments for two years right it's still
gonna be a lot and the eye acceptor
remind people that though 128 gig iPhone
7 plus was already a thousand dollars
after tax oh wow so they've actually
already sold technically a $1000 phone
yeah so again it's like people that are
freaking I'm like dude people are
already doing this I literally don't
think it's gonna stop people that really
want it from getting the phone so might
actually get Apple more profitable it
will it will money you know it will so
we'll see how that all shakes out on
this one is a quick story just about you
know iPhone platforms in general
Apple has acknowledged that they've the
leadership for the Siri team has
officially moved off from Eddy Cue to
Craig federighi in a quote says Craig
federighi is Apple's senior vice
president of software engineering
reporting to CEO Tim Cook he now
oversees the development of iOS Mac OS
and Siri organ originally that was
allocated Eddy Cue I find this
interesting I didn't even know this you
know I don't pay attention to every
single detail but think about this Eddy
Cue is a services guy from a standpoint
of like iTunes Store Apple music like it
doesn't make sense for him to oversee
Siri
hey that doesn't even find you have some
services though I mean yeah it's like
makes sense to me I mean you know Siri
is like almost a service you asked her a
question and she serve something about
you but it's like a I it's like
artificial intelligence you should have
someone who's heading that to be like
you know from from the software
development side right series make basic
most glaring problems is just not as
smart as other AI so I don't know how a
services guy is gonna be able to do that
like clearly when I see what Apple did
with a arc it they'll and we had
reported that they had built huge teams
around a arc it they're gonna go all in
and that shone is what we've seen at
least initially and how it's at least in
the minds of the public has started to
take off with this first batch of apps
but it's like put a team behind Siri
like that fine if they just report to
Eddy Cue and say this is what we're
doing I think you need someone
specifically on Siri when it is one of
the weaker points of Apple someone to be
a strong person that's gonna drive that
forward and be like basically be a jerk
about it right like an anal retentive
jerk about yeah so they like just kind
of rearranging the deckchairs here or is
it just yeah
seems like a big almost like a big
shake-up like he's not getting the job
done so we needed to put someone else in
charge who might come in and whip the
team into shape or something you know I
just think from the outside Craig
federighi handling Siri makes more sense
because of how its integrated into the
operating systems which is his calling
you know yeah yeah
that makes more sense to me so
so that so that's just a little like you
said reshuffling in the background I
don't know if any of you all saw this
but we referenced ether earlier but Sony
released a new wireless enabled speaker
it does not use Siri but it looks very
familiar I love this yesterday too
it looks like a home pod it's the name
this is where Sony just completely fails
would you like to hear the name of the
product mr. Beecham sure it's the LFS
50g Wireless that's terrible
I'm trying to flow away here I'm trying
to find the link as the links not
working here hang on I mean it's not LF
s 50 G what are they doing my it looks
exactly like the air pot except it has
like little lights and numbers on it
yeah it's like the home pod with a
screen it uses the Google assistant so
therefore by default it's already going
to be really good the other catch about
this it's even when they revealed like
they took off the top of it it's very
similarly designed to the home pod now
granted it may not have the same
technology to optimize the playback in a
room they didn't really go dig deep in
that but um it's there it looks like a
home pot it totally looks like pong it's
wrapped in fabric it's a marshmallow it
comes in black or white it has a voice
assistant
the other big thing about this different
from the home pod is they cost two
hundred dollars a pop the home pod cost
350 oh wow yeah so hmm
well it looks like another thing that's
gonna collect a lot of dust actually
though that fabric on there man it's not
it's not the greatest design that I
think I think they look cool I'm not
gonna lie but I don't want it lit up it
does look cool anyway let me just rewind
this does the kind of I don't even want
to buy a whole pod for a 350 dollar 350
just to test it out but I mean I will
but it's like dude 350 yeah
that's an that's too much money man I
mean bro Bravo
too much price some people complain when
we say wow I'm not gonna listen to show
dude play bro
sorry alright Apple TV news we talked
about the early window pricing for
movies that Apple was trying to
negotiate with Studios last week at the
end of that week after our show ended a
new story popped out so if you haven't
read this we're gonna kind of cover over
some of the details but now in
anticipation for Apple releasing the new
Apple TV Forte model at the new keynote
that is expected to happen on September
the 12th Apple is going back and forth
with movie studios about pricing for
teen movies so this is a report from The
Wall Street Journal and what's happening
here is Apple is basically saying we
want to charge $19.99 for 4k movies 4k
versions of movies when they launched on
the iTunes Store the trick about that is
that typically a majority of at least
the blockbuster movies retail for $19.99
on Apple's iTunes Store now the studio's
want to charge $25 to $30 for a 4k movie
because they associate a premium with a
higher quality higher fidelity for that
movie which makes sense as well in The
Wall Street Journal report someone even
one of the sources inside dealing with
Apple was quoted as basically saying I
don't tell Apple how much the price
their iPads right why are you telling me
how to price my movie right and so we
put this in the recent weekly show the
Apple byte video podcast but what I
found interesting is some people like
why are you complaining about
Apple wanting lower prices for us but
here's here I'm not complaining about
that that aspect but this is again where
Apple thinks they hold the power and
right now especially with the movie
studios and TV studios they just don't
so remember Apple wanted to create a
skinny TV service subscription TV
subscription service earlier and they
were demanded it would be like a $30
package with these channels that's all
we want to do and the network's were
like no we don't want to do that so what
did they do
they made an agreement with every other
partner from Sony to sling to YouTube to
Hulu they those companies and those
groups are now making money from a TV
streaming service one that Apple wasn't
willing to negotiate with them because
guess what they're like
we don't need you and I think the same
thing is happening here you can buy 4k
movies from platforms like voodoo and if
Apple thinks that just because there are
iTunes again that the studio should have
them charge $25 and they're like no we
want 19 they don't hold the power again
it's it's one of those things where they
they still want to come from a position
of power but the industry has changed
and Studios can go to other platforms
that show off 4k content they don't need
the Apple TV to be there for K Savior
they just don't and they will there's so
much competition happening right now and
they can just easily go somewhere else
and make a deal but I'm also I'm kind of
against this charging a premium for a
higher resolution content because
eventually like in the next few years
everything's gonna be like that so it's
like it's like just a temporary cash
grab that they go for during this period
of time when there's like this
reshuffling of how content gets just
distributed you know so like oh we got
4k now so we can charge a little extra
money and then like in five years
everyone's gonna have five K at 4k and
it's not gonna matter anymore so then
that that will probably go away those
premium prices so I just think it's like
it's just a cash grab I don't like it I
don't like premium extra cost for
premium content I think that's a good
point actually I think that's a really
good point that you make about that cuz
I mean we did the same thing with HD
blu-ray like is anyone watching blu-ray
now you know I mean probably some people
I know I know but but are you actively
buying new blu-ray videos and stuff like
I don't know it just seems like
something that's gonna go away and the
it's gonna be gone pretty soon you know
what I mean I just think premium
charging more money for premium fidelity
or quality is it's kind of a lost thing
I don't know look I'll be the I'll be
the I am the dinosaur and I've admitted
it before I'm the guy that still buys
blu-rays cuz I want the highest fidelity
yeah and they'd say look awesome you
know but I mean how long is that gonna
last I know I know I mean you're right
you're right eventually it'll catch up
but also like I like part of the
psychology is right you can actually buy
movies two weeks before they come out on
physical now they're like trying to
encourage people to buy digital because
it's they honestly probably make more
margins from it because they don't have
to produce or print or press so they're
always like get it on digital I wait for
the physical copy so I can get a
physical version that is the best
fidelity and then it comes with the
download for free cuz like not free but
it's packaged with that for roughly the
same price like I don't I feel weird
just have again I'm old school I feel
but I invested in a system that looks
badass I'm like I'm not gonna get a
digital stream I'm not gonna do that so
yeah well it's somehow ploy some of the
digital distributors are doing like
amazing stuff now like HBO go and when
you stream like to chromecast on that
thing it looks incredible like it almost
looks better than my cable television
you know what I mean so you know nerdy
me sees the artifacting around the dark
Game of Thrones is like a real dark
scene you start to see like at least you
feel me on that cuz you're like that's
so annoying and it's whatever fine first
world problems dude first well you can
problems with that that might be our
Wi-Fi connection at our house who knows
but yeah that is a thing but it's
getting so much better like everyone's
being able to do it so much easier now
so I for example I would let one of one
of our co-workers borrow ablute the
blu-ray version of oh I think it was a
blu-ray version of Game of Thrones stuff
and then they came back who they're like
holy crap it looks so much better
compared to when you stream it I'm like
yeah I mean no doubt no doubt that's
totally true
I got my PS Quach my PS Quattro what am
I yes Quattro so we'll see how that
plays out but I think the biggest
concern is to me if Apple is rolling out
a 4k TV are sorry a 4k Apple TV at this
new keynote you need to come with 4k
content oh yeah
I'm curious gonna win that battle
because we have a couple more weeks
don't tell me you you're gonna say hey
we have a four capital T V and you can't
buy 4k movies for it you don't I'm
saying that sound that's just stupid
so we'll see who wins that battle
another quick follow-up about Apple 4k
TV at WWDC Amazon set or Apple announced
that the Amazon Prime video app would
finally be coming to Apple TV nice we
were expecting it to come around
sometime this September but according to
recode the Amazon Prime video TV app may
not even be ready for the Apple TV the
new Apple TV launched as well hmm and I
mean that also is just if it happens
Amazon Prime does have a few shows that
stream in 4k but let's say let's pretend
okay so if they don't make a deal with
the steals they don't get 4k movies to
buy on iTunes Amazon Prime video app
doesn't come out
that's another 4k source that they don't
have so what are they gonna launch to it
like hey Netflix happens to show some 4k
videos in 4k what was the other one duh
what's the other show oh yeah
carpool karaoke and 4k Wow no logos like
4k logo 4k so uh well we'll see how that
all shakes out but again I'm I don't
know about you beat them are you excited
about this keynote coming up in a couple
I am excited man cuz this could possibly
be my new phone I've had the same phone
for two years now so it could be my new
phone we don't know I don't know yet I'm
gonna see I'm I'm I'm honestly juiced
cuz we're just gonna see so much new
stuff I think it's gonna be very
interesting yeah all right you know what
Beach the show's been going a little
longer let's just skip over you want to
jump into the phone calls I think let's
do it
yeah we got a lot of money phone calls
laughs yes yes we considered that to
talk about should we go through the
gates first or should we go through like
the regular oh yeah yeah okay so
remember last week we were talking about
what would the new gate be for the
iPhone 8 / iPhone future so we had some
of you guys and gals call in
and this is what some of you all said
okay we have four of them wrote and
they're real real quick so we'll just go
through it
hey guys this is Kevin from Chicago
how's it going my boots with the next
gate from Apple would be faced gate
so these faced gate 17 better guys let
me show PC we agree we agree another one
for apples facial recognition face gate
makes sense right face gate thank you
yeah face gate so this this one came out
of left field and I was not expecting
this and it's a valid gate so let's see
twin gate twin gate white Wingate
because now all identical twins will be
able to unlock their twins phone
beautiful twin gay do you think there's
possible I mean I think it's possible if
they are truly identical the thing is
that how often are you gonna be next to
your twin like when you're younger maybe
and this this might affect 0.1% of the
population
yeah I dunno some identical twins and as
they get older and older they kind of
start to not look as much alike so that
you got that going for you okay so let's
go to the phone calls all right here's
the number first call we got this is
Matt from Georgia
it would make sense that Apple is
introducing a new Apple TV with all the
DirecTV now promotions back in December
and January they're running that
promotion where you buy three months for
free
you buy three months and you get an
Apple TV for free and then they just
reintroduced that same promotion so it
makes sense that they're dumping off all
of this inventory at a discount to make
way for a brand new Apple TV cool cool
series I think I think yeah I agree I'm
not in my head I mean he makes good
points there yeah all right
next call what a Beach what have done
Jordan from Denver Colorado two
questions on iPhone future how do you
think Apple will handle replacing faced
ID with touch ID do
face ID will play touch ID from my
banking other touch ID enabled apps
right away because I really do want to
go back to internet password like an
animal
I'll think that Apple will show back
into the Wi-Fi game and maybe package
together 3 Apple TV boxes that include a
mesh Wi-Fi solution I don't know they
could get a lot more Apple set-top boxes
in people's homes while solving crappy
Wi-Fi all at the same time what do you
guys think am I crazy keep up the good
work peace out from Silicon Mountain in
Silicon Valley that's true Denver Denver
baby that's a up-and-coming area also
with just Silicon Valley companies also
um the marijuana industry is quite quite
blossoming oven in that general area
Denver Colorado was the first to
legalize that huh I was there when it
happened - oh wow Brian was there I
would I spent a lot of time out there
can I help I help push for the
initiative no not really
um so when he talks about what was his
first comment that was cracking me up Oh
what was it I forget to 13 so replacing
to face ID with touch ID I don't think
we have a choice I mean if you want to
be an animal you you can go back to the
digit code right you savage you just
horrible savage person but no I think
that it's gonna force us to and if it's
as fast as they say it is I don't think
you'll it'll be a problem
I really don't if all the indications as
they say it's a one millionth of a
second it can detect it at an angle
maybe there's some tolerances that we
see it's one of those weird things where
we just have to see it in action and
then we'll be able to make a judgement
so it's hard it sounds like it could be
cool but I can't really give a verdict
on it until we actually see it play out
and then we'll we'll have a better idea
of what right now we're just talking
about in theory so but in if you're
asking will it replace it absolutely
it's gonna end up replacing it for at
least for this generation
maybe if something happens where there's
like a like a lot you know people lash
back at it that they might tweak it in
the next in the next phone but
we'll see it's it's probably the most
fascinating feature of the phone to me
of how it's gonna play out and what
about the wireless stuff he's talking
about having a set top box Wireless box
and everyone's home you think that's
gonna happen
well I think that if Apple has seen how
powerful a brand they are they should
have they should stay in the Wi-Fi game
I think we've talked about it on the
show multiple times that they're all
indications that Apple was no longer
going to build Wi-Fi routers and people
like what a mesh network solution is
we're really where it's at it's where
the entire industry is going so it would
be nice but I don't think it it would
just again make them have another thing
to focus on and in in a weird way if
they have to not do a mesh network
solution and I know like you're saying
integrate it with an Apple TV we've been
talking about that idea probably for two
or three years I don't know if they're
gonna do it but maybe that's a surprise
we'll see there it they could surprise
us but I don't want more to thing we've
got one more I mean baby I mean that
would be cool again I love what you're
thinking but there's no indication that
they're actually doing that now so all
right we've got two more and they're
pretty short so let's check them out
a beach and tong this is Brian from New
Orleans quick question is this the end
of the lockscreen photo I know that's a
minuscule fact compared to all the
technology that we're about to get but I
don't know about y'all I personally like
having my my lockscreen photos something
special to be there so just wanted to
hear y'all opinion on that and you know
what might replace the lockscreen
photo you just look at your phone and
unlocks guess you can't look at the
photo anymore discuss Thanks he's
absolutely right
I'm serious I'm sad about that - I'll be
sad wait I got my start out here look
how cute this guy is I get this guy
anyone you won't have them on there
anymore bro I know but look at my phone
he's gonna disappear it's gonna be like
nothing literally literally that picture
is no good anymore how am I ever gonna
see it again Brian unless I don't have
to open my phone and go through my
photos I'm sorry man
I'm sorry
man you know Tim can take give-and-take
Jake get out of here that's a that's a
really good point though right yeah it
is like let me see what I guess I can
show people to have on my screen beside
me and BAE uh yeah

pink wall and look like you're really
looking at something but you're not like

right last guy here we go
hey Steve and Brian question concerning
the carrier plan for the new iPhone 8
the financing plan for the carrier for
the iPhone 8 right now I'm paying around
$40 I just wanted to know what you guys
thought about what the carrier plan
financing would be for the new iPhone 8
some people are saying around $50 to
start a month I was just wondering what
your guys's ideas well it's about I'll
love you guys a show have a great day
bye bye $50 a month and there's a lot
wait is that on top of your like regular
like you know phone bill yeah that would
be on top of your phone bill that's
annette's see I'm not totally in the
know about how these things work but if
you're paying $50 a month and you're
paying your regular phone bill for data
and and minutes or whatever that's
that's a pretty hefty bill every month I
think you're pink you're paying more
than $50 a month you're gonna be really
paying closer to $60 a month if you're
getting a thousand plus dollar phone
they say that it's like a car payment
you know I mean you're basically buying
a laptop I mean our foot this is the
interesting thing right our phones are a
lot of our life that they're basically a
mini computer now you know like people
are using their computers more for work
and then using their phone as their
leisure device oh man to do everything
right I mean you're doing that I'm doing
that
mine is definitely 50/50 work and
leisure sure on top oh right yeah so I
think it's gonna be more than 50 quite
honestly so just buckle up I'm serious
for people that want to go ham on this
thing
I'm telling you like it's time to go
back to ramen dinners with the family
okay
something about the Nokia clamshell shut
you know flip phones you want mac and
cheese for lunch breakfast lunch and
dinner
you get an iPhone you get an iPhone at
8:00 totally we you know we need to do
whenever they come up with a price we've
got to do something like things you can
get instead of the iPhone eight that's a
great idea that's a great idea I'm just
like how many how many boxes are
freaking let's just get the cheap crappy
stuff like the cup of noodles ramen
could you get I don't know I'm just
thinking about that cuz right now my
phone bill is like 87 and that's like
with a special discount for for
something you know talking about 50
that's gonna be like a hundred ooh don't
make me do math I'm live on the air but
it's like a hundred hundred forty-seven
dollars that was incorrect like eighty

thousand dollars what do you have taxes
