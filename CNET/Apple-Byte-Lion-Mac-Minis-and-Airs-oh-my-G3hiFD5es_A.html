welcome to the apple byte it's all the
good and bad stuff inside the world of
Apple so let's get to the show now it's
a big week this week for all the Apple
fanboys I even saw two grown men cry
about the news and unfortunately I'm
away at comic-con 2011 but we want to
showcase some of the goodies so let's
check out what everyone has been waiting
for the new macbook airs i'm dan
ackerman and we are here taking a very
first look at the latest version of
apple's 13-inch macbook air now
physically from the outside you open up
the box just looks a heck of a lot like
the previous macbook air and in fact
physically it's pretty much the same box
except this guy has a backlit keyboard
something that was in the original air
mission from the second generation now
back here again and the other big change
is i'm going to show you right here on
the side this display port jack right
here in the back is now a thunderbolt
compatible jack so that you can hook up
a display to it but you can also hook up
thunderbolt peripherals if you happen to
run across any there a couple of hard
drives and Apple is going to have a
really nice-looking big laptop oriented
monitor later on in the summer that you
can actually connect this directly to
and that's going to have an ethernet
port and a firewire and some other
Jack's that through that single
Thunderbolt connection you can all
access from your laptop under the hood
the biggest change with this latest
generation of macbook air systems is the
move from Intel's Core 2 Duo CPUs to the
latest second generation core i series
that's a two-generation leap for the
processor you've got core i5 in the 11
inch and the 13 inch macbooks and in
both of those you can actually upgrade
to the faster core i7 processors these
are all the low voltage versions and
you've got to start with the more
expensive upgraded based models for both
of those in order to get that core i7
processor as it is just start out with a
128 gig solid-state drive in the 13 inch
version and
we're gigs of ram you can upgrade that
to a 256 gig solid-state drive which
should be big enough for just about
everybody once you start doing that your
macbook air can get a little bit
expensive we've still got the same 16 x
10 display they haven't moved to 16 by 9
yet on the 13 inch models the big
gigantic multitrack touchpad is the same
they have however added for the OS 10
lion operating system upgrade that comes
with this a bunch of new gestures that
took us a little while to get used to
but a bunch of them are actually pretty
useful and you're going to have to train
yourself to use those instead of some of
the previous versions of these
multi-touch gestures so here's a quick
peek at some of the new gestures are
going to have to get used to in order to
use a new macbook air or really any mac
laptop that has the OS 10 lion operating
system upgrade the two finger scroll
still work still works really great
going up and down web pages now in order
to move a window around it used to
double tap here and move it much like
you would on a windows pc now you just
take three fingers and then you can move
your windows around very easily just
like that the fourth finger gesture
still gives you a big overview they call
this a mission control view now and
shows you all the different apps you
have open and lets you set up
alternative desktops the biggest change
for me was getting back to your desktop
you take your thumb and three fingers
and then you pinched out from there and
that exposed to your desktop you reverse
that to go back the other way and you do
that reverse again and that takes you to
what they call the launch pad which
looks very much like your iOS your iPad
or iPhone collection of apps and these
are all the apps that either come
pre-installed or you get through the
apple app store and then you just pinch
the other way to get back to your
regular desktop so following the
traditional Apple upgrade cycle what
they've done is they've kept the price
is the same 1299 and 1599 for the two
different base models of the 13-inch
macbook air while upgrading the
components inside most notably of course
that core i5 processor and the
Thunderbolt port i'm dan ackerman and
that is Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Air
you guys I cannot wait to make out with
that thing and I can even see its face
in the dark with a battle-ax keyboard
it's hot now i also want to mind tongue
wrestling with a lion that's Mac os10
line for you disgusting sickos out there
seriously well it's here so let's take a
look with jason parker hello everyone
Apple is finally unleashed the lion
that's Mac os10 line and it's available
today at the mac app store but is it
worth the upgrade for everyone i'm jason
parker from cnet and this is a first
look at Apple's newest operating system
Mac OS 10 line we have the chance to sit
down and check out many of the new
features and we're impressed with what
we've seen so far to get started
multi-touch gestures figure prominently
in Mac OS 10 lion letting you swipe
pinch and tap your way through many of
the operating systems newest features
for example a three-finger swipe upwards
brings up the new mission control where
you can see everything that's currently
running along with associated windows
that have the running apps icon at the
bottom simply click on any window to
bring it to the front as another example
in Safari you'll now be able to go back
or forward through your history on a
browser tab with a two-finger swipe all
the multi-touch gestures feel very
natural and apple says it's because
they've added new more responsive
animations notice how you can swipe the
safari page exactly as much or as little
as you want Mac os10 lion now offers
full screen apps a feature many windows
users have seen as a major
disappointment in the mac OS over the
years now you can click on the diagonal
arrows icon in the upper right corner of
a window to quickly switch to full
screen once in full screen you're three
finger horizontal swipe switches between
full screen apps and desktops speaking
of desktops the spaces feature has been
elegantly worked into Mission Control as
well if you want to create a second
desktop just click and drag a window or
set of windows to the icon at the upper
right now with a three finger horizontal
swipe you'll be able to switch between
open apps and newly created desktops oh
and also new to lion one further
three-finger swipe to the right now gets
you to the widget dashboard it's no
secret that iOS devices have been a huge
success for Apple and along with touch
screen features some iOS interface
elements snuck into line as well
launchpad gives you another option for
quickly showing all
apps and it looks just like the way apps
are laid out in the iOS bring up
launchpad by hitting the icon in the
dock or by doing a three finger and
thumb pinch motion just like the iphone
you can click and hold an app to get
into jiggle mode then either move apps
around or create folders by dropping a
nap on another apps icon you still have
the option to search for apps in the
finder and still can create an
application folder in the dock but if
you like that iOS look launch pad is the
way to go one of the biggest upgrades
for Lion is one of the most important
apps of all mail Apple's email app now
the layout closely resembles the email
experience on the iPad with your message
lists on the left and message content on
the right the new mail app now has a
favorites bar for one click access to
your most used folders you can still do
it the old way if you want however by
hitting the show button in the upper
left to bring up the standard folder
structure also just like iOS devices
you'll now be able to view message
threads as conversations a number next
to the message shows how many messages
have been sent in a conversation once
clicked each conversation shows separate
boxes for each reply that's both
nice-looking and makes it less confusing
to quickly read through searching email
got a huge upgrade as well now when you
type in a name for example mail offers
suggestions based on what's in your
inbox but even better they created
search tokens when you click a
suggestion it creates a token this way
you can refine your search by first
creating a token of the name then at a
month say then a subject and get only
the mail that came from that person in
that month and with that subject this
will make searching for that mystery
email much easier than before apple also
made it easier to share files with those
nearby where once you needed to email or
send a file by a chat client you'll now
be able to use airdrop simply choose
airdrop from the finder and you'll be
able to see nearby users where you can
drag and drop a file to their avatar we
have one word for this finally even
though the mac app store was introduced
as an update and Snow Leopard it's
important to talk about here because
it's the only place you can buy and
download line for 2999 unfortunately
this means that if you skipped over snow
leopard you'll still have to buy it for
29
in order to get the Mac App Store to
download lion we can see why Apple did
it this way but frankly it doesn't seem
fair to those who chose not to x snow
leopard overall Mac os10 lion is a solid
upgrade that comes with more than 250
new features we can't list them all here
but be sure to check out our full review
at download com this is jason parker for
cnet thanks for watching our first look
at mac OS x see you next time so that's
some sweet news and we'll talk about all
the other things they announced later
next we show but the only thing that
could make this week better would be if
I was sent to the biggest baddest pop
culture sci-fi fantasy comic book
convention which I am alright let's
check out some of those emails I asked
for and everything here is fair game
Thomas bossio rights in with I got a
request can you please share your
favorite flavor of pop-tarts thanks
cherry Thomas has to be cherry but our
building only has strawberry but one
thing is we also have 25 cents ilysm
that's really the only reason why I
wanted to work here now Andre Leo race
or rice she asked yo be on the last
episode you said that you know that Mac
os10 10.7 s release date but you
couldn't tell or you would get fired now
the only way you can know is if you work
for Apple so do you work for Apple of
course I work for Apple you know there's
a reason why they don't want me to be at
the press conferences and if you've
watched the show clearly you know that
all I do is suck their teeth with a
segment like the bad apple or calling
them ID ox you know they're more than
happy to call me as one of their
employees but I did work for them in
retail years ago as a photo model I know
pretty hot now our last email comes from
Richie limb hi Brian I've been wanting
