that's 50 years of continuous production
for this model only handful of cars can
claim that kind of longevity and if we
ignore the Mustang - from the mid 70s
pretty much every generation has been
good and this newest generation is
really amazing this is the 2015 Ford
Mustang GT
now GT means we have a 5 liter v8 under
the hood and that's similar in size to
the 302 cubic inch v8 engine that Ford
introduced in 1968 so there's a lot of
history in this car of course with this
generation Ford dropped some of their
retro looks from the past 10 years we
have a smoother rear-end but we still
have this really brawny hood we also
have the GT performance pack on this car
so that means these 19-inch black wheels
and six piston Brembo brakes up front
you really need that stopping power with
this piece we've got these optional
Recaro seats in the cabin here they have
these big bolsters on the side that
makes getting in and out a little
difficult and if you're anything more
than an average build these are gonna be
uncomfortable you're not really gonna
fit very well you'll want the standard
seats these are also manually adjustable
not power adjustable on the stack here
we have the switch gear which looks
metal it's plastic but it looks good it
fits the performance character this car
we also have a white engine start button
that also looks pretty cool plus the
6-speed manual shifter really brawny
shifter very mechanical feeling and
looking for it emphasizes the
performance character of this car even
on the speedometer it says ground speed
is if this car is gonna take flight you
don't want it to do that and in the
center display we have what's called
track apps amongst all the trip computer
options and stuff like that I can
control the track apps with these
buttons on the left side of the steering
wheel that gives us things like
acceleration timers ticking measure 0 to
60 braking performance can even activate
launch control from this panel here it
says track only on here in red so Ford
doesn't want you to use these on public
roads keep that in mind in the center -
here we have this big touchscreen this
shows the MyFord Touch infotainment
system we got hands-free phone
navigation digital audio sources it's
not a great system we review this a
hundred times the response is pretty
slow but it'll get
job done but it'll frustrate you too we
also have on this card the optional 12
speaker shaker audio system that comes
with an equipment package which also has
blind spot monitoring system
I like the cider system it's a good
package to get especially with that
blind spot monitoring system that's kind
of the point of getting the GT this v8
sounds really good and it just got
burbles along all day when you're
cruising and gets a nice controlled
growl when you get up the revs puts that
port in thirty five horsepower 400
pound-feet of torque but with the
six-speed manual even with that kind of
power it's really controllable it's easy
to control the power modulate the power
and nets to my mind the mark of a really
good car something you can keep in
control of and that doesn't just
translate to city traffic and stuff like
that that also translates to track time
with this new Mustang Ford actually got
rid of those solid rear axle that used
to use in this model through a rear
independent suspension and this is just
really fine actually it handles
amazingly well it just keeps good grip
in the corners you can feel it shift
around a little bit but it's nice and
contained the suspension is pretty stiff
in this car which is great for
performance stuff for taking the corners
fast and that's so much for ride comfort
we've got an electric power steering rig
here and because of that I can actually
change my steering modes with one of
these toggle switches I showed you
earlier and I've been keeping it on
sport mode it feels just fine it's easy
enough to turn Ford also included a
definite lose control on this particular
example not a great thing to have with a
manual transmission because as soon as
you get the clutch it disengages cruise
control and then you're back controlling
the speed yourself so that's really
something that works much better with an
automatic transmission which we don't
have with this car
all right let's price out our 2015 ford
mustang GT face price for this GP
premium model like we have here is
thirty six thousand three hundred
dollars we have that GP performance
package that's twenty four ninety five
and we also add the 401 a equipment
package seventeen ninety five that gives
us the shaker audio blind spot detection
a couple of other things we leave off
the Recaro seats and we leave off the
adaptive cruise control we don't really
need those or want those so we end up
with twenty one thousand four and
fifteen dollars total with destination
if you want a Ford Mustang then you know
you'll want one it's pretty easy to
figure out you go for the GT if you want
a muscle car but if you just want a
cruiser get the four-cylinder turbo
EcoBoost engine cuz that's pretty good
too
