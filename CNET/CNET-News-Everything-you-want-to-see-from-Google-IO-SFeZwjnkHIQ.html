really begins 16 camera modules mounted
in a circular array we're going to be
opening up the camera geometry with
plans available to everyone this summer
so if you want to experience vr video
all you need is the YouTube app your
smartphone and some cardboard you can
use your fingerprint to authorize
Android pay transactions the user simply
touches the fingerprint sensor which
unlocks the phone the phone will then
make a secure NFC exchange and then the
payment goes through and you get the
Android pay notification of the
transaction at the top today I'm very
excited to announce HP or now for the
first time is coming to Google Play and
it's available across Android and iOS
using care so here you see an email from
my friend Ali about catching a movie I
don't know much about the movie I want
to find out more so all I have to do is
a simple tap and hold on the home button
google now brings me information about
tomorrow lack no internet connection but
you'll notice that I can still do things
like search for places you can see that
auto complete works too even though I'm
offline I can still see the reviews and
the opening hours type-c ushers in a new
way of charging that works across
hardware from cell phones to tablets to
laptops and everything in between and it
means we're going to start seeing really
fast charging of devices and because
type C is bi-directional the M release
adds the ability to select whether you
want your device to be charged by the
cable or is still instead for your
device to access the charger to whatever
is plugged into so if your grocery
shopping you can wear your shopping list
on your wrist or if you're walking
around a new neighborhood directions
with maps will stay on the screen and if
you're chatting with a friend the latest
version of Android wear now lets you
draw and sand emoji a new design fits
phones with screens as large as six
inches and now instead of it taking 12
steps to assemble it takes just three a
cardboard SDK
it needs to work with every phone too
and so as of today the cardboard SDK for
unity will support both Android and iOS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
