secretive company but in recent years
it's loosened up a bit particularly
after the death of its inspirational
founder and longtime MIT professor dr.
amar Bose in 2013
CNET recently visited its headquarters
and got an unprecedented peek under the
hood you're probably familiar with Henry
Ford who said you know if I asked people
what they wanted back in the late 1800s
they would have said a faster horse he
saw that the problem and the need but he
had the vision to see the technology
that could be a much faster horse and
one of the benefits of studying
technology and being on the cutting edge
is you can envision what might be we met
with some of boses top engineers most of
whom have been with the company for over
25 years and sometimes longer this
particular room is an anechoic chamber a
huge number of different measurements
are made in here when basically what you
want to know is what's coming out of or
off of the loudspeaker boses engineers
developed a unique solution for making
sure that nothing in one of its audio
test rooms was ever moved and always
remained a constant it turned the room
on its side you also notice that all the
walls are unparalleled and that's the
same thing that's going on in the other
rooms it's to try to remove anomalies
that are true for typical rooms and make
a room that breaks up natural standing
waves in a way that creates more of an
average those had never shown as design
insurance engineering labs to the press
the director of those labs led us
through several testing areas this is a
reliability test chamber here we make
the product failed we make sure that we
understand why it failed and if it's a
weak spot we can improve it
this is called cargo bounce test so we
have a rain test fixture does a very
calibrated amount of rain interestingly
some of the products are designed with
little water channels in them in case
people leave them outside this is kind
of like being close to the seaside if I
open it you get a little bit of the fog
that comes out this is a different one
for steal this one cycles between hot
and dry and the same kind of salt fog
this is the exact weight of an iPhone so
it simulates your pulling out your
iPhone you drop it and it puts tension
on the cable here our goal is to make
products that people love and you saw
lots of people today sweating the
details to make sure these products are
reliable that they have the best
performance and that the industrial
designs are relevant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
