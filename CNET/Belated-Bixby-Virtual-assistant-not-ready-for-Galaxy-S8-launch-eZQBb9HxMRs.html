missing a major feature when it launches
next week the voice activated big speed
virtual assistant will not be fully
operational in the US and it is delayed
until sometime later this spring bixby
is like Apple Siri and Samsung made a
big fuss about it bixby is one of the
biggest selling points of the new phone
samsung even put a physical button on
the side of the s8 just for summoning
big speed now that means there's now a
button for something that isn't fully
working and that's not a good look for
samsung although the company did warn us
that big speed may not be ready in time
for launch so this isn't a big surprise
the English voice recognition software
is what needs more time but what will
work at launch according to the company
is the bixby home screen which learns
your routines and read your calendar to
make suggestions you can also use it to
set reminders and also working is bixby
vision point the camera at a sign in
another language and it's going to
translate the text it can also recognize
landmarks and recognize select objects
to tell you where to buy those objects
launching without a fully working
assistant may not be flattering for
samsung but there is already skepticism
over how much bixby is really going to
make a difference to users when the
android phone already has google's
assistant installed so essentially this
is a phone with two assistants samsung
wants to set bixby apart from other
voice assistance by having it be a way
you can control your phone with your
voice such as telling it to find a
certain photo and send that photo to
someone all with audio commands I'm
