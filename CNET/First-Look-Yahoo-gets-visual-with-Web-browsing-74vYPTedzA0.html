Wednesday with versions for both iOS
devices and plugins for Google Chrome
Firefox and Safari I'm Jason proctor for
cnet and this is a first look at yahoo's
access web browser yahoo says it wants
to redefine the way you use search on
your iOS devices in your desktop and
after using the app for a little while I
think access offers a pretty unique and
intuitive search experience let's get
started by touching and swiping
downwards to open the search interface
the first thing you'll notice is that
access list trending searches and you
can touch each text search term to see
the latest headlines relating to a topic
if you want a more visual experience
access offers thumbnails of the websites
to find the search results you want you
also have the option to look at image
thumbnails relating to the topic by
touching the button at the bottom of the
interface and selecting image search
once you have chosen a page to look at
this setup makes it easy to go back to
your search results when it's not what
you're looking for simply swipe
downwards from the top again and you can
view your previous search browse through
thumbnails and select another page one
word of warning you'll need to be
careful not to swipe down from too high
on the page will open your iOS 5
notifications panel if you discover a
website you want to look at later you
can either save it as a bookmark or add
it to your real ater list to save as a
bookmark just touch the star icon to the
left of the Yahoo logo and select where
you want to put it now when you touch
the silver ribbon on the far right
you'll bring up your bookmarks and read
later links for easy access if you have
a lot of bookmarks you can also use the
search bar at the top to drill down the
access web browser has a visual system
for tabs simply touch the button at the
bottom of the interface and you can view
thumbnails of tabbed web pages if you
want to add a new one hit the plus sign
to bring up the access home screen here
you can choose one of your favorites
something you post it as a read later
page or you can use the search bar to
find a new site at the bottom of the
access home screen you also have a
section called continue from device if
you log in using your yahoo account ID
on every device you'll be able to view
searches and sites you looked at on
another device this is true for the
desktop as well access offers plug-ins
for google chrome
Firefox and Safari so if you login to
access with your yahoo account on both
your iOS devices and your favorite web
browser you'll be able to continue your
browsing experience from anywhere this
means that you could be looking at
websites on the way to work then switch
to your desktop to continue browsing the
same sites on the desktop versions the
experience is slightly different instead
of the touchscreen pulldown tab you'll
be performing searches from a small
window where you can also look at the
axis home screen and browse your
favorites and read later stories axis
also offers some sharing options for
when you want to send something of
interest to friends or social networks
simply touch the share button to send a
link by email pin it to your Pinterest
board or send a link to Twitter for your
followers overall access doesn't offer
all the features of a full-fledged web
browser but it does have a slick
interface for performing web searches
saving webpages and sharing sites with
your friends you can grab access for
free right now at the iTunes App Store
that's it for this first look at yahoo
axis i'm jason parker for cnet thanks
