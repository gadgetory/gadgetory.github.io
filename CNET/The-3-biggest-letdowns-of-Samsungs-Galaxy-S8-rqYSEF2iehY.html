eight-plus the Galaxy s8 delivered on
some great new features edge to edge
HDR display iris scanner and faster
processor put aside from that gorgeous
screen it seemed like the s8 was holding
back perhaps for an even more dazzling
no date here's our list of let downs the
s8 has a 12 megapixel primary sensor
with optical image stabilization sound
familiar
that's because the hardware hasn't
changed much since the s7 which we love
by the way
Samsung did add better image processing
and a better front camera but it still
seems like they could have done more to
that main camera this doesn't have to
mean a dual and setup like the g6 or the
iPhone 7 plus but what about a better
lens optical zoom depth sensing
something
aside from the actual size Samsung made
no mention of the duration of the
battery on the s8 and the s8 plus and it
may be for good reason because those
beautiful hd are infinity screens aren't
going to power themselves and with no
increase in battery size they're relying
almost solely on a more efficient
processor for extra juice so while fast
charging and wireless charging you're
great don't expect more hours of usage
from these phones everyone me Bixby
Microsoft s Cortana
google has assistant Apple Siri and
Amazon Alexa and now Samsung seems to
think Bixby has what it takes to stand
out in this sea of digital assistants in
theory Bixby sounds great
seamless integration with the s8 with
its own dedicated Bigsby button visual
translations and image recognition but
in reality it could end up being just
another Samsung feature you'll want to
deactivate it will only work with a
handful of samsung apps at launch it
can't answer trivia questions and it
overlaps with a lot of the things Google
assistant already does better the truth
is big speed is still a baby in the
assistant world so we'll have to see how
it matures over the coming weeks and
despite the criticism the s8 may be one
of the most drool-worthy devices we've
seen all year
