take a look at Sony Vaio and f-series
this is a 16 point 4 inch laptop that's
kind of the higher end of what we call
the midsize laptop so their laptops with
14 inch or more commonly 15 inch and
very rarely 16 inch screens although the
way that Sony built this particular
system it's pretty big even for a 16
inch machine so I can't really imagine
putting this in your bag and carrying it
around more than ever you know great
once in a while we're maybe something
like a 15-inch MacBook Pro or HP Envy 15
you know other kind of full-featured
midsize laptops you could carry around
you know a few days a week you really
wouldn't want to do it every day but
this guy probably it's probably gonna
stay you know anchored to your desk and
that's why it's a good multimedia and
even gaming machine it's got a full
1080p display it's got a blu-ray drive
it's got decent Nvidia graphics and of
course it's got that great Sony keyboard
it's a back with keyboard and you may
not be able to tell under these big
light it's actually one of the brightest
back lights they've ever seen on a
keyboard the touchpad itself is down
here just kind of a layer of textured
dots over this raised wrist rest it's
not the biggest touchpad we've ever seen
especially in a laptop this size but it
works fairly well I'm not a big fan of
the button bar below it I like to
separate left and right mouse buttons so
of course Sony is well known for
charging a bit of a premium for its vaio
brand prep next to Apple they're the
only company you really think of as kind
of a reach brand so this via f-series
starts at about 1050 our particular
build out here with an Intel Core i7 CPU
is about $1,400 of course if you drop
out some of the options you can bring
that price down but that puts you in
about the same category as some of those
high-end 15-inch full-featured laptops
like the envy 15 of like Dells XPS 15z
but still a lot less expensive than a
comparable 15-inch MacBook Pro I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Sony Vaio Cup
