with josh Stone of RootMetrics now they
partner with cnet to provide the
coverage maps that you see for mobile
phones on cnet com and I'm going to see
just how they independently test the
signal strength and the data connections
for all the cell phone carriers in the
area so Josh this is a pretty big
briefcase here and I see that you've got
a bunch of phones and battery pack
strapped to it what am I looking at our
kit starts with off-the-shelf consumer
phones there's a phone for each of the
major carriers we're testing in the
market and all of them are connected to
this master device it's actually
controlling and automating calls and
each of these phones is running our
proprietary software and collecting
samples around signal data and texting
what we typically do is we run in a
proprietary software this randomly
selects way points along a route for the
drivers they're able to plan their
routes and select three indoor locations
at each way point that are publicly
available like a supermarket a gas
station that kind of thing so right now
I see that these phones most of them
look like they're calling a phone number
what are they doing exactly these are
actually calling a server and holding an
actual call and testing the signal
strength back to that server at the same
time so they're going to upload what
photos videos yeah exactly so every five
minutes we will run through signal
strength data uploads and download
speeds and text performance now to the
carrier's actually use your data to go
ahead and find out where their weak
spots are so that they can improve their
network they can and do use that
reporting to and improve technology
throughout the markets great thank you
so much this has been really fun thank
you I'm Jessica doll court for C night
you can catch all of our content at cnet
com
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
