welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show noon universe I'm Ashley sceva
and yes there's no co-host that's unless
there are ghosts in this room but that's
because our new sets being built and
your words have not gone unheard and
we'll tell you more about that soon but
for now let's hit the headlines I should
tell you right up front if you are
terrified of robot bike cops or the idea
of robot bike cops you should probably
look away for this story
Yamaha unveiled moto bot at the Tokyo
Motor Show this week a robot rider
mounted on a Yamaha r1m Superbike with
some slight safety modifications like
training wheels on either side in case
the robot puts the bike on its side
accidentally so what exactly is the
point of sticking a futuristic looking
robot onto a motorcycle aside from
looking really really cool
Yamaha says it wants to someday be able
to build a robot that can ride on a
motorcycle that isnt modded out like
this one is and without assistance once
they achieve that goal the data and
knowledge acquired during that process
can be applied to writer safety and
writer support technologies which is
always a good thing in my mind
moto bots is already feeling pretty
confident about its existence it already
sent a message to writer Valentino Rossi
saying it was created to surpass him
whoo that's creepy well let's be less
creepy and talk about teddy bears or
more specifically virtual reality teddy
bears Japanese startup Aida warp is
working on an interesting experience
that combines stuffed animals and
virtual reality they want to allow you
to see through the eyes of a teddy bear
it's not just a simple point of view
experience though the idea includes the
ability to talk to people near the bear
and hear their responses turn the Bears
head by turning your own head while it's
in that VR headset and even move the
Bears arms by using an Xbox controller
the inventor of the bear
Tatsuki edenia says the bear could be
used to keep in close touch over long
distances but I personally thought this
might be an excellent therapy or
teaching tool for children if he can
smooth out the movements and make them
less terrifying edenia hopes to ship the
robotic shell powering the bear by the
end of next year for developers and a
consumer version that's fully realized
after that
which I'm assuming the official name is
going to be virtual Ruxpin you're
welcome it's not even really that great
of an idea all right guys
uh this last story is for anybody who
has found themselves wishing they can
make a full-size wireframe prototype in
the comfort of their own home so all of
us right I hereby introduce you to the
prototype err a genius bit of Technology
from a team of researchers at the
human-computer interaction lab at the
hostel Plattner Institute this is a
delightful little tape gun that's been
modded out to mold tape into tubes which
can then be attached to each other to
create full-sized wireframe prototypes
obviously you wouldn't be able to sit on
ortho eyes put weight on these
prototypes but the team who made the
proto piper says it's actually a great
tool for inventors or designers to get a
feel for dimension and form at the
earliest stages of design potentially
saving cash in the long run by
eliminating costs of creating more
expensive and functional prototypes too
early in the process I'm also sure it
will come in very very handy for some
hipster who wants to have quirky art
pieces in their house all right guys
let's check out mod squad
there's a Logan cot this week's Mod
Squad online a few days ago and some
people enjoy the Assassin's Creed
franchise we figured it was a no-brainer
Colin Furze is obviously also a fan of
the Assassin's Creed franchise and he
created working versions of both the
hidden blade and the rope launcher
gauntlets featured in Assassin's Creed
syndicate the rope launcher is really
nice to look at and the initial blast of
the rope with the help of a co2 canister
is pretty exciting to watch but the
actual hoisting isn't quite as fast as
we hoped it would be
I guess it's impressive the winch can
lift furs up to his desired location
though the hidden knife gauntlet on the
other hand looks super nimble and deadly
slicing up bags of grain and sheets
without any problems it can retract and
extend with a simple wrist motion but
honestly I think I'd be scared to stab
my own hand if I was using it so good
job Colin on not injuring yourself full
disclosure Colin actually partnered up
officially with Ubisoft to make these
items so they're kind of a promotional
tool but they also required a lot of
work so we do salute Colin for his
efforts alright guys that is it for mod
squad we have a brand-new viewer brand
new fan so let's check out our phone
talker for the day
our photo of the day today somebody you
might be familiar with Neal who has
written into the show before he's been
kind of a fan of the show since day one
which is pretty awesome and now there's
a new fan of the show this is baby
Jensen I'm assuming somebody else
snapped this picture with Neal's Lumia
635 but he tweeted to us and he says
baby Jensen born six pounds 12 ounces
you can use this on the show Lumia 635
baby and mom are doing amazing so
welcome to the world baby Jensen and we
hope that your future is full of not
creepy and amazing virtual reality teddy
bears and definitely not creepy
terrifying robot by cops if you guys
want to submit your pictures to be
considered for fronta go for the day can
email us tomorrow at cnet.com send us
your name your picture a story about
your picture what device you took it
with and of course give us permission to
use it on the show if you want to find
us on the internet we're tomorrow daily
on Facebook and Twitter I met Ashley
sceva on Twitter producer Logan's at
Logan Moy and that is it for the show if
you want to share it with somebody you
can send them to tomorrow daily comm we
always appreciate that
we'll see you guys next time with a
brand new docket of weird science fact
in science fiction but until then be in
humans bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
