3-series and for a while it was good but
then things got weird when BMW decided
to slit the poop from the sedan and form
its own 4 Series line then things got
even weirder when BMW decided to make a
sedan version of that coupe
so here we are the 2015 BMW 428 i grand
coupe we're wondering what's the point
let's hop behind the wheel and see if we
can't figure it out
now the key feature is gonna keep the
grand coupe from being redundant to the
sedan it's gonna be this rear power
opening liftgate
it's gonna give you a much larger
opening than a trunk and get some
bulkier items in there you can even
knock those seats down to get really big
items in and I think that's gonna give
this vehicle a lot more utility without
looking like a hatchback I really like
this now here in the cabin we've got
this really nice red interior that I
think contrasts nicely with the blue
exterior the fit and finish is really
good in the cabin here but the dashboard
tech is a little bit disappointing for
example we've got over $10,000 in
options on this $40,000 car and we don't
even have navigation there's no blind
spot monitoring there a lot of holes in
this tech package for a car of this
price but we do have is BMWs latest
generation of I Drive with this small
six and some change inch screen
sometimes this is an interface that's a
little maddening and sometimes it just
makes perfect sense it just really
depends on the driver
we got the iDrive controller right here
that you'll control everything with and
right here next to the transmission
we've got a couple of other controls for
one of our only safety features that's
gonna be this sort of camera system so
when I shift the car into reverse I have
the option of seeing out of the back of
the car or hitting a button and seeing
sort of a bird's eye view of around the
vehicle
okay so this 428 I model is gonna be
powered by BMW 2 litre twin power turbo
charged engine gonna put up 242 our car
got 258 pound-feet of torque it's a good
little engine there's not a lot of turbo
lag it's very responsive off the line I
like it
this example is also equipped with BMWs
M sports package a $3,500 option that's
gonna make this car a much more dynamic
handler thanks to adaptive steering and
adaptive suspension is a great sports
sedan for when you want to take it on a
twisty road
okay to get out of the door at this 2015
BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe you're looking
at about forty thousand three hundred
bucks to get out of the door with this
bait 428 i model we've got about twelve
thousand dollars of options on top of
that including a $3,500 M Sport
Performance Package definitely going to
want that but we're missing a lot of
tech as testin we're looking at about
fifty two thousand three hundred dollars
and we're not even close to being fully
loaded get crazy with the options this
thing can get really expensive really
fast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
