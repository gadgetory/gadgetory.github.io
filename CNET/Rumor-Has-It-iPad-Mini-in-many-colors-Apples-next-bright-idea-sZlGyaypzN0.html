leaving welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech rumors and then we vote on what
sounds legit and what seems like it'll
never happen and remember that you guys
can vote too on all the rumors keep your
eyes peeled for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet but before we get to our rumors
let's get something horrible out of the
way right off the bat as you probably
know invitations went out for an apple
event to be held october twenty third
and everyone on earth including us
believes it's the coming-out party for
the ipad mini okay leavey you have five
seconds to gloat I don't need to gloat
you singing edda james's at last in
front of an apple store is all that I
need Oh God in case this is your first
time watching rumor has it Emily BETT
that the ipad mini was a mythical
creature and if she's wrong i get to
come up with an imaginative way to
humiliate her on the air I'm thinking
public singing or a duck costume but I'm
open to suggestions anywho let's change
the subject to images appeared on
google's picasa photo sharing site this
week showing what looks like to Sony
Nexus phones running a pure Android
experience android fans who like their
operating systems raw and unrestricted
started salivating but a closer look at
the pictures reveals two problems first
the Google Play search bar that should
be on any stock Android OS is absent and
there are some wonky artifacts in the
image which could suggest photoshopping
now rumors of a new Nexus phone coming
from an unexpected manufacturer have
been circulating all year so this isn't
unheard of but recent leaks suggest that
LG is making a nexus phone so either
this is a red herring or it's an early
prototype that's not quite finished and
we'll get a nexus from both sony and LG
next 9to5 mac has a rumor that I'm
obsessed with namely because if true
maybe I won't have to suffer a
humiliation it claims that it apple's
event next week we could see new mac
minis so maybe that's the little
something apple alluded to in the
invitation um Emily even 9to5 mac says
that it'll be mac minis as well as the
ipad mini okay i know i'm just hoping
irrationally that maybe they got that
part
maybe the main event is the rumor
13-inch retina MacBook and the little
something extra is the mac mini right I
could get lucky weirder things have
happened name one one time I dropped my
phone in a toilet and when I dried it
off it was still working see I'm lucky
gross let's get back to the ipad mini
invite the invite reads we've got a
little more to show you so if we
explicate that line of poetry a little
we pretty much know that the worst kept
secret in history will be announced but
we still don't know what it will look
like according to an inventory system
screenshot obtained by mobile geeks the
ipad mini will come in 16 different
memory and wireless configurations the
prices are listed in Euros and translate
to about 320 to US dollars for a Wi-Fi
only eight gig model and go all the way
to eight hundred fifty dollars for a 64
gig cellular version Apple Insider then
went on the record citing anonymous
sources drink that said the ipad mini
will actually come in 24 varieties but
it only reaches that number if the ipad
mini comes in a Wi-Fi a 4g and a 3g
option i don't think it makes any sense
to have a 3g option a commenter agrees
with me pointing out that you can reach
24 configurations a more logical way
with a Wi-Fi and 4g option in two colors
and three capacities on two carriers as
my ninth grade geometry teacher Mike
Wade would say QED but now here's the
rub the new ipod touch comes in a
rainbow of colors which has led some to
believe that the new mini will also come
in different colors i don't think it
will however the leak spec sheets don't
mention a million colors but the invite
shows a rainbow of colors and as we know
apple never puts anything on those
invitations accidentally plus if they
want this to be the killer must have
holiday gift having a bunch of different
color options for children would pretty
much ensure that so i think this makes a
lot of sense what do you guys think will
there be a candy-colored assortment of
minis don't forget to vote in the poll
while we go ask the people of San
Francisco what they think
do you think that's a possibility that
they'll release it in different colors
ah well that might be a possibility
because they are very creative in many
ways so I think that there is an
innovation in this way also that doesn't
make that much difference to me I think
that's a great possibility i think it's
a trend that's their continuing with and
i think people will be excited to have
an option in colors sure they probably
will call marketing would you want one
probably what color would you want red
yeah people have favorite colors I don't
see why not i mean for me I would pick a
silver color or a blue color so okay
it's kind of like this one yeah
definitely like this one actually pretty
nice color um I guess I'm not too
worried about it now if you were if you
had to get one in a different color
which color would you get probably like
white white or black so even if it came
out a bunch of colors I wouldn't make
you get one it would not make me give
Boy yeah well most people on the street
had heard about the ipad mini coming out
and a lot of them more excited that
would come in different colors let's go
upstairs and see if the cnet counseled
experts thinks that's a possibility the
cnet councils compose 25 editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
verdict is man a girl can't catch a
break it's no our editors say the ipad
mini will likely not come in many
different colors though they were split
three to two all of our questions will
be answered next week and i'm pretty
sure i'll get to humiliate Emily if you
have any humiliation ideas please share
them with us at rumor has it at cnet com
or post them in the comments and tweet
us but please don't be too harsh on me
and tune in next week for more tech
rumors
