policy that has long required users to
provide real names intended to prevent
fake and malicious accounts the policy
recently drew fire from the LGBT
community and in particular drag queens
like sister Romo who were forced to add
given names to their profiles we also
have heard from victims of domestic
violence and people who for a lot of
different reasons want to protect their
privacy you know something like a
teacher who wants to keep their personal
life separate San Francisco city
supervisor David Campos and other LGBT
leaders met with Facebook
representatives to discuss the policy
Campos told CNET that Facebook
apologized for any harm the policy had
caused and agreed to add a clarification
allowing names that aren't necessarily
legal the clash with Facebook led some
users to explore other social outlets
ello an invitation-only network has
attracted users with more than just
privacy they built the social network to
be ad free they're going to charge for
certain features and so it'd almost be
like a toll like if you want to be able
to use their mobile app you'll have to
pay a couple bucks San Francisco
resident Scott pando joined ello to make
a statement it's important for facebook
to realize that they also need there
they need me as well and they need you
know their LGBT people as well they're
using our information to to create
revenue for their own business but pando
isn't using ello exclusively it's raw
it's you know it's raw its buggy it's in
its beta I don't really know how to use
it i'm figuring it out myself but i
didn't know how to use facebook when it
started loz founders tell cnet facebook
isn't a competitor saying quote facebook
is an advertising platform ello is a
social network in San Francisco I'm SI
me das cnet.com for CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
