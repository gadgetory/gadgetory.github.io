corporate office in Thousand Oaks
California
we've got the Rolling Hills outside here
but inside these doors is Sideshow
Collectibles they have statues figures
life-size replicas of all your favorite
geek pop culture icons so we're going to
talk to the people that make the magic
happen
so sideshow looks to express itself as a
Renaissance studio by combining the the
modern cutting-edge technology of
digital sculpting digital painting with
the classic mediums of clay sculpture
actual you know wet paint on statues and
I think this is the element that brings
this sort of old and new world ethic
together and is the heart of our
presentations to the collectors this big
boy right here is Thanos from the Marvel
Universe sideshow put it together and
it's really one of the largest and most
intricate pieces they have ever made but
the other thing it took a lot of
traditional methods as well as new
technology the things that you and I are
using to make him come to life I use
ZBrush in Maya almost exclusively one of
my biggest tools that I that really
helped me transition from traditional
sculpting into digital was my Cintiq
screen that's the Wacom screen that lets
you work with a pen directly on the
screen I honestly do a lot of my sketch
development work on them on an iPad but
sometimes I just have to break out and
get messy and with it this piece we
thought wasn't working and this one as
well we felt didn't have enough there so
actually I photoshopped in gray this
component of the armor and then send it
back to him and then we broke this line
up and just edged a few more things to
bring it back to that same language and
then I would send him the Photoshop file
on Thanos he's got a lot of really cool
textures that are really difficult and
tedious to do by hand but we can design
it that way and then when it comes to
molding cast we can work around those
and create seam lines outside of those
things and really spend that time in the
design process to make something that
really is so amazing and would be so
difficult to do
and his suit pattern is made up of these
intersecting pyramids which is really
cool and if you get up there you can see
that we really push brushwork airbrush
work sponge work and we have some
techniques that we really like to use
you know a lot of times we will sponge a
color on or something and they will
break it up with denatured alcohol is
like misting it carefully out of a mist
bottle which kind of causes the paint to
crackle and separate on its own and give
you a kind of organic broken up quality
about it the amount of fidelity that we
can get the amount of detail that we can
get you can't compare to what the way we
used to do it in the past I think you
know in the in the 20 of the 20 plus
years that you know we've been doing
this at sideshow I think the interesting
thing about with the technology that is
you know pretty readily available now
you know I'm 51 now so you know to me
this is a goddamn magic trick at this
point because it didn't exist when I
started this I think that that has been
both frustrating encouraging and most
certainly inspirational
