this is a look at the monoprice m HD
action camera for those unfamiliar with
monoprice the company has made a name
for itself by selling less expensive
versions of pricier name-brand products
in this case the MHD has a very similar
design and feature set to the ion air
pro camera it's about half the price
though but to be fair the ion has a
couple differences including the
capability to add Wi-Fi to it which the
MHD just doesn't have so what you do get
with the MHD is a small lightweight
action cam that's waterproof down to
about 30 feet without an additional
housing it records in either 1080p or
720p at 30 frames per second and
captures 5 megapixel photos and
operation is simple just slide the
switch on top forward and it powers on
and starts recording giving you a little
vibration to let you know it's going
included is a handlebar or palm out
along with a Quick Connect mount that
screws into the standard tripod mount in
the bottom so while you can buy other
mounts from monoprice all under about
$20 you can also use anything with a
quarter inch tripod mount its ports in
microSD card slot are stashed under a
cap in the back and while the camera's
battery is built-in you do get about two
and a half hours recording time from it
now the video quality it's what I would
expect from a sub $100 video camera that
has all of these other features going
for it
it's basically good enough for mobile
devices and online sharing its small
sizes but viewing even slightly larger
reveals a lot of artifacts and wobble is
plentiful the rest of the package is
very good for the money though so if you
don't need anything more than decent web
video
this will do the trick I'm Josh golden
and that's the mana price M HD action
camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
