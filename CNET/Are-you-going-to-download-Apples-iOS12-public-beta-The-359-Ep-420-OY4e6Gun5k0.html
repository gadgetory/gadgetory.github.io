I'm Alfred hang
I'm Scott Stein I owe as 12 is here well
at least the public beta if you were
brave enough you could have been the
first to experience the latest version
of Apple's operating system we have
Scott here to talk about all the ways
what what are your first impressions
you've been playing around with few days
right yeah so I mean weird you know iOS
12 was not really that many exciting new
things it's really about fixing a lot of
the bugs also don't expect some of the
new features that you think might be
there for instance augmented reality
which I'm fascinated by is not really
there because that requires third-party
apps that don't exist yet to take
advantage of multiplayer there's a
measure app from Apple but that's really
just a measuring tape and shortcuts
which is the one that sauce to make Siri
more usable yeah
that's only part of the way here the
biggest parts of that the standalone
shortcuts app that's basically an
extension of the work flow app that
Apple acquired and the ability to do all
sorts a deeper program with third-party
apps is not in this beta well you can do
a screen time which is that management
of your how much time you're glued to
your phone that's interesting emoji are
there if you have an iPhone
those your me emoji how do you know oh I
seem emoji with like a hard G well using
the Mojo you've tried them emoji I tried
them on you tonight commuting on a train
are you are you into the Momo guy are
you are you as a technical achievement
they're definitely the best that are out
there there's no question why you'd
really want to use this an apple berries
this inside the messages app so it's
really hard to get to the coolest the
weirdest momochi on your head thing
which is like basically like a snapchat
trick where suddenly your head isn't
animated talking okay that's buried
inside messages you can use it for group
FaceTime so I love the effect but I'd
rather have it built in the camera app
do more Google's doing with a are
stickers open that up yeah be nice to
actually use those me emojis in other
apps or other messaging apps or Facebook
right just having it be share quick
things yeah locked in a messages seems
like a mistake it seems like Apple
really wants that to be part of the
messages identity but it needs to be
part of the whole iPhone identity but as
more phones get the front-facing camera
in the fall you can expect probably
they'll do more with that stuff so as a
reminder this is still a beta and we
recommend Betty if you install this
software you
do it on a phone that isn't your primary
juries don't you in fact I wouldn't
normally install a beta why probably
because I'm into tech but I don't like
to install something like that on a core
device because why would you mess with
that already
you have OS that's fine there isn't that
much in iOS 12 that's really
unbelievable unless you want to play
with group FaceTime 32 people but you
know you could just wait all right so is
instagram worth 100 billion dollars it
seems completely ludicrous but a
bloomberg analysis is out today valuing
just instagram by itself at a hundred
billion dollars this is based on the
fact that is crossed the 1 billion user
mark recently and it's projected to grow
to 2 billion active users a month
in the next five years just the worth
worth noting facebook is itself worth
five hundred seventy five million
dollars what do you think ludicrous yeah
how is this ludicrous I think Instagram
is like one of the fastest growing
social networks out there I mean they're
owned by Facebook so I don't know how
much of that you can credit to Facebook
but you know that it has all these like
Millennials going to it all these people
leaving Facebook to for Instagram like a
lot of celebrities would much rather use
that they have this whole like IG TV
stuff which I've been seeing a lot of
people using actually like I know last
week when we talked to us I don't think
I don't think anyone's gonna use I've
I've caught myself watching a few videos
on IG t keep in mind
Facebook's valuations really basins like
that it's been able to make money off of
targeted ads yes a gram still struggles
with making money that's what IG TVs
yeah but Instagram posts are really good
at like connecting influencers and like
that's like the audience that like I
think social media is headed towards
next because like if they're not like
really responding to like these targeted
ads anymore but they will be responding
to like their favorite YouTube or their
favorite like person on Instagram like
their favorite personality on social
media I think that's like where most of
its value comes from alright lastly the
tech industry is working with the
government to ensure that Russia's
influence in the 2016 elections don't
happen again from the terms so Apple
Google Facebook and others met with US
intelligence officials last month
obviously disinformation was one of the
big strategies tactics from Russia I
mean do you think it's it's gonna happen
again
oh no yeah it's definitely going to
happen again they're already like
there's there's a lot that's going on
currently that like we probably don't
know about yet in the same way that all
the attacks happened in 2016 that we
didn't really like realize until like a
whole year later Scott brought that
point I like earlier basically the idea
that like yeah we know what to look out
for except Russia is probably gonna do
so yeah probably different they've kind
of moved on and you know the I think
from security experts that I've spoken
with about this like the idea is that
like the 2018 election is kind of like
the testing ground to see what works and
then that's like what they're going
full-throttle for in 2020
well scary stuff like heart syndrome you
always test for the wrong thing you
realize the park has other problems all
right for more on those stories chickens
on CNET I'm Roger J I'm Alfred Inge I'm
Scott Stein thanks for listening trying
to get all right come on that beat is
fire I had to wait for it right way that
was so good the music is so good my
music is so good I'm just putting that
out there you should have kept it
playing longer because I don't mean I
barely got take yeah yeah that's how I
always you know new studio new intros
man that's just right thanks everybody
for joining us it's like you're turning
couch gags on like The Simpsons where
it's like I just try to do something
different every time all right it's time
for me to jump into the chat and find
some decent questions and comments that
we can keep the conversation going with
let's go ahead and acknowledge that
syringe oh is one of the most eagle-eyed
viewers we have it seen at hey Jett
Scott isn't the red vaz for the red
comparison when you had the new red
iPhone in it is I mentioned that I said
unboxing but it wasn't unboxing oh so
the Eagle responds with an eagle eye a
comment but that was good and yes I was
trying to throw a reference to that to
say those four that's my unboxing well
done as always thank you that was a I
was an experimental unboxing yeah that's
one way to put it when you end up with a
lipstick on at the end of it from a user
whose name is in what I believe is
Taiwanese and I can't pronounce his I
can't read tight Taiwanese uh actually
after I saw Scott's video I just
installed iOS 12 on my iPhone 7 but it
doesn't feel like a beta it feels like
it's really working well and smooth it
also has better Siri features it seems
like there's a large number of people in
our chat today who have actually been
pleasantly surprised with the beta
release it seems like it's a better beta
than we've seen out of apple in the past
do we think that Apple's kind of turned
a corner since they have a bit of a
foggy history with releasing stuff maybe
arguably a little bit too early what do
you think Scott well that's that's great
to hear
I always warn people away from
installing a beta because it could
introduce all sorts of problems but that
is an interesting use in that if there
are people who find that the performance
of iOS right now has been awful for them
on their old device maybe they feel they
have nothing to lose and they say I'm
gonna try this beta because it could
really help me out that's the first time
the Apple's made a proposition that a
bit that a new version of the OS could
help older models or that I can remember
that really speaks to how buggy like
it's this random
beta that definitely has not been
checked for any quality control just for
the chance that it's gonna be better
than my buggy supposedly call the
control checked iOS may be running
slower on an old device yeah well first
of all iOS 11 is buggy and in second
yeah I mean I'm surprised someone around
someone I know installed the developer
beta we didn't need to it was like
re-enter he was just doing it to try it
out and I what are you doing on your
days at primary thumb under yes on your
like to live life on the edge if you
don't have a chance to check it out
otherwise maybe you feel it's okay you
got a backup but does somebody maybe you
feel it's totally fine I think this is a
safer experiment I still don't know
what's going to emerge in a beta what
problems might pop up so I try to talk
people away from it but I definitely
think that the performance gains could
be a real reason for
balda dive in soon and I will say like
after all the presentations are the moji
the group FaceTime like the thing I was
most excited about was performance
improvements was the fact those faster
and hopefully less buggy I love that
they never lead with that at like the
big leg shows or whatever it's just like
okay yeah the battery life is probably
gonna be out but check it out you can
talk of 32 people now and you can all be
koalas Apple did lead with the
performance proven right that was the
first thing they talked to him saying
like that should be like the the bulk of
it like yeah sooner or later you're
gonna get to group koala chat there's no
avoiding it and I actually I do want to
try group koala chat we're all koalas
now yeah sad koalas my wife said what's
the point of everything now of when I
when I showed her them emoji an animal I
always thought that how did that in as a
way to like break bad news to people
like like in a way that's like okay so
you're fired
but this cute panda kinda just fired me
I can't be that sad about it's like the
Back to the Future to see you do you the
Koala says you're fired you get all the
faxes do you use emojis with your wife
[Laughter]
no I don't use them for about a week and
I was like that was it and that was it
which I I mean when I look it's not all
those instances where I look back and I
go this is gonna be amazing and then I'm
disappointed from the very GetGo I
thought they were gimmicky oh yeah I I
do feel like look VR that's a different
story
we figure we've had ups and downs in VR
I still think in the future there but
with an emoji I felt like what this is
stuff you already see on snapchat right
right yeah it's weird though cuz like
you see like you said you see it on
snapchat like they're making you do it
through like iMessage which is right
kind of annoying is it would be nice if
it was broken out into more apps getting
to the stuff that does the cool effects
is super annoying for instance to put am
emoji on your head you have to which is
that bizarre yep extra trick you have to
go into messages
you have to then not tap the an emoji
button which is down below you have to
tap the camera button in messages and in
the camera part you have to tap the
filter and then you have to select the
an emoji part and select the an emoji
and make sure not to accidentally exit
it by pressing the wrong button oh my
gosh yeah it's like fun yeah that's
great and then if you want to save that
clip you have your spontaneous calls I
could see it well how's this work
glamour all how do you how do you
integrate into FaceTime than I do in
FaceTime you have the options there like
a bun like okay it's not like I've got
to go back to I messages activate them
emoji right back to FaceTime there just
be an an emoji app and so there should
be a way to hook it in directly into the
camera which is the main way you use it
it's annoying and I I feel like it's
like one step there but how many steps
do I need for talking and emoji and and
sorry I want to ask you unrelated
question because I know you spent a lot
of time your phone yeah and you've
thought about this too oh it's good the
screen time app are you actually gonna
use the screen time app thank you for
asking that when I was writing up the my
impression so far and these are very
early on it test phone and I haven't
moved into with my full account I think
for kids
screen time is an overdue feature that
you could do like I mean the switch has
it others have it we could limit use
that's great I'm a personal thing I am
NOT a believer in this isn't improving I
think about health tech right I think
about fitness bands and I think about
the fact that over time as I've used
those they made similar claims of
improving your life and I've said before
you kind of hit a wall like I need extra
coaching till I get to the really
healthy part at some point you're just
not going to improve naturally through
insights and I feel like it's the same
thing here like knowing how much I use
anything great that's like knowing how
many calories you eat it doesn't really
make you healthier to know that and I
think that's been proven over time or
fitness it's not so easy to just put a
calorie count up and just suddenly get
healthy and then the other thing is you
can just override yep any one of those
all you do is you tap it and you say
snooze for 15 minutes I feel like our
garage
those yeah that's pretty quick like on
the calories analogy though like doesn't
knowing it still make you like more
conscious of how much you're like doing
it and like make you try to make an
effort to like not do that no it is I'm
not saying so a totally good point and
I'm not saying you you give up and don't
show that but I'm skeptical about this
being enough on its own it's like step
one is the calorie count but step two
the thing I'm missing a lot of fitness
bands and why think personal trainers
are always intrigued me is that you
really need an extra step to get to like
the real level of fitness or it's like
if you know I need to lose as my
personal talking about weight less than
these but I need to lose like 40 to 50
pounds over time I find it really hard
to do and I keep going up and down at
the track but you could to get to that
step it's not so easy so to like go cold
turkey on like what is probably a big
phone addiction for people yeah I think
it's I for instance I deleted my Twitter
app I was like I'm done on my phone what
did I do like half an hour later I
reinstalled it totally weak-willed I
checked my phone at home I was judging
you right now yeah touch me I feel
really awful when I come home my kids
know I'm on the phone a lot I need to
learn how to give it up I need to do
that I would love screen time to help me
I'm super like the downtime idea where
if you said it at a certain time it does
yeah say hey hey dummy stop using this
right now right yep you go back to your
kids but I just feel like if you're
really hardcore into your device you're
just gonna hit that bye yeah I mean that
that's what I used to do for I had like
a Chrome extension that would basically
do the same thing was like from this
time there this time like I can't go on
like YouTube or anything like that but I
got to a point where like I'm a grown
man I can I'm just gonna turn this off
so I think it makes a good point in the
song it was like clean your room or so I
was like man for some no I got it I got
a brain that's nice boy yeah I was just
like I'm just gonna turn this off but
like do not disturb mode can be your
best friend in the world that's what I
rely on well like putting it as a part
that I'm I like
extra futures I'm not motivated to check
and unless someone's bothering me and
you guys always bother me yeah I like
the there was like a 12 day like
vacation that I took like during the
last Christmas break and I like deleted
my Twitter app and like all social media
apps on my phone I like it was great it
was not amazing without it
then I reinstall I wanted to go back to
work I am so I know I realized the only
way I can like stay off social media is
one in a hospital or tuna cruise ship
where I have zero cognitive 'ti right
that's really the only time or or like
I'm in someplace where I have no
continuity at all which is rare just
increasingly rare nowadays I'm going for
for another transatlantic Cruise in the
summer where I'll be eight days without
land so that'll be my next chance it and
there's no access at all it's like a
dollar a minute oh man tweets in that's
a good prohibitive measure that is so I
think that that that will be an
interesting experience this time a ganda
State or immersive theater just
basically staying immersive theater for
four years like well what else play
don't spoil it by the way I don't know
how okay we got to take some more
questions
I like this comment from our old friend
Chris Wesley oh and while we're at it I
want to make a shout out to our new
friend from Korea watching in South
Korea still alone Hey but welcome it's
great to have you Chris Wesley old
friend I feel like not just Apple but
everyone else is getting better at
making betas how do you guys feel about
that I I'm still kind of torn I think a
lot of these keynotes that we see are
lackluster and underwhelming and it's
just like oh goodie cartoon faces
congratulations on your tech degree do
we think these betas are actually
getting better are the beta themselves
worth more or they at least more stable
upon delivery date great question that's
something actually I was thinking about
for a future discussion for another
video two betas are weird for me I'm not
wild about betas although we're in a
world full of betas I mean games are all
about
betas and we remember Gmail was in beta
for years yeah use email is it still in
beta I think am I Sylvia may still who
knows but yeah we're we're full of betas
people like to test things people like
to try things so I understand that
I'd still maybe I'm probably
old-fashioned I'd rather wait for like
the release that's done but we are in an
age where nothing has really ever done
like you know every time a final release
comes out it's still full of bugs and
there are patches and problems that
happen all the time with with iOS so the
game industry is built on DLC now right
yeah yeah Kanye West's album that keeps
getting changed nothing is stable
nothing is stable so maybe in that sense
what I almost would like to just do way
if the idea of yearly releases and just
keep making updates you know just like
it's it's that it's that pack I guess
Windows does then it's like package
updates oh yeah bring update the spring
creators update yeah 2018 - whatever I
feel like unless you've got something to
like driver run around and discuss what
an X version of the OS is that's why it
starts feeling really silly as we're
just bundling a bunch of features that
start feeling less impressive into
something that's called a new version of
the OS right but to them that means
something to us it's like you're just
talking about screen time emoji and then
like how is they doing from airplay to
or messages in the cloud or like any
feature that gets Apple pay cash gets
pushed like mid year so I I'm fine with
a more stable beta but I think it does
point out the absurdity of like we're
always in beta
that's a deep that's a deep thought so
shout out to Kris from Korea
I like this comment from CERN Roy says I
think my life is still in beta sir enjoy
trademark that copyright that life in
beta would be an excellent podcast title
yours keep that is from Bill harried a
friend of mine is losing tons of ad
revenue on his business since recent
changes with Facebook any ideas why also
is Instagram a better platform for ad
at this time point hmm I don't think
instagrams a better platform for ads
more so that it is like a better
platform for like you know reaching out
to influencers and like big accounts and
things like that I think that the
problem that the ad industry is
struggling with is like how do you make
money off of that right yeah how do you
how do you exploit that for a lack of a
better word to sell things yeah that's
ultimately what Instagram needs to
figure how to do yes if it can't make
money then it's yes well as far as like
on it Facebook ad revenue stuff goes I
mean I'd have to have more details about
that it's hard it's hard me yeah
judgment or like assess the situation
that we really have no details it really
depends on what you're selling and
things like that who you're targeting a
lot of the times with Facebook like they
will just change things in their
algorithm you're like without really
telling people which is why they're like
a lot of media like Facebook sometimes
like don't get as many views as they
used to or anything like that but you
know it's all a mystery of Facebook we
are almost out of time let's take one
more question do you think IG Instagram
TV content creators will bring an
innovative tricks to promote vertical
orientation can we a 16 by 9 by 9 by 16
war I hope not I mean vertical did what
Isis much what I've been seeing on IG TV
is that people they its vertical but
like you just you flip your phone
sideways that it's fine it's not how
your eyes work that's why we went to the
16 by 9 letterbox format because of
science maybe they should just start
making horizontal phones you're going to
force evolution and everyone everyone is
going to start there no everyone's gonna
start getting born with sideways heads
because of video I love idea introducing
we should just create a video for the
NAD for the first horizontal phone it's
just reducing first iPhone you hold it
this way
hello alright it's available for you to
use there is no screen rotation you are
literally unlocked all the time it's got
like a gyroscope and it so anytime you
touch it you know what that's basically
how it holds my phone the next iOS
update
you're really chatting most the time so
you just just do this just go from that
they should make a feature where you
can't take photos unless the the phone
is horizontal like it's a gyroscope
detects that it's vertical like no no
you know what I want I think I wrote
this like a long time ago and seen it I
don't know why when you shoot video why
can't just be like a flip cam where you
should be able to shoot vertically but
have a record horizontally oh that's the
worst yeah that happens to me a lot well
I would be great because then you could
record horizontal videos but just you
know with the way the cameras oriented
it is but the flip managed it or did it
did it I mean it did that you just read
it square photos score videos the magic
I want to see I don't know how that
would I don't know what you do I really
like the ill-fated flip camera is like
the guideposts for how we should have
camera innovations reaching all the way
back
what is because it is so much easier to
record that way right but I and I guess
I am watching videos on my phone but
what about snap just circular videos yes
circular phones as well there was a
circular phone run sit the rots runcible
runcible runcible phone run sitter is a
character from a Philip dick novel and
you can use the back as like a coaster
and everything oh yeah there we go
or the frogs the screen there's going to
be the coaster yeah there you go
the oppo coaster I'll do it I'll buy it
it'll look like that'll get announced
like a pop up mean how fun this thing I
think it'll get you can get like the
what the hell is this a runcible I've
seen I saw knows what the hell is that
it's a it's a doctor basically a blood
watch it loved it people were all over
that it's good well that sort of came
out people could not get enough of that
you're a liar it's you Paul you put on a
monocle exactly and you know that's what
oh yeah just feel the it comes with a
cane to goggle cane accessories I think
monocles are gonna be the next comeback
next week they're basically be like the
schedules been lying in ball have you
okay I would have you been to Brooklyn
lately Scott no I haven't I have seen a
monocle in the wild but based on based
on Montclair New Jersey x' like what are
they prescription I'm going immigration
like I feel like I can wait three or
four years and I'll see that you'll see
the monocle yeah I do
Alfre I do like your dragonballs yeah
scatters would look awesome
isn't that Google glass yeah yeah but
Google glass had two glasses just break
it in half and there's like stuff like
inside like scarring and then you have
this monocle oh my god like evil Morty
yeah okay there you go
give us money whoa we have brilliant
ideas we are completely out of time but
the more Tikal just the more Tikal I
know oh yeah I want to I want to plant
this seed and everyone's head though we
have to go we are at a time where I just
got a meeting to go to
I want to plant this thought I love this
discussion we're having about phone
orientation and and prioritization and
like apps that would train you to use
your phone in the right orientation the
first thing that comes to mind is when
did this become an acceptable way to
take a phone call every time I see
somebody talking on this out on the
street I want to slap anybody takes a
vertical photo everybody takes vertical
video I'd love to just branch this
conversation out into what are like some
of the biggest faux pause about holding
your phone I've seen people do that on
the train and I've also noticed it's
more acceptable now for people to like
play music out loud without headphones
but I anytime I see somebody doing doing
this on the train or like it in public
because I'm a jerk I'll like pretend to
be on the phone I'll be like this and I
was like hey what's up yeah how's it
going I'm just talking enlike a normal
person would and hold
not like an idiot okay cool yeah I'll
see you later bye hi - I do see this I
do see this a lot more often what's the
value there I guess you don't touch your
ear with this line isn't the speaker
over here or that's way worse you're
being obnoxious you should you should do
that every time so what do you guys
think is some of the worst offenses of
people and how they hold their phone
from vertical video and photo to
shouting into the speaker - playing
stuff out loud we want to hear it in the
chat in the comments until then we do
have to say goodbye Roger all right I
feel like anything you saw or heard here
checks out on scene at our podcast is
