yellow Chevy Aveo in the scenic car tech
garage it's our test mule for
electronics I've never driven it I never
will
I'm afraid to be seen in it but that's
changing when it comes to the bottom of
Chevy's line because bottom ain't bottom
anymore
this is what replaces the avail the 2012
Sonic LTZ turbo let's check it out don't
mind if I do
and check the deck now in a car in this
price point you're never going to get
super luxo materials but they're
definitely a step up from the avail
instrument cluster real different
motorcycle inspired big analog tach on
the left everything else is digital on
that blue screen to the right including
your only speedometer which is
relatively unusual in a car in this
price class to have at digital-only
here's the head unit and it always looks
like this there's never an LCD here this
car doesn't offer integrated nav or
vehicle control on a big screen but you
got a bright screen bright blue easy to
read with basic options now if you get a
totally basic sonic not even a turbo
you're going to get am/fm and that aux
jack and that's it not even a CD CD is
an upgrade satellite radio is an upgrade
also USB for your thumb driver iPod and
on the higher trim cars you get
Bluetooth hands-free calling and
Bluetooth audio streaming so you end up
with a pretty nice array of stuff here
about the only thing that's missing is
no ability to go to premium sound the
best you can do is go from 4 speakers to
6 and no HD radio oh it's a small thing
but these two kind of nasty-looking
binnacle is up on the side of the center
stack a real handy now on most Sonics
non turbos you get a base 5-speed manual
or for about a grand more a 6-speed
automatic kind of an advanced gearbox on
this car being a turbo one choice only
and that is a 6-speed manual if you
don't like using a clutch you don't want
to buy a sonic turbo okay now our sonic
is a turbo the base sonic would not be
this it would be a naturally aspirated
fuel-injected 1.8 liter for kind of
garden-variety stuff giving you 138
horsepower
same horsepower on the turbo so what's
the point well it's a 1.4 liter turbo
they get more torque out of it 23
foot-pounds more bringing that up from
125 to 148 moves the car from zero to 60
and eight seconds instead of like eight
point eight and gives you better mpg
29:40 instead of 26:35 with the standard
car so they're using the turbo here as
much for efficiency as they are for
performance and drivability okay now on
the road the first thing I notice in the
sonic turbo is that it's a 1.4 liter not
that it's a turbo it prints small engine
before it prints turbo engine once you
learn to modulate the throttle the way
it wants you can get decent and reliable
power on it but all too often when I
jump on it and need something it's just
not there or it's a full second away
suspension and handling are just fine in
fact I'd say it's more of a ride quality
story than it is a handling story it
doesn't have the sharpness that I
remember from the Honda Fit Sport for
example nor the power availability from
the Ford Fiesta but it doesn't do a bad
job middling either and the overall
quality of the cabin is quite good
nothing rattles or feels cheap I'm not
getting any bad road noise or vibration
that's a that's a key win in a car in
this class is for it to feel inside more
like it's a cruise than a sonic and I
think they've largely nailed that okay
the bottom line on the sonic this is a
big car for Chevy it's a clean sheet
design made in the US unlike the avail
it's also important I think right now
this car comes in around 20 or so as a
turbo loaded up all CNET style which
isn't too lavish but it's got the basics
as we saw drivability real nice you
won't feel like you're in as cheap a car
as it is main competition Ford Fiesta
unto fit and definitely Hyundai Accent
it doesn't dominate any of those cars
but it competes on mpg power and value
nicely across the board
