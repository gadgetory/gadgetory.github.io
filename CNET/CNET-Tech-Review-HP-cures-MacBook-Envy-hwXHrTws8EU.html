the bookstore head to the app store
instead before you head back to school
plus Spotify tricks for some slick
playlists HP's envy 14 may make you
rethink your macbook purchase and a
solar-powered keyboard that makes
fluorescent lighting a little more
tolerable it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good first off
to all you kids out there enjoying your
summer break I've got three words for
you back to school wah wah I know we're
barely into August but some of you are
only weeks away from heading back to
campus and we want to make sure that you
are fully prepared when you get there
that's why Brian Cooley is here with his
top 5 download recommendations for your
smartphones tablets and PCs
whether you're going back to school this
year with cool new tech or the same crap
you had last year you can tune it up
nicely by downloading this year's
hottest programs and apps I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five you really need
to get on your gear sorted by the five
major categories of gear you're likely
going to be packing number 5 iPad
downloads skype is on our list now sure
skype works on just about everything but
on the ipad you sort of sit there with
your mouth open because it really rocks
video calls on that full touchscreen and
of course make sure you're running it on
an ipad 2 with the cameras or you're
going to be sitting there making a voice
call on a big screen device and that's
kind of lame also look at netflix
netflix i'm convinced has kept scores of
ipad buyers from taking the damn thing
back with buyer's remorse because it
reminds you why you just spent five to
eight hundred bucks on a mobile device
that doesn't even make phone calls it's
what portable TV always wanted to be
number four is our mac software category
starting off with tweetdeck now we
always like TweetDeck which is now owned
by twitter by the way we especially like
the mac version which isn't what you
always hear it looks sharp and it's a
great way to merge and manage twitter
and facebook posts from you your friends
your followers and that weird stalker
guy we also are big on spotify when
you're cranking away on your mac doing
homework you know you're gonna be
playing music nobody studies in silence
anymore nothing is hotter in online
music right now then spotify it just
launched in the u.s. right in time for
the school year their track library is
huge and you pick exactly what you want
to hear not a sounds like thing the way
you do on pandora number three are
android apps starting off with the
kindle app the free kindle app for
android is a simple clean way to get a
kindle without buying a kindle that's
more money for beer that way and you
know all about kindle books and
periodicals web feeds PDF support but
the new thing just announced is the
kindle textbook store you can save huge
money by renting digital versions of
your textbooks and you still get to save
your notes and highlights from them
after your book rental ends cuz those
are just fun to look at
years from now also those Evernote what
is school if not one big organizational
pain Evernote for Android really fills a
need for one app that swallows up text
notes voice clips pictures files links
even GPS locations you'll kind of be
like Einstein when he said he never
memorized his phone number because he
always knew where to look it up unless
you drop your phone in the toilet
Einstein number two we get to our red
hot iphone category starting off with
the whatsapp messenger now put this on
your iPhone and you can save tons on
texting because you'll be able to skirt
that texting plan that you pay your
carrier for the catch is your friends
and family who you want to text this way
also have to install whatsapp messenger
then they and you are texting and even
sharing your locations for free yeah
that's going to be a tough sale also
we're big on Yelp think about it now if
you're heading off to college especially
a new college you're not leaving without
two things one a lot of weirdness from
your parents and two they yelp app on
your iPhone now everyone thinks
restaurants when they think Yelp but
it's a great pocket guide to finding
anything like a guitar shop then a
piercing place then a skateboard store
and a Career Counseling Center now our
number one category for back-to-school
downloads it's pc and windows stuff
chrome browser at the top of the list
chrome is really cool partly because
it's really fast and it makes the google
stuff work very well it's also nicely
standards compliant and it seems to run
best in its pc or windows version plus
you can turn on sinking so your
bookmarks prefs and settings will follow
you to any other machine that is running
chrome just by you using your Google
login great for all that itinerant
computer used to do in school finally
there's paint.net now come on you're not
gonna pay for photoshop and you probably
don't need that horsepower anyway so
paint.net sour go to pick it's open
source so no cash required it does all
the essential stuff and a few advanced
tricks as well and it seems to get an
update like every two days now for more
on all our back-to-school pics software
and gear go to back to school cnet com
and for more top 5s like this its top 5
cnet com
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
that's a good list especially since it
had 10 items on it instead of five
consider it a bonus I would like to add
one more item to your download queue
though especially if you're a Windows
user BitDefender total security 2012
you're as seth rosenblatt to tell you
why hi i'm seth rosenblatt foreseen it
and in this first look we'll be peering
behind the walls of BitDefender total
security 2012 which you can get from
cnet download.com for the second year in
a row bitdefender's got a new look the
suite now has a dark theme not unlike
norton it also retains the modularity of
last year's basic interface but the rest
is entirely new the beginner
intermediate advanced interface options
are gone replaced with a single approach
this status ring here shows a your
security status green for secure yellow
for problems that require attention and
red for immediate issues this ought to
be narrowed to green and red the yellow
is potentially confusing either give got
problems or you don't the new UI it does
retain some of the defenders modularity
though this is the default look but you
can swap these security modules around
each one has an icon at the top for easy
recognition and toggles at the bottom to
manage the feature the settings window
is well designed with tabs that
precisely reflect the options presented
in the main window this year's interface
is definitely easier to use than last
year's enough about looks let's talk
features there's not a huge amount
that's new in bitdefender 2012 but there
are some important improvements there's
a new autopilot that's on by default
it's a smart system that sets most
notifications to silent automatically
deals with most threats encountered and
basically ensures that your security is
running but not bothering you the
browser add-on previously limited to
Firefox and Internet Explorer has been
replaced by a browser agnostic tool this
means that you'll be protected no matter
which browser you use rescue mode has
been beefed up
and bitdefender's free facebook scanning
tool Safco has been baked in it ought to
support Twitter soon if it doesn't by
the time you watch this the online
storage component safe box now gets file
syncing across multiple computers
bitdefender's efficacy scores have been
strong in the past six months on
infection prevention generally in the
top five across multiple independent
testers it scans are fast but not the
fastest and be warned you're definitely
going to notice its impact on startup
and shutdown times also it's got a very
aggressive install and it won't play
well even with security programs that
are designed to be complementary to the
major sweets such as malware bytes oh
and that corporate philosophy thing the
software maker says it's the computer
security equivalent of the mythical
Romanian half wolf half dragon which
let's be honest it's kind of awesome I
think more computer security companies
should take on animal avatars kung fu
style and that's your first look at
bitdefender 2012 i'm seth rosenblatt I
don't care how boring internet security
seems I want that did you hear that
hackers I've got a wolf dragon watching
my back but if you're looking for
something a little more social Spotify
also made Brian's list now I know many
of you are still waiting for your
invites but if you happen to be among
the chosen few already using the service
sharon has a few tips to make the most
out of your playlists
hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com and today I'm going to make you
a Spotify playlist master first let's
talk about the best ways to discover new
music for your playlist starting with
Spotify built-in tools because the
search bar is actually a lot smarter
than you think instead of just entering
the name of an artist or song title use
search operators for example you can
search year colon 1972 1980 and get a
list of popular songs from that decade
or if you want a flashback from the new
millennium search year colon 2000 or you
can search for something like genre
colon rap space year 1994 and find rap
music from that year this is a full list
of search operators so you can mix and
match to find new or old songs for your
playlists another built-in feature is
related artists anytime you see a song
click the artist name and you'll get an
overview of their top songs albums a bio
and related artists which is also a good
feature for discovering new music it's
not as cool as Pandora but it'll do now
that you're a music discovery Pro you
can drag and drop music into new
playlists just remember that all
playlists are automatically public so
make sure to make them private if you
don't want people discovering your love
for Justin Bieber just right-click a
playlist and uncheck publish in this
menu you'll also see the collaborative
playlist option this makes it so that
anyone you share the playlist width can
add songs to it and add it to their
sidebar to the only catch is that it
makes the playlist private to you and
those people now if you don't want to do
all the work searching for songs and
creating playlists there are a few
services that will do it for you and one
of them is spotted bot go to spot a bot
calm and hit more options under the
search bar enter the name of an artist
or multiple artists by clicking add
another select the number of tracks and
hit generate playlist you'll get an
automated playlist of songs similar to
the artist or song you entered which you
can then drag and drop right into
Spotify another way to find playlist is
to use a sharing site like share my
playlist com which lets people upload
their playlists for everyone to download
you can browse through the collection
search by keyword or look at the charts
to see which playlists are most popular
once you find one just click play and it
will launch and Spotify and don't forget
to subscribe at the top to add it to
your sidebar now here's a tool I love
what if you already made play this on
youtube soundcloud grooveshark and other
music services well-placed if I org will
take those playlists and help you
transfer them to Spotify just go to
place to fight org and click bake your
own playlist then select which service
you want to grab your playlist from and
follow the instructions you'll end up
with a link that you can then open and
Spotify without going through all the
trouble of rebuilding it by hand so now
you have a huge list of Awesome
playlists but maybe you have too many in
your sidebar and it's getting a little
crowded now this is where playlist
folders comes in to create one just go
to file new playlist folder give it a
name and drag and drop playlists into
that folder to keep your sidebar tidy
once you've got your place built
organized and perfected it's time to
share them go back to share my playlist
com and upload your clothes so that
anyone can get them or just right-click
a playlist and select copy HTTP link and
paste it into Twitter and email instant
message or facebook when someone clicks
it it'll launch Spotify okay now it's
time to go and make your epic playlist
and be sure to send me a link on my
facebook page and visit how to cnet com
for more tips tricks and guides for your
gadgets Brucie net I'm Sharon Vaknin and
i'll see you on the interwebs
just remember as more people start
joining Spotify you'll have more and
more friends to share music and build
playlists with and maybe paying the
monthly fee for offline listening might
seem a little more reasonable me
personally I like that now if you like
to keep a tidy desktop a wireless
keyboard can be the key to a Spartan
workspace if you're into that sort of
thing but if you're not into dumping a
bunch of batteries into your local
landfill check out this new solar
keyboard from logitech if you're tired
of replacing batteries on your computer
keyboard logitech has a new solar
powered solution that earns our Editor's
Choice Award I'm Justin you peripherals
editor for cnet com this is your first
look at the logitech wireless solar
keyboard k750 the k 750 s killer app is
the dual solar panels that power the
integrated lithium rechargeable battery
inside they also draw a perpetual power
from artificial light sources which
means you don't have to be sitting by a
window or even outside for the recharge
the lights in your apartment or above
your desk at work are fine and the
keyboard automatically senses and stores
those charges in ambient light to keep
the unit charged best of all Logitech
tells us a single to our charge will
retain power for the keyboard for up to
three months or more if you use the
on/off switch in the corner the k750 may
take a little getting used to though in
terms of typing if you're normally used
to the generic keyboard that came with
your computer that's because the keys
use scissors style switches underneath
that you have a much shorter vertical
clicking distance which means two things
first the low-profile switches make for
a typing experience that's a lot more
like a laptop and a desktop keyboard
that means low noise and light touch for
actuation second the key switches also
make the keyboard super thin that's just
one third of an inch thick other notable
features include Logitech's perfect
stroke uniform key structure and
unifying receiver technology so a
unifying receiver is this USB port here
that links to your computer to the
keyboard and it sticks out just about
half an inch off your computer
and you can power up to six other
Logitech devices at a time saving your
precious USB ports for other peripherals
finally we're really impressed with
logitech's thorough eco conscious design
principles from the pvc-free chassis to
the one hundred percent recyclable
packaging and even a download link
instead of a physical driver disk in the
box shows the company's push to reduce
the users footprint for its
affordability eco-consciousness and
thoughtful feature set we're proud to
award Logitech the Editors Choice Award
and you can read all the details in our
full review on cnet com but that's going
to do it for me I'm Justin you you just
took a first look at the logitech
wireless solar keyboard k750 thanks for
watching as justin mentioned the solar
keyboard can hold a charge for up to
three months so for those of you who
prefer to do your computing in a
darkened cave you could just switch on a
light once a quarter charge that baby
and take the opportunity to throw out
some of those pizza boxes too all right
the time has come to take a break but
stick around we still have a lot more
tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good if you're one
of those early adopter types and you
want something to tinker around with
while you're riding in someone's
passenger seat the pioneer AppRadio
might be right up your alley though it
aims for seamless iPhone integration
with your car you might end up being a
little disappointed these days
smartphones pretty much do everything so
why do you need a fancy car stereo
that's the question that pioneer aim to
answer with its new app radio the first
car stereo to be almost completely
powered by your iPhone I'm antuan
goodwin let's take a first look at this
one of a kind of ice the Pioneers
appradio is aimed squarely at those of
you who are absolutely addicted to your
iPhone's now by itself it's a little
more than an am/fm radio tuner a
Bluetooth hands-free system and a kind
of fancy kind of sexy 7-inch capacitive
touchscreen now if you don't actually
have an iPhone that's about all that you
can expect from this app radio pretty
disappointing huh however connect an
iphone to the included 30-pin dock
connector and the rest of app radio
functionality spring to life thanks to a
set of apps that are installed on this
connected i device users are able to
browse google maps search for points of
interest and get directions however like
the Maps app on the iPhone itself these
directions aren't live updating so you
want to get a passenger to advance those
instructions and probably read the
directions allowed for you users who
want the real deal for turn-by-turn
directions will want to install the
motionx gps Drive app on your iPhone
which does exactly that it gives you
those turn-by-turn directions motionx is
a free app for the first 30 days after
downloading though it's going to cost
you about three dollars per month
thereafter users can also add traffic
data at an additional cost or you can
just install the inrix traffic app on
your iPhone to gain access to free
traffic reports incidents and flow data
while you're on the road you can access
your locally stored ipod media or stream
audio from the internet with the pandora
internet radio or Rdio apps on the
iphone all of which are very cool ways
to keep your head
on your next long drive there's also
calendar integration and a contact
manager which lets you initiate
hands-free calls or even email your
current GPS location to anyone in your
context list even better pioneers
actively working with even more app
developers to add more choices to the
list of supported apps however at radio
is about as first generation as Hardware
comes so there are some odd interface
quirks that you'll need to be aware of
before you pull the trigger on this guy
first you'll notice that every app looks
a little bit different which is buying
on a handset but it can be difficult
when you're just trying to skip tracks
while you're driving next none of the
apps are connected to one another and
they run a separate processes on your
phone so that inrix traffic data i
talked about isn't actually going to
factor into your Google Maps or motionx
gps Drive directions more importantly
none of these apps have a back button
built into them so if you actually want
to switch between the apps for example
you're tired of our do and you want to
listen to pandora you'll have to
physically touch your phone to switch
between the apps using the touchscreen
which means you can't really just hide
the phone away in a glove compartment
and control it with the app radio which
sort of defeats the purpose of actually
using the app radio again pioneer
promises that it is making strides
towards continuously updating the app
radio and the apps that it supports but
for now it feels like it should probably
be called F radio beta for you iphone
addicts and early adopters that may not
be such a bad thing but I think I'd wait
for app radio to bake for a bit longer
before taking the plunge well there you
have it for more of my thoughts on this
one-of-a-kind car audio receiver and
I've got plenty of them look for the
full review on cnet com which is also
where you can find more cool first look
videos I'm answer one good one giving
you a first look at the pioneer AppRadio
the a Brady oh really could have gone in
the bad section of the show this week
but I like the idea and the direction
pioneers headed so I'm giving it a pass
although I'm afraid I can't say the same
for the next item which is truly
deserving of the title hi I'm rich brown
senior editor for cnet.com today we're
going to take a look at the acer aspire
x 1920 you are 20 p so this is actually
a pretty terrible budget desktop sad to
say the case is pretty decent it's the
nice simple design relatively clean here
got the DVD burner by the front door
there few ports media card reader down
here but the problem is that the system
really is sort of under featured even
for its low price you can find it for
about four to five hundred dollars
depending on where you look comes with a
reasonably fast intel pentium dual-core
chip they're still making pan geum's it
has four gigs of ram a terabyte hard
drive and that's about it the system is
really pretty spare and you can get
better equip pcs for the same price so
we really can't recommend you buy this
system now the back of the case we think
you'll see what we mean when we say how
under feature it is you've got 5.1 audio
support only two USB ports a single egg
internet jack old-school ps2 mouse and
keyboard inputs as well as a me GA video
out there's no digital audio no digital
video no firewire e-sata a little own
USB 3 you can find those features at
least in some combination on other
desktops in this price range
particularly gateway which is actually
ironic since ASR owns gateway so inside
the case the layout is pretty
straightforward for a slim tower there's
the intel cpu here you can see here's
the DVD drive underneath that is the
hard drive there's room for only one
hard drive inside and down here you kind
of can't see it but there's two memory
sticks not for memory sticks lots like
you get on some other pcs for card
expansion the system has no cards but
there is a 1 x pci express slot those a
16 x pci express slots you can put say a
half height graphics card in this pc but
we wouldn't even recommend this
upgrade platform just because it's
really pretty underpowered and under
featured as we've mentioned now we don't
always expect slim towers to deliver it
say the fastest performance are the most
features for the dollar but the fact
that they're such tiny cases really
makes them well-suited both to desktop
environments and the living room you can
imagine putting a system like this next
so TV is a pretty decent home media
server but with no Wi-Fi adapter or no
digital video out that really makes the
system tough to recommend for the living
room environment you can also get better
bang for your buck in terms of
performance in this price range so for
both those reasons we can't recommend
you buy the system Farmer Brown this is
the acer aspire x 1920 you are 20 p
let's take a look at some of riches
takeaways from this review under
featured can't recommend underpowered
and how could we forget pretty terrible
i don't think i have anything to add so
let's finish things up here with this
week's bottom line this summer apple has
introduced updates to both the macbook
pro and the macbook air laptop lines
which is great news to apple fans with
money to burn luckily for the other
ninety percent of the world HP's updated
envy 14 continues to be a word the
alternative
I'm dan Aykroyd and we are here taking a
look at the latest version of HP's envy
14 now if you look at this envy 14 you
may say it looks a heck of a lot like
the last entry 14 or pretty much all the
envy laptops that we've reviewed and
from the outside it actually is pretty
much exactly the same that said that's
not necessarily a bad thing on the
windows side this is about as close as
you're going to get the kind of that
hefty metallic macbook pro look and feel
and it's really one of our favorite
high-end pcs right now on the inside the
differences are this latest version of
the envy 14 has one of Intel second
generation core i series processor of
this one has a core i5 in this case it
also had USB 3 and it adds a its new
touchpad gestures they've taken this
large image pad style touchpad at the
very front here and even though it looks
the same they've tried to upgrade the
two three and four finger gestures to
work a little bit more like dare I say
at a macbook they're differently are
some improvements here however it's not
quite the same as you do get with a
macbook the two-finger scrolling not
quite as smooth there's a new handy for
finger gesture for bringing up and
hiding all your different windows that
you're working with that's kind of very
similar to what a four finger gesture
pre line used to do on a macbook it's
still not quite as smooth and seamless
as that still you get most of the things
that you're looking for in a higher-end
midsize laptop you've got both hdmi and
displayport outputs of course that USB
three pointer and some basic AMD
graphics so you could do some you know
mid-level gaming on here even better the
envy 14 starts at nine ninety nine which
is the same as the 13-inch macbook used
to start at now you'd have to either get
a 999 macbook air 11 inch model or trade
up to about 1,200 bucks for a 13-inch
macbook pro or even more for a 13-inch
macbook air so if you're looking for
something that's built like a tank solid
metal and really emulates kind of that
macbook pro look and feel on the window
side you're not going to do better than
the HP envy line and this envy 14
definitely hits the sweet spot coming in
at 990
i'm dan ackerman and that is the HP envy
14 bottom line this week what's apples
return policy again and also is it just
me or does the phrase for finger gesture
sound a little bit dirty don't think
about it too hard okay folks that's our
show go back next week for an all-new
cnet tech review until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at Cena TV com I'll see you next time
