4.2.2 that includes a keyword trade for
a going price of about 480 bucks so it's
pretty much an Android based netbook
however the tablet portion can of course
be detached from a keyboard it's pretty
light as a tablet but the side that
plugs into the keyboard tray has a
couple of really uncomfortable edges
that really sours the experience when
handling it the same edge also has an
awkwardly placed micro SD card slot and
a headphone jack as well as dual
speakers that even though they face the
user are very powerful sounding but
they're decent enough there's a
serviceable front facing camera and an
okay back camera neither of which will
set your world of fire the power and
volume buttons are located on the back
which surprisingly works pretty well and
as long as you know where the feel
they're pretty easy to find when
attached like I said before it feels
like a netbook circa 2010 design running
Android we've seen these before with the
Asus Transformer line but this one
doesn't really push that idea forward at
all the keyboard still feels too small
and cramped however I do appreciate the
extra wide touchpad the keyboard does
pack in a lot of features though with
its own headphone jack full USB port
full HDMI port and a full SD card reader
also the keyboard has its own battery so
you're getting extra battery life if
it's attached the screen resolution is
1920 by 1200 which on a 10-inch tablet
these days is good but ultimately
unimpressive there's also a very
noticeable yellow tint to the screen
that really sticks out when looking at
websites with white backgrounds and when
compared to Telus that handle colour
better like the Nexus 10 the x2 comes
with only 16 gigabytes of storage which
feels low for a $480 tablet even while
with a keyboard there also doesn't pier
to be any GPS hardware which is kind of
a weird omission the x2 is not an
exceptional tablet it's also not an
altogether bad one
it's just that 480 bucks feels a little
too expand
given an overall quality of his
offerings check out my full review at
