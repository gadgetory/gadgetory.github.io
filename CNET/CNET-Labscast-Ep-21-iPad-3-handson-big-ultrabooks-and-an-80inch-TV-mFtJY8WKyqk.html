smoother every week and thanks Steve
attempt to go for actually doing the
talking about these cool gadgets you
don't have right here Joseph exciting
looks like a case it is a kid what one
side look in the case yeah all those big
news last week that's right the ipad 3 i
know you can tell immediately it's an
ipad 3 not an ipad one or two right you
got in the school targus case that they
said don't you guys it is a two times
before well that's that that's the big
thing how can you tell uh you know the
difference and and and you've got it too
I've got a three cats meyer and i spent
about 40 minutes on friday sitting on
i'll tell you the story very quickly we
said you know how far you have to hold
it from your face to tell the difference
with the higher resolution and catch
Meyer said to me well how do you usually
read your iPad I said well you know in
bed usually so how far is that so I sat
down on his floor i put my my head up
against the back of his wall and stretch
my legs out and said okay let's pretend
i'm in bed and then he gets on the floor
next to me so the two of us are
stretched out in in this faux bed just
on the floor was off as leaning up
against the back wall a holding iPads at
various distances in front of our faces
to try to stimulate that sort of reading
the newspaper in bed experience and that
was our sort of ipad 2 vs ipad 3
resolution test now i will say uh that
that now i'm sure ty you've you've seen
both screens now correct um only from
about this distance and and what was
your and what was your immediate
reaction to that yeah i got that knows
about the change in resolution that much
it does it bother you that it's a higher
resolution than HD TV no no it doesn't
um because most monitors now if they're
not 1080 they are a little bit higher
you know for the 27-inch and 30 inches
they are what 21 by something right okay
but i think you to monitor yeah exactly
so the fact that it's quite high in
resolution it's good because i know that
when i had the original iPad you can
sort of see pixels I'm you know being a
TV review I instantly noticed pixel
structure so the fact that you can't
really see it now is good and but I
don't think that it's that leap that
that
strophic leak that they saying that it
is like we were looking at a lot of
photos and some video and was hard to
tell even with super high-res photos I
thought with with text it was a lot
clearer especially if you kind of you
pinch in and zoom in if you're reading
let's say a website online like a news
website like scenic maybe or like the
New York Times really or an e-book or
something else with text on it or the
notepad thing actually that made a big
difference but for regular stuff I could
really see it Joseph my like my only
gripe is is that they give you the
retina display is great that's great but
here he has no please please why would I
want what I me personally what I wanted
was a higher capacity I have a 64
gigabyte and I have to keep deleting
things when I had other things I've over
a hundred ninety apps that are taking
over 20 gigs of space now you can just
redownload them it will once i give her
the ones you know this thing i don't
want the codman but that's that's a
thing okay the people that want the
cloud and they're people like myself who
don't want the class the whole meal the
whole point of having a device like that
is not being reliant on anything else i
can be somewhere where I don't have a
signal I can enjoy a program or I could
play a game I don't want to have to
depend on a hot spot or a Wi-Fi place I
want to know I can have it and even now
I'm updating my apps and they're larger
so I'm updating my apps on my my second
generation and they're taking up more
space for a higher resolution screen so
even that in itself should say hey
should scream we need a higher capacity
device so I'm a little disappointed that
the retina display is nice maybe they
could have kept the camera off and gave
you a higher capacity if they wanted to
cut back but I would prefer 32 64 128
and i will say that until they do it and
everybody else could be happy with the
iphoto of the aisle I for the I this all
right but I want space but what I want
to pay would you pay more for 128 well
I'm well I'm saying they could have
shaved the Cameron and given me and
giving me the the higher capacity I
would have tried I would trade how to
use the same camera and taking a higher
capacity instead interesting people
interesting now I i thought i'm going to
show you a picture now the thai ads of
what I did was I went to the New York
Times website which I read a lot in fact
I'm
actual paid subscriber to to that and I
took a screenshot of the reader view of
an article on the ipad 2 and then I did
the same thing same article same
paragraph on the ipad 3 that's right
there we go now if you look at this big
image there depending on on the quality
of the stream you may be able to see the
difference I know it's very obvious to
us here in the studio on the left is the
ipad 2 and on the right side is the same
text in the ipad 3 it's like night day I
mean there's really no debating that
right now it doesn't into a blind person
like me that's great because I actually
use my iPad without my glasses but I got
I it's very frustrating because they do
this to you like every time it's like
give you a slightly better product for
the same price everything is the render
the retina display is already old on the
iphone so it's so it should be so
impressive or such a new thing to the
iPad because we've seen it like what two
generations ago on the iphone it's on
the iphone that's a little tiny ver what
I'm just saying so it's on the iphone
now the ipad gets it so basically now
what the iphone 4 I mean it's me the
iPad 4 is going to have Siri because we
don't have Siri now it just it's just
very frustrating that they they do this
to you and they making they have people
who really love their products as
salivating to have everything in one
place at one time um the surprising
thing is the fact that they rushed for
jiendo because normally apple doesn't
make things mainstream until it's until
it's mainstream so I think the 4g thing
they were kind of forced into and that's
probably nothing that brought their
costs up and that kind of short us or
maybe getting the capacity because there
are too many Android tablets out there
screaming 4g and when you're out there
for those who your iphone now says 4g on
it even though it's not really 4g they
change the letter on it hey hey listen
there are people who thought the iphone
4 was 4G so they didn't even need a
letter all excellent points um I just
think the text if you read a lot it's
really different and a guy on the I
think the silicon alley insider Business
Insider took a technology business news
website uh they had a good little short
piece this morning that I actually liked
a lot where guy said he got the iphone
the ipad 3 took it home over the weekend
ok lo looks fine no big deal then on
Monday he went back after using the new
one for like three days and looked at
someone's ipad 2 and was like i could
even read it it was so blue
it was just mind-blowing and I did that
this morning I got out the ipad 2 uh and
look I was like whoa you're right how do
they ever read this what the hell was I
thinking well it's it's like it's like
it goes back to like when you are when
you with televisions like when you win
if you have a high definition television
at home and that's in there's a certain
station it's Walker there's not
available high-def you have to go back
to standard definitely oh my god how did
ever watch standard def but there were
times back in the day where people were
loving dvds and and you know and 480p
now you just get used to it you get
spoiled but that's nice of the screen to
careen you you used to watching what a
20 20 inch in ever more water you never
work past 27 32 was a lot i remember the
19's man that was a standard hey listen
i'm dating myself I had a
black-and-white TV uh sorry my idling
are I my friend to this day in his in
his house this is this old school it
doesn't work anymore but it's the TV
that's set in the wooden box yeah and to
the right is like the record player and
the speakers and everything are built in
it and the doors closed and you can open
up with the TV so he has like his new TV
on top of that I've done that I've been
there temporarily but I mean you know
what it's such an antique you can't get
rid of that you can i would i would just
assume gut it and maybe put like a flat
screen in there and it's around model
epoxy and the modded put something
something in fish tank III try to show
you one more thing uh 11 more new ipad
thing and this is actually not new for
the ipad 3 you can actually play this on
your ipad 2 or your phone but i'm
addicted to it now and there apparently
were like four million people playing
this game simultaneously last night in
the course of one hour they've they've I
think 20 million people downloaded it in
like four weeks and that's draw
something if you haven't seen it I gonna
hold it up real fast it's like words
with friends meets pictionary I started
my first game more oh good good we'll
have to start playing now so I have a
choice of drawing for the person i'm
playing with a cook rest which I guess
the concept the concept of rest or a
suitcase which is supposed to be hard i
think that's the easiest really so i'm
going to click on suitcase I don't know
how this game actually goes I've only
played the first rounded where you draw
something so that's what I've done okay
so be cool guest something really
drawing guests on out now if you saw
that I guess it looks more like a
briefcase than a suitcase I should have
done it differently maybe a bag like as
well as long as long as it's not a
thermometer because we played a game
Axemen he drew a thermometer and it
looked like a piece of a male anatomy
it's a thermometer in did not look like
a Julie and I get a Julie gonna test it
did not look like a thermometer missiles
only thanks to you good yeah good an
upside-down turkey baster right let's
see maybe a maybe a little handle coming
out of the top ok now this doesn't look
anything like a suitcase I've completely
failed if I were a lawnmower it looks
like a yeah it looks like a trolley cart
with like a coffee machine on it all
right or one of those dry cleaning I did
not doing this I did not do a good job
there that's all I'm going to say but
there's been an interesting couple of
hats who's on the site in the last
couple of weeks Sharon Beck know they
right I have to go back and read those
now that I'm playing the game but this
there's some sort of stylish you can
make with a piece of foil and a these'll
forget how really low rent to me but the
thing is he can actually get stylist is
fairly cheap there between 10 and 20
bucks mm-hmm and they actually look
quite good so I wouldn't play with a
pencil and better for myself I wouldn't
do that but if you wanted apparently if
you want to play draw something the
first thing you should do is get a good
stylist or get it for the the samsung
note which comes with the style is right
right huge 5.3 inch it's just I always
game for now but if you could play an
android samsung that would be great to
play that really and it'll be coming to
android right we can only hope it's a
matter of time that's alright so going
from this 9.7 inch screen to a screen
that is approximately eight or nine
times larger hi what exciting thing that
you have that we wanted to look at it is
simply too big to bring in here okay
it's called the le8 no sorry the le 632
it's an eight inch screen by sharp so
we've had this in while i will put it on
the screen now we've got Joey pointing
at the Justice actually I'm waiting from
they put it up so here we go so here we
go put this and screen essentially this
is an 80-inch um I tried lying whore
what would it be diagonally across that
thing
and so I couldn't actually if you're six
foot eight that's and laid across that
screen I wouldn't be the least surprised
so that is what that is it's 80 inch
screen it's basically what they're
pitching a to is people what sport on we
had was it a Knicks game playing on 50
what we did is uh we have a hardcore
well we have a Georgetown alum in the
office and she's really sweet shout out
to Liza I'm sorry about your boy is
armed she really wanted to see the game
and she was like fascinated with a size
of TV so tying myself move the TV in the
general population and we played the
Georgetown game on that deal of
television and they happen to win that
game maybe we should just because of the
idea maybe maybe we should have kept
displaying the gtown games on that 80
inch our fault guys I saw that you guys
now how did you actually get it out in
the hallway because that's got to be
it's a hundred ninety to a hundred and
thirty-two pounds uh I'm like one of the
rickety wheeled cars that we know what
are the real horse danger and we pushed
it right down the aisle real quick did
that we did the quick jump yeah it was
funny it's a monster we're gonna
probably do it we're probably gonna set
up for the final four as well I see so
essentially we've had this in the office
for a couple of weeks not great if your
movie buff really now why is that
essentially it's well it's in LCD I'll
see these are really hard the large
sizes to light correctly across the
screen because you need a lot of lamps
and lamps costs money so what it is it's
a budget 80 inch television arrange that
now it's 13 years ago four years ago
shop no not shop sony put out an 80-inch
which was the same amount in australia
this was the same amount in dollars as
it wasn't screeding sighs there's
$80,000 oh nice so this is an Australian
destroyed which is what about pointed
out four dollars 30 yeah so it's
essentially this is a five-and-a-half
thousand dollar 80-inch so this is the
first time is come on coming under 10
grand so how much is this guy so it's
five and a half thousand yeah that'll be
500 if you go for a 70-inch it's it's
half the price so it's about two and a
half thousand oh it's also quite
reasonable yeah so it's not a great
screen but what it is for is for in a
lip
room you're watching with a couple of
buddies Andy and you're watching a game
or something like that I'll tell you one
thing we the nice thing with that was we
had it set up out there people walking
in front of me and I could still see the
sky that was the best I I will see it
bring productivity in the office to a
screeching halt the two of you on I
think was Friday right it was friday but
i was also you know that was popcorn day
nobody makes their numbers to the other
question that's what we're gonna blame
that TV no Hendler has his crew tight i
see who's got it held down over the
world I'll tell you something else about
this this this TV essentially is
grateful for angle Joe sure great for
gaming on we it's got this thing called
a viper mode which is essentially a like
a lossless lag type situation with a
turn off all the post process yeah so I
had wipeout playing on that screen it
was amazing oh no it was great fun the
only problem with this television is
it's not 3d which I was about reading
imagine modern warfare on that bed in 3d
into the glass in 3d surrounds I think
3d on something that big would probably
make you cockeyed yeah I iris make you
feel a little bit you gotta you gotta
set a minimum distance back our
apologies to anyone who's listening to
the podcast but you can easily download
this and look at a project and watch the
video or really reviewing which will be
coming up today monday that's that is
yes excellent i look forward to seeing
that do you think we're gonna see more
80 inch and larger tvs this week oh well
that's the thing once you get beyond a
inch there's a hundred and six inch out
as a more of a I guess commercial model
and that's a hundred thousand bucks whoa
hey now yes so those are all still 1080
nobody's going yeah no one's going for
4k yeah we know there is a 4k coming
from LG later this year and I believe
that the Schieber is almost on the
market if it's not right now while we're
on the subject out a question I was
posed to me bye bye Andrew Henley he was
asking cuz he's caught up right now he's
thinking about getting another dlp he's
looking at the mitsubishi nail pages
because you know i got that really
because they have a 92 inch well I also
looked at do peas and funnily enough
North America is the only market that
still sells DLP's in the world so
there's still a market for cheap huge
tvs and i think that's what shops going
after here they're going after that
market obviously it's more
dlp but you'll actually get better image
quality than you will out of a DLP
because you know lighting conditions off
angle with dlp is terrible you got to
sit right in front of it it's not great
with this television but it's better so
I can see dlp disappearing from the mark
in the next time I'll bring it up
because of the size of this TV and yet
the only thing you can get larger than
that would be a deal piece or they can
get a projector yet yeah but come on it
tho those days are done on the wall
projectors are good to be around long
after D up easy well because you just
take it you can make it as large as you
want you around and they're people who
build whole projective rooms and stuff
so that's going to be the money option
or the the budget option if you're one
really big screen is to get a decent
1080p projector you can get them for one
or two thousand dollars they're not
going to be to the equivalent of say a
five-and-a-half thousand dollar LCD in
as far as black levels because you're
still going to suffer from black levels
particularly in a lit room mm-hmm but uh
yeah I mean if you want big projector
still away I just always assume you need
a dark light tight room for rejected or
really work absolutely but that's a good
for gaming that's a lot of fun icicle
like there's be like a lot of clubs in
New York where for some reason different
was into sort of one video djing which
is just stupid and but to then when the
video TJ was done they put on like this
is you know should how old was they put
on like a PlayStation like one or maybe
was a playstation 2 and and people would
like be playing games on these giant
walls in like clubs I I worked at the
All Star Cafe in 96 early cans of the
club no no it was it well I worked in
the AV Department and they had a 27-foot
Fargo in DAV go they had a 27-foot barco
screen and I actually hooked up Tekken
from the first PlayStation in there it
was great seeing martial law larger than
life but we mostly played on the 6-foot
barkos I won so many free meals from the
kitchen playing tekken good excellent
excellent should we treat that with this
new v speaking of smaller screens
getting bigger i want to show you guys
two things that are i think if you see
three of something it's a trend so i've
got two right now one more and then its
trend time and then i'm going to hear
about the mysterious thing you've got a
risk but don't tell me yet Oh nuh-uh
we've talked many times about the
Ultrabook those super slim the super
thin 13 inch laptops are comic
macbook air well now they're starting to
expand the Ultrabook repertoire if you
will and now we're seeing 14 and 15 inch
models that all have the the Ultrabook
tag which is uh intel you know created
the name that concepts we have to abide
by their rules in order to call yourself
an ultrabook but we were starting to see
14 and 15 inch models first I'll show
you 14 that we've we talked about before
from history they lean back dramatically
behind me so this of course is that HP
Spectre with the glass lid like I don't
like this thing another part it's part i
pat ipod our you know ipad important
obviously wants to see it yeah yeah
really is it when it's closed the kind
of has like a tablet e sort of look to
it i like i like the board layout
everything I like that little I'd like
this uh yeah the glass over the I liked
that bit there I like them actually like
that because you rest your hands on it
the grease and oil from answered on that
plastic and wipes right off its glass
well glass plastic whatever it wipes
right on white right off what do you
getting before you use a laptop dude
there you know many times our first of
all you know many times you could be in
the lab where this goes for anybody
because I've seen I've seen it happen
you it in this office it never fails the
minute you put food in front of you
someone needs something from you where
you have to get online or looks at them
I've walked in your office I've seen it
happen to you I know it's happened to me
I've seen it happen to Julie I don't
know if it's happening at I but I've
seen it happen a lot I fee but what does
that have to do with the fact that the
fact because the fact that you're eating
something and you automatically you
barely get a second ago for this chewing
and you got your laptop up and you're
looking something up equity and this is
that's better but our larger point here
Jace it's fried chicken proof there's a
larger point here is that this is a
14-inch ultrabook but feel it's kind of
big and heavy not like you not think in
that book here when you pick that thing
up the glass word imagine heavy the
glass w making every but you know what
that's that's something people want you
know they want something that feels
solid they want something that looks
like it costs or if you like a board
would it cost which but a secondary
display under that glass you know be
nice and maybe nice if they put that
track pad on this like was on the uh
what was that the razor like I like that
try was cool oh yeah that would
a little bias with it to the right cuz
right towards right-handed people but I
don't you left-handed I'm right-handed
okay good but my sons mothers left and
that's why I'm only conscious of these
things mm-hmm but yeah so that this is a
voyage for ya the 13 age I would take it
you'll get it out a Michigan flipping
around one in right now it's sort of
from here looks like a business laptop
but the thing is once you put I mean to
hold in your hand like this fine but
when she drop it in a book bag it's not
that bad and the adapter for that's
nothing people in taking consideration
yes the laptop is little weighty but the
adapter for is very sleep in sexy it's
not like one of those big xbox 360 you
know power supply adapters that convert
like freaking solar to I like as if that
this is the first time I've ever heard
someone use the term book bag since like
1979 boop boop boop what's up an appt at
least she knows it at least you know the
book bag no no it's a knapsack but when
you're in school you have your nap
taking of your school books in it so in
school you would call it a book bag when
you're like in the fourth grade ah we
used to have like a little string right
yeah had a string on it and then you
know the back of your chair this is the
this is the KFC HP edition it's already
crazy eyes I already a fit for your
industry of us all over it now I've got
something even crazier to show you if I
get lean behind me dramatically mines
automatically this is a 15 inch
ultrabook allegedly with the malcontent
in that is this one at least is mad it's
the acer m3 ultra you know it doesn't
look like an ultrabook it does not just
looks like i did 15 inch it looks like a
macbook it does looks like a pro yeah so
I just a little finger than it's just
interesting that you know Intel can come
out three years later inside we've
invented this new phone factor prevented
it back but now exactly did they go back
in a time machine professionally detuned
dobby home theater i think i think the
biggest the biggest thing with with with
these could you know it's perfectly nice
i don't i don't have a problem for what
it is i don't have a problem with these
designs everything i just think that if
you're gonna make something and you're
aware of who you modeled it after like
you made something that's that resembles
let's say like the the mac pro or the
air you got to automatically underpriced
it
you can't go in more you can't make
something that looks like it and then
charge more that's why there's altar
books and I 1328 99 999 when a 13 in
chairs like 1290 and I think that's the
biggest problem with a lot of these the
fact that they didn't they come out with
some really nice designs but then they
destroyed asa written on right now I
think I've always wanted brand as well
well is around they go both ways this
one actually has a really high-end bit
to it and really get a bit to it now the
high-end bit is it's the first it's one
of the first laptops or the first
ultrabook with discrete graphics it's
got this new nvidia I think 640 g4 640m
GPU in it so that's cool because we
haven't seen an ultrabook with discrete
graphics yet on the other hand the
display is only 1366 x 768 and it looks
very toilet ah so you're not going to
get a retina time right like do you guys
like you have this great you have these
great graphics on here but you're gonna
play games at 1366 x 768 that doesn't
make any on a big 15.6 inch screen that
just doesn't make any sense to me you
got to go at least 16 by 9 in order to
make it kind of worthwhile that's that's
my opinion well Lisa another point for
the biggest agree the biggest remember
an 11 inch laptop is usually 1366 x 768
when you have a 15-inch but the same
resolution that just looks cheap another
another point for the Aged the HP laptop
is the fact that now they have these
homeless Wi-Fi spots gonna be you're
gonna be mingling and shaking hands at
least you know you can just wipe
everything right off your laptop all
right that's why you wipe the old image
800 right off that Jesus man we have
those here is that well we don't know
HBO sell the Texas two Texans oh boy so
so is that a new side job a little
mobile hotspot I will I would jump out i
will gladly gladly be a hot spot to just
not have to pay for for myself oh i see
so you get the benefit and these Travis
you know just freakin naked they could
make it they can monogram my NYX hats
with the with the WEP key on the back so
I don't even talk to anybody well you'd
have to give people to password all
right I've said they could put the
password on my neck hat and that's it
they could they could do the thing so so
Joseph since we're running out of time I
do want to hear about this mysterious
device you have strategy that you two
seem very excited about and I've known
you tried tiny things I type thought I
was pulling his leg
I've been following this I've been
wanting to pick it up I finally got up
on my butt and I picked it up because
they're really hard to find they're
actually going for like 200 and change
on ebay and it is Senator the nike+ ID
whoa nike+ fitness to be Jackie plus
FuelBand what does that mean so what it
does is it measures it measures your
steps and your movements in fuel you
could set goals for yourself and have it
on the band or sync with your iOS device
and you can set like a goal of 2303
2000-3000 so forth whatever and if you
reach let me go to my goals I'll show
you cuz I'm not even to my goal it gives
you calories ah yeah total calories
you've consistent today steps nope since
I've gotten it or since I put it on 250
calories hold on sir I'll go back around
but I've wonder the fuel so like my
field I said the two thousand i'm at 614
right now what is few more how long well
that's the thing that's that's that's
Nikes little gimmick of fuel what is it
it it's like it takes a combination I
guess your steps tree movements and
calories burns and it transfers it to
thing called fuel where you can upload
your scores via your iOS device you can
plug your band and ended up later to the
web is fuel like calories where you want
both of them were like oh no don't
you've worked out whether you actually
you can actually go calories it'll give
you Cal right so what's the 250 there
that's the calories I burn Chazz I put
on OLX is gonna color such as I put it
on I thought it measures you consume
which is a lot these are the steps I've
taken similar which is when since uh
what about noon oh nice nice and not
taking two thousand steps into noon well
you shoulda saw when you you should have
seen the way I was booking to the nike
store and trying to get back here for
the podcast oh I say um STIs money hello
and then and then rock Rodgers actually
Roger Chang's reviewing it oh no I'm
doing it wow it slides off it hooks up
via USB they recommend that you do not
plug it directly in the back computer
because like the foundation the
lithium-ion batteries are right here you
don't want to break the connection so
they give you a little band we can just
mount it like this so you can either
upload your load your data from here or
you can sync via bluetooth to your
iphone or ipod touch after you download
of course the nike+ fuelband app
it retails little pricey i'm selling
Roger I think the ideal price for it
would be a hundred bucks it's 149 oh
that seems really just a 90 this is
water resistant not waterproof I was
told you could shower with it but I
would recognize it but its debt Kevin
Durant plays basketball and I intend on
playing ball with tomorrow so I'll let
you know what my fuel points are oh yeah
because I'm definitely playing some ball
I had to take off my live strong
bracelet to put this on but it's pretty
cool animals come in other colors I just
comes in black right now but they do
have different size and what's really
nice to give you this little tool a
sizer you can up yeah you can adjust
again and it also it also locked he's
got a case of the fat risk so you locked
and well that's there I don't think this
is this is an ideal device four persons
already in shape because there's not
much they have to prove to themselves
but it's a good motivational tool for a
chunky person like myself what days I
was lazy and what days I was not like
this I'm gonna tell you I'm liking this
I don't know if you'll concept no that's
goofy but I'm interested in the ups and
the calories that I burned like sort of
reminds me remember the swatch internet
time that the late 90s where everything
was in 500 i think it was and you then
RB at 472 internet time didn't take off
what I think fuels probably going to be
the only thing I'm curious about is also
tomorrow I'm gonna find out because it
may move with arm motions I can't
imagine tracking anything other than our
movement so right is it you know how
many steps is it giving me for doing
this right now a pedometer cue light as
much as Joey does burn more calories I'm
not gonna tell you again it's like a
pedometer that snaps onto your belt you
know it's not really on your foot but it
it knows it and if your cloning self
abuser of course you'll use a lot more
like oh my god fifty thousand does your
boy a microphone Giselle that all right
all right gentlemen is-is-is has been a
lot of fun I feel like we've done more
gadget ree hands and eyes on than we've
