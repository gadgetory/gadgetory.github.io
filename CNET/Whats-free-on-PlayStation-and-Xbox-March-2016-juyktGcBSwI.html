Xbox Live and PlayStation Plus for the
month of March 2016 Sherlock Holmes
crimes and punishments is free all month
long on xbox one you'll help solve a
murder mystery by interviewing suspects
and surveying areas of interest also on
xbox one but running March 16th to April
fifteenth is Lords of the Fallen an
action RPG that draws a lot of
inspiration from the dark souls series
of games moving over to the xbox 360
supreme commander 2 will be available
for the first half of the month and the
original borderlands will take the
second half of march for the sony family
of consoles ps4 owners will be treated
to a pair of throwback stylized titles
first is broforce the pixelated platform
shooter with a very specific sense of
humor as well as galaxy a 2d space
shooter that is very heavily inspired by
the 16-bit era of video games on the
Vita plus subscribers can check out the
fire fighting game flame over as well as
reality fighters the augmented reality
fighting game which let's be honest that
was not very good at all moving over to
the PlayStation 3 we've got the last guy
which is a cool sort of top-down rescue
game that looks like you're playing in
Google Maps leading hordes of people
away from zombies and finally one of my
favorites super stardust HD is also free
as always a small caveat you do of
course need to be a member of
PlayStation Plus and or xbox live gold
to access these quote on quote free
games and those memberships well they
cost a little bit of money but as you
can see for the most part they're worth
it that'll do it for this month I'll be
back next month with a brand new list of
free games
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
