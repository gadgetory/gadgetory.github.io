just been announced the Samsung Galaxy
s6 and fraternal twin the s6 edge by all
accounts they're beautiful phones
running the latest version of Android
but if your gadget addiction has left
you spiritually and financially broken
then I'm here to help you turn a blind
eye to this tempting tech i'm donald
bell and here are five reasons not to
buy the samsung galaxy s6
starting off at number five it's not a
SmartWatch let's be real you're gonna
blow some money chasing some hot gadget
this year it should be a SmartWatch and
it doesn't matter if the phone in your
pocket is old with a crack down the
screen if there's a SmartWatch on your
wrist
that's all anyone's gonna see you can
escape by another year without upgrading
your phone at number four a non
replaceable battery the ability to
quickly swap or replace your battery as
one of the few great features that
Samsung could really lowered over the
iPhone now it's all sealed up I assume
because Samsung has figured out that
built-in obsolescence makes a great
business strategy to that end Samsung
also did away with making this phone
water-resistant coming in at number
three the Galaxy Note II there's a note
for edge which is already out and
already has that curvy screen thing
going on or the galaxy note 5 we expect
to see later this year Samsung Galaxy S
is a popular phone I think we can safely
say now that Samsung really saves the
horsepower and the geeky features for
the note so treat yourself and step up
to a bigger phone or if you have no love
for Samsung try number two LG G flex 2
this is Samsung's biggest Android rival
and it's easy to see why it's got a
beautiful screen Snapdragon 810
processor a self-healing exterior and a
flexible design literally flexible it
ships with Android lollipop and you'll
never have to utter the word TouchWiz
priceless but before we get to the
number one reason let's take a moment to
appreciate what Samsung did include on
the s6 yet built-in wireless charging a
sharper screen better camera and
upgraded Exynos processor and
compatibility with Samsung's latest
update to gear VR that's not nothing but
in spite of all that the number one
reason not to buy a Samsung Galaxy s6 is
the Samsung Galaxy s5 I'm sorry but
aside from that curved edge there's not
a lot to distinguish the 506 a Samsung
Galaxy s5 with the recent Android
lollipop update it's more or less the s6
about the edge plus it's water-resistant
has a replaceable battery microSD
storage expansion and you can probably
pick one up for a whole lot less than a
new s6 your throwing a SmartWatch and
you're covered for 2015 so there you go
five reasons not to buy the Samsung
Galaxy s6 we're top fives like this
including top 5 reasons not to buy a
bunch of other stuff head over to top 5
