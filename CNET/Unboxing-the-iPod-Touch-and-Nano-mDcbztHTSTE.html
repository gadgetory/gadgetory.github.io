Apple unveiled new iPhone as well as new
iPod Touch and iPod nano models but it's
not until now that those iPod Touch and
nanos have finally begun shipping we
have them both here at CNET in their
boxes and if you're curious about what
they look like when you receive them
here we go with our CNET unboxing of
both they both have jewel case designs
those clear plastic cases and we'll
start the little Nano it looks a lot
like the Nano before it tells you on the
back how to bend the case to free your
iPod Nano from the plastic pull off
little sheath and there it is lightning
connector on the bottom underneath
you've got your little welcome package
hello and a set of the new ear pods
which come with it and the new lightning
connector cable but no AC charger so you
can pull out cable all carefully wrapped
up ready to go and these ear pods come
in a foam like container as opposed to a
plastic case alright now that we've
thoroughly unboxed the Nano let's take a
look at the new iPod touch
here it is also in its crystal box and
it is also bracketed in plastic so first
you want to actually pull off the top
screen the top plastic layer which is
attached to the plastic tab then take it
out
there's the welcome pack again with a
little QuickStart guide
I didn't open the last one but actually
you get two white stickers we have the
lightning cable wrapped up ready to go
you also have the new ear pod headphones
now these come with the new nano the new
iPod Touch and the new iPhone what's
this OH
hmm this is the Apple loop this little
elastic band actually fits onto the back
of your iPod Touch there's a little
circular disc on the back of the iPod
Touch you press it in to pop it out and
then pop the loop on make sure it fits
all the way around and then lock it in
and that was your own boxing of the iPod
Touch and iPod Nano for cnet.com I'm
