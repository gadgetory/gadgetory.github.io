kinds of things i'm your host is actor
there's news about space these days like
finding evidence of flowing water on
Mars of course that should make some of
us start thinking about aliens so let's
scare ourselves about the potential
threat of extraterrestrial life shall we
today we're counting down the top 5
horrifying aliens and movies at number 5
the block now why on earth would you be
afraid of what appears to be moving
massive gelatin because it will
assimilate you while continuing along
its merry way that's what the nineteen
fifty classics effects look a tad dated
the 1988 remake has a superior monster
when it comes to looks but spoiler it
dropped the alien origin however no
matter the execution the concept of the
shapeless unrelenting blob is unsettling
at number four the aliens in signs now
why they horrifying the bulk of the
movie doesn't show the aliens instead we
get mostly noises and silhouettes okay
so what's freaky about them the
introduction of the aliens is built up
really well in the movie so much tension
and then boom and alien walking by in a
birthday party they fit the good old
standard alien look with the green skin
the big black eyes there are a lot of
great clear shots of the aliens as well
so maybe much of the scare comes from
our imaginations and that's not such a
bad thing at number three predator the
thing is a warrior from another planet
who hunts for sports in some respects
predators event like a horror movie
villain complete with a signature
weapons in mask however behind that mask
is a snarling beast here's some trivia
about the filming of predator
jean-claude van damme was originally
cast to play the beast but he didn't
seem large enough to counter the film
stars the seven foot two inch Kevin
Peter Hall was cast instead the design
was by Stan Winston he handles special
effects for Jurassic Park Iron Man and
The Terminator series
at number two the thing from the thing
the alien threat and the thing doesn't
have a distinct look when you think it's
dead it's not dead it absorbs living
things and mimics them with that mimicry
creates a huge distrust if you're trying
to fight the thing you don't know who's
been compromised a single particle of
the thing can mean a person is a host
for the thing the special effects the
1988 version of the film are incredibly
disgusting just disgusting your memory
bank might use that imagery to torture
you in a future nightmare before we get
to number one let's talk about some
aliens that I think could have made it
on this list but didn't that's right I'm
talking about the aliens in Indiana
Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal
Skull they were horrifying for all the
wrong reasons mainly there shouldn't be
aliens in an Indiana Jones movie however
cooler heads prevailed and these aliens
only get a dishonorable mention on to
number one and at number one the
xenomorph from alien do I really have to
explain why this thing is the most
horrifying alien in a movie all right
that's my job first up this alien design
is from 1979 and it still appears
terrifying just on looks alone the
design is by HR giger and eyes were
intentionally left out create fear since
you couldn't tell where it was looking
then there's the story of the alien
movies these things use other animals to
procreate when the spawn of one of these
things is ready boom it comes bursting
out of the host and there you have it
the top 5 horrifying aliens in movies
let me know what you think in the
comments or on twitter if you think et
should have been on this list I'm is for
more top fives like this visit top 5
