here on the show floor in South Hall
drones are a really big story at CES
this year but what about a drone that
can carry a whole person in it this is
the e hang 184 it has eight rotors they
are humongous also we're gonna check out
the cockpit check this out
you're gonna get in here you're gonna
check out this map there's gonna be
locations you can tap on you're gonna
tap on your location and this is an
autonomous aerial vehicle it is gonna
take you exactly where you need to go
and you don't need a pilot's license
that's one of the goals of he hang 180
for the founder of the company actually
was inspired by unfortunately the death
of his friends who were small pilot
small plane pilots so they wanted to
design something that nobody needed a
pilot's license to pilot to gold places
but could get them from short ranges
without as much danger you want to limit
your danger here so the e hang 184 is
designed to do just that and it gets up
to 65 miles an hour
you got 23 minutes of battery life on
top of that it gets up to 11,000 feet in
the air that is really really high I
think I'm terrified of heights I don't
want to go that high but it'll hover
generally about 500 to a thousand feet
this thing is going to be available to
real consumers and the goal is that it's
not going to be exclusive to the
billionaire circuit so get out your
millions or your hundreds thousands and
get ready to buy the e hang once those
regulations and the FAA approves this I
predict I'm gonna have one of these to
get through LA traffic
