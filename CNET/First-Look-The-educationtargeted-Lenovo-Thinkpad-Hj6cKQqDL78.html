you going back to school do you want a
laptop well by a ThinkPad that's the
idea that lenovo was trying to sell on
the lenovo thinkpad x1 30 ii and
obviously we're a long way from
back-to-school season but this
educational targeted laptop is
supposedly targeted at the K through 12
set now of course it's also being sold
to some extent as a portable ThinkPad
last year the lenovo thinkpad x1 20 ii
was one of my favorite little small
laptops that i looked at that had an AMD
fusion III 50 processor inside so as
faster than a netbook but a little more
sluggish than a full-fledged laptop and
that was the compromise they had to face
with these 11 inch laptops now a year
later this is an AMD II 300 processor
which performs about the same but this
laptop costs 549 that still feels too
high for what you're getting in here and
it is very sturdily built and that's the
big move here that's educationally
targeted at least this laptop slit has
changed it's thicker but it also has
curved rubberized bumpers that also
protect the rest of the laptop and
provide some dust resistance this also
as a sturdier hinge so if you want to
throw into a backpack and give it some
stress testing this does feel like a
very thick sturdy laptop but it is also
half a pound heavier than the x1 20 e
3.9 pounds that's not far off from a
regular full-fledged laptop weight and
you can feel it this thing is thick it's
over an inch thick so if you're
comparing it to an ultrabook or a
MacBook Air forget it
the other problem is that there are
laptops that have equivalent processing
specs you can get for Less the HP dm1 z
one of our favorite 11 inch laptops has
sold for around 399 as of last year and
so you can get one of those types of
deals for a similar amount of money now
is an educational friendly well I don't
really know if this is education
friendly because while it does have
customizable back lids for bulk
purchases and it does have a a nice
sturdy feel it's a Windows 7 laptop
there are a lot of those and some of the
design elements I don't really like when
I think about a kid using them for
instance there is a track point here I
mean that's a think pad stay
but when a seventh-grader want to use
one of those the problem is not that it
sits in the honking middle of the
keyboard but the fact that it's discrete
buttons take up a tremendous amount of
the real estate that otherwise it'd be
used for that multi-touch click pad
beneath it's just an awkward touch that
suggests that this laptops kind of
hedging its bets oh yes I want to be an
educational laptop I also want to be for
small businesses and that's the biggest
problem I have of this laptop it feels
like an in-betweener
and the price doesn't really feel right
you should be game typing something
around four hundred dollars for a laptop
like this as opposed to 550 but it does
have good battery life and you know if
you want something that feels somewhat
indestructible for a student maybe take
a look at it but there's really nothing
special going on in this laptop that you
haven't seen before
I'm Scott Stein and as a look at the
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 30 II</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
