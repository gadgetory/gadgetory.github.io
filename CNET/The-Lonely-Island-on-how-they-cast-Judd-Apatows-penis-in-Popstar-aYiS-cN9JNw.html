movies a lot of people I'm not
requesting this per se but they're
always like oh there's so much female
nudity this movie obviously shows a love
you know there there's male nudity here
without a doubt equal opportunity equal
opportunity you guys are the creators
directors producers writers everything
what goes into the casting of a role
like that we know a Judd Apatow is the
manbo how do you guys evaluate that
casting process
well Judd was adamant that he didn't
want nepotism in casting so he sent in
his headshot just like everyone else
yeah he sent it in really early on
actually before the scene was actually
written he was sending us about one
picture a day yeah yes I just saying
just in case guys keep it in mind yeah
I'm here in case he comes up okay ask
comes up and it looks good I think I
think I think he won the role just
purely based on merit and and the look
of his member hmm who had the final say
on the casting oh yeah we did as
directors and right we all looked at all
the dicks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
