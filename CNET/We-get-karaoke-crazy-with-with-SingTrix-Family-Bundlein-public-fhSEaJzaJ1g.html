Brian Talia and with me here is John to
Becca the CEO founder sing tricks and
look we are here at CES like all the
time we want to have fun sometimes I
found their booth I think a couple years
ago with sing tricks and this year you
have a new machine that lets you change
how your voice sounds but not that I
needed or anything but I wanted you to
talk about sing tricks and a little bit
about what this is what you guys are
doing sync tricks is like the most
exciting karaoke and singing experience
that's ever been created like the most
exciting ever I really think it is
Memphis it allows the 95% of people who
can't sing to be able to get up and pull
off their favorite song and sound good
instantly which is amazing so how does
it do some of that um this is a portable
unit right so this is the first portable
you guys have made is that Korea we had
a we have a party bundle which has a mic
stand in the separate speaker and this
one is more it's more portable it's plug
and play so this one you can carry
around easily to bring to your friends
party or whatever but it also has all
the same effects and all the features
that are in our main unit okay so I'd
like you to maybe demo some of these
amazing effects what is this model
actually called this is called the
family bundle so Amalie bundle so the
whole idea is like we our company
created the guitar hero so the whole
thing we like to do is just try to bring
people and music together and even if
you didn't spend years and years of
practice you can get together with your
friends and have a good time and
experience music together so what's
special about sing tricks is really the
studio unit here we use professional
vocal technology that's only the pros
use and we figured out how to adapt it
to make regular people sound good so
there's like an automatic pitch
correction if you need it and then it
also does live vocal harmony so one
person can sound like a choir voices
studio quality just like that by the
press of a button okay well I would like
to see this in action I would like you
to show us the action we have these
people coming in they're like oh I'm
curious I want to carry-out get CNET at
CES 2017 yeah so we have we also have
these effects called
voice morphing effectors are pretty
funny too so I'll give you I'll go
through a couple of slides show me what
you got
my Tinkerbell boys I can make a man's
down like a woman if you want as you can
sing like let it go or any of those
famous karaoke songs and then you
stretch it over and then you got your
favorite pair until you sound a little
like my right so you can play better
white track and have a good time too
friends just like that turn the dial
make an effect and sing alright so this
one is really fun so this shows the
power of the vocal harmony that you
could do so it's all done live I'll try
this one
yeah you plug in any music you want and
it's going to do a live four-part vocal
harmony so it sounds like a choir voices
from one person so yeah just
I believe I can fly oh come on now you
felt you felt that one in your so I saw
you out there so yeah you have all these
different effects basically you can plug
in any music in any device you could
actually even plug a guitar keyboard in
there and it what it does is polyphonic
note detection which means it figures
out what key the music's in and it'll
pitch correct you as much as you want
and it also do the live vocal harmony
it's fun now another big thing about
karaoke or Norah bong - my Korean
friends Coco's out there I see you we
wanted to have fun I'm gonna get you all
warm here it's CES 2010 I felt like I
would want to like jam a little bit can
we because if you carrot karaoke you
want to be able to get your own songs
into it so what are one of those ways
that someone could just take this with
them I mean where's their song library
gonna come from yeah the one of the
things we really wanted to do is make it
open source so YouTube actually has tens
of thousands of free karaoke tracks on
there all high-quality so you don't have
to the good thing about our you know
we're not trying to sell you music along
with it
you can use YouTube and it's got all the
greatest tracks up there already you
could use any karaoke app that plays
music or guitar or keyboard because
don't we use YouTube for everything
already pretty much ok so uh are you
guys ready do so Carrie ok oh my gosh
that is the most pathetic clap I've ever
heard in my life
one more time are you ready for kid a
okay that's here okay now we're getting
warm so should I just like get my track
jamming or what okay you guys I'll let
you all decide we play a little game
like called C II yes or C II know so
