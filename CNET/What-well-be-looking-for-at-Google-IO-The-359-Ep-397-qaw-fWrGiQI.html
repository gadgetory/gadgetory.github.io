I'm offering the Google i/o developer
conference is happening Tuesday and
Wednesday this week it will definitely
not include an extended mayor Copa like
Facebook's f8 conference did last week
and instead should focus on a lot of new
tech Alfred is there anything in
particular that you're really looking
for from IO something that you want them
to talk about this is actually the first
time I'm excited to hear about wearables
I'm from well I know that usually I
don't care about them but you know with
them changing their whole like they to
like watch OS now like it's not Android
wear anymore or anything like that I'm
pretty interested to hear what they have
for it I actually saw eyes not watch os
that's apples yeah thing but yeah
they're gonna they're like completely
remodeling their OS for their Android
watches and all their other wearables
I'm pretty excited about it
where OS where OS which is
understandable why you may have gotten
yeah I'm surprised you started with
where I know yeah I am to most of the
times I don't care about it but I'm
pretty interested to hear what they have
for it this timer I would also for me
personally I know you didn't just ask
but I'm gonna tell you anyway I'm
interested to see what they do with
Google home they've obviously been
trying to take a lot of market share
away from the Amazon echo are they gonna
show potentially new hardware maybe
they're gonna have a Google home with a
screen on it I know that they partnered
with a couple other companies to create
those types of devices maybe they're
gonna come out with their own who knows
yeah I'm expecting them to talk about
that a lot more I know you did a pretty
deep dive into that during CES when they
announced it but I actually haven't
heard of anything related to that since
then yeah so I'm hoping to hear more
about that it it's very interesting this
the first Google i/o where like the
Android stuff to me is the least
exciting thing yeah one of the things
that I read about speaking of Android
Android pee they're probably going to
talk about this obviously its developer
conference apparently most of the
navigation buttons are going to be
removed from the bottom you're only
gonna have the home button and it's
going to be replaced with gesture
controls which for me is gonna probably
be pretty annoying I
which from an iphone to android a couple
months ago and just getting used to the
muscle memory of moving things around
with that I may have to relearn that all
over again which is gonna be a little
bit annoying I hope that all of Android
pees features are designed around a
notch at the top even if your phone
doesn't have it so really really
horrible last also a RvR maybe we'll see
more about daydream I don't know there's
there's a lot that they could
potentially talk about over the next two
days maybe they're gonna get into a
dating app I'm not sure I really hope
not okay next the Microsoft build
developer conference starts today but we
were expect from that one it's gonna be
much more like enterprise and business
focused we're gonna see AI stuff maybe
Alexa a lot of what they're gonna be
doing is focused on the cloud I pretty
sure that's where Microsoft is you know
putting all their eggs it's like that's
the basket they're putting all their
eggs into I hope I got that ATM correct
honey I know you got it
I mean you're right about the cloud
stuff yeah they're really pushing more
into enterprise and cloud which means
that the expectation that they're gonna
have like new consumer hardware seems
unlikely but you never actually know
last Sunday marked the 20th anniversary
if the iMac Apple's all-in-one desktop
the computer was first unveiled May 6th
1998 by Steve Jobs and it had a colorful
sorry colorful translucent egg-shaped
housing the system had a 233 megahertz
PowerPC processor 4 gigabytes hard drive
and it's sold for $1,299 in the US I
actually wonder how much that cost now
when you adjust for inflation it was
probably way more you're right it was
probably like twice as much as that more
than like two grand or something like
that anyway if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNET
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred Aang thanks
for listening
my favorite part of the show is where
you almost forgot your name I was
waiting for him to jump in and I was
like wait I was supposed to do it first
yes when you queue out your the fuses
first one out thank you for joining you
think I know how to do the show by now
you know only on where we get 300 as
always thanks everybody for joining us
for the recording of the podcast I'm
gonna jump into the chat see if you guys
got any good questions or comments to
keep the conversation going on the
meantime we do want to know what your
wish your wish list I can't talk either
for Google i/o is going to be and yeah
in the meantime I kind of missed the old
game box piece like you know we give
Apple a lot of crap but that was at
least fun back in it was your estimate
was actually pretty like on the ball I
just looked it up online adjusting for
inflation that price would have been
1984 dollars today yeah 1984 dollars I
don't like their boy 1984 dollars you
mean now 1984 yeah that's a lot of money
for a desktop I suppose I mean if
anybody's even buying desktops anymore
all I remember about the iMac is that I
would see it on like Nickelodeon on like
all those like TV shows and they know
that's a cool looking computer but they
would have it because they don't have
the rights to like show apples logo they
like redesign to make a look like a pear
or like a banana yeah like any other
fruit
I remember those they did that on
Zootopia to where the rabbit has a
carrot it was a carrot it was a carrot
phone which was kind of funny I remember
we had them in college that's where I
used them and they were just kind of
like fun and silly and I was very much
in like a Windows world back then and so
any time I jumped onto a Mac I was just
like what the hell is this kind of like
what it was like in our like typing
classes then - mmhmm yeah cool do we
have any questions or sure let's take
one from Sandro G my wish list for IO is
to let me use hallo from my default
message app Android messages compares to
compare to ollow sucks it's the first
time I think I've heard that one you
interesting you mentioned what is it a
low or a low I am wrong I think it's a
low I never use it and it's one of like
many many messaging services that
if you're in the Android world are
available to you I have to say that I
don't have a lot of experience with it
just because there are so many different
yeah messaging services it's very
interested how fragmented the Android
messaging world is like I used hang out
like all the time but yeah I'll have a
friend who's like I'm using like you
know Alec can you like contact me there
or can you just like send me a text or
something like that it's very
frustrating and you know what if Allah
does went out in the end I don't care I
really just hope that Google just says
here is one thing that we're using for
everything right that's it we settled it
we're not gonna be making 10 more new
messaging apps that being said I don't
think they're gonna be talking because
like I don't think like IO really does
have a history of them showing off
they're like messaging apps or anything
but I think they did actually add you
know the IO two years ago they unveiled
a low I believe a year or two ago I mean
I don't think they did it for last
year's I definitely didn't talk about at
last year's i/o I wasn't here that year
before that so mm-hmm
I would have no idea yeah either way I
feel like it for me at least it doesn't
seem like it really took off that much
as far as a messaging service so it'd be
interesting to see if Google pushes
further into that I'm not really sure
but yeah we'll see what they decide to
do with that one other aspect that I
think is interesting we didn't mention
that much on the show is Google lends so
Google is lenses basically like their
visual search where you could point your
camera at like a flower and it'll tell
you what type of flower it is or a tree
it'll tell you what type of tree it is
you pointed it at a restaurant and it'll
tell you what its hours of operation are
stuff like that so it's kind of like
taking Google search out into the real
world I've always been really interested
in that I don't think I have it on my
phone if I do it's not readily available
or anything I'm very skeptical of any
news coming out related it's that only
because they like this is one of the
things they announced last year
mhm and they're still rolling it and we
were like pretty excited about it
although we really cool like we can find
out how many stores this restaurant has
or something like that or and then like
we just never heard of it again so it's
because it's still coming to phones yeah
in February our
colleague rich never wrote that google
lens is coming two more phones
what is it furred I think it's like
Samsung phones and LG but before you had
to have a pixel phone to use it so it's
something that's taking a long time to
roll out and I think once it starts
getting on more phones
it'll give people more of a reason to
stick in the Android world number one
and number two I think it would just be
like a really handy tool to use yeah I
mean if it works perfectly and if it's
easily available then yeah I'm gonna be
excited about it but I don't know I
don't really like getting excited about
things that like I can't really use you
don't like getting excited about things
no you know what he's right though
because I remember there was one Google
conference where they showed off like
the Babel Fish yeah remember that thing
that and I was like I was oh I was so
thrilled about it I was like oh my god
they have like translation earbuds this
is incredible and really all it was was
a piece of hardware that put Google
Translate in your ear it was very you
know clunky yeah executing well at all
now and the demo made it seem like oh my
god you could just walk around with
these in a foreign country and
understand our Trek style yeah so I
don't I don't get my I don't get my
hopes up anymore about anything because
of the Babel Fish well because of other
things there's really nothing left in
life to like look forward to and
everything sucks
happy Monday everybody hey how long
until the no you know I'm gonna save
that one I'm gonna save too depressing
I'm gonna stay from our resident Google
guru Michael Brown what's up sir
I'm interested in what they're talking
about with Android messages and
definitely interested in the new user
experience for Android P gesture
controls and material design too oh and
let's not forget about Google Play being
changed and sandro g wants to know
exactly how we're gonna see that get
changed i has touched on it late getting
changed tell me about that i've you got
me dude I'm not the reporter I'm just a
button-pusher I don't know
actually there's so much going on well
it sounds like there's going to possibly
be a rebranding by the sounds of it
that's tentative all speculation all
rumor mill but in effort potentially
combining the forces of the pre-existing
Google Play with YouTube bred into one
synonymous enter
payment entity but that's what I'm
reading between the lines are we talking
about the Google Play app store or we're
talking about Google Play Music I think
music I think we're talking about the
entertainment that could make sense that
sounds interesting to me sounds logical
to me yeah Plus Google Play Music to me
is not that useful for having your own
library it takes a little bit longer to
search for stuff and to actually play
stuff at least in my own personal use
but I feel like Apple also kind of
screwed up and made it harder for you to
have your own catalog and have your own
library they're all trying to basically
have you pay monthly for their streaming
services what Penn pay money yeah but
like if you've had a library that you've
acquired and developed over the course
of years they're then taking this thing
and you know shunting it off to the side
and making a little bit harder for you
to find it and search for it I feel
Google play music too the same thing as
iTunes Dead Sea that's why Arians I was
the personal fan of google play music
when it came out because I let me upload
things that weren't in their cloud and I
could keep mine in my own personal cloud
as part of the subscription why aren't
you a fan of it anymore I still am but I
got when I was in the beta I got cut off
right because they only let you put up
so many and I have entirely too big a
music collection so when they expanded
that I got lazy and never went back so
that's my fault but on paper I love that
concept and someday I'll go back to it I
think it could be interesting if they
combined it with YouTube bread because I
think as we've been discussing Google
has maybe a few too many alternatives a
few too many options and maybe
consolidating a little bit yeah would be
really useful for users especially for
people like me who are mega collectors
and super anally organized about
everything in the collection YouTube
bread might be work a little differently
than the way like Google Play music
works though just because like I think
with Google Play Music they usually have
to get the rights to a lot of the songs
kind of how like how Spotify or you know
Apple music works but YouTube is a
pretty like large source of like pirated
music so I feel like it's a like very
different for them mmm pirated yeah
there's your there's like stuff that's
on YouTube I like you wouldn't be able
to
fine on Spotify or like sprite or Apple
music like that and like they just
download and upload it for free on there
so that like puts in a whole different
like you know issue for for copyrights
and stuff
I'm not a Youtube Brad user so I don't
know it's interesting it's basically
YouTube but you can listen to it with
like your phone off like your screen off
mm-hmm like on the standby mode or
whatever we need to get Joan back in
here is what we need people always
complain about Spotify not properly
paying the artists and labels their dues
but I want to get more perspective on
how angered they are by the piracy
problems with YouTube and how much stuff
gets leaked out and how YouTube just
kind of pays it off and brushes it under
the rug mmm yeah I mean there's been a
lot written about how YouTube is this
giant platform that Google has a really
hard time getting ahold of similar to
issues of Facebook so runaway train yeah
I feel like they they all like created
these like extremely popular platforms
and they're now struggling to figure out
how to control them
APEC says I have Google music and if I
change the YouTube red music which I
might have I probably change to Spotify
especially if the change in the Google
music app over to YouTube it's all kind
of weird I wonder how many people this
would turn off if you're a current user
of Google Play is that merging going to
chase you away if your user if YouTube
red is it going to I don't know do you
embrace it do you hate it sound off in
the comments until then let's jump back
to Michael Brown he says do you wish
Android and Google were more like Apple
and they didn't give us as much of a
user's choice and there's a lot sounding
off about the gesture controls and being
able to opt in and out of those sort of
options with the mobile OS what's what's
your take away I mean I don't mind more
options and apps like I use hangouts and
then I also use whatsapp and signal to
like connect with different people I
think it's absurd when one company uses
like gives you multiple options for
things that have the same function like
for messaging if I have to use hangouts
allo I don't like messaging yeah and and
and then that also comes with like if
I'm using you know Android on a Samsung
phone then there's like Samsung
messaging and then Verizon for some
reason things that they have a messaging
app too
none of which I can delete by the way it
it just doesn't make any sense it'd be
like you know or it's like frustrating
for users yeah you won't open up the
phone you're not even sure which one to
use so Google had it pretty well with
like Gmail for a while and like it'd be
like if Google had like okay we have
Gmail and then we have mega Gmail and
like hello inbox Gmail like that kind of
thing whereas like no you just have
Gmail from Google I mean now they have
an inbox app but that's still connected
to your Gmail account like that's my
point where's Lana I am getting very
confused by it exactly making good point
like one company shouldn't have like
four different apps that all do the same
thing that's not providing options
that's just making things inconvenient
for everybody I agree it's a sure though
to be sure a lot of Android users
especially complain about the fact that
Apple is too closed off yeah doesn't
provide enough options so there's you
kind of have to figure out where you fit
in the balance there's no happy medium
and that well I take a lot of issue with
that myself I've been Apple user for a
long time because I'm lazy I like things
just kind of done taking care of this is
how it works and then Apple continued to
kind of close that fist until you're
just kind of stuck in that ecosystem and
since then I've moved over to Android
I very much like my experience but it
can be very daunting it's just like I
just want to listen to something do I
need to go hunting for it I would also
like to throw out there having switched
from Apple to Android I have no idea why
people like write love letters to AI
messages like it's not that much better
than any of the other messaging services
on Android I don't actually like
whatever some like love letters I just
thought I've read them in different
current periodicals of note that people
really really love my messages and it's
super easy one of them like worse things
that I've seen and these are just like
scoring caps that I've seen on Twitter
and Tumblr is you know somebody will
message somebody for like a date or
something like that and then they'll get
the green bubble back it's like oh you
don't use an iPhone forget it and I'm
like yeah what's bad that's what they
like look it's like somebody's not gonna
date you because like the phone that you
use
or like the operating system you clearly
dodged a bullet there so congratulations
yeah we definitely need to get John back
in here because this entire conversation
has spawned a lot of chatter about
alternatives like SoundCloud Hunter
Manson says what do you guys think about
SoundCloud they have the same problem
like YouTube just a little more under
control
again they give the artists a lot more
control but I also don't think
SoundCloud has the algorithmic priority
piracy prevention that YouTube does so
if somebody's just out there Lee
contract it's kind of on the artists I'm
don't quote me on that one I'm not 100%
sure
Chris garner also says that SoundCloud
the audio quality sucks
SoundCloud files are limited to 128
kilobits that is true until I think you
go to premium which lets you go up to
256 again not 100% sure because a
premium client but yeah SoundCloud is an
interesting platform it does give you a
lot more creative control a lot of
artists are embracing it as a one-to-one
it's kind of a Twitter of music at this
point I'm a fan I'm always a threat of
shutting down yeah unfortunately yeah so
yeah for that no thanks guys we'll
definitely have Joan in hear back soon
because she is the music expert I really
like music apps like iTunes tune in the
stitcher feedburner and play music yeah
which the 3:59 podcast is available yeah
let's take some more questions before we
run out of time Hunter Manson says I
would like Google to give an update on
Google glass I know it wasn't you
popular that popular originally but it
seems like the glass can get work done
if you use it for that work point taken
and I think it's still being used and in
like in work place I mean they haven't
shuttered it
we know that yeah there there were
rumors and plans for like an update to
it around last year when Roger was
working on a Google glass related story
but then that kind of like just like
went to the wayside I don't know if
they're gonna be talking about it at i/o
at all but I would imagine that if they
are going to be doing any more like
public work on Google glass that AR is
probably gonna be a pretty big focus of
that yeah my strong suspicion with any
of these is that if not this year then
in a future year you will be seeing more
Google glass like devices Google has
definitely been developing Google glass
it's out in the market maybe they're
gonna come out with
2.0 at some point we know Apple is
working on something similar you know
Amazon is - I think a lot of these
companies when you want them themselves
to be very much in the forefront of your
thinking by just being on your face at
all times and there's an enormous amount
of control like just a lot that they can
do if they come out with the glasses
tight too bad they could they could
never ever compete with the immense
success of the snapchat spectacles
wizard now the top-selling wearable
glasses is that true I mean what
competition do that oh yeah yeah you're
right the question at hand is can Google
glass make it not look goofy yeah I
think I came up the solution to this we
talked about this a few weeks ago with
the Google monocle yeah yeah that would
be awesome and then they can do it with
us they could do it like shaped like io2
if like the monocle being the oh and
then like the the chain is like the big
like a big eye you guys know that I love
your ideas and I'm not on board with
they could call it eye oh this is like a
buy a so over your eye okay good night
everybody it's been great having you
it's a let's take just a couple more
questions before we wrap it up for the
day from Michael Brown one more time on
the subject of fragmentation is it bad
to have the choice or do we always want
one thing that is the thing I think this
is going back to the great question the
chat apps again is a good place to jump
off for that I it depends which
operating system you want to use if you
think that apple provides that best
choice every single time then you're
probably going to be an Apple user if
you want to have more selection and test
out different things then you're
probably more likely you're gonna be
Android for me I'm happy with Android
even though it does take a little bit
more effort I would say but that's
that's what people say about the
difference between the two of them and I
think it's a little bit of a shame that
there isn't a third option out there we
like blackberry and Windows Phone got
killed off and it would have been nice
to at least have something else in
consideration nothing else I've already
said everything I wanted to and then
he's checked out he's checked out after
the Monaco ok this best idea so on
closing thoughts
Matthew dad sure wants to know anyone
placing bets on Android pees named the P
tapes oh come on boo
hate you so much right G what can I have
to delete that later Android PI Android
peanut butter P model doodoo one that's
not horrible what are you talking about
alright fine we're gonna wrap the show
Alfred take us out no wait wait wait no
no come on there's got to be something
out there it's it so what we had Android
Oreo what is a P P no that's not my
nutty buddy they know I gotta go do
something nondescript it's got to be a
brand right hmm
I feel like Wario is one of their first
brands well KitKat was also a breath out
right you're the only KitKat and
although we had marshmallow ice cream
sandwich maybe pie
maybe pie but wouldn't that kind of
infringe on like the Raspberry Pi
well they don't own pie I guess I don't
know it'd be confusing I think from a
branding standpoint any other good
takeaways on the chat we want to Oh
Matthew Duchess is peppermint patty
pecan pie yeah maybe peppermint that's
not bad
I like pecan pie because then you get
the double P I mean I like pecan pie in
general but I don't think it's a good
name it'll be funny when they get to cue
Android punch their stuffs I think I'm
in tune with cue exotic okay so
reminding everybody the i/o is tomorrow
what time oh I think it starts at 1:00
p.m. Eastern I believe I am thank you
