future but we got some work to do I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update sometimes smart home gadgets are
not as smart as they seem
the company Nest has pulled its protect
smoke detector from stores because of a
potential safety issue the nest protect
is designed to let you silence a minor
smoke alert by waving your hand near it
so if you're just burning the toast the
protect will kindly bring it to your
attention and you can hush the voice
with a wave but the company says it's
possible to unintentionally hush till
alarm the device may misinterpret other
nearby motion as a wave and it could
delay the alarm going off if there was a
real fire so to be on the safe side nest
is halting sales to turn off this waving
feature and for those of you that do
already have an S protect an update over
an internet connection will
automatically disable the wave feature
now you'll have to push the center
button to silence a warning and use the
smart phone app to get message alerts
during the time the product was still on
Amazon many consumers were giving it a
bad review for a different reason
some said it was too sensitive and it
would go off without any smoke in the
house and waving or pushing the button
did nothing to stop it
so this smart smoke alarm still has some
learning to do vine is a video app
created by Twitter for sharing 6 second
video clips that loop now for the first
time you can send those looping videos
in a private message if the person has
the vine app the video will show up
there but if they don't have the vine
app you can still send the private video
as a link in an email or a text message
and to keep things private vine made it
so that the link to the video can only
be viewed once after that it just shows
a message that the video was already
viewed and it urges you to download the
app to see it again every app wants a
piece of this private messaging craze
especially Twitter's rival Facebook I'm
sure you've seen Facebook keep pushing
its messenger up and don't forget it
bought whatsapp and it owns Instagram
which also recently added private
messaging and did you know Samsung even
has its own private messaging app it's
called chat
you don't have to have a Samsung product
to use it it's available for iOS android
blackberry and windows chat on just
added new feature so that you erase a
message after it has been read it's a
similar concept to the disappearing
messages on the popular app snapchat you
can also share your location and send
files up to one gigabyte in size
chaton has 100 million users but nothing
is as popular as whatsapp which handles
64 billion messages a day from 465
million users
