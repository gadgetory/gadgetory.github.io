ready for more video commercials in your
strings I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update twitter is a network
for keeping up with what's happening
right now within the moment reactions
from people around the world and now
twitter is also for spontaneous shopping
the social network is allowing some
companies musicians and charities to put
a Buy button right on a tweet so if you
stumble on a post to buy something once
you click on the buy button you'll get a
prompt to confirm your shipping and
payment information because yes that
means you'll be storing your credit card
data with Twitter and once you confirm
the item is on its way the whole sale is
completed without ever leaving the
Twitter app this is first launched into
some us members for the iOS and Android
apps facebook also recently began
testing out a Buy button and Twitter is
following suit as it continues to find
new ways to make money of course Twitter
is not the only medium that's
experimenting with new ways of getting
revenue Spotify is launching video
advertisements for the 30 million users
who do not pay for premium subscriptions
to listen to the streaming music they
can watch a sponsor's video ad on their
phone to keep listening for another 30
minutes without commercials facebook is
also hungry for more video advertising
the social network reports that since
june there have been more than 1 billion
video views on facebook every day so to
woo over marketers and to get more
companies to publish their videos
facebook will show how many people have
viewed a video for pages and public
figures by flaunting the number of video
views facebook could convince
advertisers to spend more to put ads on
the network instead of on television and
on the topic of video if you find
yourself needing more space on the DVR
to record shows tebow has a new product
that will store three years worth of
video it's called the tivo mega and it
comes out a mega price five thousand
dollars it's basically a rack mountable
server case with a TiVo logo slapped on
the front and when it comes out next
year you can get ten swappable hard
drives for a total of 24
bites of storage space you can just
transfer video from your computer to
this as a way to store your entire movie
catalog if you don't need that much
there's also tivos Romeo Pro which
stores a week's worth of programming
there seems to be a new messaging app
cropping up all the time but one new app
puts a snapchat spin on audio it's
called chit chat and instead of sending
a photo that will disappear you can send
a voice message that will self-destruct
once it's heard you could argue that
that's safer than sending a scandalous
photo of yourself that's your tech news
