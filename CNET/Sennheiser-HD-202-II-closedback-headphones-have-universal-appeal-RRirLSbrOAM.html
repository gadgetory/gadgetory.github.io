first look at the Sennheiser HD - OH -
two headphones these headphones are over
the ear and are an excellent all-around
option for listeners curious about the
sonic gains of aftermarket headphones
but don't want to spend over $400 on a
flashy high-end pair everything about
these closed back headphones are built
for universal appeal including a wide
range of fit adjustments replaceable
synthetic leather ear cups and a
relatively neutral sound profile with an
emphasis on the higher end the HD 202 -
SR a closed back design that means the
ear cups grip around your ears and
filter out a pretty decent amount of
ambient sounds which can be a useful
feature if you want to block out noises
on your commute or while you're walking
around a loud city now in terms of
comfort the headband holding the cups
around your head is fitted with a range
of articulation points that lets you
adjust them to a lot of different head
sizes and despite their lightweight they
do feel very durable compared to other
plastic headphones you may find that the
10 foot long cord will keep you from
wanting to use it as a mobile headphone
but Sennheiser does include an adapter
that lets you spool it up if you want to
go that route another thing to note on
these headphones is that they don't
include any controls on the wire for
remote or volume access so you may want
to check out our other headphone reviews
if you're shopping for a smartphone
friendly pair
I recommend the cost Porter pros the
knee electronic HG 21s or even some of
the others Sennheiser on-air models for
comparisons you can read more about that
in my full review on CNET but that's
going to do it for this review these are
the sennheiser HD - OH - 2 headphones
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
