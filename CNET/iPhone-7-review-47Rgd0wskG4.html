a lot like the last iPhone and the one
before it what's going on here bobble
seems to have settled in on a particular
design you might be annoyed or bored but
the good news is this new phone is
better in ways that are totally non
gimmicky the iPhone 7 is finally water
resistant this time ip67 so if you end
up in this or end up jumping into a bath
or a pool you should be fine I wouldn't
go swimming with it and Apple says
definitely don't put it in salt water if
you happen to get it wet dry it off for
a few hours before charging it battery
life is better at last not by a huge
amount but at least a couple of hours
over last year the new processor faster
again they usually feel the same out of
the box but it is faster on paper and it
could be great for gamers the camera on
the a7 is better especially with
low-light photos and the flash is
improved - the front-facing camera is
also improved again for video and photos
good news for self streamers see this I
recorded all my selfie videos on it but
if you want to double down on cameras
literally that's we get the larger
iPhone 7 plus 4 which offers Apple's
first ever dual camera system with 2 X
optical zoom but think of the iPhone as
a hub smartphones connect with tons of
things now smartwatches smart homes
wireless headphones the cloud your
computer their everything and as hubs
they need to be more powerful have
better battery life and be more durable
the iPhone 7 does this for most cases
it's not any more shatterproof and the
new jet black color collects lots of
scratches but these are pretty practical
upgrades overall you know it's not
practical
losing a headphone jack I tried using
Apple's new air pods those crazy looking
wireless earphones coming in October
that you probably saw online and hey
they're really good but I don't like
using headphones I need to charge and
now I need to use a dongle to use
regular wired headphones of my choice
Apple includes the dongle nicely but
you're out of luck if you lose it or you
leave it at home other weird things the
new home button doesn't have actual
click like the new MacBook trackpads
they buzzed with haptics
Apple calls it the taptic engine it
won't break but it takes getting used to
that could be a hint that the home
button sooner or later is going to
disappear in some ways it already has
all signs point to Apple doing something
big for the iPhone 10th anniversary
which is next year in 2017 the iPhone 7
maybe it's just shoring up some key
improvements before then
you might want to just wait this 7 in a
lot of ways is a perfect step up for
anyone who's been waiting for an overdue
phone but that missing headphone jack
yeah it's going to be really hard to
swallow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
