this is a quick look at an unusual ipad
case called the podcaster now regardless
of how you are I feel about people using
an iPad to shoot video instead of a real
camera there are plenty of people who do
it the podcaster makes it easier for
those people to get better results at
its core it's a tripod mount for an iPad
you just pop it in to the flexible
insert and screw it onto a tripod and
you're done if you're shooting handheld
it gives you something bigger to hold on
to for steady or shooting and there are
also all these other threaded holes
around the outside for attaching things
like a mic or panel light then there's
this bracket on front and that's called
the lens caster and that is a threaded
mount for lens adapter so you can change
the focal length of the ipad's lens
paired with the right apps you can
basically turn an iPad into a mobile
video studio for shooting editing and
uploading on the spot or into something
as simple as a teleprompter also if you
shoot video with an SLR you can pull out
the insert and use it as a cage now
given its hundred and forty nine dollar
price you have to be pretty serious
about creating videos with your iPad
also once your iPad is in it's not easy
to get out and there's no cover to
protect the screen side if you just want
to throw it in a bag for travel so yeah
it's not for everyone but if you have a
need for it this is a solid product I'm
Josh Coleman and that's a look at the
podcaster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
