nasty it's downright dangerous all those
little bits of food and grease clogging
up your grill well they could cause a
fire and they make your food taste
pretty bad I'm going to show you how to
clean your grill properly and safely
when your grill is cold and gas is
turned off completely start by opening
it up and removing any parts that might
get in the way I'm talking about the
grill grates heat deflector bars heat
shields etc a lot of grease and food
particles tend to end up inside the
grills interior also known as the grill
box use a cheap putty knife metal or
plastic or old spatula to scrape the
sides of the grill chamber free of as
much gunk as you can if you have a gas
grill one part that often gets clogged
is its burner tube use a nylon or steel
wire brush to gently clean the small
holes on the tubes be sure to brush from
the center of the tube outwards moving
sideways not up and down otherwise you
may push debris into the tube or holes
themselves assemble the grill then turn
it on to its highest temperature setting
and close the hood after a few minutes
open the lid and scrape the grates
vigorously with a metal grill scraper if
you don't have one of those then use a
nylon brush but only if the grill is
cold certain practices can help
discourage deposits of dirt and grease
from forming one method is to grease the
grates of your hot grill with a little
cooking oil right before you start
cooking in the same vein scrubbing
grates with a raw onion is another
tactic you can try if you do have a
grill brush without bristles it's a good
idea to scrape your hot grates both
before and after grilling of course
performing a full cleaning every few
months is the best way to keep your
grill cooking safely and looking good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
