it and right now we're taking a look at
the KitchenAid for slice manual toaster
toaster certainly haven't changed in the
last 50 or 60 years but a crop of new
devices is trying to spice things up in
this otherwise stagnant product category
by adding all sorts of snazzy features
and design elements this appliance comes
in this really wild looking retro 1950s
almost automotive style up top you have
these wide slots so you can put in very
thick slices of bread and you also have
four so it can toast for a time up front
is a digital display which lists how
long you could have to wait until toast
time you also see how much toaster power
is engaged you have anywhere from level
one to seven and you can also see what
preset toasting function is engaged you
get things like bagel reheat or defrost
the KitchenAid for sliced manual toaster
is a little bit pricey it costs 109
dollars so that's a bit of a detractor
especially if you can just pick up a
regular toaster for about forty five
dollars this toaster is also pretty big
and heavy its wide its deep it weighs
about nine pounds and it's made out of
stainless steel so it's definitely gonna
take up a lot of room on your countertop
another thing I don't like off too bad
about this toaster is that even though
you get a
crumb tray in the back it does have a
tendency to collect crumbs inside the
actual slots themselves which don't
actually make it down to the tray the
most I would say annoying thing about
this device is that it takes a while to
toast your bread and for a toaster
that's kind of a that's a bit of a
problem essentially this toaster is
pretty good but for 109 it's a bit
pricey so if you want something that
toaster bread a little faster
I suggest checking out a toaster from
Elise Eve or even kitchen aids own Pro
Line 4 slice toaster
