off snap I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update it looks like snapchat gave
up on the dream of creating its own
original content when the popular
messaging app launched the discover
section in January it featured polished
Daily News reports and videos from 11
different media companies including CNN
ESPN vice and Comedy Central in the
center was a ghost icon for its own
snapchat Channel it was a way for
snapchat to establish itself as its own
media outlet and sometimes it used the
channel to create buzz broadcasting
exclusives like the premiere of a new
Madonna music video it even had his own
show called literally can't even the way
snapchat works is that everything on
these channels can only be viewed that
day then it disappears and it's replaced
by the next day's stories photos and
videos a couple of weeks ago snapchat
removed its own snap channel to give it
a remodel and a relaunch but in an
interview with deadline snapchat said it
has shut down the snap Channel
permanently the app hired a team just to
make content for this channel and it
even had its own studio but the company
decided to scrap it all because of costs
the head of programming has left to find
a new job discover is now made up of 15
outside media partners and this week it
added the fashion and beauty website
refinery29 meanwhile as his own company
can't afford to make daily videos the 25
year old founder of snapchat Evan
Spiegel is baring his chest in the
Italian version of men's vogue magazine
the tech billionaire puts on his best
attempt at sexy faces by cuddling a
puppy and leaning awkwardly in a
corduroy suit Spiegel is the youngest
billionaire in the world according to
forbes magazine worth 2.1 billion
dollars let's switch gears to another
pillar of social media Twitter the
network is laying off more than 300
employees which is about eight percent
of its staff one former Twitter employee
said he found out he didn't have a job
tuesday morning because he couldn't get
into his email account you would think a
company could talk to you about the loss
of your job before cutting off your
email but i guess a little dig
t is too much to ask for these days from
a major tech company apparently
Twitter's HR did leave him a voicemail
which he didn't listen to in time before
his email was cut off so a snapchat and
Twitter downgrade apple has released a
few upgrades to its IMAX giving the
desktop computers better screens and
faster processors the Mac computers make
up less than fifteen percent of Apple's
revenue but of course the company still
has to update the models to keep fans
happy every 27 inch screen iMac now has
a retina 5k display which is a sharper
display than today's ultra high-def
televisions it also put a 4k display in
the 21.5 inch mac line that's it for
this tech news update there's more at
