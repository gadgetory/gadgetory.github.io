revolutionize the market they need to be
two things cheap and practical a lot of
people have been waiting for Tesla dope
crack that nut with the model 3 but
Chevy is about to beat them to the punch
with this it's the new bolt it has a 200
mile range it's going to be available
for less than thirty thousand dollars we
got to drive it we're in the bolts we're
going to take it for a quick spin we're
gonna start with an acceleration test
the car will do zero to 60 in under
seven seconds and it's pretty good
that's certainly on par with pretty much
any other small economy car that you'd
expect in a segment the car is very nice
and roomy there's a lot of room in here
flat floor as well which makes getting
from the left side of the car to the
right side nice and easy which given the
partnership will lift you can see being
a good thing dropping off partners are
pedestrians i should say be nice and
easy regardless of a shot of the curb
you're on you can adjust the
regenerative braking here by shifting
into low which means that the car will
basically allow one pedal driving
meaning you don't have to worry about
using the brakes too often that'll mean
that the brakes will last longer it also
mean you can go longer on a charge which
is good of course we're talking about
200 miles to a charge but of course
that'll depend on your driving
characteristics now have you are on that
right pedal weather and other factors
will also affect your driving range but
ultimately car drives quite nicely it's
of course nice and quiet as you would
expect from an EV and again pretty good
amount of power inside the bolt we have
a customized version of chevys MyLink
system which is completely different
than what we've seen in any other cars
it's actually quite customizable and it
looks a lot like Android as a matter of
fact you can actually go through here
and choose a variety of different
layouts you can even do a custom layout
pick whichever widgets that you want to
these will then be tied back to the
driver profile so as you get in the car
remember who you are and show you the
appropriate things will even remember
what you were listening to when you got
out last time and being an EV of course
the car gives you plenty of information
about all the electricity and where it's
going in the car how you're using it can
also get information about you or
driving economy and also factors that
will impact your range things like
terrain and temperature basically things
will help you to optimize the amount of
distance that you can get out of your
battery pack also some other nice
features in here like an LCD dashboard
and a pretty cool mirror that actually
uses a camera to see behind you instead
of just optics
like the Model S the bolt has its
battery pack situated down low in the
floral this has a lot of advantages one
being handling it will help the car to
corner better but it also means you get
a lot more room inside a nice flat floor
plenty of room for plants or pets or
pretty much anything else would you want
to put into a compact car now again
Chevy isn't giving us a formal price for
the car this is just a pre-production
model which explains why these
headlights are a little bit ugly and why
there's lots of vinyl everywhere but
again they're saying the price will be
under thirty thousand dollars after the
federal tax rebate and it will have over
200 miles for the formal numbers we're
going to wait a little bit longer but
for my first time behind the wheel it's
a pretty impressive little car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
