and Wi-Fi router from Asus and this one
here is a soos answer to the are 8000
from Netgear right here and the EA night
204 links is right here these three are
the trio of AC 3200 router on the market
they all have a 3-band 12.5 headband and
two fighters headbands if the band has
one access point so the Asus right here
has one 2.4 good access point that cap
at 600 megabits per second and two
five-year-old access point each cap at
1,300 feet per second making a total
bandwidth of 3200 megabit per second at
any given tab so the router here is
especially helpful will have a lot of
fatherhood clients and doing a lot of
local Wi-Fi network intensive tasks such
as media streaming backing up or data
sharing if you just want to share the
internet or stream Netflix ideo this one
here is overkill now physically this one
here is a huge router with SiC
detachable antennas despite the big
desire here it comes with the usual for
land ports and one one port there's
enough space to put more land put here
but there's not extract unfortunately
that the router comes with two USB port
the 2.0 port is on the back here but the
3.0 port is actually on the front which
is a bit up on the inside issues here
run a powerful dual-core 1.0 gigahertz
processor 256 Mayibuye up system memory
and hundred twenty eight megabyte of
flash memory this thing is powerful it
has very nice and robust web interface
that is fun to use and many unique
features including the ability to turn
one of these land 4 into a second one
port in case you want to hook to a 2
separate internet connections at the
same time the router also come with a
traffic monitoring tool an adaptive QoS
engine and the ability to protect your
network from not just high code but also
viruses
when covered with an extra hard drive it
can work as a powerful network server
with lots of other storage features now
in testing the router did really well
with fast Wi-Fi speed long range and
stable signal still though I'm not sure
if it's worth the price of $300 to find
out more this one and check out my full
review at cnn.com you know if you can
afford it didn't hurt to have it
actually a great router and if you ask
me to choose which one to have among
these three I would pick the issues
because it has great feature but mainly
because I actually have them all
simultaneously and that's because I'm
done going this has been the first look
at the RT 2 200 tri-band Wi-Fi router
