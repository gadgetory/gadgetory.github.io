whirlpool swash so what exactly is this
large appliance I have in front of me
supposed to do essentially supposed to
save you time expense and effort by
cutting down your trips to the dry
cleaners this swash appliance is big
it's heavy it weighs 80 pounds and it's
almost four and a half feet tall the
swash is also not the most elegant
looking product it's made out of plastic
and it looks like some sort of retro
radiator type of device except it has
LED lights on the front which basically
clue you in to its 21st century origins
to use the swash you basically pull this
big knob here and you open up the drawer
put in any kind of item that you want to
refresh after you put in a pod and put
it right in there close it up there are
some definite drawbacks to the swash
first off at $400 it's still expensive I
also don't like how the swash requires
you to use proprietary pods almost like
it's some sort of pureed coffee machine
at six or seven dollars a 12-pack that
can definitely add up one thing to
definitely be aware of the swash doesn't
actually clean your clothes it may
refresh them and make them smell a
little better but it doesn't remove
stains or grime or dirt so if you're
into the pressed sharp clean looks that
you get from dry cleaning or even
ironing the swash is not gonna make you
happy it tends to leave some wrinkles
behind until the swash delivers the same
sort of wrinkle free press look that you
get from dry cleaning or even just
ironing I don't think this guy is really
worth your money
