gold well you're not gonna get it I'm
Bridget Carey and this is a special
edition of CNN update another iPhone
launched another iPhone line but this
time things are a little more
complicated we have two phones going on
sale and the top-of-the-line iPhone 5s
which people are here in line for comes
in three different colors and people are
not going to get the color they want so
we're here to talk to people in line to
see what they think and why they felt
the passion to come out here today
you're battling this crazy long line
that's wrapping around the block what
phone do you want to get I want to get
an iPhone 5s and what color I haven't
decided actually so I'm secretly hoping
that there's only one color left but
maybe I go for gold I'm getting the
silver one and she's going to get the
gold one
you don't want gold to figure some more
silver not gold not gold no so why gold
it's a new color I've got a lot of gold
you know rings and everything so I don't
need gold iPhone I'm going for the
silver if they have it you're gonna go
for silver not gold isn't gold then you
color though
yeah go about it um I feel a little
girly for me to get the gold one like my
sister wants to get the gold one so I'm
like I can't get the same as my sister
are you gonna be disappointed if you
don't get gold yeah I think so I mean
it's different I've had every iPhone so
you know you kind of like to get
something different but it'll be fine
either way why did you want to come here
though on the busiest day to get it why
did you have to be the first to get this
phone I don't I feel like a sucker but
if I like just I had to do it so if you
can't get gold what are you gonna go
with how are you gonna be able to go on
I might just like Gorder online honestly
you might abandon it altogether this
line getting here this early and say if
I can't get gold you're gonna just try
again later
yeah I know it pains me it pains me to
say that
there was an extremely limited supply of
gold and silver iPhones online orders
made early Friday indicated a month long
wait for delivery of a gold phone even
the first dozen people in line at this
store couldn't all get a gold phone and
reports came in from across the country
of similar shortages some carrier stores
didn't get any iPhones at all to sell on
launch day but this Apple store did have
plenty of the black space gray models no
silver just black well at the flagship
New York City Apple store they did sell
out fast of the gold and silver but even
so people will still wait in line just
to get the iPhone no matter what color
it is for CNET I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
