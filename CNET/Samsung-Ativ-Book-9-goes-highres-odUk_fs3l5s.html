take a look at some of samsung's new
laptops these are the atif book 9 plus
and book 9 lite let's start with the
plus so the Plus has a 13.3 inch display
it's very light and thin it's just 13
point 6 millimeters thick and it weighs
1.39 kilogram so this is an extremely
portable laptop let us talk about the
screen for a minute because it has an
extremely high resolution specifically
3200 by 1800 pixels that is a shocking
amount of pixels and it makes all the
on-screen action look extremely crisp
Samsung's also seen fit to make the
screen touch sensitive which is perfect
for navigating the windows 8 interface
there's plenty to be excited about on
the inside as well you get up to 8
gigabytes of RAM Intel's new Haswell
processors and samsung says this machine
will last for up to 12 hours in terms of
battery life but we'll wait till we can
form our own benchmark tests before we
really believe that too much so a very
cool very thin and light very portable a
very powerful laptop it's bound to be
expensive though so you'd best start
saving if that sounds like it's going to
be a bit too pricey for you you might
want to check out this is the smaller
cousin the book 9 lite it's basically
kind of the same laptop but all of the
specs are a little bit less impressive
so it's a bit thicker it's a bit heavier
though that said picking it up it
doesn't feel like two unpossible I think
you could easily carry this around with
you all day the touchscreen to be honest
is where you see the most difference it
has a lower resolution oh it's 1366 x
768 and it does look unfortunately a lot
more ordinary samsung is promising a
quad-core processor and 8.5 hours of
battery life and another positive sign
is this track pad which at first go
feels quite sensitive and its really
large as well so they have it to very
slim light reasonably powerful laptops
let me know what you think I'm lacuesta
cnet and this is the samsung atty book 9
plus and light
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
