internet connected smart speaker will
give you step-by-step instructions out
loud for more than 5 million recipes
until now Google homes biggest
competitor the Amazon echo line of smart
speakers could only read off recipes all
at once
that means you couldn't ask it to repeat
a staff or pause while you completed a
test Google home changes things however
by adding a more conversational element
to help you cook recipes here's how it
works you search for a recipe in the
Google assistant app on your Android
phone or with the Google Search app on
iOS or Android when you find the recipe
you want to cook you tap the send to
Google home button then it's time to
talk to your Google home ok Google start
cooking I have a recipe you got from
Food Network called Tony's chicken
tenders with honey mustard sauce is that
the right one Google home will list all
of the ingredients either in groups of
three or one by one and she'll also give
you the steps one at a time you can ask
her to repeat steps or ingredients just
in case you forget ok Google what was
that last step beat the three eggs in a
separate bowl and measure the flour into
another separate dish but you have to
say hey Google first this kit clunky but
you can move at your own pace throughout
the recipe without having to write
anything down this new Google home
feature is a big deal for making smart
speakers more useful in the kitchen and
it also challenges Amazon to step up its
chef skills with the echo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
