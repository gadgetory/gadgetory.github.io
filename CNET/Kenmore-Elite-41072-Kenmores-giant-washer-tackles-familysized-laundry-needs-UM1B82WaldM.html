$1,650 kenmore front load washing
machine is that it wasn't actually
manufactured by kenmore this mega
capacity washing machine right next to
me is actually an LG model that is
already available on the market the good
news is that this washer is an
exceptional performer it did really well
both in terms of stain removal and in
terms of overall gentleness on the
clothes so that means it won't wreck
your favorite sweater or anything like
that which is great another thing is
that it is a huge washer for a front
load model most are at or under 5 cubic
feet but this one is actually 5.2 cubic
feet and that's the largest washer
that's a front load model that we've
reviewed to date another bonus is that
it's currently on sale for less than a
thousand bucks so if you don't want to
spend the excessive 1,650 dollars on
this thing you can get it for 990 bucks
at Sears
so overall this thing is perfect for
large families if you can get its 29
inch width through your front door it is
available for less than a thousand bucks
on Sears right now and it's definitely a
model that I would recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
