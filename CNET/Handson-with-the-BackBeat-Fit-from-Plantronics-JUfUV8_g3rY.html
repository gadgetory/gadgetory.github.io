back key fit stereo headphones from
Plantronics these connect to your
smartphone tablet or mp3 players through
bluetooth and can also double as a
wireless headset thanks to a built-in
microphone as you can see they're very
flexible and both sweat and weatherproof
making them perfect for runners and gym
rats a play and pause button along with
volume controls sit on the Left earpiece
while the power and phone buttons are
located on the right side you also have
the ability to skip songs or go back
with a long press or double tap of the
play button charging which should take
about two and a half hours is done
through a micro USB port that can be
accessed by lifting a small cover on the
right earpiece although smaller the
backbeat fit has pretty good battery
life getting up to eight hours of music
listening or six hours of talktime in
standby they can get up to 14 days or a
whopping 180 days in a deep sleep
hibernation mode weighing only 24 grams
the headphones are comfortable to wear
and the stereo sound is very good I did
notice that they tend to bounce a little
bit while running or working out which
can get a little annoying inside the box
you get a micro USB cord and also an
armband that can be used to hold your
device while you work out or even store
the headphones when you aren't using
them the backbeat fit will be available
in lime and blue in April $429 I'm Dan
Graziano frissina and that was a first
look at the backbeat fit bluetooth
headphones from Plantronics
