to the laces on your sneakers and can be
used to measure pace distance duration
and cadence when you're running but it's
not an activity tracker and it's not
meant to be worn all day what is it
exactly it's a low-cost and bluetooth
equipped foot pod with up to eight
months of battery life and on top of all
those basic running metrics it can also
measure foot strike ground contact rate
of impact stride length and leg swing
and while you may not initially
understand why these are useful the
milestone app does a good job explaining
them like how a high rate of impact can
lead to injury or a higher leg swing is
considered more efficient for most
runners that happens to wear you can
also view and analyze all the run data
but it doesn't sync with third-party
running apps like Strava or RunKeeper
now the question on everyone's mind is
accuracy how does something like this
compare to using GPS well surprisingly
it's pretty accurate I found the pod to
generally measure a distance that was
point one miles off from what the GPS
measured but there is the option to go
back and enter the correct distance
this will also calibrate the pod for
future runs overall I like the milestone
pod and at 25 bucks it's about half the
price of foot pods from Garmin and polar
now obviously with no display and it
being on your laces and everything you
won't be getting real-time data but for
newcomers that don't want to spend a
hundred bucks or more on a full-fledged
running watch it's a solid Buy although
in the long run a watch like the Garmin
Forerunner 25 or four run or 235 would
probably be a better investment for more
