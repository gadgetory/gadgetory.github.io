vying for your money these are the top
five online services worth paying for as
voted by you at number five Spotify it's
one of the more popular music services
out there it's so popular that Taylor
Swift once had a problem with it the
service features so many top artists and
has a huge catalog
oh and it's really easy to use at number
four last class if you haven't heard of
LastPass it's a password manager they
can generate all kinds of crazy
passwords so you don't make the mistake
of using one password for every site
don't do that the general service is
free but their premium version lets you
easily access LastPass on mobile devices
like your phone number three Google Play
Music and YouTube rent I'll say I'm
surprised by this one but I get it for
$9.99 a month you get both Google Play
Music and YouTube red that means you can
upload all of your music to Google Play
Music and listen to it's a giant catalog
as well on top of that that same $9.99
get you access to YouTube read the
premium version of YouTube that means no
ads none both of those together make it
hard to argue with that price at number
two Amazon Prime Amazon Prime is a crazy
service you pay an annual rate and you
get all kinds of privileges two days
shipping on whatever you buy is included
in the fee want to watch a catalog of
streaming movies TV shows and
award-winning programming that's
included want to listen some music
that's included want to travel the world
in the Amazon Prime box that's not
included yet before we get to number one
let's take a look at a service that did
not get on the list backup services many
of you use different services but the
category pulled in almost ten percent of
the votes and now it's time for numero
uno and the number one service worth
paying for as voted by you is Netflix
nearly 20 percent of votes were cast for
Netflix which is really understandable
it's cheap it's offered streaming
commercial free video for years and it's
up to its original offerings in the past
few years
check out orange is the new black or the
Marvel shows like Jessica Jones or
daredevil for proof of that
do you have a difference of opinion let
me know i'm at donald on twitter wait
That's not me I'm at Aya's anyway I'll
see you online
