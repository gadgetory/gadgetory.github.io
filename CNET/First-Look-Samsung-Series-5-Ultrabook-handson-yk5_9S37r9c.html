almost here and the summer is arriving
and you're going to be looking for some
small laptop to carry around right well
that's what a lot of computer
manufacturers are hoping for that's what
ultrabooks are designed for and one of
the ultra books that we did not get a
look at until recently is the samsung
series 5 ultra this is a more affordable
version of the samsung series 9 that
really fancy MacBook Air type of
competitor that was really expensive
that came out last year this one is 999
for 128 gigabyte SSD although you can go
even cheaper so you get a pretty good
bargain on this laptop and that's a far
cry from the thousand dollar plus
territory that we tend to see these
ultrabooks in before what's not so great
is that you can tell that there were a
couple of design corners that were
chopped off to try to make this thing
more affordable it certainly looks
attractive but it's a little more
plasticky it's certainly not the sleek
blade design that's all metal that you
see in a macbook air now we're to the
wise if you're buying an intel laptop at
this point there are new processors that
are literally right around the corner
and in some laptops they may already be
here that's called ivy bridge and that's
a slightly faster processor that's going
to actually have a lot better graphics
performance for playing games especially
on a little ultrabook like this one if
you're going to think about getting this
laptop i would highly recommend you wait
maybe about a month and just see what
comes out maybe at the same price that
gives you a little more bang for the
buck the 14 inch version is a totally
different laptop it is an ultrabook as
well but it really fits more into that
looks like a regular thicker laptop
territory it's got a DVD Drive and if
you were to see it on the street you
probably just thank a regular laptop the
13 inch version is shrunken down doesn't
have a DVD drive but it's a lot thinner
it really feels much more like the
Ultrabook MacBook Air type laptop they
are probably thinking of now ultrabooks
a marketing term what it really means is
that you're looking at a thin laptop
here 13 inches and no optical drive
you're getting a low voltage processor
that's still really zippy and Intel Core
i5 in this case four gigs of RAM and 128
gigabyte SSD and again that big shift
that's happening this year is your
see a lot more of these get packed with
regular hard drives to shave a few
dollars off the price and be able to
make these things a little more
competitive with what Apple's fronting
that's a great idea and I would probably
end up buying one of those in the 500
gigabyte territory and not go for the
SSD but that's a matter of opinion the
other great thing about this laptop is
hey it packs in all the ports why can't
every ultrabook do this you've got your
USB you've got USB 3.0 HDMI and Ethernet
port on the side they're all here it's
effortless every laptop should have that
it's a no-brainer as far as this one
goes is a very good laptop with a
disappointing battery life and a feel
that is a little more plasticky than I'd
like still you might want to check one
out and see if you can get one at a good
price I'm Scott Stein and that's a look
at the samsung series 5 ultra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
