two things you need to power up the
level of your trainer by gaining
experience points and power up your
pokemons combat power level you do that
by catching pok√©mon to start you'll
grab a Pokemon out on the field tap on
it and if the server's allow you to you
can catch that Pokemon with a pokeball
each time you'll gain experience points
towards your trainer and you'll have a
new Pokemon that you can trade in to get
some candy once you've captured a new
Pokemon it's time to level them up I'm
going to head on over to the Pokemon the
screen here and take a look at my
ratatata which is one of the low level
Pokemon you'll get during the beginning
of the game as you can see here we've
got a pair of phones
my Samsung is a level 6 pokemon trainer
and Rebekah's is a level 10 so you can
see that though we have the same
percentage of the Ratatat as progress
bar filled up we have different combat
levels that's because more advanced
trainers can level their Pokemon up
further than weaker ones either way once
you've got two Pokemon up on the page
you can power them up by spending some
of your Stardust and your candy so we're
going to power up this ratatata
to the maximum level we can by spending
that Stardust and candy each time we can
combat points and some health for our
Pokemon which will help it in battles
we're just going to do that a few times
until we reach the maximum that I can do
with a rata Tana with a level 6 trainer
with a level 6 pokemon trainer I can
only met my Ratatat up to a hundred and
one combat power which is only about
what Rebecca had with her level ten
without even upgrading this Pokemon now
we're going to evolve these Pokemon and
see what happens
takes 25 candy to evolve this ratatata
and do it over here
Radek eight it's the new Pokemon we're
going to get from this evolution and
we'll see what the combat power is like
in a second
271 you get a huge boost to your combat
power when you evolve a Pokemon and then
you can further power it up from there
even though I'm a level 6 trainer I
still have the ability to power up this
pokemon further so some of you might be
wondering should you power up first
before you evolved or evolved before you
power up let's put it to the test here
we have a CP 10 ratatata at the very
beginning of its entire powerup scheme
we're going to try evolving it right
away
we'll use 25 of these ratatata candy
instead of getting eradicate with CP 271
we're going to have something probably a
bit weaker which we can then Oh
quite a bit weaker CP 17 but what's
important to note here is that the
percentage of its growth is the same it
still only costs us 200 Stardust and one
reddit Etta candy to power it up to its
next amount and it's still at the
beginning of its progress cycle one of
the theories right now on reddit and
other Pokemon go forums is that the
percentage will stay the same regardless
of whether when you evolve so if you've
got a fully maxed out ratatata it'll
turn out into a fully maxed out Reddit 8
for your level in my case it's a level 6
trainer that just devolved into level 7
trying to power it up into the next
level right now you should see it
progress the same amount it would have
progressed if it were a Ratatat so at a
combat level 113 about halfway powered
up I've actually run out of Stardust so
I can't upgrade it any further I can't
actually prove that fully upgraded it
would also have a power level of 271 it
looks like if you double 113 to 226 it
looks like if you filled up the progress
indicator all the way you'd be
approaching the power level of the red
that we powered up before we evolved but
we're not sure we can't prove it right
now so for now this remains an open
question maybe you'll be the one to
figure it out
happy hunting folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
