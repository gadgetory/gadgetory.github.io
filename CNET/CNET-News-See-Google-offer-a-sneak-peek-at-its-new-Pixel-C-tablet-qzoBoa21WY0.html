for convertible is an entirely new
approach to combining a tablet and a
keyboard closed they're held together
with self-aligning magnets but when
you're ready to get down to work slide
the tablet off touch it to the back of
the keyboard and lift the tablet
attaches magnetically and the screen is
fully adjustable between 100 and 135
degrees I can hold it by the tablet I
can hold it by the keyboard I can hold
it upside down the screen size is 10.2
inches with a square root of two aspect
ratio now that's a metric area ratio
that's used by a series paper of which
a4 is the standard letter format
throughout much the world and what this
means is this life will use in either
portrait or landscape orientations while
at the same time giving us enough room
for a full-size keyboard so with the
pics we'll see the keyboard attaches to
the back of the tablet securely so
that's out of the way but close by and
unlike Bluetooth accessories the pixel
see knows when to use the physical
keyboard and when to use the on-screen
keyboard so I can enter in here on the
screen but then if I want to do more
extensive typing the keyboards there for
me now it is a bluetooth keyboard it has
a small battery but you'll never have to
charge it either when closed the tablet
inductively charges the pixel sees
keyboard just a few minutes a day closed
will keep the battery topped up and if
you don't close it for a while don't
worry the keyboard would last for over
two months of daily active usage without
ever recharging the pixel sees display
lives up to its name with three hundred
and eight pixels per inch that's 4.6
million pixels if you're keeping count
it's super bright at 500 nits and has
amazing srgb color gamut all of this
while keeping the power low enough for
great battery life on a tablet driving
all of those pixels is an nvidia x1
quad-core processor with a desktop class
maxwell GPU so to enable far-field voice
input we've added four microphones so
now you can have voice interactions from
across the room of course the tablet
charges with USB type-c and one of my
favorite features for a quick check of
battery life double tap on the light bar
the pics we'll see will be available in
time for the holidays on the Google
store starting at 499 for the tablet and
149 for the keyboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
