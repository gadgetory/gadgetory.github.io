four-four time here in New York City I'm
Jeff Bakalar and I'm Justin you this is
the show where we give Wayne Brady a
swirly really oh is that what's up or
Wayne Brady gives the internet a swirly
either one or trade off hahaha that's
fine turning the tables on us Wayne
Brady thank you so much for being here
in our studio thank you sir we've had
you in Las Vegas and now we've had you
in New York no it feels good to be here
thank you so very very good it's April
twentieth we're all very excited yeah
because today is the day where Wayne
Brady starts his Gotham a comedy club
segment of shows starting tonight night
tomorrow and Sunday two shows tonight to
show Saturday Hayden 10 yeah 730 and 10
and eight o'clock all right there you go
so make sure you if you're in the city
or you're close enough to come in make
sure you get tickets for that tickets
are on sale gotham comedy club com so
make sure you do that and see your buddy
Wayne today also note know there are
some people that have seen whose line
and they followed it for years or
they're seen other things have been on
and they'll come no no the other people
are like well why would I want to come
to to an improv show I've already seen
that no it's because it is an improv
show yeah and it's my improv show it's
different better whose line showing me
it's me it's it's it's stuff that I do
off the top of my head right and so the
whole show I walk on stage is myself a
microphone and and a keyboardist that's
fantastic and I just get folks up on
stage and we do different scenes one-man
improv and I act out whole movies by
myself and sketches all right and then
there are two things that I love doing
one I let the audience ask any question
they want to ask and I'll answer it
truthfully and that may turn into a
scene or a song or something or I'll
just be a funny answer only if you write
your name on the paper because folks
will say oh I'll ask something really
you know to like finish and then not
want to claim it right no I will ask any
question anything you asked me right now
sure you don't have to go on Wikipedia
dude I have to look in a tabloid you
don't ask me but you have to be man or
woman enough to say I Gwendolyn from
juror
he wanted to ask you about your junk
right you have to be the person right
and then I will be glad to let you know
what what you want to know and and the
show i think is really honest and funny
that way and that ends up spurring the
other improv stir and then at the end
the audience writes down song titles
that do not exist huh they give it to me
and they give me a recording artist and
my or style and my keyboardist plays and
someone says hey I've got pork chops in
my pants his rod stewart boom he starts
playing and i do it as rod stewart or
something is prince or hammer michael
jackson a kid whatever it is I'll do it
that's awesome wow that sounds like a
lot of fun so make sure you see it
tonight we said saturday and sunday
making it up is what we're calling the
that's we're calling it here on on the
radio here but in vegas and in real life
it's making you know oh the stuff up
shizzle shizzle Bashara a shy oh that's
so cool because we were talking earlier
about you know people have sort of being
a little using the cloak of an end up
being anonymous on the internet
anonymity if you will you know you went
through a recent sorta bored or deal on
twitter which is sort of silly I feel
like you should get some more
information from people other than their
name like a social security number or
something as well write it down or the
very least an email address yeah where
you can be reached because I'm finally
going to start doing that this I think
that the whole thing about the Internet
is is and i'm a believer and i would
like to believe in the best in people
sure but i'll be honest the internet has
really made me feel that that people are
not high on my on my list yeah yeah they
the thing about what the internet it's
it's a little harder to ignore those
kinds of comments you know like it's are
you can choose not to read youtube
comments but with things like Twitter
they reply to you you have to read and
they engage you because they keep
because they put your name in the thing
thing is look if you want to insult me
or say something stupid go ahead cuz
it's a free world of course you know you
can walk around and yell at all you want
to but then it reaches another level of
why include my name and add and you know
personally that I'm gonna read it do you
hate me that much anonymously that you
would say some stupid crap why not just
say it in in the ether and be done with
it like
you really wanted me to know but the
thing that I found is and I've run up
against a couple these people is they'll
say something whether it's online or on
you two will oppose something and you
meet them in person and that person
immediately becomes your biggest fan
right yeah man Wayne Brady he can kiss
my they really really just do that yeah
he's behind me isn't he all away their
wages are tracking down these Twitter
haters and just showing up at their
house right that's in front of the
member don't even joke with me because
I've dreamt of how to do that I ifsc
pitched a show last year that that that
the pilot was was gonna be made but then
Mario Lopez had a show called haters
okay and that tanked and so my show
would went away that the premise of my
show was because of the online haters
and everything right you you get someone
to help set up a friend where where
let's say this guy oh my god I hate that
dude Wayne Brady was a really he yeah
the guy's horrible that okay hey Wayne
Brady my my friend Doug hates you he was
a starbucks over on Katie second street
ding a ling ling hi I'd like a coffee
yeah here hmm that's not dead man which
I don't respect because in a way I don't
respect that now if Justin turns around
the coffee goes hit so hey and throws it
at me Dad in your fight make a coffee in
your face then I go okay you know what
that man stood behind his opinion not
because he had the cloak of the internet
that gave him a plus 5 dexterity still
there yes he he then stood by his no I
don't like you not oh I need something
to say but now that you're here and
you're an actual person right now I'm
gonna change it up yeah that's what I
don't respect if they don't change it up
and they keep their hate they should win
something almost it's like that one
they've won a do my hair that they were
actually going to UM it was called how
you like me now yeah
and we actually would spend the entire
day together and then at the very end of
it I said okay so it's almost like a
dating show dude we've spent three hours
together made ice cream together we want
you dinner I bought you dinner I I put
in your hate we've all hung out so yeah
how you like me now yeah and they can
honestly go well you know man I still
don't be funny but your internet same
but that's cool yeah because at that
point it's a genuine human interaction
which i think is cool and that's what my
whole act is based on right being in
front of an audience is saying hey this
is not TV this is stripped down say you
say what you're going to say so I can do
what I do and let's see how you feel at
the end of the night right now that we
talked about it about this at CES but in
terms of like Xbox Live and PlayStation
Network like little kids like talking
crap that they would never say in person
that they would never see in person and
never see in front of their parents
unless their parents owned a double-wide
out in chatima hooch is seriously dad
spent a lot of time on a wife beater
hall and as one as oh yeah double duty
yes there sure ain't just the name is an
occupation way of life it's pretty good
yeah now the the the internet definitely
allows for 4p I mean you know even our
show where sometimes we'll say something
we have someone right in you know like
maybe 500 words fu this is that why why
I don't know well right back and then
the table sort of turn sometimes be like
oh I really like you show guys I'm sorry
I went crazy back there because they
didn't expect you to write invest yeah
that that I get that all the time on
Twitter like oh you just texted me yeah
no no really I'm a fan like I follow you
what then why did you say oh no yeah
just as it was something to say yeah I'm
a big believer that Twitter is around
for people who love to be enraged it's
just there for people who love to get
mad at stuff and those types of people
people who are easily enraged they just
thrive on Twitter and that is their
platform they just sort of sit around
waiting around what what's going to
insult me now what can I really jump on
the second it happens
oh my god I don't know and then that's
it you know so reactionary well I have
to admit I'm one of those people okay in
the sense of you would never know it
from the stuff that I have to do on TV
sometimes but I sometimes have anger
issues I believe in the sense of I get
mad at everything and I get mad and
fairness I get mad when I don't think
that someone is getting a fair shake
sure I get mad when I feel like I'm
being judged I get mad when I see a dog
get a kick that you're mad remember that
so Twitter is is that for me but I don't
want it I would love just to say hey to
the people that like me but I see one
comment I go man you can't engage do not
engage gramophone so so I i am the
converse of that guy yeah i get enraged
because i see people that use twitter
and and the internet things they would
never say in real life mmm this is my
voice yeah well it's free speech well
then it will say what you will say it in
real life no no no I couldn't possibly
that's a different free speech thing I
don't really say it um we get fan mail
or fan the reverse fan mail sometimes
that at let's make a deal where someone
gets so offended that there was this
letter and they later tweeted me I I do
not enjoy your singing and
improvisational antics I enjoy gameplay
and I want to see who's going to get the
money in the curtain this is a game show
this is not a variety show it's not a
talent show this is not what you did a
like wow you really got it so so just to
go them on e even more I said so if so
what if I just did did just a couple
improv games that be okay no this is
them this is not about improv hey just
look up and then what what I love is
when you look at the avatar that tells a
lot yep that tells a lie cuz they spend
time on that it's very telling yes it's
so telling us if the person that gets
mad at you doesn't use their own face
but a picture of all their cats I don't
care what you have to say that doesn't
matter when you tweet me about you hate
what I'm doing let's make a deal and you
have cats on your thing I don't care
there you
when when you have a picture of an orc
yeah yeah holding a unicorn some sort of
wizard yeah I admire you in a weird way
but I don't care looking up to say your
vote does not get show your face yeah
and then I go oh that's it that that's a
grown person sure or not possible yes so
that's okay yeah so funny to me um so I
want to get into a little bit of the
gaming talk we've spent a lot of time
talking about trolling on the internet
about what kind of troll you to get
after people that's a position ring it
bring it bring it on um so yeah gaming
you you disclose to us we already knew
going into CS you're a big gamer um what
have you been playing since I feel like
and there and we've been talking a lot
about this lately about running out of
time to play video games you find that
obviously you're a busy man you're
involved in a lot of projects do you
have the time to play as much as you
want to no i don't but i find myself
doing the things that addicts do Oh
telling the small lives to get out of
certain things that may be a meeting
that I don't necessarily want to be in
because in my head I went well if I get
out of that meeting at noon yeah I don't
have to be the studio until three so if
I don't do the medium noon that I can
stay home until two-thirty and I can
play because I have become addicted
addicted hardcore to um to uh to to uh
and and now I blank black ops okay
zombie okay makalah judias holiday yeah
and I've downloaded all of the different
zombie level oh man and and I play with
my niece's who I'm the luckiest guy in
the world a few my niece's live with me
and they're teenagers so downstairs in
the TV room there they're playing on a
ps3 and I'm upstairs playing with myself
and a buddy and sometimes my daughter
all the girls that are in my life love
video games you like that we play and
even my nine-year-old is good so we're
up there until two o'clock in the
morning i'm the worst parental figure
and uncle sometimes because they want to
go to bed like no no no we have to get
through this level right we have to get
to the level now what you're going to do
and and we're all on headsets
and the ps3 which I hope that Sony's
listening the big fault with the
multiplayer on ps3 and maybe someone has
found a way to get around this is if two
of your playing on the same console only
one of you can rock the headset right
that sucks yeah they were I think
there's like something you buy that does
sort of like a speakerphone thing where
it sort of lets you chat on like a
speakerphone in that sort of concept I
want that yeah I'm not sure they work
well I've tried one out for Xbox not
really doing the job because I end up
yelling yeah because I end up eat either
getting instructions from my daughter to
give to the other two right or or I'm
yelling at the one who isn't on the
headset via her sister she can stop
yelling at me uncle shut up and you just
open the door who opened that door who
opened the door now the hellhounds are
here who helped you know the plan we go
through this level and then we stop at
the first door you get some more money
then I'll open the door you get the
shotgun that's on the wall and you get
the oohs e then we meet at the
teleporter duh are you CD gonna head go
to Vail Christ school in the morning go
to bed man I'm such a jerk when it comes
to video games that's so funny because a
lot of you know there's a lot of people
that sort of say especially in the news
lately that games are the end of the
world and they're bringing civilization
down to a level that we've never seen
before they're causing people to commit
crimes and there and you know it's it's
bigger would cause me to commit a crime
before playing a shooting game before
shooting a zombie would I would imagine
yes I mean how do you feel about that
like you know as someone who's so
passion about games I mean obviously we
are on one side of the fence you know we
cover for a living I mean as a big gamer
you know well how do you feel that games
get thrown in that sort of category like
you know metal and rock and roll did in
the 80 in the 70s and 80s sort of like
that's the reason everyone's worshipping
Satan and stuff like that civilization
and society will society itself always
need to scapegoat sure you always need a
scapegoat things aren't going well and
I'm sorry this is your fault excuse me
it's all ginger ale Justin trick that uh
that things aren't going well sure you
know why because the video games
right because you kids are going around
shooting things so you shooting things
in real life now that's not to say that
there are not individuals who are
already because of whatever's going on
in their life they're not already at
that precipice where it could have been
the video game it could have been a book
that they read where the character goes
in and and and goes out in a blaze of
glory right could have been the kid who
picked on him yes that exists sure
completely I will not be to be the
person that goes no no yes that that
person's out there but take him over
there and then you have the rest of us
who have been a gamer since I was a kid
with with the first systems and kaliko
Atari vision and then I love video games
because when I was was growing up
reading was my video game because it
wasn't accessible right then when you
told me you mean I can play this thing
and it oh okay that took me to another
place it just let me use my imagination
even more right and now we're gaming has
reached it's basically watching a movie
which we all love to do anyway of course
but you're in the movie now who are the
hero of the movie so as I get away it's
perfect yeah and and and it's been
proven to increase hand-eye coordination
it's just one of those things so yes has
someone committed a crime and blamed in
a video games and maybe they they were
pushed by it in their own head yeah but
for the rest of us in the world right no
the other six billion of us yeah thanks
we're not that guy exact form of
enjoyment for us I'd rather be the dude
who goes home after a hard day of work
and and I let off some steam playing
video games right then then smoking
crack or charlie shining it very bored
or being a Secret Service agent in South
America III El Presidente so so I so I
defend the gaming industry and I laugh
at anyone who like rock and roll's like
anything else says that it's that that
it's bringing our civilization down sure
if anything is bringing our civilization
down it's it's Wikipedia hey
and people feeling that that that they
know things that they really don't right
right good point um if you could be if
you could star in any video game cuz
that's a popular thing now a lot of
celebrities and during the you know the
gaming world not so much so you know
their their motion capturing their
lending their voices for voice over
stuff you could be involved in the game
what would you want to be involved in
mmm I would definitely want to be
involved in a game a gritty kind of um
oh no I take it back it's going to say
that I would want to do something like
um like the zombie series sure but I
think I'd rather be in a halo like type
space of mass effect okay universe sure
where I'm the renegade captain of this
ship and and I've been disavowed by the
rest of the Federation because they
don't believe that I know the secret of
course and and I'm that guy you want to
be the Shepherd you want I want to be
the Shepherd there you go and then I
want to be at the very end of the first
game I wanted to be some huge
cliffhanger for the next two years the
studio pushes the release date back away
I'm fills up hype then it comes out
there you go I would buy I would play
that just on the pitch alone i think or
or develop an app called call the the
choke a bitch app yes upload your own
photo of who you in with you to which i
am actually developing i'm joking about
it but uh yes so is that it is it was a
nice way of sticking that in sick segue

can put your simpoints no I'm so not
putting you on I'll and I promise you so
how does it work yeah well as well I

interaction with with your fans and
people you know you will be able to
reach out to me yeah and and and with a
photo ward or video and there are
different tiers ok this is the
money-making aspect of it which is in-
the company's
