of it
identifying an audience and letting them
know the company exists let's see what
their latest effort doing exactly those
things is life as we drive the 2015
all-new Lincoln MKC and check the deck
before you even see a Lincoln MKC you
may smell one select Lincoln dealers
that have a lot of these are going to
have the Lincoln Cent sprayed around
their showroom they worked with master
perfumer Renee Morgan faller to develop
this smell that is I'm told a
combination of jasmine for a sense of
well-being and green tea to relax you
the look is very different the Lincoln
faces come along I think to a very nice
look it's not so deep and exaggerated as
it was they also point to the tailgate
being a very different look and style
it's kind of like the Big Brother MKT
and it's got this wraparound clamshell
design that the escape does not have now
inside rmk see a lot of familiar lincoln
cues with some modifications you've got
video animated needles on the tack and
spin ometer even though the actual bezel
with the markings is physical my Lincoln
touch is familiar we've seen this system
before it's the four zones that are
communications navigation climate and
media they've had a lot of knocks on
this so let's see how the response is
that was always the big gripe now as you
can see this is a pretty responsive
screen at this point it used to be real
laggy they've moved things along to the
screen and the response to your touches
of it are much more crisp however if you
want to drop back to voice of course
you've got a good system there too
please say a command find an address in
California state a street address
including the city 2:35 2nd Street San
Francisco when ready press the voice
button and then say set his destination
or say changed something very good one
phrase got it right off the bat didn't
have to do a double-take whatsoever
you've also got a lot of knobs and
switches this is cutting back the other
way from the last two model years you
still have detent knobs here these went
away for a while
volume used to be this finger strip that
hated here our little rocker switches
for temperature and fan this is a car
company learning lessons and applying
them the map quality remains really good
on this system it has been for some time
and you've got a whole variety of
options and abilities to tweak this this
is one of the most configurable systems
out there which is part of why they've
had some problems with customer
acceptance there is just almost too many
settings screens like this don't do
anything to instill confidence in people
who are not tech forward I mean how many
people know what dial-up network
settings are for or query on connect
status should be set to this should be
buried like a body out in the desert
outside Vegas the media choices are
familiar AM and FM with HD radio sirius
satellite radio optical disk is still
here you have two USB ports not just one
there is still no native app support in
my Lincoln touch media streaming like
Pandora or tune in will just have to
hitch a ride on the more Universal
bluetooth streaming selection our
vehicle is hotted up with the THX audio
as you can see with these speakers that
are kind of carved up on top of the dash
and the badges everywhere and I always
applaud thx sound this remains perhaps
my favorite sound system on the road
some of the options you've got around
there I'm pleased to say are pretty
simple sound settings can be very
complex this car cuts against the grain
and has a pretty straightforward
surround or not real simple how much
speed compensation do you want and
beyond that standard tone controls bass
mid treble balance and fader I applaud
the relative simplicity of that because
no matter how far you crank it it never
gets out of shape it keeps the ratio of
bass mid-range and treble nicely
measured together it just will not
distort parking tech galore in this
vehicle rear view camera is standard
more than I can say for some of their
imported competitors and it has
trajectory and distance it does not have
different views however but you are able
to zoom in and get a really grainy look
I just leave it where it is but more
interestingly they have the self parking
assist where you operate the pedals it
operates the wheel but this is new it'll
also get you out of a spot using the
same technology which they say is useful
if you get into a spot and then someone
comes later and really boxes you in this
car they say well know how to get out of
that better than you do without scraping
anyone's paint
now of course Lincoln is struggling to
find its place amidst a sea of Japanese
American and German luxury car
this one really goes for a lot of soft
trim really comfortable seats I noticed
that as soon as I got in this guy and
this would tramp I'm still trying to
figure out if it's fake or not it looks
like the real deal as opposed to some
plaster wood so they're taking a lot of
pains to make this car look a cut above
second row knee room is tight if you're
sitting behind a 6-footer butt head and
shoulder room seem pretty generous no
third-row on this car up under the snout
of our MKC is an interesting story it's
not just its engine which is new but
this is also a sneak peek of the new
Mustang engine the 2.3 liter
four-cylinder EcoBoost this is actually
the bigger of the two engines the base
engine on MKC would be a 2-liter
EcoBoost for this of course has 300 cc's
more and makes a lot of it 285
horsepower 305 pound-feet of torque
front wheel drive on the lower engine or
all-wheel drive if you get the 2.3
they're all all-wheel drive like the one
we have here the power always goes out
through a 6-speed automatic in all MKC
configurations now this all-wheel drive
guys all those 4,000 pounds gets to 60
in 7 seconds or so and the mileage is
1826 mpg not bad but it would've been
nice to crack that thirty mark but of
course the bigger engine and the heavier
all-wheel drive vehicle doesn't help
ahead of this engine by the way there
are active grille shutters up here that
will close up at freeway speeds to
improve the aerodynamics when the car
doesn't need that excessive amount of
cooling air also interesting the 2.3
motor has 1,000 pound lower towing
capacity than the 2 liter that's kind of
counterintuitive a bear that in mind if
you're gonna lug something around first
thing you notice on the MKC is this a
nice little engine I'm looking forward
to it in the Mustang where it will
almost certainly have a different tune
but they're off to a good start this is
a nice healthy feeling four cylinder
then it's brought down I think a lot by
its transmission I am NOT a fan of the
transmission programming on this vehicle
to me it's hit the paddle now get a
shift tomorrow
it's an incredibly sleepy gearbox maybe
they did that on purpose to make the car
come
and not jarring but for the market
they're aiming at people who are being
cross shopped across outtie
and some Acuras and infinities that's
not the right thing the sport mode
selector on the transmission can be
configured by you to be sport power
sport handling either or neither it does
hold ships much longer but doesn't seem
to make them any quicker all-wheel-drive
MKC is get a continuously adaptive
suspension impressive stuff in sport
though the handling never gets
aggressive if you want lincoln comfort
the MKC is your huckleberry if you want
an american x3 it ain't buy this car
because you want to arrive refreshed not
so much stimulated the lane departure
tech is calibrated kind of late to my
mind you're already in the other lane
before it does anything and then it does
guide you back in your lane kind of
moderately and it also gives you a stick
shaker it vibrates the wheel the blind
spot techs not so interesting tiny
little indicators on the mirror that I
never even seen the forward collision
technology will give you a bright LED
bar in the windshield there it'll beep
like it's gone nuts and it will pre
charge the brakes so they really clamp
on hard when you jump on them but it
doesn't self brake to a stop the base
price on a 2.3 liter MKC which is always
all-wheel drive and includes adaptive
suspension is a little under 41 I'm
going for the reserved group at a little
under 7000 primarily for the Vista roof
navigation with good voice command blind
spot Tech and the hands-free tailgate
and more tech package is about 2200 for
adaptive cruise forward collision with
brake boost and that in and out parking
assist along with the lane keeping tech
I love thx audio thousand dollars a
no-brainer so we're at just over 51 for
the top-of-the-line MKC
done our way what we end up with here is
a vehicle that slots in between the very
popular Cadillac SRX and of course
outies q5 is a very strong inspiration
for this vehicle too good benchmarks but
Lincoln still has to figure out who they
appeal to that everyone else hasn't
already stayed down
