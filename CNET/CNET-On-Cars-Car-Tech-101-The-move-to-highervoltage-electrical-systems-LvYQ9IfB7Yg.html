exclusively 12 volts direct current to
do just about everything you know it
this is the stuff that comes out of the
cigarette lighter we call the power port
now in your console but it flows all
over your vehicle from taillights to
ignition system sometimes it's converted
to higher voltage for things like high
intensity discharge headlamps but for
the most part this car is a 12-volt
world and that dates back over 60 years
before that it was a six volt world in
many instances but now we're cutting the
other way to higher voltage namely 48
now just as 12 volts is a big increase
in the ability to get things done and do
it efficiently over six volts 48 volts
is multifold improvement over the
current standard yet it remains notably
below the 50 volt DC line that is
generally considered the beginning of
substantial shock risk to humans now the
main motivation for higher voltage is
coming largely from the engine bay
things that used to be driven by these
sloppy parasitic belts off the engine
are now being driven by integral
electric motors I'm talking about things
like power steering pumps air
conditioning compressors and water pumps
that move coolant around the engine you
can drive those by electricity and only
when they're needed as opposed to
constantly tethered to a belt you get
nice efficiencies and you also can
package things a little more tightly in
the engine bay and speaking of
electrifying things several automakers
are considering using new electric
turbochargers which are spun up by an
integral 48 volt motor instead of
bypassing exhaust gases which should
reduce lag make the plumbing more
compact and lower fuel consumption while
creating that additional power it goes
without saying that V's already use
high-voltage like the 375 volt system
that powers a Tesla and you've seen
those orange wire housings inside
electric cars and strong hybrids those
call out the high-voltage runs but those
are currently limited to systems that
turn the wheels not much else but even
if you don't look at a future with
strong hybrids plug-in hybrids and
electric cars the move to 48 volts seems
like it's ready to
happen because it grants so much more
efficiency to even conventional gas
engine cars allows packaging to be much
more flexible which designers love and
takes components that SAP the engine's
rotational energy all the time and
convert them to devices that tax mostly
the electrical system just part of the
time more car tech demystify right now
