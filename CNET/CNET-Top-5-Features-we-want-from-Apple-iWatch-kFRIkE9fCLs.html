understand people are really into the
idea of big high-tech watches maybe was
that square ipod nano or the insane
response to the pebble watch on
Kickstarter or the whole Nike FuelBand
and Fitbit craze whatever it is the hot
rumor right now is the apple is cooking
up their own wrist watch throughout this
year Donal Bell and this top 5 i'm
counting down the must-haves i watch
features that might get me to buy one
starting off at number five
notifications honestly I don't really
want to watch what I want is a way to
obsess over my phone without having to
actually take out my phone and look like
a jerk I want to be able to screen calls
read text messages see upcoming
appointments and I want it to blink them
buzz a lot so that everyone thinks I'm
important number four is a little bit
gross that has got to be sweat resistant
in fact they can make this whole thing
waterproof by going with wireless
charging and sealing the whole thing up
even better all I know is that if this
thing can be undone by a workout or
careless hand-washing it's too fragile
for me I leave my pointless status
symbols to be military grade at number
three connectivity controlling music
playback on my phone or iPod is the
least it can do I want the control Apple
TV airplay speakers keynote
presentations talk to Siri maybe even
turn on the lights of my house now
knowing apple i'll probably get half
those features and then they'll dangle
the other ones out for i watch too and i
watch three which will come in more
colors and be thinner and then they'll
be VI watch mini for the kids I've
suffered this abuse before I know how it
goes coming at number 2 3rd party apps I
don't want this thing to just be a
window onto my phone in my pocket I
wanted to have its own apps and I want
to see what kind of cool things
developers can make maybe some little
teeny tiny games I mean it'll take some
pretty tough design restrictions to keep
designers from going off the rails the
Apple more than anyone else has shown
that they can really crack the whip to
enforce app quality now before we get to
number one let's take a minute to
consider all of the features that the I
watch doesn't need I mean really if this
thing is like an iPhone companion device
why not let the phone in your pocket do
the heavy lifting that means no GPS use
bluetooth 4.0 instead of Wi-Fi or 4g no
headphone jack no pedometer no quad-core
processors and most importantly no
offensively high price I mean who the
hell really needs a SmartWatch make it
low tech with the low price and put the
emphasis on apps and design I mean I
know it's Apple it's not going to be
cheap but don't make me have to explain
dropping four hundred dollars on an
iWatch to my wife it sounds ridiculous
all right and now the number one thing
the apples hypothetical i watch is going
to need if they're going to get people
to reimburse the watch long battery life
and I have enough crap that I need to
charge every day I don't need to add a
watch to the list now Apple has shown
that they can pull off some miraculous
battery life with products like the iPad
but there's no way to cram a giant
battery into something small enough to
fit on your wrist well maybe if it was
like a Nintendo Power glove kind of
thing that would actually be pretty
badass but a solar panel on there for
charging couple laser pointers chick
magnet so there you go those are the
five features an apple iWatch would need
to have to keep me interested but it's
just my opinion and I'm sure you've got
one of your own so hit me up on Twitter
or leave a comment on the top five blog
over at top 5 cnet com also be sure to
check out Scott's lines right up of nine
features he wants from the iWatch I
ripped you off I only gave you five
Donald Bell thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
