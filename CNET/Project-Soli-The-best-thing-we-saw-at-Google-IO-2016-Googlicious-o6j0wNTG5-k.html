Google issues and Google i/o is all
wrapped up but there's plenty of other
cool things that came out from the
sessions after the keynote now some of
the coolest stuff came out of Google's
advanced technologies in product session
known more commonly as Google 8 app
Google and levi-strauss
showed off their latest collaboration
with project jacquard a commuter smart
jacket that will be in beta this fall
with the release plan for next spring
now there is a gesture to tap or swipe
and you'll be able to command different
functions like getting directions or
controlling your music in the left cuff
of the jacket pretty sweet also project
ara Google's modular phone is still
alive and well with the target date of
2017 to consumers that gives them the
user upgradeable handset we've heard
about since 2015 the team found people
didn't want to change core components
like the processor so instead you'll be
able to customize it with modules like
an additional speaker a camera and
eating display and an expanded memory
module it'll be up to third parties to
come up with even more unique add-ons
and it's a bold phone so we'll wait and
see how consumers react to it once it
hits the market and finally project soli
might have shown the biggest potential
for the future of wearables and other
devices
it was showcased last year and it's a
sensing technology that uses miniature
radar to detect touchless gesture
interactions SmartWatch screens are
really too small to do much with them
but with solely your hand can act as a
virtual dial a slider or a button Google
eight app showcased a little bit of what
it can do with a soli chip integrated
into an LG watch and those sorts of the
watch I know I can use a virtual dial
gesture to interact with the
complication
yeah that's bonkers now Deb kits for the
solely platformer in developers hands
and Google already has planned to work
with LG moving forward and really this
is the coolest thing we saw at Google
i/o now Google to our keynote featured a
lot of things we know about Google's
daydream it's their VR headset that's
just a rendering right now with no list
of supported devices and a promo video
with a later this year target we know
what to expect from Android and thanks
to the developer previews and I'm not
switching messaging or video
conferencing apps anytime soon so a
low-end duo didn't do anything for me
but Google home was my favorite directly
taking on the Amazon echo with its
unique design and color options but if
you really want to take this to the next
level
go with like a variety of scents like
Hawaiian breeze or clean linens you've
already got the air freshener design
really nailed down now Google's voice
technology can make this special but
they don't actually have a product out
there's no price and we've only heard
later this year home has the potential
to be better than the echo but the echo
has already built a strong family of
third-party partners and it's only
getting bigger plus the saddest part of
this is the family that talks to home
more than they talk to each other hey
Google has my package shipped yes it's
already shipped ok Google how many stars
are in our galaxy well if there are
about 100 to 400 billion stars according
to space.com all right outside of i/o
Google's password killing project abacus
will start testing in banks this summer
it was announced last year and the idea
is that humans are bad at remembering
their passwords which is true but they
are good at being themselves
abacus analyzes how you type how you
speak and combines that with other
signals from the sensors in your phone
it basically is constantly paying
attention to who you are that doesn't
sound like it could go wrong at all it
then calculates that you are who you say
you are creating a trust score a new
trust score API is what Google wants to
put in developers hands now it's up to
this test trial and developers to see if
it's reliable and secure enough to
replace PIN codes passwords and
fingerprint logins and finally Google
has
a new sticky technology to protect
pedestrians in case they get struck by
one of Google's self-driving cars the
granted patent is for a sticky adhesive
layer on the front side of the car that
would adhere to a pedestrian
instantaneously and help prevent them
from being flung into other vehicles or
other debris yes you would physically
stick to a Google car if you were hit by
one
now there's an eggshell like layer
covering the adhesive that would protect
the sticky surface during everyday
driving but shatter in an accident to
reveal the glue the patent also could be
applied to non self-driving cars but I
really included this story because I
like the drawings all right that's gonna
do it for this week you can email us at
Google is just at cnet.com or tweet me
at brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for some
more of that Google ishes Google ishes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
