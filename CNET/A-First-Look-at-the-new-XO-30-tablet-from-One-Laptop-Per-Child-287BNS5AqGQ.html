we're here at CES 2012 I have with me
ed McNerney chief tech officer of OLPC
that's one laptop per child Ed's here to
show the exo 3.0 right okay Edie take us
through why this tablet is special and
why I should care about it well you
should care about it because our mission
of providing education to kids around
the world wherever they can get it is is
really important to us and should be
important to everybody the exo three
tablet is an 8 inch tablet comes in a
waterproof case it's actually waterproof
itself but the case keeps things out of
it and it's a tablet that's designed for
education it's designed for small kids
and it's designed to be fun and have a
good time with it
what exactly are you expecting kids to
do with the tablet well we're building
on the work that we've done with our xo1
tap laptop computers which we've got
about two and a half million of those
absolutely like they're they're designed
to be you know something that you enjoy
and it's comfortable sure something the
kids keep coming back to all the time
right but we've built not only the
hardware but you know we really focus on
open source software and hardware so all
the educational content and all the
educational tools that we've developed
over the past are available on the
tablet as well one of things we care
about is low power and low cost and this
technology uses marvels our motto 610
processor family we're actually using
that in our laptops as well okay so we
have a very low-power laptop and a very
low-power tablet
what about please speak a little bit to
the software that it's actually running
I heard it's running Linux it does run
Linux our software is all open even the
firmware is open our microphone port is
actually a DC sensor input port so you
can put a thermometer you put electrical
measurements can actually build
experiments and do that kind of stuff
with so you really your give really
giving kids like a canvas to kind of
experiment and kind of try different
things and just see what happens that's
on the career that's that's a really
good example because one of the things
that we do with the tablet we've done
with our laptops too is provide a lot of
tools to teach kids how to do
programming okay
right and debug programming Wow because
we there's a lot of evidence that says
that when you're programming it's a lot
like learning about learning can you
speak a little bit I've heard these have
like some unique ways of charging the
tablet we do yeah
so can you show that a little bit sure I
can take one of the things that we do is
our charging port here is really unique
in that in a tablet industry we can take
anything between 10 volts 25 volts
varying power anything that you can
generate out there in the world we demo
that with our hand crank it's it's kind
of a fun demo I wouldn't want to use
this as my primary power source every
day nothing else maybe I maybe as a
fallback this is a 4 watt solar panel
okay okay the tablet used about 2 watts
so you leave this out on the Sun for an
hour and it can produce enough juice to
run this for 2 hours we've got a big fat
standard USB port Ethernet sneakernet is
really important where where we go okay
and everybody's got thumb drives they
got to stick into a full size port so we
gave them a full size port we've got the
microphone and and headphone ports yeah
we talked about as well as the USB micro
USB on-the-go port so you can put in
those kind of peripherals you can also
connect to devices to each other
yeah allow some new opportunities there
like if there's like a lot of our users
you know consumers that they're you know
normal consumers - they'd be interested
in buying this is that possible could
they I know we don't sell these we don't
even manufacture them okay we're weird
we're a little different from everybody
so we we design the product we bring
them you know get them ready to go we
work with a manufacturing partner to do
that and then we then look to the
countries and the organizations that
have purchased the products in the past
and say ok they've got a pull and say
yes we want to do that we don't build up
big warehouses full of tablets and hope
somebody buys them right Thank You ed
thanks for bringing this by that was the
