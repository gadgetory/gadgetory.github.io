the power of the Safari you I into this
single bar and that means you have more
space for your content now of course you
may wonder what happened to my favorites
bar well of course you can bring that
back if you want to but you're somebody
you don't really need to because now
you're smart search field when you click
it shows you all of your favorites right
there and it's also really great for
search so in addition when you type to
getting your smart search suggestions
you also get spotlight suggestions right
there in your completion menu and this
means you can get it things faster than
ever before now Safari it's also more
powerful than ever with sharing so now
if you want to subscribe to an RSS feed
on the site you can do that right here
and those RSS feed articles will show up
right in your Safari sidebar under
shared links and you can also share two
people more quickly than ever because
Safari lists the people you've messaged
with most recently and with just one
click you can share a web page now
Safari is better than ever as well with
tabs we now have a tab view that gives
you a bird's eye glance of all of your
tabs and its tax tabs from sites just
like this so you get individual stacks
for each site that you're browsing
Safari is also great when it comes to
privacy Safari was the first browser to
introduce private browsing and now it's
easier than ever because you can create
a new private window and when you do all
the content within that window and all
its tabs stay private and all of your
other windows are unaffected it's really
handy now Safari is great when it comes
to standards it has WebGL now for super
fast 3d graphics speedy for efficient
networking and HTML premium video now
this enables modern max to efficiently
stream video from sites like Netflix
without a plug-in and the results are
awesome if you get up to two hours
longer
battery life on a MacBook Air streaming
netflix and that's for 1080p video now
Safari has been set the benchmark really
for energy efficiency since Mavericks
and its lead here continues when it
comes to multi-tab browser energy
efficiency Safari is without equal when
it comes to the kind of you I
manipulations that are typical and web
apps Safari is faster than ever and how
about JavaScript will take the most
complex kind of JavaScript it's typical
very rich web applications well Safari
now has a fourth tier llvm based
optimized JavaScript compiler that is
the fastest of any major browser and
when it comes to typical website
JavaScript safari is in a league of its
own so that is Safari and to give you a
quick demo I'd like to bring up
brian.krall to the stage let's give them
a big welcome Brian thanks
I'm really happy to be here today so I'm
just going to dive right into Safari
here we go it's really great and when
you go to a website you can really
appreciate the new design it's simpler
and it's even more powerful I can open
up the sidebar really easily to get at
my bookmarks my reading list as well as
my shared links and when I click into
the search field I get instant access to
all my favorite sites it's really nice
so I'm going to go ahead and type in a
search for Ansel Adams there we go and
if I can return I could just go to a
regular old google search but since
Ansel Adams is a common search term I
get this new spotlight suggestion there
at the top it has a snippet of
information from wikipedia i could read
it there or if I like I could go ahead
and see the entire article right on the
Wikipedia site it's super convenient now
if you use tabs you're going to love
this now no matter how many tabs i have
open i can smoothly scroll through them
to get at any of that tab i'm looking
for it's really nice so now sometimes I
want to see my tabs so i can go ahead
and do this and i'll click on the new
tab view button and there you go a
beautiful birds eye view of all my open
tabs so i'm going to go ahead and select
this one here it's a photo blog with a
bunch of pictures of Yosemite and
there's a couple good ones of El Capitan
down below so I'll find them there I'll
cup of 10 and then I'm going to choose
this one I want to share it with Craig
something to get the high-res image now
sharing couldn't be easier in Safari I
just simply click on the share button
here and now i can use the new recent
recipients feature to dress it to craig
and here we go and just one click i'm
ready to send that image
it's that easy so but before I send it
I'm going to add my two cents to this so
i can go here and we have just the right
feature called mark up now with markup i
can edit this image without ever even
leaving mail it's really great so what
I'm going to do is annotate this image
with a nice a magnifying glass of loop
so as you move it around you can see
that it magnifies everything underneath
it so I'm going to place it right here
and it turns out that those two specs on
the big granite face there there are
actually climbers it's kind of crazy so
I'm going to zoom in a little more so
you can see it better there we go so I
can zoom nicely in place it here now i
want to point this out to Craig in the
mail and I can use my trackpad to draw
on the image so I'm going to go ahead
and draw an arrow here there we go and
you notice markups smart enough to
recognize the arrow and make it really
pretty so now now it's really easy to
add a comment so check out the climbers
there we go now I can have a little fun
with this so I'm going to go ahead and
create a cartoon bubble okay not so good
at drawing but markups going to help me
there we go so luckily it can clean it
up it's better than I am so now I can
add a caption and so i think i'm going
to appeal to the inner developer and all
of us i'm going to type in I hope the
Rope is wait for it multi-threaded
yeah okay so I think I've done enough to
this picture time to go so now it's
ready for me to mail and I can just
click like that so that's how easy it is
to mark up an image in mail so those are
a couple of great new features in safari
and mail thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
