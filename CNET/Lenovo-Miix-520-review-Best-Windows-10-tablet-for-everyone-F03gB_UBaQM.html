mid-range surface pro clone with the mix
510 so instead of scrapping the thing
entirely and starting fresh it kept a
design and made a couple of tweaks to
just make the whole thing better and
called it the mix 5:20 let's start with
the design though again it's essentially
unchanged from the 510 which means it's
pretty much identical to the old surface
Pro for the built-in kickstand is nice
and strong and uses lenovo's watchband
hinges that give you a big positioning
range you might still find it awkward to
use on your lap though and in general I
just throw it over a cross-leg to
balance it out lenovo includes its
magnetic keyboard and it's active pen
too with the tablet so you're ready to
go out of the box the backlit keyboard
in general I like the key travel is good
considering how thin the cover is but
there's definitely some bounce to it
when you're typing its touchpad is on
the small side which could be
frustrating but there is a 12 point 2
inch touchscreen right in front of you
the screen has a 1920 by 1200 resolution
so it's not as sharp as a 4k display but
I never felt like I was missing out for
a casual sketching or taking notes the
bundled act of pen 2 is great but
creatives who need a screen with
accurate colors will probably want to
pass regardless also while the display
gets reasonably bright you'll probably
have trouble using it outside on one
side of the screen are the power and
volume buttons and a combo headphone mic
jack and on the other side are USB C and
USB a 3.0 ports and the power jack the
USB C port is in Thunderbolt 3 but you
can connect up a dock for video output
in peripherals what's a bit of an
annoyance though is that lenovo's pin
storage solution is this little plastic
piece that not only ties up your USB
port but partially blocks the power jack
in USB C port what's new is in
sigh 1/8 gen intel core i5 processor the
new chip along with its other components
gave the system a noticeable bump in
multi-core performance on our benchmarks
but just felt snappier overall and along
with the improved performance you'll get
slightly better battery life we got 6
hours and 27 minutes in our streaming
video test but you'll definitely hear
the fans blowing when they're under a
heavy load so while it's not perfect
between the performance improvements and
the overall features you get a really
good mid-range package for around $1,000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
