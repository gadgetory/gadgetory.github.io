redid the Jeep Cherokee
bring it back with a completely new face
an interesting new transmission a very
different sort of powerplant and
orientation let's find out if change is
good now the niche Araki goes up against
Ford Escape onto CRV and Hyundai Tucson
and remember this is a unibody car they
haven't done body-on-frame since the
early 80s on a Cherokee or Liberty so
get over that and keeping with its
modern routes it's available front-wheel
drive all wheel drive or real gutsy
four-wheel drive there's a difference
now spotting a Cherokee you don't need
my help nothing looks like that this is
the most dramatic styling departure in
the history of the Jeep brand and a
rather controversial by the way these
are not the headlights they print as
such but these are your turn signals and
markers the headlights are down here
basically in the bumper the fog lights
below that now the first thing you're
going to notice in this new Cherokee is
nothing in the dash it's under your butt
these seats are really comfortable in an
era when car seats and if you noticed
airline seats are getting harder and
harder these are super soft you just
never see that anymore and it's it's
kind of cool
now the first thing I look for after I
get comfy in here is do they keep doing
that ww2 Jeep theme and as you can see
they don't this is a very urban sleek
interface the only two things that call
back to their heritage are a tiny little
embossed since 1941 down here and the
oddest thing look up there at the bottom
of the windshield it's a little
silhouette cut out like almost like an
Easter Egg it's so small of a jeep going
over a rock I think they realize that
that ww2 stuff may as well be war of
1812 for the audience they're targeting
here now to the main event the 8.4 inch
Chrysler UConnect head unit this is an
outstanding interface and we feel that
way every time we run across it it's
simple I believe now the touch response
is faster than ever you hit that screen
it responds right now very quick which
is more than just a nicety that's how
you end up getting quick in and out of
the screen and not being distracted now
all the great media sources are here
that you care about iPod or bluetooth
streaming both with good if not perfect
metatag
way notice that CD is optional on this
car and we don't even have it on this
one you can add it for like two hundred
bucks but they're starting to say forget
it
you don't need anymore now the
navigation systems right the best place
to get a feel for why this thing wins
Awards in JD Power surveys for ease of
use this is simple and clear and clean
where things fall down is when you go to
the voice command button and it's much
less intuitive notice address sorry I
didn't get that you can say things like
destination 1 Main Street Detroit
Michigan
or find nearest gas stations cancel so
on some screens you say what's on the
screen on other screens you say what's
on the screen and it doesn't know what
you're talking about that's a weird mix
of expectations that is not good UI and
then when you get to this you connect
apps logo you can go to the you connect
store starts to get confusing here but
it's powered by 3G which is built in
that I applaud but it's 3G that I don't
applaud forget it it takes forever and
then you get a disconnect notice take my
word for it once you get in there
there's a $20 fee telematics app that
lets you access and control your car but
oddly enough Yelp is baked into this
unit without any extra technology so
it's a weird hodgepodge now aside from
this big boy right here which by the way
comes with or without navigation that is
an optional extra to this you've also
got a really nice color LCD between the
gauges again something kind of special
in a Jeep I like how it's full bleed it
goes right out to the curved edges of
the speedo on the tech they really
utilize that area in there is a whole
variety of vehicle information screens
and it's highly configurable down to
absurdities like deciding what goes in
the upper left and upper right corner
and how you want your gear position
displayed but I guess choice is better
than none last thing I want to show you
in here are the drive controls now one
choice only 9-speed automatic we'll talk
a little bit more about that wiggle up
to the engine bay right adjacent to that
because we have a trailhawk which is the
most trail ready a multiple terrain
response controller you've also got the
ability to do some pretty serious crawl
in this guy down to a 50
6 2 1 crawl ratio and because this guy's
a real four-wheel drive not just an
all-wheel drive you've got a four-wheel
drive low mode and you've got rear lock
now under the hood this is part of the
indication that we're in modern Jeep age
the engine right off the bat MultiAir
2.4 liter sidesaddle inline-four that by
default just drags the rear ends around
in front-wheel drive configuration
MultiAir is Fiats hydraulically driven
technology for variable valve event
control now the numbers on this engine
are 184 horsepower 171 foot-pounds of
torque but it gets there without any
clever tricks notice I didn't mention
any turbos you don't see any here and
there is no direct injection on this car
it uses kind of old-school 1980s ish
multi-port fuel injection so nothing
tricky here in full four wheel drive
locking drivetrain trim as this one is
you just barely tip two tons in weight
zero to sixty a little under nine
seconds mpg and four-wheel-drive is
twenty one twenty eight go front-wheel
drive you get up to twenty to thirty one
now the gearing all this hooks up to as
I mentioned one choice only 9 speed
automatic no paddles instead they use
the back of the wheel for audio controls
interesting the top four gears top four
of that transmission are all overdrive
I've never seen that before and this is
they say the only four-wheel-drive
crossover they can unlock the rear and
freewheel it when not needed for fuel
efficiency let's see what all comes
together on the road
okay the good news on this Cherokee is
that the engine note is quite nice and
the ride quality is quite nice and as I
mentioned nice comfy seat so things get
off to a really good start but you know
my little trick when I first drive a car
that comes into seen that first thing I
do is do no research and drive it for an
hour or two and try and guess what's
under the hood and underneath the
chassis and this one I thought had a CVT
transmission in fact it's a 9 speed
automatic as we now know that's no
complement to the automatic this thing
is kind of slippery and vague and
wandering therefore taking what is
already a small engine for the package
and putting it at a further disadvantage
I just don't like driving this vehicle
there's enough power there but not
responsiveness
okay let's price our 2014 Jeep Cherokee
trailhawk
basically top-of-the-line with real
four-wheel drive with locking and low
range 30,500 with the 2.4 liter for that
as you can tell I'm not hugely fond of
so I've got to drive that v6 before I
make any other move in the showroom and
that'll add 1,500 now the options to go
CNET style the big one is the tech
package for 2200 bucks you get adaptive
cruise control including stop and go
brake assist Auto high beams blind spot
and cross traffic technology lane
departure warning you get the idea 1900
for the convenience package that
includes automatic temperature control
headlights and turn themselves off and
on a rear camera you want that power
liftgate power driver's seat only and
remote start navigation as I mentioned
is an $800 add-on to that you connect
head unit CD player 195 bucks you can
upgrade the audio for 400 to add more
speakers and better amps add a dual pane
glass sunroof for 1400 now you're at
around 37 for all in stilwell shy of 40
grand for a vehicle that you got to give
it credit has some real off-road skills
my downside as you can imagine is that
powertrain at least with this engine
I find driving it to be a mixed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
