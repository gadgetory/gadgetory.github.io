here at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show
and 2017 promises to be a very cool year
for those of us that love rear-wheel
drive convertibles that's right I am
talking about the 2017 Fiat 124 spider
if you don't recognize that good thing
when they thought in the new fourth
generation Mazda mx-5 but here they've
given us a 1.4 liter turbocharged
four-cylinder which is good for 160
horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque
now those of you that are keeping a
score yes that is more than the mx-5 but
it's just right about in line with the
Fiat Abarth
powers going to the rear wheels via a
six-speed manual transmission or a
6-speed automatic and unfortunately this
is not the same six-speed as in the mx-5
so we can't wait to get our hands on it
to see if Fiat has been able to give us
the same crisp short throws that we've
come to expect in a small convertible
roadster now on lookers surely are not
going to confuse the 124 spider for the
mx-5 as the sheet metal is quite
different it really has a throwback more
to the original 1966 versions the
headlights have definitely a more
rounded appearance to them as well as
the horizontal oval grille in the centre
and the rear I've just got a modern take
of the rectangular simple taillights
from the 1960s
of course it's what's under the sheet
metal that makes this car fun to drive
the thing that's got the same multi-link
setup in the rear as well as a double
wishbone suspension in the front as the
mx-5 and it has an electric power
steering system set up and Fiat chose to
keep it simple using the same manual
soft top as the mx-5 the interior of the
124 spider is pretty much a carbon copy
of the mx-5 safer a couple of fiat
badging it uses the same seven-inch
touchscreen with blind spot monitoring
and rear cross-traffic alerts no pricing
has been announced yet but we expect to
see this little baby in showrooms in the
summer of 2016 so mark your calendar
