within Android and that people will be
really excited about VR being one of
those things you know getting your VR
headset and we felt that we could do a
lot at the platform layer to make dr
really shine on android other things
include you know increased productivity
you know Multi multi window being able
to have two windows side by side two
apps side by side I also think there's
there's something to be said about just
the base usability that the the how good
the experience feels the base sort of
operating system and that's something
we've continued to focus on the idea is
to allow you to very quickly flip
between applications so if you just
double tap reasons it's going to bring
you to the last application you're in so
in this case double tap i was in gmail
and then let's imagine in gmail and I
want to like create an event and I'm
emailing my friend and I want to go back
and forth between calendar what calendar
was the last application I used before
they're so if I just DoubleTap recents
it flips back into calendar and I can
check you know am I free come back to
the email app I can start writing an
email I start coordinating and I'm like
oh actually let me take you another day
flip back now another area that we have
improved productivity landis
notifications so the idea is that you
can actually reply to a message from
right within the notification shade
without leaving and having to launch the
application so here I have a message I
just literally right but press the reply
button type in a quick message here and
press go bad that you can now actually
modify head notifications are shown so
if I long press a notification like so I
now get an option and I can say hey only
show this notification silently or block
all notifications of this type in future
so allows you to be much more control of
your own notifications and we've added a
support for unicode 9 and low G and what
that does is first of all is it gives
you access to much more sort of
human-looking characters to start with
like so but also we also support a skin
tone very end so i can put long press
this and pick different tones for the
skin
basically if it's sweet and tasty I like
it you know that's basically how it
works for me the idea behind the naming
contest is we just think it's a really
fun thing to do yeah I well I like
Nutella I think it's great my daughter
is a huge Nutella fan too but you know
we'll see what's a contest and we'll see
how it all plays out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
