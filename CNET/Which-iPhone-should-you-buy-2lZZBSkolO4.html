so if you were shopping for an iPhone
you just got the new one that's not the
case anymore Apple actually has a ton of
iPhones for sale and right now there
were three new ones that are out pretty
much at the same time the 8 the 8 plus
and the 10 if you're looking for one
here's how to keep track of them and
decide which one to get note that a lot
of the features are the same under the
hood but you're paying up for a lot of
different bells and whistles I don't
like buying a car
iPhone 8 budget choice where is it the
iPhone 8 is the basic model car with the
standard options no extra frills but at
$6.99 it's still not a low-cost phone
the eight has better system speed and
some improved camera quality over the
iPhone 7 and it also works with a
variety of wireless chargers like the 8
+ and 10 do but its older look isn't
exciting it's a fine phone but a boring
one nice to hold but a smaller screen
are you ok with that
pick this the 8 gets you in the door on
future proofing but it's not the best
choice the iPhone 8 plus is the comfort
pick for those who don't want change
don't feel great about a new interface
or face ID for your phone prefer
fingerprint sensors and a home button
the 8 plus saves a bit of money versus
the iPhone 10 is still just as fast and
has many of the best camera features
intact and the familiar rectangular
screen of the iPhone 8 plus is still the
best for watching videos without the
pillar box compromises of the taller
iPhone 10 display which does have that
notch to landscape mode on the 8 plus
offers some extra features that the 10
doesn't have either male notes and some
other apps put it to use just understand
this could be the last big screen iPhone
with the old home button design if you
like the old feel but want the best of
what's new under the hood dive right in
the iPhone 10 is the future phone and
it's also the super expensive phone it's
the best iPhone of the year mainly
because it introduces features that will
be around in future iPhones and has the
best size to screen ratio it feels right
but you're paying a tax on the future
the longer edge to edge screen is better
but not necessarily immediately
noticeable to the casual eye for many
apps that still aren't optimized the
camera is the best but the lower light
improvements and the extra portrait mode
selfie features may not be worth you
upgrading its battery life is good but
the 8 plus battery is better 10 has a
different way to swipe to things that
sometimes is great and other times feels
like a lot of getting used to
and then there's face ID it works but
when it sometimes doesn't it can
quickly unlocking the phone feel
frustrating future iPhones will nail
down the interface and improve face ID
you could wait or if you're ready to
show off and you have the money go for
it it's got a lot to love if you want an
iPhone but want to save some money
remember that Apple is still selling the
2015 and 2016 iPhones at better prices
than ever and if you want the most
compact and affordable iPhone of all
definitely consider the iPhone se it's
an older smaller phone but it only cost
$350 and works just fine just know that
it when it comes to the iPhone now there
isn't one definitive iPhone for everyone
like a lot of Apple's products it's a
spectrum you have to get used to that
after shopping for an iPhone in 2017 for
weight or pick something else
