cnn.com I'm here in New Jersey at main
gear headquarters I don't really know
how a computer gets made so I'm here at
their warehouse to find out how a
computer gets built how its ordered how
its water-cooled overclocked painted
we're going to learn all about this
right now
let's get to it so this is the nerdery
so this is where the magic happens our
inspiration comes from the automotive
world
so we you'll see the colors and you'll
see the mechanic carts which I'll show
you right now even the way the facility
is very neatly kept we like to work in
an environment where we're inspired
where provide inspiration so the guys
that work here they will probably be
doing stuff in their basement if they
weren't doing it as a profession so pay
him to do it exactly so do I look at the
the venting even that has like this
strange like detail to it right like a
car so people place in order all the
stuff goes into the bins right so it
gets kidded once it gets gets kid gets
assigned sweats technician technician
will build it from beginning to end okay
that's just the building part a second
technician will go and inspect the build
they'll both sign off on the sheet okay
and that's when it'll go to the
configurator we also have a lot of
customization that we can do in-house if
they want like a game character let edge
down the system we have those
capabilities in-house we're actually the
first to do it long long time ago you
could see the level of detail that we
can put into these edges and this is
just a regular one panel people think is
that like you know it's like a drawing
or something where I know it's on it's
like tattooed metal this is literally a
down Josh Bray booth oh just like a body
shop instead of having cars we have
computers in here we bake them like like
they bake the cars you actually have to
bake the paint after after you lay down
and reason why we decided to do it
ourselves
it's because of quality control I am the
most annoying car person you know like
like you know like I brought my car to
body shops before and they're like walls
we just can't you just can't work with
you man you like you Jeff yeah it's
difficult like it has to be perfect man
if it's
perfect you know just like my cars have
to be perfect and so this is my computer
case so this is a this is our epic force
this model we launched it to really show
our craftsmanship really showed our
capabilities in-house that we can do on
a production level this system is built
as if you're building it yourself
imagine you spent like you know two
months researching right one month
building that's the system right here
okay when you order Ferrari you can
actually order the color of the car
right but you can order the color of the
stitching this dish you love the record
and same same idea here you can get you
know exactly what you want how you want
very cool each system gets individual
attention right so we're cutting these
tubes to length so make sure that our
cabling looks amazing
purpose then just to have it look hot
that's it its aesthetics yes yes with
most manufacturers use an all-in-one
little cooling system okay um they're
very reliable the system here is
actually empty but where I said extra
large reservoir and that's just like a
big old bong in your computer exactly
that's what I'm seeing that's I wonder
who came up with that idea now so what
are we dealing with in terms of cost for
this guy like how much does this one Oh
in this case here you're talking about a
fire like 10 12 grand
all right we learned a lot today how a
computer gets built how it gets painted
water cooled and overclocked enough of
that let's use this to test some games
