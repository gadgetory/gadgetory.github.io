film cartridges but it's a video format
that apparently never died and now Kodak
is staging a comeback this is the modern
take on the super 8 we saw it last year
as a prototype at CES and now this is
the living breathing model that will
make film purists drool and will be
available in stores beautiful retro
design that looks especially sharp in
person and sounds even better on
recording that's because it uses the old
8 millimeter cartridges hence the
namesake that need to be developed in a
studio or in this case with Kodak which
is included as part of the service you
mail in the cartridge then it's
developed processed and scanned into
digital files that are downloadable from
the Kodak darkroom website you even get
your developed films sent back the
camera itself does have a few upgrades
for starters it uses a foldable LCD
display as a viewfinder and it tracks
audio on an SD card slot with a slew of
modern ports to plug into an external
monitor it comes with a wide-angle lens
but you can use any old c-mount lens
from other brands via third-party
adapter and though it does have its
downsides there's something satisfying
about pressing record on this camera and
hearing the snapping of the film that
you don't get on digital and the effect
on a screen is like a retro Instagram
filter that will transport you a few
decades back the super 8 will be
available in two editions a limited
edition in grey which will be more
expensive or the standard edition in
black or white</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
