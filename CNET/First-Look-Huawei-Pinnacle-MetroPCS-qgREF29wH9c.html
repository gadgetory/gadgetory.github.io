the huawei pinnacle for metropcs this is
a future phone for them and I think it
looks pretty good especially because
it's got the circular motif here and it
also has these bright red accents but of
course the most important thing with the
phone isn't how it looks it's what you
can do with it so as a feature phone
this has all of the basics calendar
alarm clock but it also has a few other
apps besides mostly thanks to metropcs
and the apps that they put on all of
their phones so with them you've got
email you of course have a web browser
you also have hooks into social networks
like Twitter and Facebook other apps on
here to include a music player and
there's that 1.3 megapixel camera on the
back that also has a camcorder built
into it however frankly the photos are
pretty bad so I would really only use it
if you absolutely need to or to take a
photo for photo ID another interesting
tidbit about the camera is that you
can't actually open it from the
on-screen controls you have to press and
hold a button on the keyboard which can
take a little bit of time sluggishness
overall was a little bit of a problem
with this phone so you have to have a
little patience especially if you're
going to use any Internet feature this
is not one of metropcs as LTE phones so
you will be riding on a 2.5 g network
now I did mention that it has a qwerty
keyboard and after a while I got pretty
comfortable with it but at first it
didn't feel like the most comfortable
keyboard I had ever seen spacing is
pretty good but just had a little bit of
a bulbous feel underneath my fingertips
but overall I could use it quite well
one other little quirky perk you can do
with the phone is actually make folders
sort of the way that you can with iOS
and with Android I haven't found much
use for it but I love that I can do it
pricing is another positive point here
it's about twenty dollars after a
mail-in rebate retail is only fifty
dollars which is really good for buying
a phone off contract so overall I'd say
that this is a good choice that I would
recommend for somebody looking for
something a little bit me on the basics
but who doesn't want a smartphone I'm
