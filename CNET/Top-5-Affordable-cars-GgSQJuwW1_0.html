CNET's
highest rated car in the last year and a
lot of you wrote in and said that's
great how about something I can afford
coolly a BMW i8 isn't exactly in the
budget I hear ya I'm Brian Cooley with a
very different top 5 but along the same
lines top 5 affordable cars as rated by
scenic this is not an exhaustive list of
the entire category but it covers cars
reviewed by Cena in the last year that
came in under 25 grand with destination
charge and got really great scores from
us that means at least four stars or an
8.0 with one exception you'll see you
can find cheaper cars by the way but
they don't hit the top scores that we
give I figured you wanted the good stuff
so let's go I'm gonna rank these based
on that see net score but filtering in
the MSRP to new ones it a bit number
five the Ford Fiesta ST not quite an 8.0
score you'll notice but close enough to
it for one of the hottest hatches on the
market right now about 200 horsepower
and 200 pound feet of torque from a
little engine that delivers 26 35 mpg
that's great and equipped with wheels
suspension and torque vectoring that are
all geared for the curves it's the
cheapest way to show up at Auto cross
and have the right gear number for the
Mazda mx-5 you know it as the Miata
easily the car that I would most want to
drive on an ice road though not of
course if that road leads to Costco the
Miata just sneaks in under our price cut
and even then it leaves out Bluetooth
and USB unless you upgrade so buy some
earbuds and realize you're in a great
handling fun shifting happy revving open
top icon for under 25 grand and bring
something bigger to Costco number three
is the Subaru Legacy even a bass legacy
has their great symmetrical all-wheel
drive that's a big plus and it's the
only car on our list that has all the
wheels driven Subaru is not normally a
cabin tech leader to be diplomatic but
their system gave us less to complain
about than last year and they distracted
us from its shortcomings with their
quite nice optional eyesight technology
that handles driver assist well and
again comes in at a nice price point
choose the Mini Cooper hardtop the
classic mini now they have one less
cylinder in the engine this generation
but more power than they had with more
cylinders the Mini connected
infotainment platform is much improved
now it taps much of the latest
generation of BMW idrive design rather
than tapping the first generation you
either love the look of a mini or wish
it's trite ode to the dot-com era would
just go away
but know that its iconic shape is now
much roomier than it was last year
before I get you to number one a couple
cars I want to give an honorable mention
to first of all you get the GMC Canyon
it misses the cut on our score
requirement by just a little bit but
it's a real pickup in a small package
that drives like a car and is far from
the bottom in terms of cabin tech and I
got to tip my hat of course to the VW
GTI it missed the cut on cost by about
600 bucks but it scored a list topping
8.2 score thanks to great driving
dynamics good cabin design and not bad
technology our number one car on the
list is so strongly the Mazda mazda3
it's the cheapest car on the list and
it's the only one that got an editor's
choice from our reviewers it's fun the
drive has a choice of manual or
automatic transmission you've got
Pandora stitcher aha modern apps and the
- even a little head-up display that
pops up though it's a bit like something
out of a cereal box
still this is your bargain choice and
knowing Mazda likely built to stay that
way or top five lists to wait the car
lever go to see net on cars comm click
on top five
