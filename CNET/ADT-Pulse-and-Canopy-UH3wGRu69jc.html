CES I met att's booth they've got a
whole bunch of things to announce at the
show today
so the first set has to do with 82 pulse
home security system there's a couple
announcements there vs. are integrating
voice control in the home next start
tying into a McAfee service that will
let you track digital devices so if you
lose your phone you can tie into ADT
Pulse finally for pulses integration
with Ford there you'll be able to use
your voice to talk to your ATT home
automation system through your car it's
pretty cool it's a nice kind of remote
control feature so all those things are
part of pulse which is an existing
system that 80 of these had the market
for a while on the newer front for ADT
is its new canopy app which gives you
sort of a live monitoring service you
can take with you on the go an update to
that is called chaperone and a newer
front for ADT is its canopy app and the
base level for this program you can look
at a map see where your friends and
family are talk to them securely it's
pretty handy if you want to upgrade to
the chaperone service you get live
monitoring from ADT's monitoring service
if you were walking through dangerous
neighborhood you can call the service
and say hey I'm feeling a little shaky
around here they'll kind of hang out
with you as you're walking through and
you know you'll be safe and have some
help close at hand if you need it so I'm
rich brown and we're here at att's booth
talking about pulse canopy and chaperone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
