google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show now a few
weeks ago we talked about how Google
Glasses moved on from there Google's
advanced technology and Projects
Division to be their own group well now
it's project tangos turn Google's 3d
mapping smartphone and tablet hardware
is moving into their own home within
Google's walls now project tango tracks
the 3d motion of the device and then
creates a 3d model of the environment
around it 200 prototype dev kits are
planning to be distributed in March to
developers and they also plan to build
4,000 tablets for some developers
sometime in June also Android hit a
historic landmark recently with the
announcement from strategy analytics
that they have sold 1 billion
smartphones worldwide in 2014 thanks to
key growth in China now globally Android
holds a dominating eighty-one percent of
the market Apple sits at fifteen percent
and Microsoft's at three now you know
there may be a billion Android devices
on the market but how many people have
actually even upgraded to lollipop well
it's taken a while for the rollout to
happen across all devices with plenty
still waiting like the HTC One m8 and m7
but finally there has been enough
progress for lollipop to show up on
Google's developer dashboards page with
a tiny one point six percent share of
the current android install base see
lollipop didn't even show up on the dev
page until recently just showing you how
weak the adoption rate has really been
alright Google now is getting a whole
lot more love with the addition of now
cards from some of your favorite apps 40
apps will now be able to give you a
glance of the latest information to be
aware of ranging from music
recommendations on apps like pandora
completing a language lesson from
duolingo or places to stay in the area
on air B&amp;amp;B ok no one likes ads I know
you don't accept advertisers and the
most common plug-in to help you with
this is adblock but it may not be so
helpful in the near future after the
Financial Times reports that google
along with other tech giants like amazon
and Microsoft have reached a deal with
adblock plus to prevent the service from
blocking ads on their websites now add
block has roughly 50 million active
monthly users of the service and no
dollar figures released for the terms of
these deals smaller sites were able to
take advantage of a special service to
allow people to still see ads on their
sites for free but for Google and others
it cost an undisclosed fee alright
Samsung has apparently released some
invites out to their first unpacked
event of 2015 the invites first appeared
on Vietnamese site tint a and haven't
officially been released according to
Samsung just yet but if this is real the
sneak peek shows off a dramatically
curved edge and reminds us of some of
the concepts of phones we saw at CES
over two years ago but one thing we're
pretty sure will see the galaxy s6 in
fact we may have already seen it after
these pics leaked from phoneArena
showcase what could potentially be the
design of the essex in three different
colors that match up with the rumors of
a metal edge and a glass back it's a
safe look to be sure and very iPhone 4
and five ish on the back but it also
matches up pretty decently with the
galaxy s6 cases we've seen that are
currently on sale right now on web sites
like Amazon and just in case you weren't
sure what direction LG will be going in
next for their smart phone line the
Korean company just trademarked names
for six years worth of flagship phones
with the LG g4 g5g six g7 g8 and can you
guess the next one the g9c you really
are smart now they're not even a
guarantee they will stick with this
naming of their gadgets but better safe
than sorry in case the next iPhone is
called the LG g4 alright that's going to
do it for this week's show you can
always email us at google issues at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks so
much watching we'll catch y'all next
time for some more of that Google ish's
delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
