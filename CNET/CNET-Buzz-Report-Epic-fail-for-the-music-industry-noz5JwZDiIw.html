buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's the corporate takeover of our legal
system some more the dislike button you
will in fact dislike and the Twitter
movie but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the epic
4g it's Sprint's second 4g phone and it
is hot as hell it's got a 1 gigahertz
processor a 4-inch amo LED display that
our reviewers called mesmerizing a
front-facing camera the ability to act
as a hotspot for up to five devices and
and a slide-out QWERTY keyboard plus the
4g it is unquestionably an outstanding
bit of kit but is it epic and are you
may be setting yourself up a little bit
if you call your phone epic and actually
is it okay if we just stop saying epic
now because I'm over that also epic fail
can we stop that to thank you neat phone
though I like that and now for the news
fun story from the RIAA and national
association of broadcasters this week
they're pulling a google verizon and
putting out a little proposal for
congress specifically they want Congress
to mandate that all cell phones include
an FM radio because they do music and
music can only continue to exist on the
radio and the radio can only continue to
exist if cell phones have radios in them
by law oh i know i was also stunned into
silence they're smoking crack luckily
this will never go anywhere not because
our lawmakers will finally stand up to
companies and tell them they're not
allowed to write laws for us no that's
never gonna happen but that thing won't
happen because once Steve Jobs finds out
that someone's gonna try to force him to
put an FM radio and iPhone he's going to
explode the universe so we're all good
speaking of companies writing laws 18t
put up a blog post this week saying they
are totally in favor of Verizon and
Google's net neutrality proposal that
would exempt wireless broadband networks
from any regulation or consumer friendly
rules it's just so funny because it was
a tease former CEO and Whitaker who
actually launched the net neutrality
debate back in 2005 when he said that
like Google wasn't going to get to use
his pipes for free even though Google
paid for them but he's gone now although
his adorably kooky and vaguely confused
legacy apparently lives on oh so hey you
know that dislike button you've been
seeing all over Facebook lately the
official Facebook dislike button hooray
it's finally here don't click it it's a
scam I know bummer right it's not super
dangerous but it's a spam scam and it's
actually likely to be the most
successful Facebook scam of all time
assuming you don't count farm bill it's
kind of the modern version of the naked
Britney Spears pictures emails that you
know infested computers worldwide with a
nasty worm back in ancient history you
know the kind of ancient history when
people still wanted to see Britney naked
poor thing and now let's have a look at
what's clogging the tubes by now you've
probably all seen the uber dramatic
trailer for the social network the movie
about the history of Facebook directed
by david fincher
you're going to get left behind move it
faster than any of us ever get behind
shoot him in federal court and because
this is the Internet it took roughly
sixty three seconds for the parodies to
start rolling in mostly from the same
place first there was this YouTube one
this is happening faster than any of us
imagine we don't have enough videos of
adorable laughing babies and find more
this is my shot you mean our shot
and now Twitter does that Twitter is
strict you to only 140 words close
characters 40 characters they're saying
that Twitter is nothing but a bunch of
idiots and celebrities talking about
what they had for breakfast I know what
it says it true I know right it's so
good also the music and that Twitter one
is done by the gregory brothers who also
did that's right the bed intruder remix
i totally want them to play my next
birthday party those guys are good and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone i'm molly wood and thank you
for watching as for the charges I
believe I deserve some recognition from
this board for what
I'm gonna you know let the way happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
