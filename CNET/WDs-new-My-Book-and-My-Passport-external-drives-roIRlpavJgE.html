hard drive film WD the my book and my
passport as you can see they look like
the different versions of the same
device and indeed they have very similar
now first both do not have a USB C port
instead they are for the O micro USB 3.0
port and that means they will not work
with computer that only has USB see like
this Mike book right here now to make up
for that both of them support encryption
meaning you can turn it on and not worry
about losing your data in case of loss
or thief which is more important is
passport here because it's a portable
drive you carry it around and you might
lose it also both of them come with W
backup software in case you do not want
to use the built-in backup tool of
windowed hands with them and both drive
out of high capacity now the my book
here is available up to 80 by and the my
passport up to four teba and in testing
they are both fast
now the my book is faster obviously
averaging some 170 megabytes per second
and the my passport 110 megabytes per
second now they are not the facet of a
scene but definitely not the slowest and
finally both come in black you will not
do to find this my book here in any
other colors but you will with my
passport how do I know well I have them
over here right here a yellow silver
blue red and orange and keeping my each
color come with a color matching USB
cable which is pretty cool and these
colors mean that is a great idea if you
want to buy multiple of them and use the
color to categorize the content like
yellow for video blue for a document and
red for photos stuff like that so how
about the price well both of the drives
here come in a multiple capacity but the
top capacity 80 by my book here can be
held for $300 the top capacity of the my
passport for tape I can be held for $160
and that's all I care about because when
it come to storage I always get the high
passively possible and that's because I
am dumb no and these are the my book and
my passport drive from Daddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
