next iPhone we're getting nearer to
Apple's newest iPhone lineup and of
course there are tons of reports
swirling around like things that swirl
heywhat swirls toilets whirlpools sounds
good
anyway we're going to rank the rumors
from most likely to least likely to
happen coming in at number five is
iPhone 10 styling for all take a look at
the current iPhone lineup there's the
iPhone 10 and iPhone 8 then there's the
last generation 7 and the previous
generations iPhone 6s the iPhone 10
showed that face ID could work and that
living without touch ID on an iPhone was
possible expect the iPhone H to hang
around as an entry-level model but
whatever the next version is expect all
of them to follow the knotch
and ditch the button at number four
three rear cameras on the
top-of-the-line iPhone if all the
iPhones look the same from the front
you've got to do something to make the
fancy one stand out one camera is good
two is better but three that will make
the iPhone 11 or the iPhone 10 plus or
whatever it's called have features that
the other ones don't I think this is
pretty likely we are now at number three
pencil compatibility hey I'm a note fan
writing on a screen with a stylus of
some kind seems natural to me but I'm
weird
Apple brought pencil compatibility to
its cheapest iPad maybe the pencil would
be an easier investment for people at
$99 if it worked on both the iPad and
the iPhone a stylus on an iPhone sounds
crazy but so did getting rid of the
30-pin dock connector the headphone jack
and a touch ID Apple does crazy all the
time we're at number two the death of a
5.8 inch iPhone the 5.8 inch iPhone 10
is less than one year old there's a
report floating around saying that Apple
is ordering fewer OLED components this
report seems very strange Apple usually
keeps models around for a year or two
the idea that Apple would get rid of the
five-point eight inch version this
quickly seems very unlikely and the
number one rumor that seems the least
likely is an in screen fingerprint
sensor
in the next iPhone Apple does not go
backwards the company has moved to face
ID yeah maybe in screen fingerprint
sensors our reality in certain other
phones but this is Apple face ID seems
like a worthy successor to touch ID on
mobile devices apples just got touch ID
on its laptop so maybe it's not entirely
dead yet however I seriously doubt Apple
would bother to include another
fingerprint sensor on a new phone after
talking up face ID for so long
respecting Apple to hold an event in
early September as it has every year for
a while now who knows maybe Apple will
go entirely retro and introduce an
updated iphone 3gs smaller screen lower
res no fingerprint sensor or face ID no
LTE hmm that sounds terrible let me know
what you think apples up to a my as a
carnal see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
