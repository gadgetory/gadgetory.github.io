welcome to our live drop test everyone
if you've been following the action here
at to show you today has beat crazy the
LBCC had a two hour power outage and we
were bringing you updates throughout the
blackout we had to move the time of this
segment so thank you so much for bearing
with us especially thank you to our
wonderful case companies who are also
where I've managed to reschedule but now
we are ready to go I'm Lexus Avedis and
I'm Vanessa and Arianna and if you've
watched our drop test before or you've
conducted some of your own you know that
phones now are very easy to break
especially the ones with glass backs
which is pretty much all the major
flagships from Apple Samsung LG HTC Wow
and let's talk about that iPhone 10 for
a second Lexie as you can see it dropped
from hit height and it cracked at the
very first drop ouch that is higher
price drop is right here needless to say
you probably want to put a case on your
phone yeah definitely for sure and and
that one specifically because the repair
is so expensive Lexie it's 549 dollars
just for the back ouch but how do you
choose a case when there are as we can
see here so many out there that's why we
are here we're here to help you narrow
it down to see all these tough cases in
action
so we have 12 tough cases ready to go
right here on the table and
representatives from case ology right
through here signer tech tech 21 pure
air subcase reinard field rock foam
bodyguards z3o WC
egon they're ready to show us what they
got so guys we try to invite everybody
but as you know there's a lot of case
makers out there but if you don't see
your favorite case maker here chances
are we probably reached out so take it
up with him these guys are a brave Bunch
so here is how it's going to work we are
going to be testing the claims so we're
going to drop their brand new iPhone 10
in the Isis from the heights that they
determine if they survive what happens
next
well if this survived then we will be
taking them above the claim so that
means they're gonna be dropped more than
once and we're gonna ask them though if
they're willing and able to do this so
we're just gonna have a drop off to the
death until we have finalists and we can
declare a winner we have our scissor
lesson standing by because as you can
suspect they're ready to go hi so are
you ready to see some phones get dropped
come on all right sorry Vanessa get into
position for our first drop first up we
have Kate solid key welcome to the stage
please introduce your case thank you
we're from case ology today we're here
to represent the legion series for our
iPhone 10 it's specifically designed to
be tough but slim just like our new
year's resolution designed to be rugged
yet flexible we want to wanted to ensure
that in everyday situation whether it's
dropped whether it's in our pockets it's
protected and we mastered that through a
perfect blend of TPU and polycarbonate
plastic and you know what makes it super
unique is that it's a unisex design so
it appeals to males and females it's
offered in a couple a few different
colors in charcoal grey and white and
aqua green for those who like to stray
from the norm all right what's the price
point on this it's $13.99 currently on
Amazon and if you have primary chef it's
the way to go great dropping what if I
drop hype we're starting with four and a
half feet
four and a half feet okay Vanessa all
right so guys just to be clear I am NOT
a robot
I cannot replicate the drops this
same way every single time I'm gonna
have them drop try to drop them screen
side down as which is what you really
care about but again I can't replicate
the same drop so if anything goes wrong
that this is not a scientific drop it's
more like a real-world scenario the way
you would drop it so four and a half
feet you guys ready
help me count down what are you gonna do
Vanessa let's get okay make sure that we
get this shot right we're gonna do three
two one drop and I'm gonna drop it on

yeah so I'm here with Dan otech our
flagship product is the K 11 bumper
we're a case and I phone accessory
company and we actually really don't
like cases we love the iPhone as it is
our niche with our product is to design
a streamline minimal beautiful case that
looks like it's part of the phone it
blends in and bleeds into the design and
it's practical it still provides the
protection that you need and want and
what's the price on this one it's thirty
four ninety five okay great and let's
see if we are in position okay how are
we doing what's the height so what is
the height they'll be dropping from 959
feet right Josie Shanon
so guys run me through it our scissor
lift is that how high our scissor lift
is as six feet so that means I'm gonna
be dropping it from the three foot mark
over here on our marker so right here
that'll be nine feet and this was one of
the late comers to our show so this
means this is somebody's personal phone
right yes and it could have already
fallen and they are brave enough to be
trying this with their personal phone so
all right here goes guys that's 9 feet
are you ready to count down with me
three two one drop
oh that's definitely what sounded like
I'm really trying not to curse to me oh
okay we could be honest of taking it out
sound off sounded sounded worse than it
was really show they here we go here we
go oh there was a little bit of scratch
on the back there but I don't know was
that already there it's a back protector
oh I see so it comes with the back
protector yeah okay well if you please
put it back in the bumper so they were
nicked well the thing is the scratch was
on the back it's not the back protector

gentlemen wow thank you so much take a
seat next up we have buddy guides come
on up buddy gods welcome to the stage
please tell me about your case so my
name is Ryan I'm with bodyguards we are
talking about the ACE Pro today it's
transparent and flexible but we we
partnered with a company called unequal
if they make protective equipment for
athletes professional athletes are using
their products every day and we've taken
their product and put it in our cases so
that that particular product and that
material takes the impact instead of
your phone taking the impact okay and
how much is this one
this one retails for 3495 okay this one

stage thank you for joining us and
please tell us about your case okay so
we're tech to anyone with a British
brand and we specialize in thin
lightweight protective cases so we've
got the Evo check here today what's
special about this case is the Flex shot
material that you can see running around
the edges and what that does it absorbs
impact force and dissipates it and stops
the force going through into the device
and stops it from breaking and the price
on this one $39.99 drop height please
ten feet footer footer okay I can
replicate my cab you said that was a
grand a full drop I will try it again

let's start with your ass sorry okay
yeah Pelican got up instead of P okay P
okay thank you so much how are you I'm
good please tell us about the case yes
so today we are showing the pure gear
dual tech case there's a number of
reasons that makes it such an awesome
protective case it's composed of a
variety of materials we've got hard
plastic on the outside that gives it
structural support whereas the softer
TPU material on the inside allows the
case to hug the phone on all four sides
and on top of that we have organic grip
on each side which not only gives the
dual type character but also prevents
gives it a sturdier hold great last but
not least I want to we have a rubber pad
on the inside a cage adds protection
price drop hi
$34.99 let's go with ten feet okay today
we are going to ten feet I was already
at twelve so I'm just gonna drop it from
here guys okay we've all righty it's
like a jungle gym I thought you guys are
12 feet but go to 10 feet then alright
alrighty three three two one drop
Oh sound always gets me like it hurts me
it hurts me to hear that okay please
take it out of the case you know maybe
it's just like the BOK is worse than the
bite maybe that's what it may be that's
what it's all about
okay looks good on the back looks so
good on the front visible clap no
visible damage there's right on the top
okay great it's another survivor whew
guys brave brave souls thank you please
put it back on the table
alright next up please step up Pelican
we would like to have you on the stage
guys had the order switched around a
little bit of musical chairs that's all
right please tell us about your case so
our case is the Pelican shield case is
made with Kevlar fibers and this case
right now is coming from 40 years of
history of the Pelican DNA we make cases
every camera case that's in here is a
polycon
so we're used to making things that
protect and this one is built to protect
anything that goes in it okay it looks
pretty tough what is the price on this
one so this one is a little bit more
expensive this 59.99 okay and the drop
height you're setting I want to go up so
can we get the crowd motivated where do
y'all want to see we could talk about
guys they're gonna go 20 feet to 20 but
we could have stopped with the cream can
we go 16 feet 60 feet well we want to
see we want to see 16 but that means we
good that means we gonna move to see
contained but we've got another 12 for
the first thing don't forget we got to
stick to 12 you guys you guys said 2 we
will keep going don't worry but we're
gonna test your claim you guys well okay

looks like I know I any better it's not
doesn't that just like make your heart
skip a beat really yes honestly
okay well look at this there's some
clipping action going on here this is
some intense case work here okay

struggled with that mechanism all right
how's it looking here we go
it looks pretty good to me I can't see
anything visible looks good okay pop it
back in the case thank you so much all
right next up I think we're getting
getting really high up into that ceiling

alright WC don't Larry go ODBC I'm
showing our new guard KX it's got
Kennedy energy absorbing materials
kinetic energy absorbing material has
made in the USA
the actual material of the the plastic
comes from German Amy it's a very unique
case style we've done this for the last
actually since the iPhone 4 very simple
it's very thin you know it's a case to
come down and off really easy but most
important you know it survives major
impacts and we've got my own phone I've
thrown hundreds of times our customers
demo this for us so looking forward to
setting the bar at 16 foot and see what
happens all right 15 foot is now what's
the price on this one and the drop
height is 16 of course $49 and 16 foot
1/2 full okay let me tell you this is
getting really really high crane my neck
to see all the way up it's really wobbly
in size I mean this is probably as high
as like a second-story balcony and it
I'm sure it does is how often do you

for joining us and please tell us about
your phone and in case our case is
designed with building screen protector
and all the covers is or the ports are
covered and also come with a holster
which allow people to take it to the
toughest environment the unique computer
Syria has been on the market for over
five years has been through the toughest
test you know 100 feet 150 feet we have
people dropped from you know 10 story 15
story 1600 you ready to go to see some
feet ok amazing how much is this one
1995 ok all right looks like a tank
let's see how we go from 16 16 feet
again and just I wanted to point out
this one also Scott comes with a
protective screen cover or a part as
part of the case so 16 feet guys 16 feet
has not been kind to phones so far so
let's start the count a minute three two
one drop
well I'm really good at this okay okay
uh we dropped we dropped the unicorn
beetle this was not the case that you
showed us though Oh
but okay so the thing is yeah okay so
this is what it looks like without all
of that on it okay
they're all right can you take it out of
the case for me see how we go how's it
looking all right
I think visible yet it's got a couple of
layers in there though it's a lot of
case there all right let's take it out
all right take a look guys can't see any
scratches nothing there on the screen
okay looks good you guys survived you
guys survives take a look at the back
there we go okay fantastic thank you
please put it back in the case
and we'll head on to our next 16-footer
okay like to invite Rhino shield to the
stage thank you very much
okay please tell us all about your case
so this is a crush girl from Rhonda
Shear we specialize in material science
we believe it is very easy to wrap a
phone in a break to protect it so the
the real challenge is to shrink the
protection to something very thin and
relight this case is actually less than
a half an ounce this is also bpa-free
which is which lot of customers really
really like okay and the last thing the
nice thing is that you can actually
remove the button and change colors to
to make it yours customize the case okay
the price on this one 25 and 16 feet
we're going to 16 feet okay and another
bumper Lexie another bicep almost feels
like it doesn't have a case and I'm
really terrified of dropping this phone
but okay here goes this is exciting
alright ready Brian oh shoot like
there's nothing protecting the back of
it which is the most expensive part so
here goes every two feet three two one
drop
Oh even the tape kids right the label
came off the labels came off
have nothing to do with the actual case
we just put it there because it's a
bumper and there's no other way for us
to know which bumper it is so we have
the little label on it okay oh my good
oh guys look at this we have a casualty
oh my goodness right I feel so sorry
shield I'm so sorry you guys didn't make
it the phone broke at 16 feet 16 feet
I'm sorry guys thank you so much for
taking part that's okay we're sure to
use a screen protector but it doesn't
come with a case so thank you so much
appreciate you guys taking pod oh we
have the couch don't cut yourself there
on that case all right finally on that
16 foot is we have speaking please come
up good to have you guys here please
tell us the name of your case
yeah my name is James from spigen the
name of the case is ProGuard is a newly
released case it's went up on our
website a few hours ago and it's a
multi-layer case with two screen
protectors that comes with it gives 360
degrees of protection and I'll get
straight to the points because everybody
wants to see the drop it speaking $9.99
on the website and let's go to the
porter job
alright 16 feet 16 feet so it hey screen
also a screen protector included so here
goes 16 feet has not been a very good
height for phone so right here goes
come on ah 16 feet in three two one drop
whoa alrighty let's reach in grab this
guy okay look it out of the case
well no won't be as damage on the front

you so much two cases have survived CCC
so far yep so we have sup case and
spigen who survived at the 16 feet Mach
oh my goodness okay so we have to give
the others a chance to meet you sorry
it's only fair speaking when you finish
we're gonna put your case back up here
so I would like to offer the chance for
other competitors to go to 16 feet
because we need to get some finalists
here we need to learn the toughest case
so who's in for 16 feet and it's show of
hands all right show of hands
round two guys for 16 16 feet or chance
that's the 16 feet 16 feet if you're
already in at 16 feet also please raise

okay that's alright fantastic
alright so case ology and rockfall okay
so you're gonna drop these guys first we
have to marry we very have a very
sophisticated pulley system pretty
honest here in the back it's a lot of
fun it's a very sophisticated pulley
system here we go and we're gonna start
with case ology because they were the
first ones to drop so 16 feet again and
by the way just FYI this is the second
time these phones have been dropped so
take that with a grain of salt they have
already held up to the claim they have
done what they're supposed to do at this
point we are just picking finalists that
doesn't reflect the claim so on that
note three two one drop
whoa okay
the volume market came up from 4.5 feet
pathology she makes him up here and just
not pull me what was the name of this

okay come up and take it out of the case
there's a lot less phones on the table
Lexi there are their eyes
yeah diminishing okay let's take a look
I can't say any cracks it's just a
little bit of dust they're just from the
landing I think we good look at the back
guys
alright let's see does it - it what's
the call was it charged up before we
brought it in it was a new friend
technical difficulties it literally was
Justin bucks well it's not turning on
well so we have a charge really I have
it we can just plug it right in there
and verify that it's actually turned on
that's why the seated booth has plugged
why we have plugs ladies GBD hey while
we're well we're telling people give it
a bit of a charge to see if it starts up
so we're waiting on that we're gonna
continue on with Pelican from 16 feet
all right three two one drop
oh wow that was so these these larger
cases are her out these logic cases
really really bounce around quite a lot
okay if you could do the honors taking
it out of the case and seeing how we go
oh my goodness that's gonna see it's
such an elaborate process there I'm so
good think we have that Plexiglas
because that would have bounced right on
it I know seriously let's take a look
guys thank you
no scratches nothing visible back
looking good all right survivor thank
you very much please put it back in the
case all right back on the table
so we're up next is subcase sup hi 16
feet again it's a larger case so I'm
seeing a trend that they are not landing
right screen side downs the larger cases
so we'll see if that holds true for this
one in three two one drop
well that was okay alright let's reach
in and grab this one all righty
okay tough case you could come out
definitely see the case is taking some
beating but looks let's take a look
let's see okay Lexie well the
phone itself back front intact in tired
let's take a look at the case let's look
at the screen protector a little bit of
dust there a little bit of dirt okay
I've got see any actual scratches on the
screen protector either though it's just
dust from the pavers okay great you guys
give me mine okay this is a nice one at
16 feet all right here we go
vegan again vegan okay ready last drop
it ready eight feet in three two one
drop Wow alright this one speakin guys
guys no eyes take a look here take a
look yeah wait but could it be this is
it the screen watched you said there was
a screen protector on this one alright
take it off take it off we go to see if
it was the glass screen underneath or if
it was a screen protector whose we've
seen another one with a screen protector
that was cracked the phone itself was
looking good and I gotta have the
drumroll Lexie true drumroll will crack
on the screen
let's say let's say take a look here and
you see these glitches here on the
screen can we see those at all
unfortunately this was this was speaking
from from the sixties with 16-piece
second time guys I'm so sorry
see the little couple glitches there on
the screen some little dead pixels there
I'm sorry you guys so just thank you so
much so just just to rewrite the Viggen
winnette twice dropped from 16 feet and
a lot of scene and then all these were
dropped multiple times so take that with
a grain of salt but I mean we still have
multiple finalists Lexie so we have to
keep going yeah we wait finalists keep
going with this yes we need to have the
verdict on P okay though did it turn on
the screen is not showing anything guys
oh there's there's no physical damage
but the screen is not turning on you've
heard Siri she we've heard Siri she was
talking to us but unfortunately the
phone screen is not turning on so we are
going to count that as being a
disqualification because even though
there wasn't breakage the phone doesn't
work the screen doesn't turn on yeah we
just were disqualified the other cases
also unfortunately guys know breaking
there's break two cases two cases in
which the phone itself did not break but
there's been glitches with the phone so
because we don't have that much time
we're disqualifying unless it's fully
functional so we got a got a way okay so
we have currently we have six cases left
on the table we're gonna go straight to
20 what are you gonna say 20 doing on
