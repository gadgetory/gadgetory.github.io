name is Stephen bicho I am Rafe
Needleman I am Donald Bell and i am
brian Tong welcome to cnet's podcast of
indeterminate length it is episode 1560
I am joined here in the house with the
boys of bol Rafe coming back I didn't
they come back for this week yep I
appreciate your I couldn't leave you
here all knowledge I know and also
Donald bell he's been working in here we
have we're here last week right I was
talking about how much I don't know
anything about Pinterest back for more
we will get to your Pinterest comments
which is the Stone Age this is the wrong
demographic to be here in the time this
is doing a show about Pinterest
unnecessarily I mean according to our
voicemails and emails that might tell us
a little different but those guys thanks
for coming to the show also everyone
here in the live chat room at live
cnet.com you guys can interact while
we're talking ask us questions and just
be part of the community so we
appreciate you guys all for coming out
there but we're going to start things
off in today's leading headline that you
just can't escape Apple akoya all things
D will be reportedly unveiling the ipad
3 the first week of March this will
allegedly or purportedly happen here in
San Francisco at the yerba buena center
of the arts where they've typically held
their big events and we're expecting to
see something may be similar in form
factor with a new processor but a kind
of to support this new revelation that
everyone's going crazy for right you
weren't you kind of like squealing in
our in our pre-show I don't squeal no
not it not in nineteen of other man you
were the only one squeal and Brian okay
there wasn't me yeah it was nearly down
so it's so what I mean what can Apple do
I mean they can't make it they can't
change the form factor radically it's
just they just got to keep ahead with
the guts to keep ahead more extend from
the Android crowd I love how also this
is like a rumor that could have been
done March of last year yeah when they
in Vail the ipad 2 in early march of
2011 mr. sir is our prediction 2012
there'll be an invading of the ipad
in early March judge that I mean that's
that's what the joke was grab all this
because it's coming from all things D or
is becoming coming from you know yeah
it's so a woman squad core we're here
first we heard it was gonna be quad core
may or may not but it looks like maybe
not who knows I don't know I'm not even
gonna say I'm not even to throw that
around because none of us in this room
no no we don't know jack about the eye
but there was think it's interesting to
me is it you know the I the iphone 4s
came out and it was the best selling
iphone in the history of the universe uh
and it was basically a really good
upgrade but it wasn't revolutionary it
was just revolutionary good I mean
seriously under the hood and the ipad 3
I mean is it going to be the same thing
it can it do to sales what the iphone 4s
did over the iphone 4 if I just don't
know if they drop the price a little a
mite which although I'm not really what
the visitor will do precisely but they
don't have to do anything the worst
thing Apple could do would be to screw
up the lead they already if you
established and seemed to be like
absolutely invincible in face of
everyone trying to unseat them in the
tablet market I mean you know what
everyone is expecting you know I don't
think anyone is expecting great huge
things from the ipad 3 from what we've
seen another Apple technology you know
we're expecting to see a higher density
possible you know higher-resolution
display we're expecting to see Siri
integrated and a faster processor and
possibly a better camera if that's what
they bring to the table that's good
enough yeah like really I don't think
anyone's going to say that you're gonna
have the people that are still haven't
purchased an ipad yet that we're waiting
on Christmas Eve everyone will complain
but I still be the highest selling ipad
the ipad 2 s it's what a little bit i
pad HD who knows what they're gonna call
it so now then they will drop prices by
the way on the ipad 2 right so you want
you'll have you know fifty dollars they
look like 18 different models of iPad as
there are right now at fifty dollars
between each one so no matter what I was
researching yesterday what the current
going prices for a refurbished ipad one
is and the lowest price like the the 16
gig model is still like three hundred
and forty dollars you Teresa yes L value
I that's not an icon right there's a
career i mean if you just even like you
said scour eBay there's a crazy
the aftermarket for just Apple products
across the board yeah there was a survey
done recently the show that I don't know
the exact numbers but the resale values
of smartphones for that were exactly the
same age was like twice as high for
iPhones vs android phones it's like the
Toyota Camry of phones it's actual wrong
I resold my iphone one for the same
price i bought it for things like two or
three hundred dollars you just have to
get locked in a contract yeah yeah so
also I you know if you guys want to take
a peek at what this ipad 3 might look
like it seems like there's a fire sale
on the ipad 3 rear housing that's i'm
popping up everywhere in multiple sites
in different forms so Donald you did a
little story about yeah and I wanted to
make an iPad but joke out of the being
the rear of the ipad but i didn't seem
in good taste ipad idea i want so i
thought i'd mentioned that i thought
about here where a good taste well we
have some ipad 3 booty shots right there
you go that could have been the headline
but now the the it looks like i see if
you got all the pimples their circle
it's got all the pimples right the
pimples are circled the circle pimples
are there too as the evidence that the
different shape of the internal you know
the inside of the back panel here shows
that the little screw holes for that
would hold the the logic board onto the
the back panel here is smaller which
would lead you to think that it's not
using the same you know processor holds
Millar scaled down hopefully in a six
process it's also leading some to
believe that it's not going to be a dual
core quad core sorry quad core processor
because the side size would not allow
for that but then it would also mean
bigger battery different camera because
the the actual camera look like the
location has carved out in a different
way yeah you can read the tea leaves
here and get some idea that it's going
to be a different panel different camera
different processor bigger battery I
think ultimately the the big thing is
it's the form factor pretty much other
than a few tweaks externally like the
camera looks unchanged but and also i'm
getting a rectangle oh my god but even
more even more on this topic see they
move the camera just enough so that
you're still gonna have to buy new cases
for new accessories it's part of how
they do things with this whole ecosystem
so
anyways we're only what three 3 four
weeks away first week a March mark it on
your calendar get excited or whatever
open up your wallet and last year the
ipad 2 came out about a week or week and
a half after their announcement so mate
so there might be similar similar
timetable but there is no official or
you know no one has found out when they
will really be bringing the hardware to
the market so that's the apple stuff on
to kind of some other great things and
things changing up in the media
streaming business yesterday there were
reports earlier in the week that this
was going to happen but Amazon wrapped
up a deal with Viacom bringing content
from networks like MTV Nickelodeon
Comedy Central vh1 and more and really
bottom line two thousand new titles to
the Amazon Prime instant video service
which is now grown quite nicely and yes
they're knocking on netflix is door with
their integration of this in the prime
service yeah and also ties into the
kindle fire you know the stream
streaming on demand a integration there
so it's another thing that amazon can
brag about compared to the competition
now what I still would love them to do
is to release and they have this on
video app that can be downloaded onto
other Android tablets you know what I
would like is an Amazon video app for my
iPad hey I don't think that's gonna
happen anytime soon but I mean seriously
just the other night I was like and I've
got all this whole new entertainment
crap in my house a new TV and you know
Roku and all that but I wanted to watch
drive oh yeah yeah in bed and that is
the iPad device and that's that's the
you know yeah I don't have a TV in my
bedroom because that's you know I don't
have traction I bet but I do have an
iPad and the one and n drive is only
available drive isn't available on
Netflix but it is on prime for rental
but there is no way to stream yeah
that's not going to happen though is it
I'm gonna have to get a fire well see
what Amazon could do because you know
they've been really liberal about
putting their apps on on other platforms
although you can't rent directly from
that I wouldn't be surprised at least if
you could see an Amazon Prime app that's
only for the free content that stream
just like Netflix because Netflix does
it right you have
that subscription you just have to plug
in you know get access to the app they
could do that but when it comes to
rentals of new content it'll probably be
a thing where you have to go to their
website it unlocks it and then you can
use the app at least to view it but the
transaction won't happen within the app
they could do that make your score the
website and do it exactly but they could
do that yeah they could the question is
does does Amazon want to sell a Fire's
or do they want to sell content if they
want to sell content they gotta put as
much of it as possible on the iPad I
mean they have a kindle app for the ipad
which is great I use it all the time but
they don't have a streaming viewer for
the ipad yet that's come come on amazon
there's a lot of people out there who
would buy your content and they're not
going to buy a fiery absolutely so
Amazon Viacom I'm hooking up in other
thread hijack sorry right jack good I
like it okay another Street and other
streaming media news HBO has decided to
invest in a netflix kind of a look-alike
from australia they call themselves
quick flicks and that that's deserves a
chuckle because remember netflix
initially had announced their Qwikster
service for DVDs Netflix's name is
netflix take the two together and what
do you get quickflix quick flicks so um
Netflix hasn't really as an established
a market in Australia yet but this is
part of HBO at least looking to
experiment and getting involved in you
know creating their own streaming
service Netflix even intimated Reed
Hastings in December that HBO and
Netflix would possibly in the future
look a lot like each other this is a
step into that direction we've seen HBO
at the moment offer their HBO Go service
right as a complementary piece if you
have a subscription but having a
standalone streaming service obviously
would change the game for them and make
them into even more direct competitor
but also see Netflix step in making
their own content to right yeah with
some of those deals we haven't seen them
yet but uh hopefully we'll start seeing
some of that stuff in the next maybe six
months to what everybody's in this
direction I mean it's just a matter of
time no broadcast TV is going to go away
at some point it's all going to be bits
and the streaming model is the right
model just the transition is really
difficult because it's expensive and
you've got these the whole companies all
businesses set up for one way and to
move to the other way just
is really hard but I can't wait I mean I
just think it's great no go HBO and do
me a favor HBO make what is it HBO Go
make that available without having to
also have a cable subscription well that
sounds the hook right now that's the
hook right now right we we know that the
other thing that with all these things
shifting over you know we're right now
in the transitional period but once
these apps start coming out and people
transition to using these apps or
getting access to these services I've
got to wonder if we'll eventually start
seeing data caps on our actual cable
service you know our home service of
everything we start doing become
streaming the natural progression for
those companies is to now put in data
caps if that's if that's how we're
consuming our content I mean it sounds
crazy but it could happen it could
download these down the line 34 years
baby yeah well happened then we'll have
the argument again about blocking the
internet and then the cable guys will
want the services that they're invested
in to come through you know with for
free or with no not counting towards
your caps and then it'll be the whole
what do you call that stratifying the
internet or you know the different tiers
yet like the end of the program tears it
could be something we're like there's
peak hours you know maybe you could have
some serious that downloads like caches
your predicted content that you going to
want to watch on off-peak hours and you
could watch bad the thing is if all
you're doing is watching to this going
off the rails I like it if all you're
doing is watching let's make the new
content you know one or two shows at a
time for three or four hours at a time
during it and that's you know being
generous in a house that's a lot of data
but it's not that much of a lot of data
so it should be an amount of data that
would fit under any reasonable cap you
know a couple hundred gigabytes or
something over a month with as as
bandwidth increases uh this should not
be a problem we're not talking about
downloading the entire 500 channels at
once because you don't need to you just
want to stream what you're watching live
it shouldn't be that hard it's here's
the thing it shouldn't be the problem
but you you even look at how we've seen
the cell carriers and how do you know
they do their data caps but also when
you look at something like
okay text messaging technically should
it be charged additionally because it's
using the same network right all right
cable and downloading these these movies
or these services in the future it
shouldn't be a problem but it doesn't
mean they're not gonna split them yeah I
mean if the question is what comcast
find a way to screw us in the future I
think the answer is yes it was making
the argument that not going to try to
you know go down screaming and crying
I'm not so sure they will I mean the
internet is not i mean the the service
the internet service providers verizon
comcast goes or the wired connections i
mean they're you know a little evil and
the carriers though I mean that's a
whole different level of today there's
lave leveled up into new I mean ten
dollars in SMS or ten cents an SMS and
that's just wrong so uh i don't know i
mean i have comcast and it's actually
pretty good yeah i mean if we look in
the chat room we have you know one over
one of our people in the chat shade are
saying with the family of four and
that's the thing that to consider right
with some of these larger families that
are already going over there 150 gig per
month limit so it's as we transition i
mean it's it's realistic that that will
change but we'll see i mean all these
things these are all wheels that are
moving in that direction another
streaming little story that we have here
verizon teaming up with the red box red
box is known for their DVD kiosks DVD
and blu-ray kiosks that you can find
like grocery stores near 7-11 they're
teaming up with red box to offer a video
streaming service that they're hoping to
launch sometime in the second half of
2012 an on-demand video streaming
service verizon will own sixty-five
percent the new joint venture red box
will own the rest and red box is owned
by parent company coinstar who not only
owns those kiosks but also there's a
cool little coin redemption I've
actually used those a few times yeah I
gotta pay that comcast bill somehow
right so um you know this verizon
they've if they integrated this into
their into their phones because we know
how verizon loves to litter their mobile
phones with verizon apps good and for
the most part it's been pretty crappy
yeah anyone will tell you that of the
delivery method even the quality in
general
this would this would be another kind of
verizon's already killing it with their
4g network yeah if they start rolling
this out in addition it's just another
reason to jump on board with them could
get verizon as opposed to as opposed to
18 I don't know I still want my my media
service company to be different from my
pipe company well even I mean it's okay
to be different but just the fact that
what if verizon says we offer X amount
of programs for free maybe not but let's
just say as part of being verizon user
they have the best 4g network right now
i mean it it's one of those things where
when push comes to shove in someone's
looking at carriers they might say oh
yeah just it's a good move for verizon
so so it could be like amazon's free
Vinay demand stuff for for people who
are prime members yeah I mean it would
be it would be an interesting play so
also just in a kind of a related story
of also a coinstar and the whole red box
phenomena they also picked up they
purchased all of blockbusters kiosks
because blockbuster themselves have had
their own chaos they've been struggling
revenue why's red boxes agreed to buy
their entire collection it was a deal
for 100 million dollars to acquire those
branded kiosk currently they added
around nine thousand machines with this
deal to its existing 35,000 machine base
red box has really been the one that has
seen progress in DVD rentals when the
industry as a whole is dropped twelve
percent for a combined sorry I combined
DVD and blu-ray sales we drop twelve
percent but everyone's you know writing
these things for like a buck 50 a night
something crazy like that so redbox not
only physically increasing their
footprint but also getting into
eventually getting to the streaming
business that's smarty pants yeah it's
morning eventually those kiosks go away
but they're writing their how long
though oh who knows but and but I mean I
don't know if you but eventually they
have to go why they're just they're just
writing the curve writing it down you
know there could be it could be one of
those things where the kiosk is always
there is something magical I didn't
really face about any of them you know
yeah I do use them you know okay I'm
saying I wouldn't I wouldn't think that
I might be the quote unquote typical
customer because I'm so all what there's
nothing is all about you thank you
thanks my mom told me that too
but um you know the convenience of it
it's it's it's pretty slick yeah I don't
have to wait for nephew know what's
really convenient lying back on the
couch with like you know Cheetos propped
up on your belly and going you click
Cheetos on your belly no I'm saying that
would be convenient I don't want to see
that or imagine that picture right yeah
big fleshy belly covered in this is so
many naughty pic cheeto dust oh don't
let your don't like the finger and roll
up and just with it with your sheet OE
fingers just on the remote which is all
encrusted you go click x and you're
watching TV it's awesome going on to who
wants to go out of the house forget it
it's a beautiful image you look
beautiful image also getting out of the
streaming business and this was kind of
a little surprise Paul McCartney is
removing all of his tracks from his
collections from Spotify Rdio and
rhapsody just a few days after releasing
his new album lovely titled kisses on
the bottom kisses on the bottom of your
iPad I don't understand this unless this
has got to be a negotiating move because
this makes absolutely no sense for a
musician in the modern world oh that's
it that's what we thought in donald
donald brothers up here I having just in
my own little experiment with my own
band like I get reports from TuneCore
that handles all the getting music
called the different you know digital
download sites and and iTunes money like
the money you make off of selling even
one track off of itunes is still it's so
much more than what you get off of the
half of a penny off of any kind of
stream from any of these other services
like the promises of course that once
people get hooked on streaming services
that then you know artists can push and
demand a better royalty from these
people but as it exists now it's is like
just little minor percentages of a penny
just get a song screened off of you know
something like Spotify it'll take
somebody like a Paul McCartney saying
like no this is a joke in order for I
think artists to get a better percentage
of a streaming royalty right so it is so
it is a very visible way to say look we
the the streaming services are not good
for musicians right itunes was streaming
not so much streaming
not so much I'm sure so yeah yeah I mean
I was I would just kind of think when I
first read this i was thinking of the
same thing like why would they just pull
out all of a sudden i pay nine bucks a
month and spotify and it's not helping
musicians now that chaps me actually
yeah i'm not happy about the promise
that thing for musicians of for
up-and-coming musicians is that services
like spotify have a much better viral
kind of reach where people see that
you're listening to this artist and they
want to go check it out but someone like
Paul McCartney doesn't need like a viral
campaign to get him hit him popular
people listen to his music he can afford
to do this good for you put in that case
good for you Paul also just as a heads
up in case I thought it might have been
related but probably but it looks like
it may not be necessarily Paul McCartney
is also doing a live concert exclusively
through itunes and the Apple TV later
today as of this thursday i think it's
around somewhere like 7pm or something
like that so anyways if you're
interested you can check that out for
free that's cool yeah so so don't want
anyone catch me listening to an album
called kisses on the bottom I'm sorry
sir paul sir paul can happen um i jumped
ahead but this is also kind of not kind
of it is important to mention that the
end of an era kodak which we had talked
about who filed for bankruptcy earlier
to try and save their business Eastman
Kodak has announced today that is put an
end to its camera business by the end of
june of this year kodak expects to phase
out its digital cameras you know what's
interesting pocket can codec was never a
camera company now there's always been a
film company i'll codec did make cameras
they made a lot of cameras but there was
the razor and razor blade model they
were always to push their film business
and digital killed film obviously so
what does a camera company do when it's
set up basically to make money from
consumables does this yeah they plan to
focus heavily on their brand licensing
not sure how much that that's going for
right now but also really more than
anything that trying to attract
companies that might need some of their
patents codec will still offer their
kodak gallery online service and their
retail based photo printing its inkjet
printers will remain on shelves yes for
a long long long time
so you know satin used to hear but it's
just the way the industry is changing so
say goodbye to your Kodak little Z
camera little little portable play
sports and all that alright guys we're
gonna take a quick break but when we
come back we have plenty of Google News
Google plane in the cloud even some more
also path you know it's it's a little a
few days after everything went down but
what actually happened with that and
Steve Jobs and the FBI they want to know
a little bit about them back in the day
we'll talk about all that when we return
alright guys welcome back to buzz out
loud joining me in the house this week
Rafe mr. Rafe Needleman here in smiling
da Nobel in the house as well as also
mr. Stephen beachy i'm running the
boards howdy good morning I was pumping
you up a little more than there you go
all right all right back to the stories
guys we have a little bit of google news
in the Google block google is close to
launching a cloud storage service
rivaling dropbox according to The Wall
Street Journal this is like Dropbox
Google's service they're going to call
it drive and it's their response to the
internet connected mobile devices and
storage space for your files and
documents and get them anywhere anytime
now he's smiling I find this so curious
I've written a lot about synchronized
Dropbox competitors CX sugar sings box
calm now and the thing about this
business is that it's terminal I mean
it's still growing but you can see the
cliff we're all crashes because
everybody is saving things more and more
we've got Spotify for streaming music we
hope your documents are stored in Google
Docs your photos are being stored on
Picasso or wherever and new cameras are
coming along that automatically upload
your photos your videos are being
streamed over the web the only thing
that you really really need in the
future so far that you only really
really need a local storage for is home
movies and even that over time goes away
so the the need to have a quote file
storage system it's just it's terminal
business and I find it so interesting
that everybody's chasing it well even
google has their music locker service to
was music beta for handling your music
so yeah it's it is what I mean if it's
just you know it's not it's not gonna
sound like a megaupload or something
like that if you want to share a move
like a full-length pirated movie with
somebody else that's a different story
there's a different service for that I
mean for myself because I do
use Google Docs sometimes that little
primarily work for my personal stuff I
do use the drop box but I don't see that
I mean more and more people once they
realize you know Google Docs has gotten
a lot better it's it's a more than
usable incapable service and yeah
sometimes it has little hiccups here and
there but for the most part it's a
completely usable service I don't I'm
one of the few people that still use
this Dropbox thing once in a while but
there's no there's really no need to per
se not not a not a high need for it
there's other ways you can go about why
not just email your email your file year
so I made it from anywhere any place to
right now drop box and all the
competitors to it are really valuable
and useful it it's just I things are
changing and I think Google's doing the
right thing we know get me wrong i think
that people are still i mean for the
next five to five years people are still
going to be filed based it's just
eventually will reach a point where that
slows and starts to decline yeah and
maybe google wants to get in and become
the infrastructure for all these apps
like evernote drink to store their data
someplace centralized instead of in
their own servers and they'll do an s3
like thing we're certain new businesses
can can use the Google infrastructure
for storage I don't know the scarier
thing looks our ego I just say it also
it it comes right into play with Android
to like if it's something that Apple's
offering like a certain amount of you
know cloud-based storage immediately
when you pop open and you know boot up
your iPhone I mean I think who would
want that same service just on a
competitive basis the interesting thing
about this is you know as an Apple user
they had their whole mobileme service
and one of their aspects was an idisk
where you uploaded files you could get
them from anywhere from a pc or mac
they're actually removing that aspect of
their service while others are bringing
it on because they've seen people are
migrating to dropbox the big thing here
is for companies like dropbox in the
others that you mentioned is that google
name and the fact that people are
already doing Google Docs I mean that's
gonna that's I would suspect for me I'm
probably going to pull my stuff off of
Dropbox and just throw it into my google
docs it won't be so easy dropbox is
pretty well entrenched it won't be so
easy to pull yourself off of dropbox
because so many interesting new web
services are getting dropbox baked in
you know and that's which is drop boxes
brilliance is there like open
up to the a open up the api's I
personally like sugarsync a whole lot
better as it as a single product but
Dropbox has done a much better job
ingratiating itself and warming its way
into the new web 20 infrastructure some
will see good Google's just you know
they have their hands in everything why
not right right right right right I got
to do it yeah also um in other Google
story this one made me laugh because you
know everyone's looking to make a little
extra money the economy is kind of
turning around a little bit Google wants
to help you with that by according to a
report they'll pay you to track the
websites you visit yeah if you'd like
that that's what they're planning to do
the search giant is promising up to $25
in amazon gift cards if you let them
track the websites you visit and how you
use them through a project known as
screen wise it's an extension that you
that you install into your browser
specifically the Chrome browser that
monitors every site you check in and out
of oh yeah I'm installing this right
away twenty-five dollars in amazon gift
cards I'll tell you why up when my kid
turns uh like 10 11 12 then i'm signing
up for this so i can see what he's doing
you can't but google well enough oh well
guys unfortunately at you know this
article is posted early this morning the
demand for this has been so large that
you can't at the moment get into their
screen wise page I don't get this and 25
bucks to have your privacy completely
wrecked I mean I just don't get it but
you know what the site was my privacy is
worth a lot more than the sick twisted
part about is there's a lot of people
that still don't value that right to
them it's like $25 surf the web this is
okay with that let's let's not make fun
of this is actually how we're all going
to make money in the future we'll all be
Google's you know little slaves and were
going to drive our google map cars
around to be able to give updates to
Google Maps you know with our Google
branding on the side and we'll wear our
Google t-shirts and we'll have google
live feeds you are absolutely right and
it just paints a picture of why are we
here next week on existential chat so
also the screen wise kind of initiative
or program that they have going on
extends even further in return for
collecting website data on every PC in
your home by and
stalling a dug data collector a data
collector router with in addition the
chrome extension ARS technica says
google is also planning a program that
will pay you 100 dollars just for
signing up and then twenty dollars a
month for as long as you'll participate
to kind of cover some of those cable
those cable modem fee set your pain off
I'm sorry people are willing that just I
mean that you're selling really you're
selling a little bit of your soul to
google to enable them to come outside
your home and look at all this look this
just in feels those gonna pay you two
hundred dollars if they can send
somebody to your house to take your
blood right to be wow please p into this
google com that's right the jalebis
links are giving you a thousand bucks
for a finger FYI the screen wise program
is strictly opt-in for now for now um
you know we've seen google kind of
entrench in the you know how they're
dealing with customers privacy and the
privacy is a hot buzz buzz word an issue
right now in the tech sector but wow the
the fact that people are more than
willing to do this kind of boggles my
mind a little bit i does not a sad it's
kind of sad it's sad more than anything
not confused me what it's sad I guess it
is interesting that we have this this
you know dual nature where where we at
on one side completely criticize google
for invading our privacy and then the
other side we jump at the chance to have
them do it for twenty dollar gift card
well it shows for those be right Donal
your absolute right I mean it does show
the real difference between what we as
pundits you know kvetch about and what
people out there in the real world yeah
really care about you know we are I mean
we are in a bit of a bubble here and
what we say is important other people
like 25 bucks for nothing sure right I
guess I I think the only part that
upsets me is that they're just that my
privacy is worth so good you know like
if if the privacy is the thing I'm
defending into the end until the right
price comes along $25 amazon gift card
you can you can do better than that
people you know what you're actually
raising a very valid point which is that
Google's data is going to be a little
bit skewed towards people who view their
privacy has not worked being worth very
much so all those super high value
people like you would be like no my
she's worth more than that so Google's
not gonna know what people are really
doing because guys like you're gonna be
saying no way Stephen were harping on
this would you do it I would not do it
no i don't but is this this is only for
like a certain amount of time that only
for like a week will track yours well
that was it but then they said that the
extension of that is a program where
they install a router and then you get a
hundred dollars and then twenty dollars
per month to be a part of this more
long-term that's what they're that's
what they're yeah that sounds annoying i
don't think i would that's crazy that is
crazy nano monitors in your drinks when
they say drink the kool-aid they're
going to mean it right alright also just
in a quick little update with google
guten the google world you probably
already heard that they finally released
their Chrome browser for android devices
very nice and in addition to that
development I haven't I haven't been
able to play with it so I really don't
have any it's really good you like it
it's fast it's an awesome chrome should
be yes I put on my my galaxy nexus
super-prime whatever oh yeah we should
also say it's only for ice cream
sandwich yeah yeah yeah and how's that
how's the tab browsing you like it yeah
it's really a good imitation and I like
the fact that the bookmarks that i have
already synced between my pcs over
chrome sync are now on my browser that's
kind of sweet that is pretty smooth on
my mobile also just FYI chrome for
android also will not be getting any
flash support in case you were wondering
why maybe some of those little fashion
sites that you visit Rafe weren't
running properly yeah I was really
eating at me yeah so uh but you can you
know you can you can pin pictures of
clothes that you want instead I just I
just go to your Pinterest populate I
have everything there I actually I'd
only put two little tech goodies on my
pictures I'm trying to refuse or somehow
make my clothing pinterest board private
I don't want people to see that but I
want to close you don't see what you
wear I don't the why do you dress like
that now well because you don't know
about Brian tongues gothic lolita thing
oh that's totally private that I should
not have actually brought up on the show
now that I'm thinking about it yeah that
was that was actually special access
idea all right on we talked a little bit
about privacy Rafe yes sir you've been
writing a lot about this whole oh god I
thought I was done with the past you're
done with it but you know let's just
talk about path in the hole
iphone address uploading but right just
what you know summarized in the Countess
of you okay so path is this little
social network is a very private social
network if that makes any sense so it's
for sharing you know real intimate
moments like i got up at this time i
drive it as airport by intimate i don't
mean it that way pervert is a little bit
just yeah so with with your close
friends and it's a very popular service
it's a very beautiful very good service
among the geek elite now the problem
that path had is that in order for a
social network like this to grow you
really want to know when your friends
join up or when they're on board so what
path was doing was when you installed
the iphone app they were taking your
iphone address book and uploading it to
the path servers so they could do
matching when new people joined that
were in your address book and then they
would you know send you a way to have
them join up that's how they help the
network grow but the problem was they
didn't ask their users if they were okay
with with path storing a copy of their
iphone address book and when that was
revealed they got in big big big trouble
among people who care about such things
so people giving up their you know their
web browsing activities at Google they
want to care uh yeah it was a $25 gift
card cutting that's right yeah well
they're venture-funded they could afford
anyway so what happened was dave morin
the CEO path put up a blog post saying
we are so very very sorry we are putting
up a new version of path which makes
this an opt-in and furthermore we're
deleting all of the data that we have up
but we have downloaded from you guys
from from our users we're just wiping it
all out so if you want it up there you
have to start over and authorize it it's
just the store and then it played out
that earlier in 2010 he had said we do
not upload or store any data then Gawker
put up a story saying he's a big fat
liar of course at the time that he wrote
that mail saying we don't do that they
weren't actually doing it that came
later so I came later with the newest
release but I can't cut a break I mean I
what what's interesting about this is
that what he did was wrong and it
actually technically may have violated
the terms of service that Apple has with
developers Apple of course makes didn't
do much to protect that from happening
they do protect location
data but they don't protect contact data
in the same way so they'll probably
change that and uh yeah it's just been a
bad day was a really bad day for path
yeah we put up a little poll on the
article that you wrote after their
apology about how people would be
reacting yeah to this and with the
options where is paths apology enough
you know if a is it's an it's enough for
me thanks Dave be no I'll never trust
path again see I don't see what the fuss
was about and after voting with this you
know kind of smaller sample size but
still good enough 55-percent people of
the respondent said no I'll never trust
path again yeah say people people don't
like that they don't like not they don't
like non-trans opaqueness path should
have been way more clear about what they
were doing and why they were just
running so fast they got ahead of
themselves and it was a big mistake and
it's hard I doubt that they
intentionally have a right to do that
like maliciously I don't know no look
I've interviewed Dave Morin who's a CEO
of path and uh i believe i really
believe him talking to him and seeing
what he's been trying to do and watching
path be developed that he's actually
trying to build a good service and not
trying to steal people's data as not
what this company is about however he
screwed up yeah you know and people are
not for people are not very forgiving on
the net especially when they can hide
behind pseudonyms and say is it you know
rotten jerk get it just let it go are
you all for real names on the internet I
think Facebook is onto something with
that hmm all right also if you want to
talk about you know identifying yourself
knowing who you really are if you guys
heard about this story the FBI did a
background report back in the day around
nineteen ninety-one on Apple co-founder
Steve Jobs the late Steve Jobs after he
was considered for an appointment on
George HW Bush's president export
council so they've released some of
these the actual report it's it's a long
report and it just I don't know if it
necessary veiled anything we didn't know
about jobs but you know everyone kind of
had a little fun with it just the fact
that he could have been on the export
council he would have been great well
what's the was the question than what
the number one the thing that kind of
came out of this is when they directly
asked them are you a communist I'm
surprised that I mean I saw that in the
in the PDF there I'm surprised that is
still a question that we ask people but
that's not for the topic for this show I
like how it's an x mark yes or no in an
xbox right that's like a Rico thing have
you evaded any taxes it's like I don't
know have you have you ever been was it
have you ever been a member of any type
of group or organization which plans to
overthrow our government well apples
worth more than our government right now
so much he could have probably said yes
on that one so anyways it's like a
50-page report if you really want to
look at it all I chose not to it's fun
it's all your tax dollars at work you
know they could have just read the
Isaacson book they would have said you
know but this was ten years ago I was
over that was a long time ago 28-20 it
was it 20 years ago really yeah 91 how
little he has changed had changed sorry
alright guys so we got a little bit of
science news to you brought to you by
our buddy Steven Beecham's so this is
very interesting story some scientists
and researchers at the University of
Berkeley headed by Brian Paisley have
discovered how to read people's minds
and convert convert their brain waves
into actual audible sound those people
never do that yeah yeah I can't read
minds but I think in the future we're
going to be able to read minds so
basically they've been able to isolate
in the brain where we actually hear
different frequencies so our brains
process different frequencies like
there's one specific part of our brain
that'll like here 1,000 Hertz and
another part that'll here like five
thousand Hertz so they've been able to
manipulate that into actually producing
an audible sound so I actually have a
sound of them reading someone's brain so
I'll really have for you right now yeah
that's pretty interesting
that does not sound that mercial huh but
anyway this is your brain on alcohol
right yeah yeah so uh basically here it
is here is Waldo Oh structure your doubt
Oh property okay so that is the computer
interpreting someone's thoughts and
turning it into an audible sound that
you can hear and perceive and make out
so what's the phrase was the first part
what the actual person said and then
they played how the brain actually
interacts I said right so the clear
woman was talking and then the then the
computer is reading their brainwaves and
repeating it back to them what were they
hooked up to to do this were they in a
scanner of some sort yeah I think they
just let electrodes and you know like
tons of wires and cables I'm not exactly
sure they don't really go into that to
the article but it is you know thought
police are coming soon so I mean the
cops going to look at you and be able to
scan what you're thinking I like the
yeah I like the metaphor they use for it
to where there was like musician looking
at someone playing the piano but the
stands off the musician would be able to
detect just by what notes were being
played visually what the sound would be
so that's kind of the same way they're
making the connections between you know
seeing their the actual you know
electrons yeah they're saying so like if
when you read a sentence if you just
read it you don't say it out loud your
brain produces the sound inside your
head so you're like hearing yourself
talk so that's that's what they're
trying to that's what they're trying to
isolate here and create into an audible
sound so next week Google will pay you
to wear the electro cap on your head so
that they can hear your thumb imine I
think I guys be quiet i'm hearing my
brain thing good recording anything
there brian just all blank right now but
I'm trying all right guys we want to
hear what you guys have to say about our
show last week we asked you about
Pinterest um we got a lot of responses
so let's just see what we have in the
feedback
you know we were trying to figure out
who pinterest really is for some people
say women some people say guys a lot of
people say women but we have some
voicemails from Erin in champaign and
others of you that will help us clear
this up hey guys they're in for
champagne i was calling in regards to
the last week's show or yes this week's
show about pinterest i just heard about
it here not too long ago but i'm
actually getting married in about six
months and my fiance is beings using
pinterest like a crazy woman to figure
out like a design for our wedding
invitations for centerpieces for the
tables different ideas for cakes and all
this other stuff so like our whole
wedding is almost being planned by
pinterest so i'm not into it some of the
craft stuff that people at church and
friends are do your kind of cool but not
exactly it dude thing so what if you
might do since on up interest of the
show let's not let's not make too many
assumptions crafts can be dude things I
feel model rockets with my time saying
then that considered dia I mean I
thought I'd another reader wrote in DIY
craft stuff is being on pinterest as
well what other things do you craft um
you are you a scrapper your youness
scrapbooking right luckily you look like
a scrapper I'm not I'm not be scrapping
I'm okay it sounds very don't kind of
dirty the way you said I did not Donald
scrapping no not so much but I do feel
like a lot of the DIY project stuff for
dudes there's already like instructables
and make magazine and that kind of I
don't know why I would need a separate
site to build there is something about
the way Pinterest is like a pinboard of
you tag or thumbs up are there and by
the way go to pinterest calm
pinterest.com / cnet somebody here set
up a scene at Pinterest of page which is
kind of cool um it's there's something
about the design yeah I gotta get flamed
honest I'm going to get totally flame on
this or something about the interaction
design the UFC directrix line that
really appeals to women wait you know it
does it's the demographics bear it out
and I you know flame me as much as you
want it just look at the numbers it is
huge I was I was going to
I was gonna agree and I thought you were
gonna say that you like the UI I think
it's a beautiful you are but I never use
it it doesn't appeal to me at a basal
ganglia levels like yeah okay but it is
working in the other demographic and its
really really interesting to show to see
that they're big a difference there is
there yeah all right now we have another
call from a gentleman who wants to tell
us how he feels about Pinterest hey guys
just want to let you know love the show
my wife just showed me pinterest during
the Super Bowl we don't have any
interest in Pinterest I'm not actually a
dude and my wife described it as great
ideas that girls can give one other so
there you go have a good one I feel like
Molly would have to say something when
the guy had to clarify i'm actually a
dude I think we got that just just let
you know okay um also someone else is
called in to say he might have found
what the purpose of Pinterest really is
hey guys just wanted to tell you what I
thought about Pinterest I try to join
but you have to be part of Facebook or
Twitter and I want to like have all that
noise in my life but my girlfriend like
daily is like wanted me to build
something she saw on pinterest or cook
something she's on pinterest and I'm
kind of over it thank you i have you put
on the fit yet and i'm tired of it yeah
it's like he's making my girlfriend
asked me to do things german girlfriend
you're doing it wrong ok throw up there
you know some you know chili recipes or
stuff like that I'm just saying come on
build me this honey yeah hook me this
honey wow that's a that's a tough
customer there yeah all right um so
there you go sim your voice in with
Pinterest I guess who will play the last
voicemail a little bit but we just
wanted to quickly go over some of a
couple of the emails that we had one of
them was really cool this was sent to us
from Nicole and Nicole said hi bol crew
I think this sums up pinterest perfectly
is this really a great chart off a
tumblr she said
I have a Pinterest account in I am
female but I just don't get it if I want
to share something I find online with my
friends I do it on facebook or twitter
if I want to save something for later i
use Instapaper and if i don't want to
make something as to buy i do it on
amazon I just don't see how pinterest
fits in so maybe this is where a man
lets exactly let's look at this chart so
according to this completely accurate
pie chart where we have no source of
data collection um it looks like a
majority of people on pinterest use it
to plan their wedding this is about
point two percent men about 0.5%
designers want to be foodies and then
take some painting their wedding this of
course is made up this chart but I have
to say still useful I had I have to say
just to be clear about that because
Brian sometimes I'm not sure but but if
pinterest isn't if Pinterest has managed
to secure the wedding planning industry
wow that good job Pinterest business
guys there's no doubt it's not a bad
thing oh it's huge that's a really
business so all right let's read this
other email about Pinterest this one
comes to us from Gloria see ladies you
need to call in I like how the ladies
right but I'd like to hear you calling
as well but Gloria writes and says hi
buzz crew first I'm a lady so maybe what
I have to say is not what you're looking
for but i really like Pinterest i'm
planning a wedding so I'm pulling
together images of flowers and a
hairstyles that I really like to help
with inspiration I also like to find
other recipes pottery I'm a Potter so I
like to see what other people are doing
with their work and other creative ideas
through Pinterest but I can see where
it's like a niche and I and market for
people who were four people two X
chromosomes I do find it overwhelming at
times and have trouble with self
curation we'll see how it changes as it
develops as my fiance who introduced me
to bol he said when he discovered I was
on the site certain females love
Pinterest it's true I didn't want to
read the quote directly because I just
write it for the first time I had to be
really pc appropriate yeah now you you
did that all too well yeah yeah that's
amazing
a lot all right um I'm not gonna do that
again but we do have a final a voicemail
and then two more emails a final
voicemail from our buddy Brett who we
get corrected a lot here Brett wanted to
make a correction of his own hello this
