cell phone yeah or maybe some kind of
software grantee virus antivirus
software or a new cell phone have you
ever heard of venmo yes just last night
just last night yeah explain my boss was
talking about asking if I was Ven
knowing someone as like no so what would
you tell the venmo people about their
app it sounds like a neat idea but it's
probably just not for me right now yeah
all right well anyway this is a chrome

then he sold venmo a while ago so maybe
he can buy you dinner or something
hell yeah and where should we go what do
you think ven most stands for doing it

mean do you know like what it stands for
I have no idea but I'd like to know what
would you guess
with entry not all right yeah so where
this is the clothes like we're basically
done great so what does been most stand
for vendor meets mobile so vendor mobile
to combine his venmo vendor mobile
