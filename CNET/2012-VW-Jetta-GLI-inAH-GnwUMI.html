VW D content did the Jetta to bring it
down in price to compete better with
Camry and Accord certain engineering
sacrifices had to be made to get there
but here's the model that answers all
those snide comments about it being a
German Accord this is the Jetta GLI
Autobahn let's drive it and check the
tech now right off the bat these GL eyes
get an LCD head unit you get all excited
then you start looking around there's no
button that says nav that's because LCD
doesn't equal navigation in this car
part of their pricing strategy to keep
Jenna's grounded in their cost what you
have is your AM and FM radio is also HD
radio on this guy because of this trim
level satellite radio is serious they
give you three months when you buy the
car media's where it gets interesting
single CD slot up here on the top SD
card down here media in that's this
thing this MDI multi interface connector
right now we've got an iPod cable on
there and then Bluetooth audio is for
streaming you do have base Bluetooth
hands-free in jeta's but I'll tell you
this LCD touchscreen is kind of
irrelevant I don't know for such simple
things especially without navigation if
I need a touchscreen bass output on a
GLI is going to be six speakers and
indiscriminate amplification we have the
Autobahn Edition that brings in the
equally inscrutable Fender audio eight
speakers plus one sub I just don't think
it's that impressive a system it's fine
but the Fender brand doesn't say
accurate sound to most people it says
guitars to most people and the Autobahn
Edition also includes this power moon
roof up here dual zone automatic climate
control this very nice faux leather they
call it V Tech's kind of like a take on
Mercedes mb-tex it's a really nice
material and you also get 18-inch
fancy-looking wheels one more step up is
to get the navigation trim level which
adds navigation it's kind of a crude
system but it's something and it's only
seven hundred bucks for that package
now the heart of the GL i's story is the
engine this is a great one two litre
sidesaddle four turbocharged
direct-injection a lot of good stuff
going on here 200 horsepower 207
foot-pounds of torque gets this 3100
pound car to sixty and six and a half
seconds just fast enough I would say
while delivering 22 33 mpg that power
goes out of one or two gearboxes your
base is a six-speed manual thank you but
you can also get a 6-speed direct shift
dual clutch that's what we've got let's
go see how that works
all this direct shift gearbox is one of
the better especially considering it's
in an affordable car of the dual clutch
manuals are all the rage right now got
paddles here on the wheel we didn't show
you but they're pretty common these days
response is good it's not jerky but it's
really crisp and tight and I find that
the sport mode down here on the gate is
also another good choice it seems to be
well programmed makes a nice note when
you get in it and the power delivery is
pretty even for a turbo of small
displacement this is different than the
base Jetta which has this kind of
torsion beam rear suspension that's
pretty crude stuff we've got independent
rear suspension multi-link apparatus on
this car it does handle very nicely once
in a while I got some kind of rear up
and some front wheel hop so I would lose
traction but that was pretty infrequent
that said I think I would still go for
the manual gearbox or at least drive one
seriously if I was going to buy one of
these cars because this just seems
elaborate to me the message around a
jetta is one of pretty straightforward
simplicity and this is a level of
translation that I don't need I'd give
my own with a clutch I think the last
note is where does this car fall between
sporty and everyday comfortable on this
GLI we've got 18 inch wheels and
correspondingly lower profile tires you
get quite a bit of tire drum in this car
on the other hand this generation of
Jetta has a much more compliant ride in
the outgoing
so somewhere in the GLI family is the
right mix I might go for a straight GLI
and not the autobahn edition that was
the manual gearbox is humbly my perfect
