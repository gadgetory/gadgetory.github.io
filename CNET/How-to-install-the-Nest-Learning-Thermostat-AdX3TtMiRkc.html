way to start making your home smart and
the installation process is simpler than
you might imagine here's how it works
the UK edition of the nest comes with a
plug heat link micro USB cable for power
the base and an optional trim plate
your installation process may vary
depending on your boiler types so seek
help from an electrician when fitting
yours choose a space on your wall that's
close to the power outlet that you'll
use for the nest then drill a hole big
enough to fit the microUSB cable after
connecting it to the plug insert the
micro USB into the socket on the bases
inside rim then ensuring it's level
screw the base to the wall over the hole
the base has a spirit level built in to
help you keep it straight
attach the nest display by pushing it
onto the base until you hear a click
next connect the nest to your Wi-Fi
network and check for software updates
though a Wi-Fi connection is necessary
to control the nest with your phone your
thermostat will still work if your
network fails it communicates to your
boiler via a dedicated radio frequency
the nest receives the radio frequency
through the heat link which you install
next as it's permanently hardwired the
heat link is the part that communicates
with your boiler to correctly install
your nests wiring consider hiring a
professional electrician and use a
circuit that matches your existing
heating system helpful wiring diagrams
are included in the instruction booklet
that comes in the box then screw the
heat link to your wall or cupboard near
your boiler
complete the circuit by connecting the
other ends of the wires to the boiler
now turn your boiler on the light at the
top of the heat link will turn blue when
it's trying to link to the nest once
connected the light will turned green
then you can snap the cover back on to
the healing finally go back to your nest
and choose your boiler type from the
list and input other settings like the
type of fuel the boiler uses then you
can test the system by selecting a
temperature and enjoy your new warm
smart Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
