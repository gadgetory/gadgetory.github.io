tech stuff
like I can't wait till we have
driverless cars everywhere I think
that'll be interesting because it'll
just be a matter of time before people
figure out that they can just get a car
for their dogs you're like honey we're
the dogs I got a car they're just
driving around for an hour imagine being
at a red light and a car full of dogs
just pulled up
hey honey it's mom
I love the drawers Sam I know that it's
a lot of work you'll get it done call me
if you need a pep talk I know you can do
it oh and don't forget to eat love you
bye message say it's what you've got is
first big thing in your life you're
never gonna get over it
hey how's your dad doing he's okay I
guess some sort of cross-training phase
of grief
it's a dramedy that's how people are
describing it why was it important for
you to make this room your movie the
movies about grief and loss and coming
out of grief and I lost my dad when I
was young when I was 20 my dad passed
away and he was 46 he was young
my mom was widowed at 41 so our family
was really devastated and in many ways
has never recovered we are fine and we
moved on in some ways but you know you
just never get over it and I want to go
back to a Daily Show skit it's about
tech those super famous you introduced
the world of The Daily Show audience to
social networks yeah talking about
MySpace and you did a whole song about
your 9,000 followers on MySpace I
checked this morning your Twitter
followers are three hundred and seventy
two thousand plus how would you do that
skit today in the world that we live in
social networks man I don't think I
could do that skit today and I it's I
find it very humbling I don't know how
you all get your heads around it as
things change it seems by the minute I
find it as a public person very
difficult to navigate social media and
as a 44 year old man I feel somewhat
alienated I don't get a lot of it I
don't want to be on Facebook life I
don't I don't want people to have smiley
faces flying in front of what I'm doing
jokes I
hate it I think it's insidious and it's
fun by Theodore they're purposefully
manipulating people's pleasure centers
in their brains and I think it's five
I'm worried for my kids and for myself
so I don't know I think I would opt out
I'd be like books man paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
