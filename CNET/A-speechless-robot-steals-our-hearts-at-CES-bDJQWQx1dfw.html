CES 2017
this is CES in depth on day one of the
show this is the formal opening of the
day I'm Brian Cooley dr. Scott Stein
here as usual to monitor my condition in
case there are any health emergencies
he's ready to jump in the breech to make
sure make sure the show continues on PhD
comes next year we're here to talk about
the biggest trends at the show so far
that's what you'd imagine from a best of
CES show now first up Scott we're gonna
talk about adorable robots like Curie
hoping the whole rise of little robots
here that I until this show thought were
the stupidest thing on earth and then I
got a look at Curie and I'm smitten it
is adorable and that's what they're
trying to do dammit they're trying to
win us over and they are intelligence
yeah that is a trend adorable robots
patted robots cute robots googly googly
cuddly beeping robots and curry is a
surveillance robot this should creep us
out right but yeah it is actually
really cute it's engaging and that's the
great victory here we were talking about
this yesterday computer vision
artificial intelligence those have been
advancing really rapidly yeah and so
these robots move in the same way as
before but they're doing many much more
powerful points more smart and intuitive
because of that like I said the
democratization of machine learning and
computer vision and the fact that they
are going first at the adorability
factor which sounds ridiculous but I
think it is absolutely the way you sell
not just the category but your specific
entry in it because I believe the
functions of these robots will all be
commodity they'll all do about the same
thing just like our phones
just like our televisions just like
everything else but who's gonna win in
the end is the one that I and this is
crazy to say the one that I have a
relationship with and there's a stealth
thing going on here we use Amazon echo
we talk to things but there's they're
hitting a wall so maybe things like this
are exploring how those devices will
start engaging next yeah they might
start developing ways to try to get our
attention
feel like they're responding to us more
so we don't feel like we have that oh I
don't understand you
can't respond to that query happens to
me all the time on any voice device
what's this thing about Curie though
people look at this we're talking about
echo and LexA and all that as Curie
doesn't talk Curie can hear you
but kiriona communicates with facial
expressions head turns and little r2d2
like beeps and blurps yeah I want that
that that head sitting on top of an
Amazon echo I want like a little robot
head so if it doesn't know we could turn
its head to the side I do want the power
of Alexa in this thing probably be
announced any day now all right I mean
if not they're insane it's out there but
I don't you and I are talking yesterday
I'm not sure I wanted to try too hard to
be specifically human and maybe really
good voice and I can't believe I'm
saying this maybe really good voice is a
bridge too far that it can it'll lose
its specialness because in a year from
now everything's gonna be talking to us
in natural language that's gonna go
commodity - right and it makes sense for
some things not to talk because if you
have one thing you're talking to in your
home
we already probably have this now in our
homes you talk to something in the more
than one thing respond right and then
waves coming yeah and it's like already
kind of happening and so you can't have
that and one company's not gonna win
your home unless you become like I mean
I don't think so I think you'll still
have some device that doesn't connect so
you got to have some be silent and be
responsive in other ways it's like kids
in the household you you think we're
nuts I don't blame you but when you get
a chance to check this little robot out
I think it's the leader in the category
it's a $699 mayfield robotics is
bringing it out they're taking
pre-orders now you do $100 deposit like
a like a very affordable Tesla and they
don't deliver until a year from now it's
if it slips we're into 18 so this is
down the road aways but I gotta say I
was taken and I don't like robots
so this impressed me this is the CES of
the robot this is what it is look back
years from now sitting there having a
cool refreshing cocktail and a smoke
when served to us by robots by robots
and so remember member 17 that damn
robot ear and we'll be taking it to a
robot remember that I do not remember
that smiling or Romani language yeah all
right
Curie was cute cute is a cute as a
button LG OLED w years and
with these things I am right yeah
actually when go check I checked it out
and it's amazing I took a picture of it
people can believe how fat it was and if
your shows TVs can be damn cool is still
and you know sure do you need a thin TV
do you need a big TV like that that's
that thin but it is amazing to look at I
need a thin TV more than I need 140 inch
TV which we normally see here I don't
think I heard anybody roll out a TV that
is the new world's biggest no.1 now for
the first time and I think 10 years I
have not heard that here instead I saw
world's thinnest and that makes so much
more sense to me than a TV that I
literally can't get through a standard 8
foot door in an average home I love the
idea of applying it like wallpaper or
you know if you could eventually just
put these up easily that's the other
thing is mounting them easily pounds is
nothing for b2b hire someone and and as
we notice we're looking the video now it
has a sound bar that is more than a
sound bar that is also the breakout box
if you will wear a thin flat ribbon
comes off this very thin tenth of an
inch screen goes to that sound bar and
on the sound bar you see right there are
all your ports for HDMI USB your audio
connections and power as well so the
power goes up through a flat ribbon
nothing spoils the the illusion of
floating except for a very flat ribbon
cable that your you know here maybe
you're gonna run it if you want to be
ambitious or just put that thing down
with some double sticky tape and paint
it I'm sure that's sacrilege and in LG
world that's what I would do
I got a roller I'll paint that damn
thing put some Scotch double stick
behind it I'm done why is there more
wire hiding paint special textured yeah
it's like putty like that okay now you
gotta explain this one to me the razor
laptop that came out that supports
multiple high performance monitors I get
it but I don't get it right it's the
classic CES laptop this is the this is
the computer those concept ones that
keep appearing and it's the most absurd
or the coolest thing you've seen a user
loves doing this razor is the king of
CES showstopper ideas my question my
question this is a single three panel
articulated monitor not three monitors
all stuck because the same guy on
stainless yeah they pull out okay it's a
makeup mirror yeah I'll pull out make
make your own crazy makeup mirror
of magic screens okay and there was a
laptop in the past that did something
like this with the second display but
not this big and and you know Dan
acraman showing this right now there are
games that take advantage of multiple
monitors there are tons of them yeah and
you know you have immersive VR headsets
there are reasons to connect monitors
and screens you don't need them all in
one laptop though you could set them up
yourself I weigh more get it now that
I'm seeing the packaging this is a great
industrial design exercise where these
all unfold from a thick lid and go out I
thought it was just three monitors that
kind of we're all cabling individually
to ready your minds
know at the right price a lot of people
would go for that that's very slick
industrial design it's cool and if you
start developing screens that Bend more
in the future maybe a future screen tech
yeah would start going plans and curved
screens makes sense because cursor means
don't make sense for groups they don't
make sense for the family TV but they do
make sense for the individual user who's
positioned properly for immersion at the
just the right arm's length and now you
have to wonder if that competes with VR
it's not as immersive but close yeah I
agree and I think for gamers there's a
real question if if your game looks
really great at high resolution do you
want to put something on in VR that
right now is a lower resolution but by
higher immersion and a lot of people
don't like that and the interfaces are
different you know a lot of four-person
games don't port the same way of course
so you may want to agree a lot of people
might prefer to add the monitors okay
that's that that's cool I do get it now
it was losing my step there for the
monitor resolution now VR na are of
course still advancing here at CES not a
new topic by any stretch but Intel tried
to kind of make things go and kind of
kick it a little bit with a 3d video
walkthrough demo of a core technology
that they've got you've gotten a look at
this right this I haven't seen yet okay
that's video I think people at the press
conference did yesterday the press
conference where the media that attended
actually had VR headsets on as Intel
showed off what is AI I guess what you'd
call it as a highly movable placement of
you in the scene you can go anywhere at
any time yeah this is a knitting
together of a video into a 3d I think
they were calling on volumetric have a
render it it was tremendously high
bandwidth you're not going to be
gigabits per second gathering
crazy amount and but the ideas that you
could walk around in a 3d video or feel
like that I mean the effect is somewhere
between you know if it looks like
somewhere between like video game and
video but but but feeling like a real
video you can see there are kind of yeah
has a little bit of a Skyrim feel you
know like a like like it's a video but
or with its Witcher for I'll say this
this kind of thing is if you're gonna do
VR that's really the gold standard we
have to work toward is giving me the
ability not to be fixed in place not to
hop between selectable locations I need
to be able to move through this thing as
if it's in the world
yeah and for capturing I mean the
fantasy of capturing your memories or
some sort of place you've been and be
able to walk around in it later yeah
sure and I think everyone's trying to
strive to come up with a new idea in VR
all the big players in VR a lot of them
are taking the show off oculus rift
PlayStation VR into a use case wall
hardware the technologies they're the
use cases despite a lot of good minds
and various communities haven't found
that I don't think yet they haven't
found their Pokemon well and everyone I
know not everyone in a lot of people I
know who use VR myself included it
despite how amazed they are by if they
own it don't return to it quite as often
as they junk because it's a huge
commitment yeah and that yet overcome
that maybe it's smaller devices and you
have qualcomm intel and other players in
the market now all wanting to get
involved too and you can see a lot of
people throwing things against a wall
trying to and then incorporating
augmented reality which is even more not
there yet that's reality conversation
where we're seeing a lot of players say
wait a min let's give you some of the
very photorealistic imported objects and
people that we bring in from the VR
world but you're still seeing them
placed in your real world and as you
turn your head they don't move because
they're placed in the scene not placed
in your vision which is a very important
psychological difference and then if you
want to get really get ripped out by it
there's another way it works merged
reality or mixed reality and Intel calls
it merged there's another way it does a
project alloy and a couple of others
capture stuff in the real world scan it
and then put it into VR that's called
mixed reality too but it doesn't look
like things are in the real world it
does the opposite so you're in VR but it
also knows where your table is or
your your friend is in there and why do
you use that well that's what people are
trying to figure out and they wonder why
consumers are bewildered by AR and VR
and now we're gonna introduce them to
mix three hours a lot of time alright
let's go to the vomitorium as I call it
some companies showing off B are doing
it saying hey come stand here put on our
VR headset we're gonna blow you away and
they typically do but Samsung went to
the point of putting you in any number
of almost like Victorian torture devices
and then strapping on VR hears bTW this
bTW in there yeah biases we're holding
on site this we're chilling we're
children to we're gonna launch okay
alright there we go we're going down
this track we're gonna launch ladies and
gentlemen ladies and gentlemen we're in
space right now oh this is tight there's
about there's large ships or kind of
like star destroyers dude okay we're
going through these like little tunnel
targets us though okay okay more tunnels
more spaceships okay we're doing these
twisty things
oh there's some blue tunnel ah damn
hyperspace okay there's like asteroids
and more spaceships and airs blowing in
my face
I haven't wet myself yet I'm still
holding on about lunch oh okay now I'm
going through like crystals oh I'm
getting rocks
stay on target stay on target stay on so
clearly more tunnels more spaceships I
gotta try to have now famous last words
boom if you can't win people over with
VR make things and do it yeah forget it
forget it that's that's it they put
everything they could behind it anyway
nothing new in the technology but
something you may have never seen in
terms of the lengths the technology
companies will go to put you through an
experience here and sell the concept
there's a little thing going on here
that I think is it's ending at - exactly
no new tech it's gear VR but they're
striving for a theme park theme park
type experience probably no accident
because you don't have to buy the tech
necessarily and you only use it for a
short period of time and you can sense
there's a theme park ization feeling of
arcade the arc test it don't buy it and
so I think companies are actually trying
to figure that out and that match to
this thing we were just talking about
I'll people even own VR early on or
still they basically sample it there's
not a frequent use case yeah and so they
may be the first ones that discover you
know what this belongs like I think 3d
printers in the hands of vendors and
service companies not in every kitchen
counter and in the world
I'm glad Samsung wasn't trying to sell
us in a giant gyroscopic spinner for a
living room family hub gyroscope dead
serious tongue no tongue in cheek is
like absolutely every home should have
18 why wouldn't you want this yeah it's
coming
Alexa Perry oh yeah all right I think we
wrap up now with a concept card a lot of
motive here from Bosch a big supplier of
tech to many of the world's automakers
that has haptic touch gestures that's
not entirely new but also facial
recognition your phone as a key they
can't took all the greatest hits of
what's come
soon in cars and rolled it into one
concept of how we might deal with
vehicles in the future so here it is I
mean we're clearly looking at a concept
car nothing about this is remotely
realistic but if you look at the idea of
haptic facial recognition also voice
recognition is being talked about in the
industry a lot of this frankly is almost
this is Toyota's concept it has
something similar called Yui car
companies right now are trying to figure
out we need to have have a new
relationship between you and the car as
they start to become autonomous where I
can just leave you to twiddle your
thumbs we still want to be engaged with
you as a brand even though we're not
doing so by making you drive but we
still want to be involved with you
otherwise why are we doing this they
don't really care about autonomy unless
it leads to them having a more and
different relationship with the driver
because they're in this to sell cars or
services or something not to give you a
self-driving car and say go do what you
want with it yeah it's finding ways to
have to make it work to make it I keep
thinking more toy I was talking about
about making engaging with the driver
and developing a relationship that makes
sense responsiveness
yeah lot of that was about that was it
decrement of vigilance they talked about
there's a great phrase like that a
seminal study in the 40s Gill Pratt said
that they notice that radar operators on
warships back in World War two no matter
how intrigued they were about making
sure that they didn't have an attack
coming you eventually lose interest your
mind wanders you may be staring at the
radar still and you stop seeing things
because your eyes are bored I guess is
the simple way to put it so car makers
and Bosch here Toyota as well are
starting to talk about how do we get
cars to have a I guess a holding on
loosely relationship with you they're
not totally gonna have your attention
because they're gonna let you stop
driving still moving down the road but
they want to keep you vaguely and
lightly engaged like a little tap once
in a while to say hey remember we're
still we're still doing this together I
just had a thought that goes back to the
beginning what if we go full circle one
of those cute could those cute robots
end up at our cars
I want Kari to drive me out of here
right now like an adorable car interface
let's go under two cars thank you and
then the greatest heartbreaker of all
time when you realize that that you know
Curie knows the f-word when she has her
first road rage moment it's like come on
hurry I thought you were a darling
little thing all right that's it for CES
in depth for this first day of CES 2017
myself Scott Stein we're back here at
both mister back here tomorrow right
yeah I'll get my back on the deck
tomorrow same bat-time and channel and
all that and that'll be tomorrow and
we'll see you when programming starts
against the CNET stage at 9:00 a.m.
Pacific tomorrow until then enjoy the
show if you're still here have a good
evening we'll see you again tomorrow on
