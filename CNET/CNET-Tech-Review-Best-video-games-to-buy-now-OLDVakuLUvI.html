games I'm Jeff Beck or for cnet.com
thanks for watching moving right along
our console games too expensive well
brian Tong has some suggestions straight
from the dollar store oh yeah hey hey
hey guys welcome to tap that app i'm
brian Tong and this is the show where we
cover all the coolest and hottest apps
in the mobile space for mobile platforms
now today we're talking gaming and we
like our games cheap so we're showcasing
a few of the top 99 cent games for the
iphone and ipod touch now one of my
favorites and a favorite from the
Twitter world is doodle jump it's as
simple as you get your a character named
doodle and using the accelerometer you
tilt the phone to jump onto the next
platform but if you miss it's game over
there are items that send you hire like
Springs and applying hat or a rocket
pack and the higher you go the higher
you score this is a killer app now Cena
editor josh lowensohn favorite 99 cent
game right now is angry birds now these
birds are mad at pigs that stole their
eggs they want them back so using a
slingshot you'll fling yourself at them
to take them out there are over a
hundred and five levels they get more
tricky as you advance different birds
can attack in different ways and it's
another great pick up with a whole lot
of replay value there's also a few 99
cent classics that you might already
know about paki God is one of them and
it lets you play God on an island where
you control the environment and the fate
of the pygmies let them fish help them
build a fire or electrocute them and
feed them to the Sharks I like doing the
ladder and we all love paper toss it's
simple enough just flick a paper ball
into a trash can see how many you can
get in a row while a fan blowing at
different speeds mixes things up and the
last 99 cent game that we recommend is
Jason Parker's pic it's called zombie
smash protect your house from a zombie
invasion by flicking and throwing
zombies all around special weapons that
you can upgrade help you take them out
and yes you will look a little crazy
playing this in public because it gets
really frenetic but all these games and
the graphics are definitely tap worthy
that's it for this week send me what
apps you want to see or a theme you want
for a show at tap that app at cnet com
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys next time come on lazy ass out come
from Oh ladies yeah good recommendations
BTW but i'm not dancing with you sorry
okay let's continue with the good when
you think young hip and happening don't
you think microsoft maybe here's a body
job with a look at the kins hey everyone
i'm bonnie toss senior editor at cnet
com and today i've got your first look
at the Kin one and the kin to these
verizon bound phones were introduced by
blanco soft in april and unlike windows
phone 7 which is designed for a very
broad audience the Kin devices are aimed
at a very specific group the group of
people who are constantly on their
social networking sites checking out
what everyone else is up to and also
updating their own status and
whereabouts and both these phones are
centered around that social experience
obviously the Kin one and can to offer
two different looks which I'll talk
about a bit later but they're a lot more
alike than different first off they both
offer the same user interface which
consists of three home screens on the
left most screen shows all the phones
different apps such as email browser
music and video meanwhile the right pane
is where you can add all your favorite
contacts the center pane is called the
loop screen and it's where all the
action happens you can see in both your
phones with Facebook MySpace and Twitter
accounts and when you've done all that
the Kin will pull all your contact
status updates leaders picture uploads
and tweets to this loop screen but the
kins aren't just about seeing what other
people are doing is also about sharing
both devices have the spot feature which
is this little green dot stays at the
bottom of the screen if there's a story
or status or even a web page or map you
want to share with family and friends
you can simply do a long press and then
drag it down to the spot then you
navigate to your contacts
page and drag and drop everyone you want
to share it with and then send it via
text mms or email there's more to the
kin one and two than just social
networking though these will be the
first phone to ship with zune to port
including zune pass where you'll be able
to stream music / verizon's 3g network
and the kin one here offers 4 gigabytes
of internal storage while the kintu
offers eight gigabytes but neither have
expansion slots the phones also don't
have any gaming capabilities or a
calendar app which is kind of baffling
to me one other difference between the
two models is that the kin one has a
5-megapixel camera while the kintu has
an 8 megapixel camera and can also shoot
HD video obviously they differ in design
to the kin one is more interesting of
the two with its square shape but you
lose a little bit in the screen and
keyboard sighs since it's smaller
meanwhile the kintu has a more
traditional design but has the advantage
of a higher resolution screen and more
spacious keyboard the microsoft kin one
and two will be available for pre-order
starting may six and will be delivered
within 48 hours and will be in all
stores starting made 13 I'm Bonnie
jaundice has been your first look at the
kin one and Kim too well so I guess
those phones weren't as good as I
thought except maybe the cameras those
are good okay everybody let's take a
break in when we come back the actual
vat
for your daily dose of tech news check
out C nuts loaded it's packed full the
latest tech news highlights that matter
to you find out the latest gadgets or
the coolest gizmos all that more monday
through thursday at cnet com flash
loaded welcome back everyone and let's
get right to the bad or should I say the
iPad I hope this week the apple ipad 3g
which is more expensive and has monthly
fees wonderful hey I'm Donnell bell for
student calm and this is a first look at
the apple ipad 3g probably already
familiar with the original version of
the ipad which came out a month ahead of
this model the ipad 3g is essentially
identical to the standard ipad with the
added capability of connecting to the
internet using a built-in 3g cellular
connection for a broader rundown of the
ipads capabilities you can take a look
at my comprehensive review on cnet com
but for this video I'm just going to
zero in on the details to make the 3g
model unique first off you have pricing
the ipad 3g comes in the same three
capacities as the original only their
price set an extra hundred thirty
dollars each there's a 16 gigabyte
version for 629 dollars 32 gigabytes for
729 and 64 gigs for 829 on top of that
extra upfront costs users also need to
purchase a monthly data plan from AT&amp;amp;T
which you can activate directly on the
device under the settings menu there's
an option for cellular data where you
can choose between an unlimited plan for
thirty dollars or a fifteen dollar plan
with a monthly cap of 250 megabytes if
you go with the capped plan you can
always buy more data as you need it now
just because you have the 3g wireless
connection doesn't mean you need to use
it the Wi-Fi capabilities of the ipad 3g
are just as robust as the original model
and typically provide better speeds than
3g in fact if the ipad recognizes a
familiar Wi-Fi connection it will
automatically switch over to it and use
the 3g as a last resort ultimately what
this model gets you is the added freedom
to access the web on the go anywhere 3g
coverage is
available the 3g model also includes an
assisted GPS chip not found on the
standard version which makes it easier
for maps and other apps to track your
location for some these advantages are a
huge deal but we expect most people will
find the lower priced Wi-Fi only model
just as practical there are some other
small distinctions on the ipad 3g the
back has this two-tone design with a
streak of black plastic that helps the
internal 3g antenna work more
effectively there's also a tiny tray on
the side here that holds 18 T's micro
SIM card another telltale sign is the
little AT&amp;amp;T call out up here at the top
of the screen if you're using this over
Wi-Fi Apple race the ipad 3g at the same
10 hours as a standard model surfing
over 3g will knock you down to 9 hours
which is still exceptional for a device
that is as light and powerful as this so
that's the ipad 3g a more expensive
better connected fraternal twin of the
original ipad for cnet.com on Donald
Bell now regardless of which model you
get kids seem to love the ipad so here's
how to make it kid friendly and keep
them away from all that bad stuff on
there
hey I'm Donnell bell for cnet.com and
today I'm going to show you how to make
an iPad safe for kids my two-year-old
goes berserk for this thing with the
help of some sesame street videos or
coloring games I can keep him from
bouncing off the walls for at least a
few minutes that said I would never
leave him alone with the iPad partly
because he would delight and throwing
this thing down the stairs but mostly
because the internet is a nasty nasty
place you never know when an innocent
google search could turn into a lifetime
of therapy there's also the fact that
the itunes store and the app store on
the ipad are tied directly to my credit
card and might offer content i object to
even in preview form so how do you
sanitize the ipad to make okay for kids
to use unattended well Apple thought of
that just dive into the settings and
select general from the side menu you'll
see an option for restrictions click it
and hit the enable restrictions button
you'll be prompted to create a
four-digit passcode that you'll need to
enter if you ever want to change these
settings later on once enabled you can
selectively kill up access to the Safari
web browser the YouTube app the iTunes
and App Store and make it so that the
ipad doesn't report its location to any
of your installed apps you can further
lock it down to disable purchases from
within apps determine which countries
age appropriate rating system you want
to use disable playback of explicit
music and podcasts and select rating
requirements for movies TV shows and
apps after you're done just hit the home
button in all of your settings will be
saved just remember if you try to access
the restriction settings again to make
any changes you'll need to remember the
four digit password you created so
that's how to make the apple ipad safer
for kids you can also use the same
technique on the iPhone or the ipod
touch for cnet com on Donald Bell
if you don't want your kid hogging your
iPad maybe your kid will settle for this
as a substitute hi I'm Scott Stein
senior associate editor at cnet com and
this is the new Intel classmate now
there's not a laptop you're going to see
in stores per se but for many years
before the netbook there were the Intel
classmate line of computers that are
meant for the educational market for
kids to introduce them using computers
and to use globally now this laptop
looks a lot like a netbook and it really
is underneath there's an intel atom n450
processor 160 gig hard drive really the
things that are in a basic current
netbook so what exactly makes an
educational laptop well Intel's
classmate program has about 300
different partners that make a variety
of software tools and hardware tools
that plug-in Lego has a robotics kit
those also a weather app and and
peripheral that takes humidity levels
and temperatures and there are a number
of other devices currently they will
mcgraw-hill as a partnership with them
as well and in addition intel has
decided to partner with a number of
different manufacturers across the world
to take this design and get it out there
to as many people as needed the cost of
this laptop is 499 this is not meant to
purchase on your own in fact you're
going to really have a hard time trying
to buy it it's going to go through
institutions so you're probably it is a
good chance you might see your own kid
take on one of these one of these days
or maybe you already have this laptop
again it runs windows 7 professional in
the version that we looked at but it has
a really cool software interface on the
screen where educators can put a lot of
the apps and applications they're going
to be using to teach there's a math
wizard app on here there's also a great
art app and there a couple of others
that we found pre-installed that were
pretty fun to use and this is a
convertible netbook tablet the screen
rotates around and flips down and
there's a stylus the tucks into the back
that pulls out now it's not like an
iPhone or iPad it's not really meant to
be touched basis meant to be used with
the stylist a pressure based but it's
actually really nice for taking notes or
annotating there's even an e-reader app
that reads epubs and pdfs and allows you
to take notes on them we saw this in use
in a setting of the Central Park Zoo
where students ran around use
it for every testing temperature levels
to drawing pictures of the animals and
they seem to enjoy using it the case is
pretty holdable it's a it's a ruggedized
rubberized type feel which should help
not have a drop out of kids hands in
addition Intel tells us the edges are
shock absorbent and the hard drive will
also detect shock and be able to detach
when needed and there's a really nice
handle that comes out the back which is
not new for the classmate but it's a
little more integrated unless you to
hold it like a little school tote it's
pretty fun and while it does have a very
institutionalized look it's actually
pretty attractive and we enjoyed using
it and hay net bookmakers this is one of
the largest trackpads we've ever seen
we'd love to see that on some other
netbooks to the keyboard and the screen
are spill-resistant which is smart a lot
of the keys and side controls here are
rubberized rubber coated so hopefully
this is a kid proof of laptop as you'd
need a conclusion looking at it it's a
kind of cool little device and
particularly it's a relationship with a
number of software makers out there and
peripherals make it very tempting for
educational use there are a couple
little nice tricks to built into the
hardware the rebbe cam rotates which is
a nice touch for when using it tablet
mode and it actually has a 1366 x 768
10.1 inch screen which is higher res
than normal for 10 inch netbooks now the
real question is at 499 would you get
this or would you get an ipad for
educational use had to bring it up
because I even know people in education
that are considering getting an ipad for
their school students it may sound
impractical but that debate between
whether get a tablet or to go with the
netbook will be one they'll be had for
quite some time i'm scott stein and is
the intel classmate the 2010 generation
see it sounds pretty good but the bad
part is that you can't even buy it
anywhere which is a letdown and with
that let's get to the bottom line shall
we the last android based phone to take
down the iphone 3gs was the nexus one
now the very similar HTC droid
incredible is trying to deliver a second
iphone knock out let's see how it turns
out
what's up prize fight fans i'm brian
Tong and this is a special people Choice
prize fight the droid incredible is out
and you the cnet readers and viewers
pick the Challenger it's a prize 5 push
out between the HTC droid incredible and
the apple iphone 3gs our judges for this
fight our senior editor Bonnie boom boom
cha associate editor Nicole ice-cold Lee
and myself will do the honors we'll take
all three judges scores and average them
out to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system which phone pushes your
buttons so right because it turns you on
round one is sexiness the droid
incredible has a sleek and slender
profile is display is crystal clear it's
rubberized surface can take a beating
but what's up with its backside bonnie
likes the topographic design but I don't
and all they had to do is just smooth it
out now the iphone 3gs is still as
minimalist as it gets and its curvaceous
booty still gets me I know I need some
help but it's curved corners and clean
lines can get a little old and the scene
that staff wants something new but it's
still a sexy beast this rounds at I and
both phones get a 4.3 next round is
controls and user interface the
incredibles HTC Sense UI is the best
looking phone OS to date and it's a
snappy device say goodbye to track balls
and welcome the optical joystick I found
it easy to use when the colon Bonnie
didn't like it as much the touch buttons
were pretty responsive multi-touch is
here and unique settings like different
scenes for using your phone and quick
access to any panel without having to
scroll through it every page is slick
there will be a small learning curve
that's easy for geeks but not for my mom
we can't say it any more than we already
have but the iphone is the easiest
mobile OS to use power users might mock
it and want something more but
navigating the menus and applications
are a breeze multi-touch runs smoothly
across all apps and we know new features
are on the way but it's still just as
easy as it was from day one the iphone
3gs gets a perfect five and a droid
incredible gets a four
so after averaging two rounds the 3gs
leads by half a point and the incredible
has some work to do if it wants to live
up to its name next round is features
both phones have the core features like
3g Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS but this is
where the incredible shines it still has
the best voice search and commands pigs
feet turn-by-turn directions a
multitasking pulldown voice to text
integration hey you want to workout and
customization with widgets and themes
are unmatched the only thing we're still
waiting for is hands-free calling now
the iphone 3gs is still running the
iphone OS 3.0 voice commands are here
but they're not even on the same level
call arielle and there's no voice search
or text integration we still have to
purchase a turn by turn GPS solution and
multitasking is limited to listening to
music while using another app and
customization goes as far as arranging
your app icons the iphone has all the
core features but the incredible kicks
it up a notch and it gets the perfect
five and the 3gs gets a four next round
is web browsing to multimedia the
incredibles web browser finally brings a
smooth-running multi-touch it's multiple
windows take a cue from coverflow and
it's bookmark previews have put it on
the level with Safari flashlight is here
but I didn't find any sites that worked
well with it HTC's Sense UI has done
wonders with the media player interface
that I actually enjoyed videos look
great with its high res display
doubletwist syncs your media and then
you just throw in an 8 megapixel dual
flash LED camera with video capture this
is incredible indeed now the iphone has
been the standard for entertainment and
multimedia on a mobile phone it's media
player is still one of the best movies
look great but it's iTunes integration
whether you love it or hate it is what
brings it all together podcast support
is extensive anna match its web browser
is still a top notch mobile experience
its multi-touch and zoom and accuracy
plus it's cut copy and paste is better
executed and it has a 3 megapixel camera
without a flash that's dated but
serviceable but the incredible has
finally stepped up its game for all
android phones and
this round is a tie at four point three
apiece so after averaging four rounds we
are tied at 4.4 going into the final
round which phone has enough gas left in
the tank the final round that decides it
all is called quality and performance
the droid incredible is fast Bonnie
feels it's the fastest phone she's ever
used it snappy across the board and I
had no issues with lag then you talk
about its call quality on verizon's
network that was clear on both sides of
the line and no one experienced a drop
call the iphone 3gs is a great
performing phone that's snappy in its
own right but the incredible showed off
how fast the next beat of phones are
compared to the 3gs call quality wise
AT&amp;amp;T network is hit or miss depending on
where you live there are times where the
call quality was warmer than the
incredible but I experienced a few
hiccups and then you guessed it we all
had the same issues connecting calls or
those lovely drops so after entering the
final round tied the droid incredible
takes this round five to three point
seven so let's average out all five
rounds and in our first People's Choice
prize fight the HTC droid incredible
comes out victorious 4.5 to 4.3 and is
your people's champ we all know Apple's
newest contender is just around the
corner but take nothing away from the
incredible this is the best phone that
we've seen in this prize fight ring i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time on another
prize fight
the bottom line android it's a contender
and that's our show for this week

videos and a whole lot more over at cnet
