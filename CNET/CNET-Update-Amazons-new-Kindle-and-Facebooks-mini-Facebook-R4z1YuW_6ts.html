besides the iphone get ready for a new
Kindle and Facebook inception I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update to Amazon will soon launch a new
Kindle e-reader a new device called the
Kindle voyage popped up on the German
and Japanese versions of the Amazon
website but the listings were probably
accidentally published early because the
pages were taken down shortly after
going live there is no image but a
German website published this image from
a leaked user manual the voyage was
listed as having a six inch display and
it'll have 3g and Wi-Fi internet
connectivity it'll also have a feature
where you'll lightly tap on the frame
next to the screen to flip through pages
the last update to the Kindle line was
november of last year with a 3g version
of paperwhite so Amazon is due for its
yearly upgrade the launch date for
Germany and Japan was listed as November
fourth but it could be out sooner for
the US Facebook knows you like Facebook
so it's building a Facebook inside of
your Facebook I'm sorry to say that this
is not a joke Facebook is working on a
new app codenamed moments that's
according to a techcrunch report this
moment sap is just for sharing personal
things with your closest friends and
family you can already use privacy
settings to do this but apparently this
would be an easier way to do that it
sounds like Facebook's trying to create
a micro social network similar to the
idea behind the app path where you have
a limited number of friends and cluster
which lumps your friends into groups
that also sounds a lot like Google+
friends circles we'll have to wait and
see if this moment SAP ever does see the
light of day beyond Facebook's testing
lab and by now I'm sure you've heard
that the iphone 6 and 6 plus will be in
stores this Friday you can head to cnet
to read our in-depth reviews of the new
iphone models and learn the tricks to
using iOS 8 if you want a new iphone but
you don't know which to pick allow me to
give you a super quick guide the plus
costs a hundred dollars more and with it
you get a slightly bigger battery and
the camera has an extra image
stabilization feature as for if the size
is right for you walk into a cell phone
store pick up the sams
galaxynote3 and hold it up to your face
because that's what it's like to talk on
the plus size six or you could just wait
until the phones come out on Friday to
see it for yourself these bigger screens
may take some getting used to you may
need to do some finger stretches to
avoid cramping from holding it of course
with a bigger phone Apple hopes you'll
then want to want that Apple watch as an
accessory because you won't be strapping
that large phone to your arm during a
workout at the gym that your technique
is update you can stay updated every day
