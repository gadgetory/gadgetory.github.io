cheap projector you knew you're in for a
dim image with a terrible picture but
brands like BenQ have shown it's
possible to make a good performing
projector for under a thousand bucks
unfortunately the viewsonic Pro 8200
harkens back to the bad old days hi I'm
ty Pendlebury for cnet.com while the
viewsonic is based on the same DLP
technology as the Ben QW 1080 it is far
far worse in terms of aesthetics though
this is a handsome projector with a
distinctly sci-fi look it comes with
adjustable feet on the front and back
but sadly no lens shift luckily though
the digital Keystone is very good but
it's one of the only things that's good
about this
the ViewSonic offers a whole ton of
connections including two HDMI ports and
it also has an onboard speaker but its
picture quality that is the most
important thing with any display and
sadly this is where the pro 8200 suffers
black levels are fairly average colors
are way too saturated and shadow details
suffer from the worst crushing I think
I've ever seen given that the BenQ 1070
and 1080 are the same prices this
projector and offer a picture that's
probably ten times better
there's no reason at all to get the
viewsonic pro 82 this has been Taipan
