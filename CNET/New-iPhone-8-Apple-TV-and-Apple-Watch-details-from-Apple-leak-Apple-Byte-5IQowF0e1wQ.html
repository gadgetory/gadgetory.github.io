the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple last week
was a beast with all the Apple leaks
from the home pod firmware release but
guess what it's the gift that keeps on
giving
now let's start with the iPhone 8
because everyone wants more iPhone
goodies I know you do I help PR has
uncovered new code that suggests the
iPhone will be able to scan your face
even while the device is laying flat an
earlier Bloomberg report claimed the
facial recognition system would be more
nuanced capturing more data points
compared to touch ID and could operate
beyond simply scanning faces head-on now
your smartphone could be unlocked even
when it's at an odd angle with Apple's
new face unlock a tweet by Bloomberg
smart durman says Apple will pitch face
ID as being quicker more secure and more
accurate than touch ID and people inside
Apple say it is now the facial
recognition system will likely work also
with Apple pay with references for pearl
resting inside the payment verification
data pearl refers to pearl ID which is
the codename for Apple's facial
recognition system I helped PR has also
found that the iPhone 8 may record 4k
video at 60 frames per second for both
the front and rear cameras the current
iPhone 7s rear camera Accords 4k at 30
frames per second and the front-facing
camera is limited to 1080p right now
Gellhorn Rambo discovered a new smart
camera feature that suggests the new
iPhone can auto detect different types
of scenes conditions or things such as
fireworks foliage pet sports the sky or
snow there's also a freeze motion
feature to recognize a fast moving
target and capture a photo at an ideal
moment and we know with these phones
these days it's all about the camera and
for the 426 of you and last week's
comments without Apple leaked this on
purpose do you still really think that
because come on they didn't there is no
way they leaked all of this on purpose
just no way all right we can always
count on Foxconn for even more iPhone
goodies an employee has allegedly taken
photos of the new iPhones internals that
were posted on social media site Weibo
you see that a large black spot in the
center yeah that rep
the iPhones wireless charging coil and
we've been expecting that as one of its
long rumored features and remember the
Palm Pre way way back in like 2009 that
was one of the first phones with
wireless charging this is expected to be
Apple's first eight years later all
right cagey eyes Ming cheek well reports
at all 2017 iPhones will come in only
three colors black silver and gold that
also matches up with a recent iPhone
dummy model leaked Kuo also believes all
phones will be announced together in
September and Apple will launch them all
on the same date based on his knowledge
of the mass production starting in mid
September with the iPhone 8 being
extremely limited at first other reports
claim the new iPhone 8 launch could be
delayed until October November but we'll
have to wait and find out all right
enough about the iPhone for now let's
talk about Apple TV a reference to a 4k
HDR display mode in the home pods
firmware backs up rumors that Apple has
been testing a 4k 5th generation Apple
TV Yale home Rambo also found strings
that could indicate support for both
Dolby vision and HDR 10 Apple recently
listed select movies from iTunes as 4k
and HDR in the iTunes history in Canada
and the UK now the movies are still only
playing in SD or 1080p but it could be
another sign that they're preparing to
drop a new Apple TV on us this year and
the man of really the past week Stephen
Chow Smith tweeted screenshots of
Apple's TV OS simulator running in 4k
with a screen resolution running at 3840
by 2160 there is no clear launch date
but come on Apple you got to get this
out in time for the holiday season all
right a Bloomberg story over the weekend
reports Apple is planning to release an
LTE version of the Apple watch later
this year that will reduce its
dependence on the iPhone
the report says Intel will supply the
new modems for this series 3 watch an
apple is already in talks with carriers
in the US and Europe about offering the
cellular version gizmo is the internal
code name for the series 3 Apple watch
and developer Jeffrey Grossman even
found references to gizmo in the home
pod firmware that refers to the cellular
radio reportedly supplied by Intel now
reports claimed Apple and plan to
release this LTE version of the
last year but chose to hold off on it
due to battery issues Apple is still
working on ways to improve the battery
life and they really have no choice to
make this the independent watch we've
been waiting for and before we go we had
so much stuff to get through last week
we didn't want to forget to pay our
respects to the iPod Nano and the iPod
shuffle you see Apple remove the - from
its website an online store and
confirmed the media players have been
discontinued so we wanted to take a
moment to remember them
okay it reminds me though that I still
have my original iPod and it still works
like a charm like this guy right here
this is a collector's item no crap okay
well that's gonna do it for this week's
show you know what you can email us at
the Apple bita cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong thanks so much for watching
and we will catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple
oh crap okay what the hell happened here
no it's not funny man this is like a
collector's item dude sucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
