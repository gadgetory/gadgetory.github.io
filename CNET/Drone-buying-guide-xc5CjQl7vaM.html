a lot of things to consider mainly what
type of drone you want to buy they come
in all shapes and sizes from toy drones
that cost about twenty dollars all the
way up to high-end camera drones that
cost thousands of dollars when it comes
to toy drones what you should consider
is where you're going to fly it if
you're just looking for something to fly
around your living room there are ones
that you control with your phone or tiny
ones that just aren't suited for flying
outdoors and those usually range in
price from about twenty dollars to a
hundred or so dollars the more money you
spend of course the more features you
get and generally the more stable
they'll be some of them do have cameras
but they're not going to be great
quality if you want a better quality
camera experience you're gonna want to
step to a dedicated camera drone you'll
get a better quality camera that's
something along the lines of either a
entry-level point-and-shoot up into
something like a really good action cam
of course if you go above that and spend
thousands of dollars you'll get a really
good large sensor camera equivalent to a
digital SLR you'll also want to consider
what's stabilizing the camera whether
that's electronic stabilization which is
done digitally in camera or in actual
mechanical gimbal and then there are
models that have a combination of both
of those selfie drones are a subset of
camera drugs they're mostly designed to
catch quick aerial shots of yourself and
your friends and family they fold up
usually and you can stick them in your
bag they're not really designed for
flying they're typically flown with your
phone or in some cases hand gestures
they usually are priced between a
hundred and five hundred dollars
Racing droids are pretty much a DIY
thing mostly because they crash a lot
and did you need to be able to repair
them now that's starting to change as
more companies are starting to diversify
them and make other categories of drones
such as racing drugs when it comes to
battery life a small drone it's gonna
have a pretty low battery life toy
drones get between five and ten minutes
of flight time selfie drones will get
about fifteen to twenty minutes of
flight camera drones will get between
twenty and thirty minutes of flight now
all of that again is going to depend on
how hard you're flying it wind
conditions and generally how many
features you have turned on on the drone
the more money you spend usually the
better features you get on toy drones
that stuff usually gets left off so
while you might get a beginner toy drone
it will be harder to keep in the air
than a higher-end drone with a bunch of
safety features in GPS whenever drone
you end up buying just be careful be
considerate and read the manual</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
