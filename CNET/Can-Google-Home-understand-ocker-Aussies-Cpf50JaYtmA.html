it's ready to simplify your life and
turn your house into a smart home but
like a lot of Americans that arrive down
under we're not so sure how it's going
to go with the language so we're keen to
check out can Google home speak astray
all right so let's start with the basics
okay Google
what's brekkie brekkie breakfast hey
Google let's throw a shrimp on the
barbie
I think you mean throw a prawn on the
barbie okay Google what is a Bobby Bobby
a doll representing a conventionally
attractive young woman yeah it turns out
you can take google home out of America
but you can't take America out of Google
home all right the next test is politics
now this device is available in the UK
and Canada but will it know who our
prime minister is okay Google who's the
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is the
Prime Minister of Australia for now
finally sports Australians either love
it or they couldn't give a rat's so hey
Google who won the 2016 grand final
the 2016 AFL Grand Final was won by the
Western Bulldogs all right how do you go
on League hey Google how did the
Rabbitohs go last year sorry I'm still
learning about League but when I do I'll
be giving you short Falls up the middle
whenever you need them alright my
favourite sport then hey Google who's
gonna win the Bledisloe Cup this
season's been so unpredictable the
umpires could win it yeah when Google
thinks the umpires are better than the
Australian rugby union team that's a
problem so all in all fairly mixed
results for the Google home but we've
got to admit we're fairly impressed with
a smart speaker but why don't we let it
have the final verdict hey Google are
you heaps good holy Dooley I'm not sure
that'll do Pig that'll do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
