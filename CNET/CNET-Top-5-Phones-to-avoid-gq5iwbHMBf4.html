market is relentless to keep up
sometimes carriers and manufacturers let
through a few duds in this episode we're
going to count down the top five phones
to avoid selected by CNET senior editor
Jessica dull Court phone so bad they
make the Microsoft Kin seem like a good
idea
starting off at number five the Sony
Xperia ion on AT&amp;amp;T Sony isn't known for
making inexpensive products so that $99
price tag is a hint that not all is as
it seems the OS is stale the processor
just limps along and somehow Sony found
a way to make a 12 megapixel camera take
just bland photos next up at number four
the Samsung bright side as in look on
the bright side at least this phone was
cheap
Reisen should actually be paying you to
take this monster off their hands the
interface looks like it was designed on
a Commodore 64 feature phones like this
are dying breed and that's something to
be thankful for at number three the
pantex Swift on AT&amp;amp;T the $69 messaging
phone is the perfect gift for a teenager
if you hate them it's heavy
doesn't even run Android and the camera
on the back doesn't even have a flash I
mean it's not like teenagers are known
for taking pictures with their phone all
the time also charging eight dollars for
a game of Tetris that's criminal coming
in at number two the pantech hotshot on
Verizon pew the combination of slow
processor and cheap touchscreen make
this thing so bad and navigation and
typing that you kind of have to laugh
unless you bought one in which case
you're probably enrolling in anger
management classes now before we get to
the worst phone of the bunch let's
remind ourselves what good phones look
like here's seeing its current list of
the best five phones for the summer of
2012 you can always check out phones dot

to avoid in 2012 is the VTE score em on
metro pcs the name is so full of wind
unfortunately the phone is not it's full
of bloatware trapped under a really bad
screen and the call quality was so bad
