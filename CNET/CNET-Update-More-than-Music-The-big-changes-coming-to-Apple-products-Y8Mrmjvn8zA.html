to know about apple's next software
updates in under three minutes I'm
Richard Carey with a special edition of
CNN update every year at this time Apple
holds a conference to show off its next
software and on Monday Apple kick things
off by revealing a new paid music
streaming service it calls Apple music
apple also revealed new features coming
to iPhones iPads Max and the watch but
first let's get to the music Apple is
blending iTunes radio with beats radio
to create a new product called Apple
music it goes live on jun 30th for ten
dollars a month you get access to any of
the millions of songs and itunes on
demand now you don't actually own the
music but you can create playlists and
also get recommendations based on what
you like to listen to apple says it's
different because the system also has
some humans picking the tunes not just
computer algorithms you can also use
your voice to ask Siri to pull up
specific songs but if you don't pay the
monthly fee there's also something new
coming for free a global radio station
with live DJs that's called beats 1
statistics are showing that paid music
downloads are dropping as people turn to
streaming services so that's why Apple
is changing its tune so to speak Apple
is lifting some limitations on the Apple
watch in the next update this fall apps
are going to be able to access the
sensors on the watch such as the
microphone the speakers and the
accelerometer so a workout app will know
how you're moving bottom line watch apps
will be more useful Apple pay is
expanding to include more stores
including coals and jcpenney and it's
also accepting some retail store credit
cards and loyalty and points cards this
tapped based service is expanding to the
UK next month oh and that passbook app
is now called wallet Siri and search are
getting smarter in the next operating
systems your iPhone is going to be able
to make suggestions on what apps to use
based on where you are and what time it
is so if every morning you use a certain
app it's going to put a shortcut to that
app in the corner and on your computer
you can get really specific and how you
search such as by typing the phrase
documents you worked on last week or
emails you didn't open from your boss
and on the iPad you're going to be able
to multi
task and have multiple apps open in a
split screen or you could play a video
in the corner while you work that's
something other Samsung tablets could
already do apples maps are finally
getting public transit directions it's
very similar to Google's transit
directions but it's only going to be in
some major cities to start music isn't
the only new thing Apple remixed it also
has a new app called news it replaces
newsstand and you can think of it as a
place to scroll through news of the day
from different topics and publications
you pick out like a digital magazine of
sorts that's the highlights when you can
dive into more details on Apple's
updates and the music service at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
