work of art this Halloween a power drill
could be your secret weapon now if
you've never used a drill before this is
probably not the best project to learn
on make sure you get familiar with it
before hand always drill away from your
fingers and use protective gears needed
aside from the drill he'll still need
your basic pumpkin carving kit but it
will all come down to the drill bits so
make sure you have different sizes to
choose from for etching get a sandpaper
or rough stone bit you won't be able to
drill out the top but at least you can
drill out a few reference points to
guide you and then connect the dots with
a paring knife or serrated carving tool
now scoop out the guts and scrape out
the walls
the thinner the walls the smoother the
car will be later so it's well worth the
extra prep time once you're done pick
out a design with plenty of holes check
Pinterest or Google for inspiration and
once you've transferred the blueprint
onto the pumpkin time to power up that
drill I suggest starting from the inside
out to avoid having it all cave-in from
the pressure not all the shapes will be
drill worthy but at least you can use it
to make your marks and connect the dots
or round out tough edges using the
thinnest drill bit in your stash and
save the best for last the simple holes
just hold the drill steady and go for it
switching up the drill bits as you go
for more interesting pattern just make
sure to clean out the holes all the way
through to remove any pumpkin gunk you
may have dragged out once you're done
with the interior make your larger cuts
on the outside with the connect-the-dots
method and revel in your masterpiece
piece of cake Friday texture try atching
out part of your design with stone or
sandpaper bits sketch out the outline
with your knife or carving tool to
lightly break the skin and then go over
it with a drill it likely won't be sharp
enough to make a dent if you
accidentally go outside the lines but
get your fingers out of the way
not bad for our first attempt and while
the drill method may not be any faster
than the traditional carb the results
far exceeded any second grade triangle
carvings I'd attempted in the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
