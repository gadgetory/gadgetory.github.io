it looks like an ordinary smartphone
with a 5.2 inch display that is until
you fold out the second 5.2 inch display
turning it into a mini 6.8 inch square
tablet while most phones are moving
toward having dual rear cameras ZTE
brings you a phone with dual screens the
M and acts on M stands for multi mode
when both displays are open you can
select how the screens are arranged
there's a continuous screen mode where
both displays are used to show on app
this seems pretty handy for gameplay
watching a video reading messaging or
just viewing your home screen there's
definitely a little Nintendo 2ds v
happenin here and that's a good thing
another mode lets you open two different
apps each on its own display this is all
about multitasking that means you can
play a video on one screen a message on
the second or read an email on the left
screen while reading a PDF on the right
and then there's mirror mode where the
exact same thing is shown on both
screens the idea is the phone can be
placed in a tent-like position between
two people facing each other
imagines to be great for two kids
watching a video ZTE is working to
optimize the top 200 Android apps to
take advantage of both screens when not
folded out the second screen folds
behind the main one and turns off in
this closed book position it looks like
a regular smartphone albeit pretty thick
one another interesting feature is it
only has one camera on the whole phone
the selfie camera is also the rear
camera I know it sounds crazy but when
you open up the camera app you're
prompted to rotate the phone 180 degrees
what was the back screen turned on and
becomes a display for framing your shot
the ZTE axon 10 is completely different
from any flagship phone available and
its dual screens offer up a lot of
possibilities for a truly unique
smartphone experience it will be
available starting November 17th
however pricing has not been announced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
