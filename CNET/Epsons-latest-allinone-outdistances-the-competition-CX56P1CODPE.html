your small office productive this epson
all-in-ones gonna help you out I'm
Justin you for cnet.com this is a quick
take of the epson workforce WF 25:40
Epson describes the WUF 25:40 as the
smallest printer in its class but that
doesn't mean it cuts corners on features
you get a lot of printer for under 150
bucks along with the built-in scanner
fax machine and copying functions from a
physical standpoint though the folding
paper trays on the front and the back of
the unit really save a lot of space but
keep in mind that you load paper into
the back of the machine so you're gonna
want to have it lower than eye level the
control panel is right in the middle of
the device but don't expect fancy
features like a touchscreen display for
starters this printer ships for less
than 150 bucks
but also this device is made for the
small business crowd that typically
wants a no-frills output device you can
adjust the angle of the panel itself but
you do get a two and a half inch LCD
display built-in as well as quick access
buttons that control the copy fax and
scan buttons along with a number pad for
entering fax numbers and a bank of speed
dial entries the flatbed scanner and 30
page Auto document feeder ran out the
extra features the auto document feeder
up top is great for loading in a stack
of documents for hands-free scanning but
my one problem with the construction is
a scanner lid again I wasn't expecting
much in terms of durability on this
machine but the cheap plastic hinges
that are supposed to keep the scanner
open are so frail that even the
slightest touch is gonna send it
crashing down onto your hand so just be
careful so you can connect the printer
to your computer using a standard
hardline USB cable but you should really
use the built-in Wi-Fi to get access to
Google Cloud Print as well as the Epson
connect feature that lets you email a
document or a photo to the printer from
any connected device that can be a
laptop a tablet or a smartphone but
speaking of smartphones you should also
check out Epsons eyeprint smartphone app
for Android and iOS devices and you can
check out all the details including
benchmark speeds and quality scores in
my full review on seeing that but that's
gonna do it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the epson workforce
WUF 25:40 thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
