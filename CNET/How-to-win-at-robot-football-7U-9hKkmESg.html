teams from more than 40 countries have
come to compete in RoboCup the global
robot soccer tournament that sees teams
of bots battling to win glory for their
human creators on pint-sized pitches
robots from the humanoid standard
platform wheeled and even AI leagues are
vying for victory most built or
programmed by students hoping to win
distinction for their school or
university in Robocop there are no
remote controls winning depends on
building smart autonomous soccer BOTS
that play with no human interaction
competing teams wind them up and when
the whistle blows let them go in the
humanoid leagues half the battle is
finding economic and efficient ways to
build the robot players this is cascade
which is one of our so called heme BOTS
this is a 3d printed robot which we
designed ourselves last year and this is
our attempt to make the research cheaper
we get quite attached because after some
years when you work with the robots you
recognize that every robot has some
specialities like you know he's always
falling down and yeah it's more like
children because you have to take care
about them all the time
they have to have two legs two arms they
have to walk upright and yeah this makes
a lot of things more difficult because
we are falling down and this is still
one even after a lot of years of
research this is like the biggest
problem we have even now
the problem of staying upright isn't
limited to the humanoid BOTS meet the
standard platform League where all teams
compete using the now robot from
Softbank robotics the SPL presents a
unique challenge when every bot is
physically identical victory comes down
to who can code the most sophisticated
software with teams hoping upgraded code
will lead to better performing robots
and a superior spot on the leaderboard
we know hopefully walk faster and more
stable and our steam strategy was
improved last year we were the such
place and hopefully we come to the final
we'll always like learn something try
something new and the codebase and see
if the robots can behave better than
last year so I think a self-improvement
is one of our goal like every year
participating in it when a team wins
this competition you know they have the
best programmers basically you know
there's no if and buts or they can do
some hardware better they can solder
better they can buy better equipment
it's a nice flat playing field and a
nice way to compare certain universities
it's a glorious afternoon here in the
RoboCup Stadium an excited crowd eager
to see our bots in blue put on a show
coach says we won't USB leave some of
the new tactics on display here Robocop
is older than you think ok not this old
Robocop began in 1997 its ultimate aim
to develop intelligent humanoid robots
capable of defeating human pro
footballers by 2050 every tournament
brings fresh challenges this year the
bots must play using a new black and
white ball which has thrown off many of
the robots imaging sensors so that's
making it very hard to see in any
condition and then on top of that we're
throwing in that this outdoor arena so
if you've used any cameras you know if
to change the exposure between sunshine
and the robots can't do that automotive
on the field so the change in light can
be really dramatic as well the whole
item of Robocop is by 2050 that we can
play against a FIFA World Cup of
Champions so we have to get outdoor one
day it may be some time to fool these
bots are troubling Ronaldo and pals but
the technological advances born out of
this competition could change the world
much sooner we've had a blast at this
year's RoboCup whether it's meeting the
teams and seeing just how dedicated they
are or watching the actual games which
is surprisingly tense and feature a lot
of adorable robots falling over beyond
soccer RoboCup hosts challenges to build
rescue robots or machines that offer
home support to disabled or elderly
people as well as junior leagues and
even robot theater for BOTS treading the
boards
uniting this diverse festival of
Robotics is a shared goal advancing
artificial intelligence and ushering in
the glorious robot future
oh the false pancakes oh this is
literally it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
