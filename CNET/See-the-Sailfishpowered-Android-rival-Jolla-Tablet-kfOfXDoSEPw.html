android tablet or the iPad then take a
look at the yalla tablet now with people
assisting this slate on IndieGoGo where
it smashed its target of three hundred
eighty thousand dollars within just two
hours of going live but now we're going
to go in for a bit of a closer look so
what is the excitement's about well for
one it runs sailfish OS rather than
Android which apart from looking really
nice apparently it's a lot easier to use
so it makes strong use of various
gestures so swiping left or right on an
app for example will take you back to
the home screen and swiping up from
anywhere in the interface will bring up
the app drawer so you can really easily
switch between apps the home screen
itself is really just like a
multitasking panel you can see you've
got your most recent open apps here and
you can see live information so you can
see what's going on without having to
actually open the app itself and
speaking of apps although you don't have
access to the Google Play Store there
are various Android apps you can
download and run on this that you can
find from third-party app stores you'll
find big names like Spotify Netflix and
Twitter on here so really most of the
big ones are covered off physically it's
not bad looking either we turn it round
you can see it's got quite a plain black
back but it definitely feels very
comfortable to hold its screen is seven
point eight five inches on the diagonal
so it's quite easy to hold and although
you probably couldn't get it in your
pocket it will certainly sit in your bag
and carry around all day without you
feeling too bogged down the screen
itself has a 2048 x 1536 pixel
resolution which is very good it's
everything looks really sharp and clear
text is easy to read and even under
these quite bright lights it's fairly
easy to see turning on a quad-core intel
processor which seems to be more than
enough to make everything seem pretty
Swift as you're navigating around and it
has a 4 450 milliamp an hour battery
which should be plenty to keep it going
for at least a day or two those early
IndieGoGo backers will be receiving
their products in the coming couple of
months but it'll be going on general
release in the second half of 2015 for
around two hundred and forty nine euros
which really isn't a bad price at all
for what you get I'm Andrew coil for ste
net and this is the yalla tablet running
sailfish OS
