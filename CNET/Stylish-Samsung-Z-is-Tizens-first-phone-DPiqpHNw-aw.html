net here as a Tizen developer conference
in San Francisco we're in a Hilton hotel
I'm getting my very first look at the
samsung Z this is a new Tizen based
phone that Samsung just announced is not
running Android but it looks a little
bit similar to Android you'll definitely
notice you've got the weather widget up
front and a bunch of home screens they
only take up the first roughly two
thirds of the screen you can swipe to
move around the home screens do have
widgets although Samsung is calling
these dynamic boxes really they're the
same and they are resized
on the bottom portion of the screen you
see some static apps these are commonly
used apps such as the dialer contacts
messenger camera App Store and the
browser folders are supported as well
when you swipe up that's where you see
your app tray so it's a little bit of a
different layout but we are seeing some
of the rounded icons we've also seen in
phones like the Samsung Galaxy s5
Samsung has installed all of it to own
apps on here for example you've got s
health s voice and as translator Samsung
link and watch on for the TV remote so
the phone does come with an IR blaster
you also see a bunch of commonly used
apps like Twitter and Google search
zone is going to be released in Russia
first you're going to find that search
on the home screen and also maps are
powered by Yandex which is popular in
Russia the settings menu look very
similar to what you get in the Samsung
Galaxy s5 so there will be familiarity
for people who know that device
you definitely have Wi-Fi the same
download booster data usage some display
and wallpaper options safety assistance
power saving mode ultra power saving
mode you get it it's very similar to the
s5 now the samsung C also has the same
fingerprint scanner that you see in the
galaxy s5 and the same heart rate
monitor on the back to use the
fingerprint scanner you'll simply swipe
your finger over the home button on the
front and to use the heart rate monitor
on the back you'll fire up as health and
place your finger on the sensor now
let's talk a little bit about the phone
design itself one of the first things I
noticed is that it felt very light 136
grams which is about four point eight
ounces the phone is pretty slim as well
it comes in two colors black and gold
but they only have the black version
here you'll notice if you look carefully
there seems faux stitching along the
sides that's the same thing that we see
in the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 it also has
a leather like appearance but it's not
made of leather
it does have sort of a grippy surface
though so it feels nice to hold in the
hand the Z has a flat top and a flat
bottom there's a little bit of angling
here but it looks pretty cool
and there are some silvery accents along
the sides around the rim
and around the home button the screen
size is four point eight inches it is a
720p HD super amoled display colors look
bright lettering looks pretty crisp but
it isn't the highest resolution that's
possible inside you've got a 2.3
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core
processor there is a 2.1 megapixel
camera on the front and an 8 megapixel
camera on the back with flash when you
snap open the camera you'll notice that
a lot of the modes and the layout are
very similar again to what you're going
to find in Samsung Galaxy phones this is
Samsung trying to maintain its brand
that's very beneficial to people who
aren't familiar with Tizen so you have a
lot of the same camera modes like Beauty
face best photo and brought your HDR
mode panorama and even photos that you
can take with both the front-facing and
rear-facing camera simultaneously this
is called dual shot the Tizen app store
is a work in progress you do have
featured apps top apps paid and free you
don't see a lot of really popular titles
worldwide for example there isn't
Facebook but you do have Twitter
pre-loaded on the phone this could be
something that Samsung and Tizen are
going to work on with developers as a
platform continues to grow however for
now it's a little bit bare bones the
Samsung Z is going to be launching in
Russia first and expanding to other
markets after that I've dealt with all
christina and you can read much more
