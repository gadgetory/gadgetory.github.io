is the HP Chromebook 11 is there room
for a Chromebook in your life that's the
question with the Chromebook equation
because Chromebooks have been sneaking
their way in as a kind of an experiment
term product over the last few years and
in case you're not entirely certain what
a Chromebook is let's lay it out for you
right now it looks like a laptop but
it's not really a laptop it runs Chrome
OS which is Google's variant of a mostly
online only operating system that's
great if you're a web browser but if you
like offline use and if you like to use
a lot of apps it may feel very weird and
it doesn't do a lot of file storage to
the degree that you're used to on a
laptop it can do all those send me
offline things and sort of file storage
e things but it really runs for the most
part like a super smart web browser with
a bunch of apps that feel like browser
extensions that being said this is a
$279 product now that sounds pretty
affordable for a laptop that if you're
looking at tablets those cost in the
budget range around that territory so
what are you gonna buy for your home the
Chromebook has attempted to sort of be a
netbook replacement and what's different
from previous Chromebooks well in a lot
of ways this is more of a design job
than something that's completely new
under the hood
HP's Chromebook 11 is sort of a
collaboration with Google and you can
tell that it looks a lot more googly
you've got a white glossy exterior here
light weight to pounds plastic color
accents green yellow red and blue or you
can get all black and with the plastic
design it's almost kind of like an
iPhone 5c of Chromebooks and under the
hood though you're going back to well
the limitations of Chromebook 16 gigs of
on-board storage 2 gigs of ram and then
you're dealing with this operating
system there are two USB 2.0 ports and
there is a micro USB charger that's kind
of interesting because you could use the
same charger to charge your phone or
your tablet only take one on the road
with you but it's missing a few ports
doesn't have SD card slot doesn't have
HDMI and those were in the last
Chromebook in this price range the
samsung series 3 at $250
no less here this is 279 you're getting
a slightly better improved IPS display
that has better viewing angles brighter
it's a 1366 by 768 but it's not touch
and the keyboard is fantastic it's
probably the best I've used in this
territory but it's not backlit and the
trackpad it's okay and the speakers
under this keyboard do sound nice and
loud and clear now what can you install
on a Chromebook I mean can you put
Microsoft Word on it no this is you're
going to be restricted to what you can
load via the Chrome Web Store which
offers an assortment of apps that really
for the most part act like web
extensions a few of them launched in
their own window and they range some of
them are productivity oriented summer
games but they all kind of feel more
like web apps than actual applications
of the sort you'd run on a tablet if
you're using this as a pass around the
home laptop replacement like a station
car to get you on the web and get you
off the web and you don't like using a
tablet consider a Chromebook but if you
want something is a true laptop
Chromebooks aren't there yet and if
you're looking for something that's
going to have a wide variety of games
and fun app experiences look to Android
or iOS before you look to a Chromebook
now the feeling these are going to stick
around for a while the question is when
you're going to want to buy one it's
getting closer this doesn't feel like
the one yet I'm Scott Stein and that's a
little look at the HP Chromebook 11 now
