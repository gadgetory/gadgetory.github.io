those things should be great together
right well not so fast
I think VR is great for puzzle games
sports games simple action games but
horror games with a lot of jump scares
well I nope right out in a minute which
means I take the headset off and I say
nope I'm done it's surprising because
I've always loved games like resident
evil and dead space but I can safely say
I think that VR horror games are not for
me I don't even like it when fish swim
too close to my face and VR demos but in
the interest of science I loaded up
Resident Evil 7 and jump right into the
new VR mode and I of course made a
couple of friends try it too okay okay
whatever that is Becca Becca Becca no no
no no no no no no no go why am I here
okay
what why am I here is that hazy look to
the VR version it's it's otherworldly
almost like you're watching a late-night
b-movie on an old tube TV which actually
plays into the visual style across
between found-footage movies and
Americana heart towards like tobe Hooper
and Rob Zombie when I finally got too
freaked out and switched to the regular
2d version I was struck by how much
sharper the game looks at full
resolution it's much more game-like
less interesting but also more playable
from lightweights like me
