computers for the creative class but
Microsoft is making a serious play for
artists animators illustrators and more
with its growing surface line now
angered by the flagship surface studio
and its inventive dial controller the
surface studio combines a bunch of ideas
we've seen before but puts them together
in a new context it's a 28 inch
all-in-one touchscreen Windows PC with a
display that folds all the way down to a
very low angle of 20 degrees the hinge
mechanism is very smooth and you end up
with something that looks like an
artist's drafting table the benefit 4k
screen has an insane 4500 by 3000 pixel
resolution and it works with the same
surface pen that comes with a surface
book and the surface pro but it's the
new optional surface dial that really
makes the surface studio feel different
it's a wireless Bluetooth control wheel
made of aluminum on the larger screen of
the studio you can actually mount the
dial on the display for additional
options such as visually scrolling
through a color wheel or selecting brush
sizes the combination of surface dial
and surface studio is very cool but
right now it's also limited to a small
group of supported apps like sketching
bowl and art program it also works as
Spotify which is kind of cool but
Photoshop and other key art programs
will have to wait for support we've set
some actual artists loose with the
surface studio and it's pen and dial and
while they were impressed they liked the
big bright screen and the stylus pen
more than the dial itself which still
feels like a work in progress
I find this thing a little clunky just
the menu system is really ornate there's
so many options to this that I kind of
am unintentionally selecting things that
I didn't mean to select like that I just
selected right back to the main menu
I'm sure after a couple weeks of working
in it I'd get the hang of it this is
nice to have all this space
I guess this feels more like a smaller
drafting table in itself which is cool
for an artist it's never good to work
flat completely you always want to have
it at an angle so it's cool that this is
able to do that one night's bonus for
the $3,000 and up surface studio it
includes a high-end laptop gaming
graphics card from Nvidia so not only
can it handle high-res animation and
video editing you can play games on the
awesome-looking giant screen too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
