at the understand that Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona taking a look at
honors new flagship for Europe the rs6
plus now the six plus makes a few
differences over the existing on a six
that we've already seen of course has
been named plus suggests the screen is
slightly bigger in fact this is a 5.5
inch display that has a full HD
resolution it looks nice and bright and
it looks clear as well even under these
bright stand lights inside this is
running on a 1.8 giga hertz octa-core
processor which would be more than
enough power to make your everyday
essentials to go like a dream now it's
also got 32 gigabytes of built-in
storage which is a lot to have but there
is also micro SD card slot if you want
to expand that further it's really on
the slightly older android 4.4 kitkat
although honor has dead but it will be
updating the phone 25.2 lollipop in the
summer you actually probably won't be
able to tell that you're not on the
latest version of android though as
honor has put its own skin over the top
which changes quite a lot of your
android interface the phone itself isn't
bad looking at all with a glass front
and back and a metallic effects running
around the edge what you might notice on
the back though at these two camera
lenses the midget effectively to 8
megapixel cameras built-in and that
allows the features such as giving you
the option to refocus to your shot after
you've taken it and also apparently
allows it to reduce the image noise when
you're taking photos in low-light but
there is also a flash for your night
time photography owner hasn't said
exactly how much 46 bus is going to cost
yet but hasn't but it will be extremely
competitive now the honor 6 before it
was an absolutely bargain with high-end
specs at a very affordable price so we
are hoping that this will be similarly
affordable we will find out more though
when it goes on sale later on this year
I'm Andrew Hoyle 50 net and this is the
honor 6 plus
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
