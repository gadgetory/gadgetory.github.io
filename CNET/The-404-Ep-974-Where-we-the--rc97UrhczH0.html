podia this is the 404 show on CNN TV
thanks for tuning in I'm Jeff Bakalar
I'm Wilson tang and I'm Justin you and
this is the show where we the that's it
s like a blank blank that's our protest
for today today's a big day in the
internet if you have no idea what like
super or Pipper is can you go a pitch
pipe pipe of I call Peppa ok this is our
protest here we go you widescreen you're
on the internet and you don't know what
it is you're gonna know today yeah
bacardi it's all over the place today
yeah all right so stop Online Privacy
Act that's the Senate bill uh Piper is
the House bill that's the protect
intellectual property act i believe yeah
um they're essentially you know
copyright holder copyright holders
including our parent company CBS right
so a full disclaimer CBS is in favor of
it correct well maybe I major Hollywood
companies a lot of big media you know
conglomerates cuz they spend a lot of
money right I'm not necessarily 44 but
they spend a lot of money now
understanding the there's been a lot of
money like you know movies and things
like that and you know understandably
they want to protect their intellectual
property but before we even get into
Weiss yes oppa is inherently wrong right
I well I mean I heart it's hard right
major portion Horton I do it's not it's
inherently wrong it's a nearly right
about that you're protecting I was gonna
say that arm the the thing I have the
biggest problem with is that this is
only happening because of lobbying right
so like if before this that's how
everything gets understand but before
but there's no other uh medium that that
really is behind this other than or
Hollywood live I was a main player in
this in this order you know a lot of she
don't realize that like the media
industry in general um is the nation's
biggest export right like we you know
other countries actor oil
other countries export you know all
sorts of things like anne-marie we
export mean export vampire movie exactly
true blood right uh and CSI I remember
like when I lived in China very briefly
I there are channels that play nothing
but Chinese CSI like actual like Chinese
people dubbing Overland uh the American
version of it but it's a huge huge
industry obviously pays our paycheck
right arm and we you know we get
obviously very upset when like somebody
grabs your text or text puts it on their
site ranges the byline but should
definitely be shut down that's the
question so like the reason why you know
people can reasonable people can say hey
if you spent money and the time to
create something you should own the
copyright you should have so you know
protection around it where it gets a
little grey is fair use for example um
you know like what's fair for one person
may not be fair for another and then you
know not everybody's a lawyer so it's
hard to decipher when something is right
the fair use k the problem is that these
legislations basically do blanket sort
of the interrelations e-government are
on you know unprecedented power
essentially to censor the web in a very
very blunt way so there are provisions
in both acts that essentially allow the
government based on you know if someone
makes a complaint or on their own accord
to pull the domain names from the DNS
system of an offending website that
effectively shuts it down like you could
conceivably get to it via like an IP
address or right or something like that
and there are actually been some
workarounds where you know in a firefox
browser Google for example if you type
in an address that's the head their
domain pulled it'll actually look it up
in another database but like the way the
internet works this is the no main don't
name may name sis domain don't domain
yeah you said donate donate don't domain
name domain right and every time you
type in an address like cnet com it
essentially looks it up in a phone book
and directs you to the correct IP
address yeah the government is going to
get the power if someone makes a
complaint to essentially pull your dns
entry from the database
and that's where like really really big
problems can happen like for example
reddit reddit Wikipedia google all
protesting SOPA because they link out to
offending sites sure they show previews
of it sure reddit actually host some
content that might be cut you know right
i mean it thi just I don't know I think
there's a lot of gray area stuff in the
biggest problem everyone has with this
is like we mentioned earlier it's just
very generalized everything in this
shotgun is just like our it's just like
a spray in praise I uh let's put out
this fire with you know yeah in certain
relax search engines are obviously the
Google is is hugely in not in favor of
this legislation because now they have
to actively if they block a site right
they have to continuously monitor that
removed from their data it's not a very
practical I mean okay so let me say let
me be like the opposite sure sure be the
Dickens are you know there are good
arguments on behalf of so but they're
just I think doing it in a wrong way you
know they're obviously targeting a lot
of user-submitted web sites like Reddit
YouTube but we can all plainly say that
those websites do host content that's
illegal yeah if you want to find it you
can do it and and but but to that point
there are provisions in place for that
stuff to get app right taken down and
they should really be targeting websites
like megaupload or wrath sides are you
host the file but you could I mean yes
the majority the vast majority of the
traffic on say something like megaupload
is not know what Megan I don't know a
video you know yeah uh is not
necessarily some you know free like fair
use or also upload is supposed to be for
ya what are the legal yeah yeah I'd be
interested to see some sort of
infographic wrestling how much of their
traffic is is usual jitter yeah right I
think they advertise themselves is like
a service would you say large files
right you don't know yet we were you
know there are a lot of industries that
send huge files back and forth through
two offices every day gitam it sir i'm
sure it up a nice chunk of it is
legitimate right right and now I mean it
they're definitely legitimate uses but
this is a hue
huge blunt tool and I think for a lot of
people where it really really just sort
of irks them a lot and it gets so point
where their protest people shutting down
websites you know millions of dollars
are being spent to stop this right the
biggest reason why is because there's no
due process right it's just the instant
ban yet literally like peak what the
government has the power they won't
necessarily exercise the government but
that's the thing is not about whether or
not they will it's giving them the
option to and that's the problem yeah I
mean giving them the well giving giving
the government the power to shut
something down I don't think is out of
the realm of you know the purview of
government but as long as I mean if they
can throw you in jail they can shut
something down right but as long as it's
is a judicial process right and there's
some sort of uh you know discovers a
judge or somebody just be go before
somebody well I was reading that you
could actually appeal you're
blacklisting if you end up on that I'm
sure it's not you know obviously you
know when websites even miss one day of
coverage their readership goes down with
essentially isn't losing a ton of oil
you know in may imagine how much money
reddit makes every single day yeah there
is no worrisome there in a lotta dated
in you know that that leads into this
sort of the second part of the
conversation is today it again a lot of
websites are protesting SOPA right by
blocking their site they're black and
not just like geo cities yeah okay
talking google.com if you go to
google.com is a huge black bar over the
logo although I think for people not the
tech industry they're gonna be wondering
what the hell Google's doing no I just
leave issue like on right exactly we're
at a point that's obviously the more but
I mean I I mean a lot of sites are a
little bit more explicit about why they
it was always very of cinematic sure
yeah you know I don't think I don't have
a problem with it it's usually where
people just click the google doodle and
then that gives them more info on in so
now if you click this it'll send you to
a page where you can contact your
congressional representative is that the
best solution by the way if if you know
like an individual citizen wants to get
involved here I mean it's working it's
working yeah do you think that's it's
working a little bit you can do it i
mean this is a huge much bigger topic
than the full force
never discussed but at the end of the
day it cost so much money to run for
Congress in uh it's I would say it's
near impossible not to be in the pocket
of you know special interest groups or
major corporations or people who just
don't necessarily have your interests as
a consumer okay or like a you know a
free speech or content creator out there
but that doesn't mean you shouldn't
still sign those online petition go
right you're definitely go ahead and do
that I I mean I be very surprised if
this actually gets past but you know
it's only because of the grassroots
efforts by people like with Wikipedia
and Google to go out there and inform
like the masses because otherwise they
could be like oh this is just a nerd
issue right right i mean that's that's
what happens like dmca and a lot of sort
of other legislation oh it's just a nerd
issue like net neutrality you try to
explain that to laymen and you know just
look eyes literally like gloss over and
they fall asleep for sure so yeah but
you know that i was actually going to
roger cheng earlier today about the
whole black out for a lot of website
what's interesting is beyond read it
read it was really good about this
beyond ready you can access most of the
sites on their mobile version or their
mobile app interesting so I I'd be
interested in sort of like you know I
think it might actually bump up like
mobile and app traffic just a little bit
today mm-hmm at the very that's what the
grand scheme is to get the mobile ad
traffic up um did you guys read about
how the creator of SOPA apparently
pirated some of this yeah background
images on his own website it prior to so
but be even being written yes what's is
name again Lamar something I think it's
lamar lamar smith i guess he's the he's
a representative from Tennessee yeah so
I guess if you haven't heard about this
this is a pretty ironic story then it's
what turned my attention to soap a more
serious way after i saw this apparently
before stop was written this congressman
lamar smith he on his website he had a
background image that did not credit a
photographer that initially took it and
this was like a background image of some
shrubs in nature and i don't know i just
thought it was really funny that he
didn't even have a Creative Commons
license
haha image that's another photographer
too hilarious why because it's ironic
yeah it's definitely erotic and it also
goes back to like that issue of okay you
know it's like music for example yeah
you can get the rights to the
performance but then you have to get
composer writes you have to get that
yeah right like it's a much more
complicated issue then oh I'm
goody-two-shoes I will never pirate
anything my life right and when cutting
someone's Liron they want to take down
like a kid dancing to a song or so what
was it like I mean that happens like
every I understand but am I or one of
the major music labels because like a
radio was playing in the background
Brett will like pull youtube video yeah
I don't know and how did how did they
deal with cassette tapes when they first
came out they wanted to create some old
relation to add like a fish tax to it I
wanted to ban I remember they wanted a
band VHS VCRs video I think that was in
the radio and cassette and they wanted a
ban like the first mp3 players to like
the Rope the Rio and how can actually in
Canada there was if you bought like a
mp3 player there's actually a text it's
added to it to compensate the music
company for time I don't know how long
that lasted but I mean the same thing
with blank cds they tried to do the same
thing cassettes they tried to do the
same thing yeah I mean it R it's like
many ways to record media now I mean it
I mean when you really think about it
though it's like how is it any different
than inviting a friend over to watch a
movie that you bought right right or
letting someone borrow a book after
you're done reading see that's that's
fair use but then you know what's the
difference like you know that would be
okay if you invited like me over to your
house but if I was like hey i have a
huge awesome you know projection screen
auditorium in my basement i'm bringing
over thirteen fourteen people and why
just really Minority Report I'm gonna
record it on my video no no it's cool
but that'd be cool if I just like
screening at my house it's is why this
is very common you know every time like
the Super Bowl happened somebody will
mention this uh-huh um but like churches
or yeah sometimes bars this is a very
very great area they have the
the game right like that like the sunday
ticket thing yet and like having ten
people over like that's fine having 50
people were that's reliable 400 people
my bar right now we're all watching
Giants San Francisco gave up for now
exactly that's where it's now on great
yeah yeah you don't we don't know I
don't know I don't think the law has as
caught up to technology that's the
problem yeah they're people truck is
Laurie or clearly misinformed though are
they not or they're just getting with
people the wrong people are whispering
in their ears I I think it's more the
latter I mean like these are bright
people when all they're not stupid I
don't see the internet just see like
Greek into like matrix letters I mean
they just but you know like if he if you
really consider like the amount of
legislation passed a lot of the you know
literal text is got from you know
interest groups have you read that you
really read any of the fine print in
this thing it reads like stereo
instructions super it's super vague it's
super uh you know you can infer anything
you really want out of the language well
you know and you know the the the bills
try to make a distinction between
domestic and foreign sites but even say
something like cnet right where we may
own the domain in the US but if you're
in Europe the server that actually send
you the content may actually be located
in London right so does the US
government have the power to block a
server sitting in London hmm you know
like things like that I mean it sounds
like a lot of fun guy but it's good but
apparently you know things are getting a
little delayed but the thing is is like
I feel like once they delay it nor they
like shelve SOPA for a little bit then
like sneak it back in and cold like boba
and everyone will be like bob was cool
man i'm now something like the you know
i love america act yeah very cold like
it why you hate America like they're
against the I love America literally be
called free music for all
and somehow put you in jail for five
bridges renewing karaoke I go back at ya
house karaoke okay because uh that's not
the actual as long as they don't touch
karaoke yeah I'm finally you know isn't
there a good chance that Obama will just
veto this bill if it ended up at so the
White House there he's already against
it how do we have anything to worry
about realistically I mean I I thought I
think we do I mean especially with the
twenty twelve election coming up yeah a
lot of people be talking a lot of other
stuff right but don't you write and I
think everyone needs to worry like i
said about it going away and then flying
in under the radar yeah but uh Wilson's
right the White House is as come out
very vocally against right which is good
in comforting yeah by the way michelle
obama's birthday was yesterday oh so
that's something we share it was also uh
Jim Carrey's birthright and zooey
deschanel well and then Frankel that's
the bat spin Frank that's right cool
boxer joke no I don't know about zooey
deschanel wouldn't really be walking
down the street bragging about that also
my dad really was on the same birthday
yeah oh you're right that is certainly
odd anytime they birthday Joe you do you
I like it will take a break when we come
back we'll stop with the soap stuff get
back to a few other stories uh stick
around and we'll be right back with a
lot more fun on the 404 seeing a second
Oh for mr effers the show where we all
sing song
what score check the fence I'm not much
maybe later like it boom yep oh I a
function solution but I'm Randy do all
your mother's request what you should
welcome back to the 404 show man I'm not
gonna lie give crows more credit we just
watched a video of a crow that seemed to
be deliberately sledding down a roof
covered in snow without a whole lot to
do in Russia well it's not even that yes
the people watching not you know this
bird doodle or Birds doesn't but think
about it you know usually they associate
birds small brains or yes that looked
like the bat kro was doing it for the
thrill I seem like I got back on the
snow lifts and then the it looked like
it was and that's what's brilliant yeah
I feel like once birds realize all man
not having to walk back up the mountain
to slide right is sick it's genius
genius think about it you could ski down
a mountain and fly back up like in 30
seconds if I could rely out just fly why
would i anyway there's a thrill there's
a thrilling going now this guy hates
being in the air the floor sucks it hey
man that that's a very interesting video
check out the show notes for that cool I
wanna wear something alexa.com when
we're at CES and you know we're doing
the show obviously when we toss to a
break we play the you listen to the poor
forever effers from you know Jon Coulton
what are you talking about uh it was
just funny because I remember going
backstage after the show and everybody
like the first thing people would say to
me after our first show was that sounds
a whole lot worse when it's on a giant
PA I don't know if it does I don't know
if I agree with you I think it's so uh
uh charming yeah and and benign that it
just wrote it just goes in one ear out
the other with the silky smooth you know
for us we do it is like 500 times try
almost a thousand I don't even hear it
anymore like living by a train I think
it's great I think it's I think it's
great i love that Jon Coulton
unknowingly is letting you name two are
you so but a destroy us yay good nobody
was very very aware that we recorded he
was and he got recorded which how are
you able to block out these words on
your facebook update I was not cool I
mean this is like a very money I stole
that uh can we cut that Mike you don't
put on my face we go to my Twitter if
you want why people know what your
facebook name is occasionally gonna get
to surgery and then how did you do this
yeah you like that you put black bars /
letters which I can only imagine our
customers isn't it like a character yeah
yeah it's a sort of blind character yeah
yeah deal with the internet brother fans
guess what first dammit yeah stay on the
internet also blow my mind Jeff playing
black eyed peas experience like this
your facebook is full of incriminating
photos this this I this I we have no
really plain black eyed peas expensive
effing hypocrite I don't want to talk
about this the show where we go through
Jess Facebook voice is your live on air
this is my nightmare no but uh yeah well
let's not worry that's the past the past
is the past features now okay speaking
of the future tomorrow right oh let's
just move on tomorrow you're doing that
all to that Vegas as our uh well
tomorrow is a apples New York media
event a lot of people are speculating
it's about textbooks uh we are on the
floor for gonna actually do something
we've almost never done before we'll
just start to show two hours earlier at
ten a.m. tomorrow wait what yeah you
know oh yeah we're probably gonna start
around nine fifty a.m. eastern time
check it out senior that calm / live or
see no TV com wherever you want to hit
it up it will be a live casting during
the apple press conference yep yep our
own Bridget Carey is going to be there
live blogging we're still trying to
confirm whether we can shoot stream live
yeah but that's probably not can happen
no um in the meantime though like you'll
be able to listen to the 404 will give
you live updates and seen its very own
david carr noi will be on the show we
don't yeah we haven't talked to David
yes I don't know if he's gonna do Plus
don't forget man we have a broken Mike
what we had that Mike's broken so I
don't know you know it's gonna be almost
though he's just gonna be reading the
whole sure
sure that even knows a thing or two
about books right i mean i've wrote
something about that yeah it'll be fun
so he may be on the show tomorrow to
talk about you know apples textbook
events uh you know for tomorrow a lot of
people are speculating that it will be
GarageBand for e-books allowing anybody
who wants to self-publish to create
their own ebook with fancy covers with
nicely laid out text on their home
computer and have it published the
iBooks how about that sounds good well I
mean it I think it's that's one
component the other component is they've
partnered up according to The Wall
Street Journal with mcgraw-hill to do
some sort of textbook program where
college students or even high school or
middle and elementary school students
might be able to get all their you know
school books on their iPad instead of
Act having to lug around 50 pounds with
a book it will literally cure scoliosis
cuz you in a in overnight and did you I
mean I do you guys have to carry like
the giant backpacks when you were in
high school I feel like I still do from
John backpacker yeah my back is all
screwed up I need some sort of brace oh
I'm pretty sure kids now have those
rolly luggage yeah but I hate those
things my house ever when people in high
school used to have those and like you
would just get made fun of well know
that those were kids that were actually
using luggage to carry though now kids
have backpacks that just happen to have
wheels jansport hole yeah I don't like
those because they follow you like three
feet behind you and you I always trip
over them I was all about cinching my
backpack up really jeopardize like on my
neck yeah yes I think that was started
like way above your neighbor a rocket
pack cool way to like wear a backpack
was to keep it like really almost um
sagging like you know that's not i just
said the opposite of that I know that's
why I said the cool way like that wasn't
the cool i know i remember there were
some people who did that they would wear
their jansport sound again
only were and they would like kicking
everybody I walked oh yeah wait I'm out
I don't think I said there had a toilet
is gonna worry Jesus that's where is ur
day endless in the chatroom says
textbooks need to die why is paying two
hundred dollars for basically renting
ancient tech acceptable got a point
about that man it I mean you know
textbooks are are in grossly overpriced
and I that they're grossly overpriced
well I mean like considering they
actually have to be printed and right
but how much is it doesn't call four
hundred dollars to print a biology
textbook I remember this in uh in middle
school in high school uh our textbooks i
remember my teacher saying like oh the
state's change their standards or like
this didn't actually happen or this is
an important anymore internal history
curriculum yeah curriculum and you know
is always weird because it's like okay
this book was from five years ago and
supposedly we were we suppose be number
one and we're supposed to educate our
students the best we have like textbooks
that are five years out of date when you
also went to a school in Tennessee where
I only assume means that all they said
was that the south I can tell the
Jeffers refers to the north as yank yeah
unions and the South won the war oh good
I've been the oppressive Abraham Lincoln
right came along time to shut it down
you were very not I'm like so shoddy
nonsense yeah the Emancipation something
stupid something stupid that yeah that
is quite awkward for me in their school
history although jgi danna see the
losers write the history but right now
we're kidding we love Tennessee in all
of our southern states but no it's true
wouldn't it be nice to have a textbook
updated in real time yeah that would be
awesome plus you know i remember
teachers like making this huge effort to
wheel in the liquid laser disc printer
pepper in it but laser display right to
play some stupid video sure why not have
it built straight into the ipad their
words more interactive
spin a molecule doesn't have to be an
ipad 2 let's get that out there can be
any surface tablet device okay doesn't
need to be in iphones really like who
owns something else someone will make
something okay maybe maybe maybe you
know I'm going to be more affordable for
them to all be kindle fires would not be
more affordable the taxpayers money goes
go right up by a lot more kindle fires
and they could buy ipads unless it won't
get texts sale sex whatever it is you
know what's right come on yeah it's true
a lot cheaper you buy two Kindles for
the price of one I've been as you choose
smart that's too educated children as
opposed to warn elitist yes that's true
I do own an item jerk I do look I own an
iPad because I bought when I like an eye
for the but they're talking about a four
year old kid no student left behind yeah
I would imagine the cheaper device that
everyone can you know afford rather go
to we can argue the prices of that but i
think that the bigger story though is
yeah like an ipad the cost of ipad
sounds like a lot but once you factor in
textbooks and then even like the medical
costs but we're joking around earlier
scoliosis not cheap to fix right so i
think at the end of the day like having
tablets of any sort is going to be a net
benefit for could you imagine just your
entire school career eliminating that
heavy books that'd be awesome if they
reckon about an ipad is your freshman
year that you had to give back i would
still carry a notebook now you and
Carrie nope you can almost see why like
it's like now I wouldn't write every
right now before the computer existed I
can see why this is also a smart thing
for Apple to really jump into yeah cuz
you reel them in young it's really hard
to get them to switch platforms later
all right that's smart that's what you
would do if you r an apple right but
paper bags like paper bag covers they
were whole seminars after we got our
techniques on how to wrap a book with a
paper grocery bag was that you you got
your booking in school and then they're
like hey do us a favor cover that yeah
these are printing special book
wrappings sponsored by the army do you
ever know Wow oh yeah when the ROTC
would come by yeah so bizarre strange
they're gonna have that for the ipad
nothing was as good as
burbank oh no and did your local right
newspaper so that all right a what is it
what is this what is a third world
country easily the in due time if uh
don't remember there was some grocery
bags from from from supermarkets that
would put the subject field right on the
bed right so you if you fall in way you
would have it on the million yeah guess
what sopa would take that away we gotta

all pretty bad young adult yeah the
devil inside no the devil insides okay I
mean that's literally about a devil
inside somebody though I understand why
are you a metaphor for like a feeling or
emotional well there's actually devil in
that thing that hits me okay so so devil
inside that's okay because you can sort
of interpret that any way you want when
they show the trailer for man on a ledge
the last image they go did you see a guy
on a Ledge and it goes black and like
men on the ledge and you're just like
man okay I just saw a guy on a Ledge
you're gonna call it man on a ledge that
when he had a movie when it's that one
it's like back to back like that just
slapping in the face be like hey idiot
wake up and go out and see this movie
that's when I become offended but that
doesn't make a movie inherently bad just
because the name is no it doesn't i
haven't seen this film but apparently
like the artist won a bunch of Golden
Globes yeah yeah like I mean it's not
just it's not just mainstream Hollywood
like everybody's embracing the let's
just name the movie whatever whatever it
is yeah Jurassic Park 4 will just be
dialing dinosaurs eating humans yeah
it's getting bad I'm happy with it makes
really yes things much it easy to choose
which movie to go well that's what I
kept saying people are just like oh let
me see the you know the new dinosaur
movie yeah it's called the new dinosaur
movies yeah there's your ticket here and
buy this 30 pound bucket of popcorn you
know like I can I can understand a
little bit because you sometimes there's
a little too far on the other side right
like a movie like case 39 nobody knows
that it right yeah like you you have no
idea it could be a detective story it
could be the hospital thing 40 cases
