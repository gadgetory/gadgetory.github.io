in to the 404 show here on CNN TV I'm
Jeff Bakalar and I'm trusting you and
this is the show where we go bump in the
night damn skippy show us yours it's
more zombie talk than anyone can handle
we'll get to all that on today's show
big big big show today a lot of fun lot
of great stories we're going to be
talking about pretty much everything the
internet can handle the ipad reviews are
out yeah along with some interesting i
guess interesting is one way to put it
what's that about how everyone feels
about this thing I mean it's really
tough to sort of predict yeah what kind
of reviews this this new machine would
get so should we just get right into it
yeah if you want it if you want to get
right might as well right I mean they
all came out yesterday they did 15
reviews all not review a lot of them are
really really long to like did you read
the Verge's review ah no it was too long
to 10 pages is like the ultimate toi
it's a lot to read yeah well it's funny
to me though from reading all these
different reviews is that people really
do have to find even the smallest
criticisms to knock apple down just a
little bit and I think it's at a fear of
being labeled as an apple fanboy you
know if you give an hour a project
really positive review without saying
anything bad about it will automatically
assume that you're giving favor to Apple
but don't you but don't you sort of uh
like for example how do you think there
should be criticism it should be but not
know about the criticisms that these
people are giving yeah okay so do me an
exam because I'm curious I want to hear
what you're talking about okay so for
example David Pogue in the New York
Times yep venerated tech review ensure
it big big ton guy yeah so uh he one of
his complaints is that the ipad this is
a quote he says the ipad is one
millimeter thicker when one point eight
ounces heavier than the ipad 2 and he
goes on to say that although that's a
minor detail it's still very unfortunate
disappointing and just to hear somebody
complain about a device being literally
a millimeter like I can't even make a
millimeter with my two fingers a
milliliter 128 ounces heavier yeah a
millimeter like don't if you're crying
over
millimeter yeah just just get lost yeah
that's it doesn't sound like that's what
that's not like his deal breaker right
it's almost as if he's feeding Louis CK
lines from stand-up comedy haha you know
anything for sure this is basically
writing the joke itself yeah that is a
little bit irritating um some of them I
don't know it makes sense that people
will complain about the longer battery
charge times oh I didn't know that yeah
so apparently the battery is bigger on
this one and that's the power of the
retina display right for this one is I
think 42 watt hours versus 25 watt hours
on the ipad 2 Wow so it does take a
couple hours longer to charge than he
that is a big deal because I was always
very impressed with how quickly the ipad
2 charges how long does it normally take
it feels like maybe two to three hours
oh really yeah yes this will be more of
an overnight type charge I want to bring
up Josh T'Pol skis review and the verge
we talked about it for a second how
insanely long it is yeah um it's it's a
really long sort of thing to say but
there's one line that sort of like stood
out and I was just I read and I was like
all right that doesn't make sense okay
he said quote 50 years from now the ipad
won't look out of place okay what do you
think about that I'm I'm wondering is
there anything else that existed 50
years ago that would look out of place
now yeah i think there's literally
nothing that i can think like there's
not one besides maybe he began a slice
of prey yeah you know odd though even
that there is much smaller bag I feel
like now they look cooler right yeah
yeah what what does that mean 50 like
okay if you said 10 I give him the
benefit of all right 10 we don't know
but 50 especially in the world of tech
where things evolve at such an
accelerated rate okay so he's talking
about the design I understand EA juices
out dieter Rams like you know and talks
about the old Braun products Brett
Jonathan I was inspired right yet one
let's a little bit of context so that
makes sense uh he's talking about the
cyclical nature of design and how
current design is draw inspiration from
the old but makes sense to me I get in
but not in the context of specifically
the ipad and its aesthetic right you
know what i mean right writing something
like it looks like oh that thing dude 50
years from now people beginning to use
that
startech you know right it's weird and
you can also look at something like the
ipod one the first generation ipod looks
giant it's a brick compared to what and
that's right now ten years old that's
ten years old no one could have ever
predicted that there would be any moving
parts on the scroll dial anymore right
like 10 years right that looks archaic
to me now or the red LED lights on uh
the ipod to write radicular diculous why
would not nothing would have that but
what is the ipad get this free pass I
don't know um anyway that's just a
little tidbit out of this huge review go
read it for yourself if you'd like but
yet the reviews are in and unshackle a
everyone's in love with this thing
everyone's really in love with it I
think out of the one complaint everyone
has that on the verizon version you
can't do facetime over uh their network
you have to jump onto a Wi-Fi network to
do that right um which was the case on
the original as well that was the case
on my phone when they announced right in
the ipad 2 right right right so all
right i mean i don't know i still think
you've got to be crazy to buy that LTE
version why I just think if if you're so
desperate for LTE why not get a phone
with LTE right pay that little bit extra
money on your phones plan to make it a
hot spot because then you have a hot
spot for your phone and your and your
iPad right I know verizon will be
offering that hotspot feature on the
iPad but why not just keep it on your
phone why do you need uh why would you
need to make a hot spot on your iPad
that's a Dean I think that's a good
point I mean the good thing about that
though is how long the battery lasts on
the ipad right if you make that a
hotspot you proud you will get more
uptime on your hotspot then you will if
you had it as your phone right i think
the problems that people just have too
many devices nowadays yeah you're
creating one hot spot to browse faster
on another device right doesn't really
make sense yeah it's it's strange but
nevertheless those are the UH those are
the reviews that are coming out today if
you want to get like a very uh concise
sort of uh logically laid out breakdown
of all of these head on over to sina com
josh lowensohn right he did it he did a
bang-up job of uh right up sort of q
reading all these iPad reviews I think
the consensus is that if you already
have an ipad 2 like we've said in the
past you probably don't have a big
incentive to pick up the new one right
that being said though apple just
announced that they will offer gift
cards in exchange for your ipad 2 for up
to 320 bucks granted that's for the 64
gig 3g or so you can trade in but they
have a reuse and recycling program so
check this out here um seen i just
publish this article this morning and
for the ipad to the basic 16 gig Wi-Fi
model you can get two hundred and five
bucks for it which is about the going
rate if you were to use a site like
gazelle or even ebay you know a little
bit more on EV I think you're gonna get
more on ebay well that's just by nature
of the auction process yeah but that's
interesting that's I think it's a really
good deal that'll put you well into the
cost of a new one yeah um or just buy
you know what just buy a refurbished
ipad 2 I think that's going for 300 350
350 on the apple store no one's gonna
blame you great now yeah and you know
the reason is 500 bucks I feel like the
whole status symbol thing is moot this
generation well that's because it
doesn't look any different exactly make
it higher class exactly so there was
that whole thing were like oh I can tell
you've got the first iPad yeah your
clunky piece car you know just I'd be
interested to know if it is really no
way of actually calculating yeah but if
the sales were affected by the lack of a
hardware does I would say no but I just
don't think based on that principle that
people can't show off their new product
by uh because it doesn't look any
different right right no yeah it's
possible like you said no way to tell
are not gonna spend too much time in the
ipad check out sina com we've got a lot
more information about that here's a
cool story we're talking about this
energy monitoring app yeah basically
what it does is and it's called flux
ohmmeter yeah what it does is it's able
to shore Dom eter looks flux ohmmeter
sounds it's me from the world of acne is
not doing such a more flex ometer
there's no there's no dashes alright
yeah man I can't breathe I can't read
look so meter fuck cell meter
get out like a thermo meter right with
this third me here I do I was a reading
it like whatever it's not a real word
measurement chlorine it's not a frickin
real word uh using a hundred twenty
dollar device that's how much the flux
ometer costs right uh basically connects
to your fuse box and can wirelessly
report to you how much energy your home
is using yeah this is cool so they have
an Android app and uh you have a
compatible phone it'll basically
broadcast you detail information about
spikes in your energy use to warn you
about like an impending energy bill but
uh so father in Australia bought into
the flux ometer and he uses the app he
actually used it to bust his daughter's
house party which i think is really
really cool yeah and basically he was
out at dinner and he noticed a big spike
in the energy of youth of that night
which was weird because he thought
nobody was home was just his daughter
right and he what is she do it yet so
you notice that the air conditioner this
was in the summertime right knows that
the air conditioner uh was being turned
on a full blast for hours at a time
multiple lights were being used in the
house and the television was running all
at the same time yeah and he's kind of
wondering what was going on with that
and so he dialed in to the video
monitoring app that he has his house
yeah and saw that his daughter was
throwing a house party yes busted okay
um now this is I guess a little too big
brother II but did the daughter not know
that daddy's got his ear attached to not
only the wattage usage in your house but
also a freakin live feed of what's going
on in there um I'd probably yeah that's
that sounds like the case to me it's
called wire Clippers do a little snippet
e stick yeah all those laws yeah but no
daughter's going to be asking their
fathers about how they monitor their
energy consumption the house though yeah
that seems like a logical loop that one
day I could see getting by but the whole
video monitoring come on don't like that
we had it I think we were the last
generation be able to take advantage of
our parents tech ignorance yeah oh yeah
oh yeah I could do whatever I wanted I
downloaded all kinds of filthy stuff and
hid them within one subfolder no way she
could tell that and no one would have
any idol clue
now all bets are off all she had to do
was do a search in my on my pc for like
star dot mov or lecture guard on TG
that's it I would have been incriminated
I mean if that's incriminating yeah I
mean you're just a growing boy who can
blame it I think of the you make a
really good point we are the last free
generation yeah we're the last
generation that was able to just take
advantage of our parents ignorance and
not ignorance which is on education how
are they supposed to know right they all
coming out of the time is right we good
you know it's almost like we're lucky
that we had it during our preteen year I
mean yeah just being able to have been
exposed think about it though when we
were six and seven there was none of
that right you know so we we don't even
have it as good as possibly a few
generation a few years behind us right
right right and just the advancements in
surveillance online surveillance I think
that is going to be really incriminating
to a lot of kids what a lot of our
co-workers are starting to have babies
as well I sure our own rich brown just
had a kid yes and he's a really tech
savvy guy clearly he works at CNN he's
an editor here so I mean his daughter's
gonna have a hell of a time trying to
hide her partying too sorry sweetie
knocking outsmart me the party's over
orchids seen it I think you're gonna get
around me I work at see ya you can't
sleep a Snooper no I'm gonna stall so
many logs on my kids you can't snoop
snoop no way how do you think invented
all this it's true I am the internet
kidding man shit you're gonna tell you
want to go on the internet I am a damn
Internet you're gonna wear a t-shirt
that says that yeah I'm the Internet
what now reload this man or maybe when
we get older and our kids are grown up
enough to try to test our internet savvy
we'll just be out of the game you think
at some point it'll go over our heads
toward would be like I can't handle this
like I'm a big I mean don't get me wrong
there's there's a few cultural things
that have already gone over my head but
I'm kind of proud of that what do you
mean just like you know little guy sort
of like cultural phenomenons that are
just stupid okay silly again action
trend or that the don't man bands yeah
that doesn't matter
I'm not better off you know with that
I'm better off without it yeah so I feel
like those things will and have have and
will continue to go over my head but in
terms of your sort of ability to pick up
on on technology I think because it was
ingrained in us in such a young age
right I feel like we have that advantage
going forward you know unless you get
some you know i J I just can't see it
evolving to the point where it's just so
it's just Greek to us yeah where it's
just another language yeah yeah I mean
it's anything I still think we're at the
advantage because we grew up having to
like code and and sort of worried about
the back end things we know how these
things work you just know how to use
them oh man you think that iphones new
I've installed 50 preloaded apps onto
that thing that will track your every
locate exactly everything you said I me
transmitted you know we're we're steps
ahead I feel like look you know you look
at like anonymous in these people who
who are arguably our age right the
they're in their late twenties mid to
late twenties whatever it is early
thirties you know these people grew up
with it right you feel like people
coming up now or you do you know what I
mean Richard you understand like there's
a there's a certain cutoff where it's
like okay you're just used to this you
know how to use it right you don't know
how it works I don't know maybe I'm
generalizing well I for the bottom yeah
right and our parents also didn't grow
up in an age where it was really likely
they would work for a tech company to I
feel like all my friends right now
exactly involved in one or another with
startups with you know something to do
with consumer tech I mean I'm don't get
me wrong there's definitely our section
of our generation will be represented in
the ones that come behind us yeah and
after us but what are some what if
everything changes so much that our
generation gets left behind don't say
that Richard not gonna like you're
talking crazy because well I didn't know
like my parents are knew how to use a
typewriter and I didn't know how to use
that when I was a kid that's a good
point and so they thought they were so
far ahead of me yeah they're like look
at Richard yeah doesn't even know how to
put new pink ribbons on this typewriter
yeah so maybe that will happen to us me
what we leave behind ya little changed
so much that the new generation we like
oh we know more than our parents it's
possible I can't wait
my kids do that's another thing I'm
really looking for real psyched about
that yeah definitely all right let's
let's take a break when we come back a
lot more with the 404 stick around we
will be back right after this this is
the 404 Mr f'ers the show where we all
sing songs here's the m16 lamp I made
using a toy and 16 and an a leg lamp
from ikea and i just wired it together
and spray-paint it gold and put a
lampshade from target on top and that's
it voila here's the best part since it's
a toy m16 the firing mechanism still
works there you have it
hey this is all mark from Syria and
you're listening to the fluorophore to
show where these guys have fans overseas
oh yeah pretty awesome here's a question
for you yeah what's up as I was watching
that video we just watched a view of a
woman narrating a project she had built
as like a custom lamp yeah that's my
rifle toy m16 do you think it's possible
to tell to gauge the attractiveness of a
person male or female based on their
voice no not at all no but you do did
you do that though you consumptions
based on how their voice sounds or just
suck what it look kick-ass simple as
that yeah but do you know what I'm
saying know like when you hear people's
voices on the phone I feel like you sort
of give them you know like a degree of
attract it's 5050 bro no yeah it's its
55th yeah I mean there's no way to tell
right a sexy voice does not denote sexy
appearance right like phone sex
operators a lot of times or sound hot
yeah I'm sure I'm sure all the
attractive and gorgeous women are going
into cubicles and talking to you that's
how it works don't ruin this for me Jeff
I see it she's a little dose of reality
would be a good everything on there oh
man did I just burst your bubble yeah
there's a big bubble it's all over the
place Oh disgusting we're back on the
404 no no what to talk about I wonder
what assumptions our listeners make
about the way we look based on the
sounds will always have you ever had a
meet up at a meetup someone come up came
up to you and was like I've ever seen
you you're insanely ugly yeah you're the
ugliest thing no I have gotten that
before what did they say they're like
you look exactly the way I said you
sound a lot shorter yeah like oh my god
I can't believe how tall you are yeah
your voice indicated someone a very
short session I want to hear from our
listener means this is very vain but I
want to know what they thought that we
look like well buddy how do you guys
think we look like yeah I don't know man
if you think your voice matches the way
that you look I mean I think it does you
kind of have like a gruff how you can't
say that cuz you're you're in it you're
cut your your whole perception is
yeah but you don't sound like a little
like wood sprite e of a guy you know
like you sound like kind of like gruff
and you have a beard and you do have one
does this make sense I guess I didn't
always have this beard and I sounded the
same then so what week so what see the
second I also heard what's up yeah
before I was like yeah hey I'm Jeff back
alive welcome to see that yeah oh boy
all right uh what else we got going on
today ooh here's something I'm excited
about uh and this is right up your alley
because we're talking at once again
about the concept printers and how they
literally change our lives right what is
a laser unprinted what's an unprinted
getting redic is this something that
just spits out like wood that's the only
thing I can think of odd so in an effort
to reduce the environmental footprint of
uh you know corporate offices that print
a lot of photos sure documents right
this uh study at a Cambridge University
these researchers have created a laser
on printer that's a device that actually
takes laser toner off of used paper I'll
do that with lasers with lace yeah like
I did I trash it to you well that Lee's
lasers I said check it's almost like a
doctor evil sort of yeah sort of yeah um
go on that could sound like El Guapo for
a second three amigos uh if I know that
it didn't really go into a lot more
detail other than the fact that it uses
lasers to remove lasers off laser
printed paper I use that word in this
article yeah and I'm not quite sure
about the technology either but I
thought it was a clever way the sort of
reuse paper right so a lot of times
people just flip over a sheet and use
like an auto document feeder on their
printer but automatically flip that over
but now you can just literally take it
off and reuse all the documents you want
if you're printing something is
trivially is like an article or like an
email or so i guess the concept of like
reusing the same sheet of paper over and
over again is a good idea because how
often are you printing out something
that you need more that you need to keep
around right I for one time use you
could make very good use of this concept
because apron rain forest oh you could
are you kidding there be a whole country
of kids who be could eat this is what
Justin prints out every day
440 for this I mean he pretty but you
print out it's a little crazy to me that
you print out the day's stories yeah but
I'm like oh you're like old school I
need to waste no I mean I need show us
you could show us you have enough there
to show us yeah look at that I mean I'm
like covered in that's from one day this
is just 2012 all the stories we've
talked about today what I don't know
that we actually script out the entire
40 4 episode there it read it off these
sheets of paper that down to about 10
pages that's what we deal with every day
how how long of a period of time would
you say that massive stack and we're
talking we're not talking for people who
are just listening to us yet that's like
a book right there that's like a big
healthy book wall like okay so this
little behind the scenes of the 404 but
um so every day I read all the articles
and source them online and then I
summarize them for myself on these
notepads right all right I'll I pretty
much just write out the key points that
I want to say right because there's so
many stories that we talk about every
year that I can show how long how many
shows is one this is one sheet / show
right this is just like also summer
those are all one offs so you got about
400 shows right there so yeah this is
probably about that much a couple
hundred does maybe like three four
months let's blow my Mon dude yeah it's
balm I'm on it's better than before
before I would print out every article
and just highlight the key points this
is actually saving paper yeah you're
really you know an environmentalist over
there Greenpeace reincarnating you know
personified right here get out of here
uh Huffington Post has an article about
the 15 most popular people on facebook
these are celebrity pages with the most
likes yeah let's scroll through a couple
of these because I don't know this
always blows my mind over what is
popular on the Internet yeah these are
the group pages like celebrity fan page
right people could just hit like I mean
when you start with number 15 already
it's like really Avril Lavigne is number
15 what I thought was really interesting
is that there's quite a bit of dead
celebrities that are still being liked
and followed right on this page for
example like Bob Marley made it into the
top 12 interesting so real quick 14 is
uh Megan Fox who's this dude he's a
soccer player Lionel Lionel Messi
Leo Messi the I'd say of course he's got
33 million likes that's blows my mind
yeah beyonce's number 12 number 11 Lil
Wayne little Wayne by far the biggest uh
can you sort of confusing things they
gotta it's amazing it's like Little John
is actually little Irish don't get it
just don't get it nobody's email of
little Wayne no music is good though
yeah that's aI don't get it k people
some people like to dance I like to
dance too so there's this thing called
like fun right people tend to do it on
like the week sorry dude you cannot tell
me that little Wayne is a big
contributor you know my problem with him
is is that he like picks up a guitar and
pretends to play it yeah and then like
smashes it yeah avril lavigne delegate
to but you have posters for plaster all
around all how how dare you know they're
they're the same person as far as I'm
concerned k yeah puppets let's let's
move on here go on cuz I like little
Wayne Akon of course 36 million likes
yeah makes sense so here it is Bob
Marley may never know somebody talented
what do you know yeah wait are you
sarcastic no I really did Marley's
amazing ja yeah uh Katy Perry 40 million
give me a break she hot and then another
soccer player Ronaldo some reason yeah
dude you don't know Cristiano Ronaldo I
don't know Chris morena although i do
know justin bieber though i was
surprised about this he only made number
six on the list with 40 1.3 million yeah
i thought it would have been number one
apparently kids don't have the clicking
powers they did before I guess not
they're all too busy voting on American
Idol it almost face he does number five
MJ Michael Jackson yeah okay number four
shakira she looks weird she's a little
strange in that photo number three lady
gaga chorus again yeah god forbid
someone talented is on the Lillian hmm
that's awesome she deserves it Rihanna
number 253 million no surprise there and
number one Eminem still has 56 million
likes bit of a shocker to me that's
really surprising I'm a little shocked
at that yeah how come Barack Obama
though doesn't I mean I hate to be that
guy that's like well you know is it all
the celebrities it's a weird that mm
probably has more likes on his Facebook
page then people who voted in the last
election yeah
is really upset that's probably accurate
right like what's the percentage of
people that vote in this country to
their credit is a lot easier to click
one button online that it is to go to
the voting would you say to their credit
or let's just say it's easier is easier
yeah there you go it's easier there's no
credit being given to someone who votes
on a on a Facebook right um dia that's
super depressing what about your
Facebook page have you liked any
celebrities oh no not maybe a couple
like TV shows right you know yeah sons
of anarchy that that deal yeah now go
out of my way to help out like things
are really like I guess or like your
friends bands and stuff yeah sure of
course what the hell speaking of things
you like and can help out things that
you like new a thing on Kickstarter that
I wanted to to bring attention to I have
it here in the rundown it's called juice
tank okay and this is brand-new it's out
today uh this actually seems really cool
and inventive it's an iphone case that
has the electrical plugs built in to the
casing wait what so if you are you're
watching the video you see the two
prongs and come up BAM you just pop it
into the outlet directly from not feel
right to me now right like the 21 is
more do that really it's really smart
yeah um it's called juice tank it's
already gotten a pledge of two thousand
sixty dollars from 39 backers with 59
days to go there looking for a hundred
and twenty-five thousand dollars I think
they're gonna do it yeah this is really
smart it's smart I hope they make it for
every phone out there I think it's going
to be easier to do it on something like
iPhone because it's that standardized
port one size fits all um you know I
would really love for them to to break
out and do it on other things can we
sort of like come up with possibly any
way that it would like not work I mean
this sort of seems foolproof right yeah
it's a smart thing I guess I guess the
only thing is like well there's outlets
that are maybe like hidden behind
couches and you're just going to hang
out behind a couch at the same time
though think about all the pros of that
situation like oh I let's say you use
your phone as an alarm clock
and bam it's just like in it's just
there you know you don't have to like
yeah bitch around all things that are
right next to their head I'm just saying
maybe it'll force you have to get up and
go turn it off yeah I don't know what do
you think that I think this is smart I
think if it's just nice to see someone
sort of thinking progressively his to
detriment seriously I feel like a lot of
times people have outlets covered by
furniture or you know there's not always
an open al accessibility accessibility
is an issue like your alarm clock point
I don't know people are gonna be willing
to just stick it down below their bed
right the other thing is that doesn't
look like you can plug this into an
existing outlet that has another device
plugged into the top outlet different
like the outlet on the case isn't low
enough on the case to allow wait let's
go back is there a photo of it actually
plugged in because maybe we could have a
better idea also uh it does not look
like and I hope this is not the case but
judging from these and these are
prototypes we're looking at on the on
the side here ok let's see here's a
video of a plug in it I think it'll work
yeah that'll work that'll be fine or you
it would be upside down if you plug it
into the bottom one doesn't look like
there's room for the the IP iphone dock
connector though Oh on the bottom yeah
in the prototypes that they have here
there is no you still need for the USB
connection right of course but you still
need so that's a little bit of a bummer
uh but other than that I mean I really
like if I an iphone I'm all over this
and as long as we were doing this design
I would have maybe liked a little bit of
extra power in the case itself right you
know mean something like a mophie juice
pack built in that would pout that would
recharge both the internal battery and
an external attach the case do you think
it has that I don't know they might have
that I don't know it just came out I
literally just got the president the
press release so I wanted to put it up
because I've never seen anything like it
it's very smart the design is cool too
because the prongs on the on the thing
they don't just like slide out they come
they sort of come from there like wings
you know what I mean and they come in
together looks like they have a micro
USB port built into the back too oh yeah
inside here there it is just plug in if
you need to connect to your computer
tonight so that's really cool they've
they've seemingly thought of everything
uh very cool it's called juice tank I'm
I've never helped out a Kickstarter
thing before yeah I have an iphone but
if they made an 814 my galaxy nexus I'm
all about it's gonna electrocute me when
I plug it into a wall socket yeah that's
the only thing because people aren't
exactly like the problems are protected
by anything so if you get rain water on
it and you know I god forbid you drop
this case in a toilet or something on a
drunken night next time you plug it into
the elect into the outlet that might
give you look shocked that's Eli's don't
worry about that let's not worry about
that part of the the story or just
cyan't you're just saying no that's a
that's a valid concern uh maybe we can
get in touch with these guys and ask
them ourselves uh it's about that time
calls from the public time to show the
love a jig 6404 scenic i tell you in
zombies all you gotta do is talk about
zombies and people will call ya alright
if you create crave brains they will
come that's the motto for the show today
aids burns the only want brains up
during yesterday's pre-show and a little
bit today we're talking about the
walking dead talking about what would
you do in a zombie apocalypse right also
the fact that you don't see any naked
zombies yeah there's not a lot of zooms
in za indian world of its own no than
liya not a lot of tegel cities no but
and I think this this stem from my
frustration with the fact that a rigid
it's cracking this is laughing so loving
it he's just like he's chucking away
beings are ya this stemmed with my
frustration in the fact that amc's
walking dead is arguably the most
gruesome show on television right they
had a scene where they showed a dude
taking a frickin shovel to a zombies
skull and it's freaking zombie brains
just splitting out without any cutting
with that any you no way to hide any of
the gore they showed a zombie literally
pulling apart a human gammak like you
know showing hey Dom be gone
but human gore I still think the zombie
gore even though it's science fiction
it's still pretty intense right like
it's not like alien gore you mean right
like you like if a little kids watching
that I'm crying and never going to bed
ever again my point was why it can we
show that but then a very nice love
scene between Glenn and Maggie they go
out of their way to hide her breasteses
well where are our priorities in this in
this world that we have been I mean do
you like and I'm not saying who've just
good we'll see some boobs it does it's
not what I mean I just don't like no I
don't like how things are just so out of
whack right you don't mean but ok so by
that principle then we should be showing
all kinds of things you want to see like
male full frontal as long as we're
talking about that yeah you know and
then we draw the line you don't draw the
line drive to draw a line at you're
talking about a zombie universe and
there's violence involved already so
might as well show that violent sure you
don't love doesn't mean you have to have
a gratuitous shot of boobs it's not on
that i'm not i am the kind of guy they'd
love to see you know like Maggie's a
beautiful woman sure of course and to
bring course I want glinting you know do
that too bright on behalf of the Asian
but you know does that have to do with
the story and do they need to show that
I am do they have nudity on AMC no
clearly yeah regardless so all these
zombies with their freaking frayed
clothing and all there there's not one
naked zombie walking around right
unrealistic yeah at some point there
would have been a zombie there was like
oh I got caught on a bush yeah well my
clothes are gone like wander into a
dressing room or something all perfectly
clothes even though zombies that are
like half alive half a body hmm yeah
what does he zombies like in bikinis and
like you know like boxers somebody had
been swimming so I had been at the beach
like in really compromising positions
grounds here right at the zombie Ground
Zero there had have been some people
dressing provocatively right I'm saying
right right all I'm saying keep it real
I don't know where we went with this but
he had Collin go and talk about talk to
us about what kind of weapons they would
be bringing mmm you seen it Jason from
san mateo you guys had a late show
yesterday what the heck zombie
apocalypse oh okay i guess i could see
why you're a little bit like little late
anyways in
more or less serious tone projectile
weapons no good I must have reusable
like crossbows like Justin said hockey
stick with a blade you'd make Casey
Jones very proud no no yeah yeah I guess
who would you bring along with you if
you had a zombie apocalypse I was
talking my co-workers about it and one
of them said Matthew wise to have a
farmer along with you another lease guys
were like you know keeping the peace I
guess yeah he makes a good point and
you've that sort of trend is coming up
in modern zombie tales like what arc
types would you bring you know
everyone's got like a class right you
know what I mean it's like oh you're the
former you're the police guy you're this
and that you got to keep order this
yadda yadda yadda so yeah good points we
appreciate the day we need podcasters in
the zombie apocalypse think they would
use us as bait yeah there'd be like put
the bug dressers in the tray with in
Chinese food so is that Justin Hugo
terrible we were also complaining
yesterday about the lack of intelligent
zombies here's a call to help us out
Josh you guys are talking about
intelligent zombied I saw this movie
that you might find interesting it's
called zombies anonymous available on
netflix answer place it's about a
society where zombies are intelligent
and integrating the precise they walk
and talk just like humans they get the
wrong me from the supermarket they even
have job movies about a girl will God
accidentally killed alright what I don't
want to spoil what this the movies about
but yeah I would check that out yeah
that sounds pretty cool uh I remember
our late podcast co-host he who shall
not be named he's not dead call him Lord
w uh Lord dubby Lord Voldemort I have
listened all W um he told me about some
really messed up zombie oh my god I know
what you're talking about look I don't
want I don't want bringing I'm not gonna
talk about what about but everyone
should go check it out it's called dead
girl no everyone should not go check it
now you should it's a very different
take oh oh oh yeah it kind of has to do
with the zombie nudity we were talking
about earlier oh fuck don't read the
summary on IMDb dead girl it's messed up
it is messed up viewer discretion
advised date movie though ah let's do
this hey guys what's going on what
on beach from the shot he'll just want
to reference yesterday's talking about
zombies and if they would ever be
smarter there's actually movie I think
you guys should check out it George
Romero's land of the dead of course they
actually have some evolves on me bitch I
don't want to spoil it for everybody but
if you had a chance take a look at some
clips on it and you apply be impressed
but uh how do you guys involved for
everything yeah he um he's obviously
credited with like the fuck being the
father of zombies all right um
definitely check that out land of the
dead is a classic still holds up still
effing scary yeah it's interesting that
in a world of all zombies you would
imagine they would evolve and they would
be able to become smarter just the way
you know if nature created them the
right sure would have them evolve um
finally with the zombie talk we'll
finish with this guy what stop for four
guys Matt this is Colorado Springs from
ah that's right I'm going rope I'm
starting a new trend yeah that was bad
comments you guys about your zombie
apocalypse talked yesterday what a great
topic I myself very huge huge zombie
apocalypse sent I think it could just be
insight into what a lawless world would
be like shares our current society is so
law-abiding a law stricken it gives us
that chance to kind of imagine what life
would be like without rules and running
around with guns shipping dead people in
the head yeah but you know what'd be fun
well not on schematic and you love that
I want to give you guys like top three
zombie apocalypse weapons number one a
silenced sniper rifle no silence why is
y0 right you need to get some distance
to destroy Tommy's without attracting
any noise unless of course those zombies
are def like Jeff depression dresses are
not silenced sniper rifle number two if
you do happen to get any close contact
with a zombie as Jeff had said also
hockey stick with a blade attached to
you know this head set zombies that
sick and number three would be a
crossbow or close medium-range you need
you need those refillable sort of Ron
ammunition weapons right those are
actually three great weapons you need
one long-distance sniper rifle I just
plays a lot of video games I really like
that but you know when you talk about
the blades you want to use on those
weapons you gotta think they can't be
big ones right because those get stuck
in these our brains really easily you
can't just pull it out for another hit
it so that's what I think honestly I
think that a bat like an aluminum bat
yeah real lightweight with uh you know
some like cordage around the bottom for
every wire and some barbed wire or like
maybe a couple nails that you can
quickly pull out but I would still do
serious damage does anybody the best for
sure yeah all right let us know what you
think internet 866 404 cnet the zombie
discussion will never end don't forget
that you're gonna expend a lot of energy
on the edge of those hits to see you
want something that you can pull back up
on those men hit again really quick you
know it's been Gatorade when you're
pillaging that lucky absolutely cuz
ain't gonna make any more of that once
the zombies take care thanks to Richard

twos or what you do a lightsaber would
be sick yes such a dream is saying but
