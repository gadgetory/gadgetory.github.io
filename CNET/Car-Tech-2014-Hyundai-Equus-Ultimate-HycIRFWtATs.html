the Germans don't lose a ton of sleep
over the Hyundai Equus Equus or necklace
or how the hell do you pronounce that
it's part of the problem let's try this
new 2014 with a tech of your cabin and a
nicer ride and check the tech spotting a
14 over a 13 really hard to do is a
little difference in the headlight LEDs
down here I think perfectly nice looking
vehicle but wow you would easily lose it
in a crowd the changes happened in
something that's about as good as you
ever gonna feel in a car under a hundred
grand it's a very nice quiet cabin as
we'll see on the road in a few moments
the past decklist had just a little bit
of a Hyundai stink about the plastic
that is really gone now this screen is
standard this is not standard we have
the ultimate trim car so that 12 inch
LCD instrument panel comes on this trim
level not on the base car here is
everything you've got on the system
navigation your radio sources including
HD radio and satellite your optical disc
player is here jukebox is a 30 gigabyte
hard drive I could not care less USB
plug in or in this case my iPods using
the USB it comes up on a separate
location streaming audio of course and
you've got telephony and blue link
telematics the navigation system looks
perfectly good there's nothing about it
that really grates me and as is Hyundai
tradition you have basically very simple
views not this 3d flyover and buildings
and bird's-eye and I'm ok with that to
be honest one thing I like about the way
it handles all audio sources is a really
good usage of the meta tag information
clean that is if I go to streaming audio
you'll see a similar representation
lexicon branded 7.1 surround system 17
speakers as I recall 598 watts of power
none of that matters how good it sounds
does and we liked it unless they want to
comment here is on Blu link this is a
telematics system not a connected
driving system the difference is this is
more like a GM OnStar if you will it's
got kind of basic information send to
car for destinations but there's no
Google search in here there's no search
to nav the things that really are
the class this guy doesn't have
Hyundai's control interface is it's not
like really anybody else's you got a
home button and a knob and click and
turn here that's pretty common you've
got a home button over here but notice
what they do they use bottom left and
right corner logic so these are shortcut
buttons that take you to whatever the
shortcut menus are in these corners of
the screen
this is not a touchscreen by the way
which is kind of unusual typically it's
got to be a German car before it doesn't
work on the touch this one doesn't
either though you got to use buttons
here at all times thank you for a nice
big back button every car should have
that look out there you're gonna see a
head-up display that is exceptionally
good this is one of the best in the
business in fact aside from BMW this is
the best in the business and that's
pretty impressive for this car this car
has more cameras than the bnh store in
New York
I can move around from in a round view
alongside my back view I can then select
this and I can get back for you only
I can go over here and get back and left
rear quarter
here's back in right rear quarter I mean
there's nothing you can't see on this
car except maybe up through the roof oh
you can do that - you got a sunroof
aside from infinity no one does as many
views as this guy now the back seat in
this car is quite a nice place as well
first of all it has great legroom I
don't like big cars that don't have back
seat space what's the point
this little rocker here let's you
control lumbar support and of course
heating and cooling back here three
zones two in the front one joint back
here now this may be the best integrated
set of rear seat entertainment screens
gonna say any car shy of a quarter
million but I don't think any car does a
better job than this you turn these guys
on here independently with buttons for a
left and right passenger they kind of
tilt an angle notice like in a nice
airline seat I can watch what's on the
map sit here and fight with the driver
tell him or her she's an idiot for the
route she's taking all that fun stuff I
can jump to the homescreen the same one
we saw up in the front row those blue
link telematics services are back here
so I can help out looking at stuff the
DVD in the front will play in the rear
but obviously not distract the driver in
the front
now up here on the prowl we've got
relatively conventional but modern
engine technology let me explain that v8
of course five liter gasoline direct
injection beyond that we've got the
usual very complex variable valve timing
technology but it is a longitudinally
mounted front engine rear wheel drive
car there's no all-wheel drive variant
of this vehicle this is modern but
relatively basic 429 horsepower 376
foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 is around
five point six five point seven seconds
for a car that weighs 4,600 plus pounds
not bad one choice on the gearbox an
8-speed automatic and the mpg is 15 City
23 highway averages about eighteen Oh
Mitchell average a little bit less than
that actually they've really gone after
Lexus LS it does not feel like a German
car it feels like a nice taut ly strong
Lexus the power on this car is ample in
fact you light up the rear end a little
bit not trying to not even wanting to
but because it's just got a whole bunch
under tap even though the torque number
is not terribly high so if you're buying
a big sedan that's also a great little
possible car if you could even say that
on the weekend this is probably not it
and this head-up display is great it
shows you miles per hour of your
speedometer it also will show you
navigation it'll bring up some other
driving prompts as you're going it's not
quite as sharp big or bright as BMW but
it's the closest of any car maker yet to
all three of those things from BMW so
it's a close number two in the industry
right now okay pricing in Equus is
really easy it's 61 920 delivered for
the basic car which is of course a very
nice car but to go see that style you
got to add a $7000 ultimate upgrade
that's gonna get you that LCD instrument
panel to get you have a cameras that are
just about everywhere the rear seat
entertainment system and they get you
the head-up display I like so much so
now you're at 68 920 and that's about
all you can do on this car
