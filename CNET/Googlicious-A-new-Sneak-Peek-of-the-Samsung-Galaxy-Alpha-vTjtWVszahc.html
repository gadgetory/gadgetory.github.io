to Google Isha's it's all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show so let's get to it and according to
the latest research by Net Applications
global usage of Android has surpassed
the overall usage of iOS for the first
time now we've known for a while that
Android holds the lead when it comes to
number of devices sold but this report
now shows that more people actually use
Android more now across net applications
network from june to july of this year
iOS usage dropped from 45-26 1% to 44.1
nine percent while android jump from 40
3.75 to 44.6 2% what might be one of the
causes will look out for Windows Phone
who jumped from under one percent to 2.4
nine percent last month not really the
biggest factor but another one is that
androids flagship phones have really
been released almost every month and
there's still no new apple iphone so
we'll see how that affects the numbers
then but it's still a big first for
Android and if you're waiting for yet
another blockbuster phone from samsung
take a look at more pictures of the
rumored Samsung Galaxy alpha also known
as the galaxy s5 prime or the galaxy F
believed to be their next offering in
the flagship phone battle it's no longer
completely plastic featuring an all
metal bezel the phone still looks very
similar to what we've expected from the
galaxy line other pictures have featured
a removable back but rumors say it will
have 32 gigs of non-expandable memory
this time around with a 12 megapixel
rear camera and a 2-megapixel
front-facing one we're also expecting a
new Samsung self-built chipset and
reports are pointing to an early August
release date all right the google is
reportedly working on a standalone photo
service that's separate from google plus
in an attempt to attract more users
according to bloomberg just like you'd
expect you'll be able to backup store
organize and edit your photos google is
considering rebranding the service with
a new name but no details on storage
offerings and pricing has been revealed
yet and and
police reports that Google is exploring
a new tool that could allow users to
create their own custom cases and even
live wallpapers for the Nexus product
line with a special interface called
workshop it's only set up for the Nexus
5 at the moment but it features two
different styles right now called Matt
me and moments Matt me would build a
graphic based on your location of choice
you can change colors and add text and
moments would let you take a picture
from your collection or build a collage
of photos that can also become the
primary design for your case not much
else is really known and there's no ETA
date for the Google workshop tool but it
would open things up a little bit beyond
the pretty limited accessories they have
for the Nexus 5 and other Google
hardware products also the Google now
launcher is available for all android
4.1 devices launcher previously only was
available for Nexus and Google Play
devices adding a Google now bar right on
the home screen for quick access and a
nicely integrated experience phones like
the HTC One m8 galaxy s5 and LG g3 will
now be able to have it as well the
whatsapp messenger app for Android gets
a beta update as well with official
support for Android wear now a part of
it previously you could only just view
messages link clear notifications but
now it adds the ability to reply with
voice so if you thought people talking
themselves with the Bluetooth headset
was weird people will now be making out
with their wrists in public a little
more often and whatever happened to
those mysterious Google barges we still
don't know exactly what they are Google
kept being ambiguous about them telling
us they plan to be interactive spaces
where people can learn about technology
but the Portland Herald Press reports
the 250 foot Google barge in Portland
Harbor is now being sold and the
container building sitting on top of it
will be scrapped now there's still a few
more out there like the one in San
Francisco's Bay that scene that first
broke the story about it has been
rumored to be anything from a floating
data center to a retail store now it's
feature is still unclear but this looks
like a project that might not be able to
keep its head above water and with that
I really think it's a good time to end
the show alright everybody that's going
to do it for this week email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
at Brian song
and I'll answer you when I can thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you guys
next time for some more of that
delicious delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
