to the first Golf GTI I drove way back
in the day this is what it felt like the
world is full of affordable cars with
kind of gray and white personality and
the golf has always been different
no variant more saturated than this guy
the Golf R now it's not a car for
everyone it's high in price and low in
production volume but it cast an
important halo over the entire
Volkswagen line with its road-going
prowl s spotting one is surprisingly
tricky you'll see some very small subtle
are badges around the side flanks in the
rear it's got some different functional
air scoops around the sides of the chin
a little different set of wheels and
body kit but overall it's not a car that
shouts look with my owner bought it
instead says rather confidently look
what I can do
and right off the bat I've always liked
these VW cabins and I still do they're
clean they're kind of classic a quality
of materials in here remains really good
as for this head unit this is the best
argument for using a smart phone luckily
there's not much of it it is touch based
it's got some very crude pinch zoom and
swipe that is barely responsive they did
waste time on things like proximity
sensing so ribbons of buttons come and
go which doesn't really get me anywhere
they should have put that effort and
that investment into things like much
faster voice glynn please say a country
or a state first California sometimes it
even starts by asking me what country I
want to drive - you have nope modern
infotainment applications or anything
like that
am/fm HD satellite you've got this
pigtail device there MDI that they use
which is really horrible you've got to
buy specialized cables and don't lose
them the overall interface display
quality and clunkiness of the voice
command system on here is dreadful that
of course is not the point of buying a
Golf R so let's get onto our drive
controls here is your current one choice
only gear shift which is your DSG shift
lever you click through for drive modes
each one ups the aggression of the
shifting and the powertrain that
includes our adaptive suspension which
is optional on this car our electric
steering assist level our engine power
on rush
now in here is a big part of where
you're spending that extra 14 grand or
so over a GTI 2-liter turbocharged
direct-injected four-cylinder sitting
sidesaddle that may sound like a story
you've heard before but this one's more
uptight than the other ones we're
getting some real power here 292 horse
280 pound-feet of torque vehicle weighs
3,300 pounds gets up to 60 in just under
five seconds but still delivering 2330
MPG so it wants those mpg to be done on
the backs of premium gallons now behind
that engine is one drivetrain right now
all-wheel drive at a sporting fashion
with a howl deck center differential
this is Audi Quattro cousins stuff and
interestingly you cannot get a manual
gearbox on the 15 so you can only get a
six-speed dual-clutch or DSG as VW calls
them in 2016 that will be joined by a
six-speed manual option they'll reduce
the cost by a grand or so as well as
bringing you some purity of purpose the
first thing I noticed in our Golf R is
that let's face it a 2 litre inline-four
with a turbo is always gonna feel like a
2 litre inline-four with the turbo you
can get buried under a lack of boost or
two taller gear pretty easily so it's a
car you got to stay involved in but that
doesn't bother me because that's why you
bought an R got a whole mess of power
coming on here right when I need it as
long as I keep the revs up and keep that
turbos fooled now we have that DCC
adaptive suspension I haven't done an
a/b against the dead steel version but
this car does not suffer from any
understeer you pointed and it kicks
right in that way
I love the sound this car makes but
turns out what I'm hearing isn't
necessarily just the engine there's
something up in the towel at the base of
the windshield electronic device called
the sound actor which resonates a
synthetic growl up through the bottom of
the glass apparently a lot of folks get
in there and unplug it
gotta say it's kind of unseemly for one
of the last great honest driving cars so
I'm sad they put it there but maybe the
engine doesn't sound very good now I
know many of you rue the fact we don't
yet have a manual gearbox in this
vehicle but I can tell you this is a
super snappy sharp and quick DSG it's
got pretty good around town manners with
the exception of getting caught
flat-footed sometimes an automatic mode
however I'd still like to have that
third panel just to really get in touch
with the simple but brawny honesty of
this car just a little better and
despite our 19th and our low profile
tires ride quality is really good you
will have no problem in everyday driving
with your arm since the last Golf R
we've picked up 36 horsepower and three
mpg highway plus some torque
let's price out our little R or D you
red friend now a Golf R starts a little
bit over 37,000 with destination and by
the time you add the adaptive suspension
and nav package that's one line item
like we have you're at about 40 grand
here's what I'm gonna do though I want
purity in this to really honor its golf
roots but also enjoy its special
hardware I'm gonna take out the adaptive
suspension and nav package I'm also
gonna wait till 2016 and buy the next
generation that has a six-speed manual
that takes eleven hundred dollars off
the price and now I'm just over 36 this
is not a golf for everyone in fact you
don't need my opinion to tell you to buy
one you've already made up your mind but
what this car really does show is it
Volkswagen as much or more than any
other car maker knows how to extend the
line without blurring more cars driven
