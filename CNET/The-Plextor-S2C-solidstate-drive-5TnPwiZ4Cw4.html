state drive or SSD from plextor now this
one is a standard SSD meaning it can
replace any regular hard drive like this
one right here and that's also its main
purpose this is a replacement SSD and
that because this is an entry-level SSD
not fast enough to replace other SSD but
more than passing up to replace any
regular hard drive is also affordable
now this particular one right here the
top capacity of 512 big Buy has a
suggested price of just 134 dollars or
just about 26 sent polka Cuba and you
will likely fight on the street for less
than that now in testing as expected
this wasn't the fastest SSD I've ever
seen but it's not the slowest either and
that's good because truly compared with
any regular hard drive it is so much
faster so again if you have computer
that still runs on a regular hard drive
we played that drive with this one here
will bring about a huge improvement in
performance now the drive here comes
with a three-year warranty which is not
extremely long but you can use it for
much longer than that and that's because
it comes with very decent endurance
which basically the amount of data you
can write to an SSD before it becomes
unreliable and specifically on this
drive here you can write up 250 terrible
or if you write 10 gigabyte per day and
every day they will take some 40 year
before you can wear out and that's
pretty cool because guess what in 40
years this could be the first and the
only part of me that's not working and
that's because I'm down low and this is
the s2c SSD for click store okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
