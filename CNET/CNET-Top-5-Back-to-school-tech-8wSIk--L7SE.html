will be happy to go back to school right
I mean who can really sustain more than
a few months of leisure and travel and
partying the kids today want to get
there learn on right but for those rare
students feeling a little less than
inspired to jump back into school here
are 5 tech gifts that will ease the
transition starting off at number 5 the
piper it's a bit of a wild card choice
here but for students dealing with a
skeevy roommate situation this
all-in-one home security camera could
provide some peace of mind as everything
built-in has a motion sensor temperature
two-way audio and 105 decibels siren 240
bucks but can you really put a price on
finally figuring out who's eating your
peanut butter at number 4 GoPro Hero 3
plus Black Edition and you're young you
do all kinds of insane stuff
snowboarding bungee jumping keg stands
so why not capture it all in
crystal-clear HD
I figure you're gonna spend the second
half of your life reminiscing about the
first half of your life and you don't
want to strain your elderly eyes at some
grainy cell phone video the hero 3 plus
is the top of the line and easily mounts
on your skydiving helmet coming in at
number 3 Sony Playstation 4
the thrill of skydiving lasts only
minutes but the rush of blasting hordes
of bloodthirsty zombies with a sawed-off
shotgun that could be a whole weekend if
you do it right
$400 gets you the most celebrated
next-generation game console out there
perfect for turning any finely tuned
academic brain into a puddle of mush if
the Rays justify it ps4 is a sweet
reward at number 2 a new TV not
everyone's into games but no one can
argue with a brand-new TV our favorite
value right now is the Vizio e-series
which comes in a range of sizes from 39
inches up through 60 the 55 inch can be
snapped up for around 700 bucks it looks
great and it comes with Vizio smol suite
of smart TV software I know it seems
like a bad idea to give a student a
giant colorful 55 inch distraction but
by turning your kid into a couch potato
least you'll know where they are now
before we get to number one how about a
piece of tech that may actually help
students get some work done our editors
pick for back-to-school text that will
transcend everything else on this list
is the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air $1,000
gets you one of our favorite laptops it
comes with great battery life a fast
processor and an operating system that
isn't suffering from an identity crisis
best of all the super lightweight design
will prevent you from getting stuck with
a bill from the chiropractor all right
and now the number one piece of
back-to-school tech a new smartphone our
pick is the motorola moto G it's a 4G
phone with a beautiful 4.5 inch screen
the latest version of Android and a
price of $219 that's an off contract
price that's the total cost of the whole
phone considering that I have never seen
a college student who doesn't have a
giant crack in the middle of their
screen an affordable phone is the way to
go also kids a little advice from uncle
Donald empty those pockets before the
cake sale so there you go five choice
bits of tech to help ease the transition
back to higher learning check out our
full guide over at back-to-school
