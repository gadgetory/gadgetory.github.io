I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it's that time of year when we
look back at the most influential
technology over the past year from news
stories trends gadgets and people seen
it has published a list of the top 100
those of you that keep up with your
daily episodes of update are on top of
it also care to take a guess or the top
tech story was or how about the biggest
technology shake-up to come out in 2012
I'll have more on that in a minute but
first an update to the photo filter
fight going on right now between Twitter
and Instagram Twitter just added the
ability to crop photos and add special
effects right from the app Twitter and
Instagram both want to be your one-stop
shop for all your photo sharing needs
and to compete Instagram also pushed out
an update that added another filter and
more camera options so if you're going
photo happy this holiday here's what you
need to remember Twitter's perk is that
you can see a preview of how your photo
looks and all filters on one screen
instagram has more filter choices and
the ability to share with Twitter and
Facebook at once and there's more
twitter news the new profile layout is
rolling out to every user on wednesday
that means everyone on twitter is
getting header photos it's similar to
facebook where you have this larger
photo right behind your main icon if you
don't add one your icon will just be
sitting in this grey box so start
thinking of photo ideas now and xbox
users several new apps are rolling out
this week including a cnet app where you
can catch this show and other videos
there's also a skydrive app that brings
your photos and videos saved in the
cloud to your TV so back to the cnet 100
what was the top news story that rocked
the tech world the patent trials between
Apple and Samsung the court found that
Samsung did infringe on Apple's patents
leaving Samsung to pay more than a
billion dollars in damages and a
possible sales ban on a number of
devices that's going to make it harder
for others inspired by Apple's designs
the biggest technology though went to
Windows 8 love it or hate it having a
completely different interface in a
normal
a predictable windows world was an
evolution that's shaking up the laptop
and tablet world because everyone's got
these new touchscreen hybrids the
samsung galaxy s3 ranked higher on the
list and the iphone 5 it was close but
the s3 knocked the iphone off its
pedestal it's a truly global phone on
nearly every carrier and it became the
Android hero in this divided market but
you can judge the full list yourself at
cnet com / cnet 100 and that's your tech
news update you can find links to all
these stories I mentioned on the blog
