show about DIY tech and how-to I'm
Donald Bell and I'm Sharon Vaknin this
week we take a look at gadgets to offer
you convenience and security at home and
we're starting with a keyless entry
system that lets you lock and unlock
your doors even when you're not at home
what if you had the power to be able to
lock or unlock your front door from
anywhere in the world just using your
smartphone well there's a wave of
Internet connected smart locks that
promise to do exactly that but a lot of
them are total replacements for your
existing deadbolt I'm gonna show you one
that's designed to fit over your
existing lock it's called lockitron it's
coming out this summer for $179 and it's
one of the only smart lock options out
there that's great for renters this is
not going to damage or replace your
existing lock now the first step is to
download the lockitron app it's
available for both iOS and Android it's
gonna walk you through the whole process
and on this first screen here you're
gonna notice a little thing for checking
the compatibility of your lock you take
a photo you sent it to the lockitron
people to make sure it's gonna work
because I swear we had to demo at least
five different doors before we found one
that would work for this video first
register online then add batteries to
power it up and finally connect your
home Wi-Fi network
alright it looks like we're all
connected it says the lock is unlocked
let's give it a swipe let's see if it
can communicate to the lock try the
other way great now it's time to get
this thing on the door using a
screwdriver I'm gonna put this C plate
behind my deadbolt and that'll give it a
nice base for the lock of trying to snap
on you're not to take it all the way off
just get it loose enough where I can
slide this thing in place it's two
little grooves here on the back it's
gonna lock right in here and then slide
carefully right there
now that everything's in place snap on
the cover and you're ready to go for one
last test the door is locked I want to
make sure I can unlock my door from my
phone from outside let's give a shot
I heard it
there we go all right my old lock has
now been upgraded and become part of the
internet of things I can now lock it and
unlock it from my smartphone of course
if the internet goes down or the
electricity goes out or the zombies
start attacking I can always just use my
good old fashioned front door key
so as cool as that lockitron product is
it's looking like about two months
before people can actually get their
hands on it and that's kind of the
nature of Kickstarter projects right you
got to keep hope alive
yes all right we're going to a quick
break but when we get back we'll show
you how to turn your old smartphone into
something much more useful yes we've got
a DIY project that will breathe new life
into your smartphone and give you some
extra peace of mind
welcome back so I'm a big fan of letting
things go I don't keep a lot of junk in
the house but I do have some old
smartphones collecting some dust well in
this next segment we're going to show
you how to take a few basic materials
some affordable ones and turn them into
a simple home security camera you can
easily spend hundreds of dollars on a
complex home security system or you can
do it yourself with almost any old cell
phone and just a few accessories here's
what you'll need an old cell phone today
I'll be using iPhones and a way to mount
it to the wall
I'll be using car mounts as an option
you can also use an add-on smartphone
lens I'll be using a fisheye a
wide-angle and to super fish eye lens
and what they'll give me is a wider view
of what the camera sees and finally
you'll need a power cord for each
security camera because those phones
will pretty much say on all the time
what I'll do is set up three different
cameras and you can do this at home or
at your office or wherever you want to
keep an eye on things I'll set up one at
my desk one at a coffee shop and one
where I have a view of traffic and
weather
once these cameras are all set up I'll
be able to check in on any of these
real-time feeds with my primary phone no
matter where I am and there are lots of
apps that turn your phone into a
security camera but the one I'm using
today is I cam that one is only
compatible with iOS devices but if
you're using Android phones then there's
tiny cam
the setup is really easy the way I cam
works is that there are two apps the
first is called I can source and you
download it on the devices that you want
to use as your security cameras that
one's five bucks when you've got it just
create a username and password log in
hit start and that's it your camera is
set up then grab the device you'll be
using to monitor in this case I'm using
an Android because I cam works with iOS
and Android for monitoring download I
cam it's also five bucks sign in with
the same username and password and voila
you'll be able to view one or all of the
devices that you've set up as security
cameras to set up the three security
cameras attached each camera to a mount
place a lens on each camera then mount
your security cameras in your desired
locations
finally to ensure a continuous stream
disable the auto lock feature now that
my three cameras are set up I can launch
the app and check in on them in real
time
I cam also has a feature that record
still images whenever it detects motion
it doesn't work perfectly but it is good
enough if you want to keep an eye on
who's coming and going you should also
know that the app works best when you
have a strong Wi-Fi connection it'll
make this whole process a lot smoother
so we've featured a lot of products that
connect to each other wirelessly but how
does it all work
Erik Franklin joins us to explain hey
guys you know we live in pretty amazing
times I mean the fact that you can have
one device and then instantly and
wirelessly communicate with another
that's a world away that's pretty
incredible so here's how it all works
in order for device to connect to the
Internet it needs a way for other
devices to be able to find it to know
where it is for example when you connect
your router to the internet for the
first time it's given a unique IP or
Internet Protocol address by your
internet service provider this allows
other devices to be able to find your
router in an ocean of billions of other
devices so once your router is connected
you have a home network and when you
connect other devices to that network
they're also given their own IP
addresses but there are local IP
addresses so that means they have to go
through your router in order to access
the Internet and vice versa so let's
take smart locks for example smart locks
use embedded Wi-Fi chips to connect to
the internet through your router and
during the initial setup process for
your smart lock your smart phone is
giving your smart locks and local IP
address so if you're at a party and you
can't remember if you've locked your
doors or not you take off your smart
phone you send a command to lock your
doors and it eventually reaches your
router and sends it to your smart lock
directly locking or unlocking your doors
now smart locks are really cool
technology and could one day make our
lives a lot easier
however like any new technology there
are some security concerns the reality
is that there are hackers out there so
proceed with caution knowing that there
are some risk involved that's it for
this week's show
thanks for watching if you have any
feedback for us or any ideas you can
tweet me at donald and i'm at sharing
back we look forward to hearing from you
see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
