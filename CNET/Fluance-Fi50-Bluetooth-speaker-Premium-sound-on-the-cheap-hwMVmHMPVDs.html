another first look video flew on sent
online direct-to-consumer Canadian
company is known for serving up
excellent performing speakers for modest
prices today we're looking at its second
bluetooth speaker the fi 50 it retails
for $200 and is one of the best sounding
wireless speakers you can buy for the
money but it has to be plugged into a
power outlet and doesn't run off an
internal rechargeable battery it looks
similar to its predecessor the fi 30 and
features the same medium density
fiberboard cabinet and comes in three
different color options including the
black ash model you see here this new
model has a larger 40 watt amplifier
better drivers and tweeters an LED
display and an equalizer that lets you
adjust treble and bass via the touch
controls on top of the speaker as for
connectivity you get an audio input for
connecting non bluetooth devices and a
USB input for charging smartphones and
tablets there's also Aptech streaming
for devices that support the feature
apdex is supposed to make Bluetooth
audio sound better although it's
debatable how much of an impact it has
on sound quality as I said the FI fifty
sounds really good for a Bluetooth
speaker it's able to produce a lot of
sound with good detail and deep bass
without distorting it's at least two to
three times the size the most portable
bluetooth speakers and it just plays a
lot bigger than those speakers with
fuller sound and in fact this model
could be used to power a party in a
medium-sized room if you really crank
the volume
the only drawback of the speaker is that
you just don't get the stereo separation
and wide soundstage that you get from a
pair of premium separate Bluetooth
bookshelf speakers but at the end of the
day while the FI 50 cost fifty dollars
more than the FI thirty you are getting
an improved sounding speaker and a
couple of key feature additions
particularly the LED display that once
again makes this a good option for those
seeking the best sound for their
Bluetooth buck I'm David Carr Noy and
that's the fluence FI 50 thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
