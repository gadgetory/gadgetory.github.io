you a safer driver I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update the next time
you get behind the wheel you may want to
think twice about using Siri to dictate
an email a new study shows that using a
hands-free voice system in your car
isn't a cure for distracted driving in
fact it may increase distraction an
Apple Siri assistant was the worst
offender of all the systems tested
triple-a strapped various monitors and
sensors on drivers to measure reaction
time when using different voice control
systems and the study confirmed what
many people already suspected trying to
get your car to actually understand your
voice commands can be a distraction the
results found that using your voice to
dictate texts and emails is more
distracting than just listening to the
playback of messages different car voice
systems were ranked on a one-to-five
scale with five being the worst although
apples car play isn't widely available
yet the researchers tested siri in the
car and found it to be the most
distracting system ranking it out of
four right behind it was the Chevrolet
MyLink at 3.7 and Ford SYNC and Ford
touch rated a three the least
distracting system tested was Toyota's
and tuned triple-a says it didn't matter
how natural or computerized the voice
sounded that didn't make a difference
what does make a difference is how easy
it is to use and the accuracy of the
dictation of course it goes without
saying that looking down at a phone and
typing is the worst thing you can do
while driving but don't let these voice
systems give you a false sense of safety
it's still distracting to dictate when
you have to review it to correct errors
in other news Microsoft and thirteen
other tech companies have made a promise
to protect student privacy and not sell
student data to advertisers a washington
DC group crafted the student privacy
pledge student privacy is important as
schools quickly adopt new tech in the
classroom it's actually pretty easy for
a program to track exactly how a student
is learning what keys they type or how
fast are getting through the chapter the
pledge doesn't stop a company from
collecting data rather the companies
that sign it just promise to make clear
what is being collected and not sell it
my
soft and others are likely motivated to
do this voluntarily so they can avoid
more government regulations California
just signed a law preventing companies
from selling data on students in K
through 12 and before I and one quick
update in the world of streaming video
the redbox instant video service has
been shut down the netflix rival was
developed in partnership with verizon
last year but it didn't take off and
customers will be getting refunds that's
