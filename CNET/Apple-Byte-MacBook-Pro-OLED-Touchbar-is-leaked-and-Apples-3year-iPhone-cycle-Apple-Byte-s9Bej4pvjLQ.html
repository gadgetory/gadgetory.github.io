are you sleepy no no just resting my
eyes
okay so I suppose eeeh what does this
new show intro look like I'm stoked
about this it's hot it's hot right we've
been working on it for a couple weeks
yeah yeah I mean it looks good but look
no school it's like the hotness you mean
you're sure you're sure to rose gold
dude yeah it is yes so you guys think we
can just add some rose gold in there
yeah yes yeah okay rose gold rose gold
rose gold all right what's happening
Brian Tong here and welcome to the all
new Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple it's a
brand new look with a brand new feel
that's so fresh and so clean hmm Plus
that intro rose gold alright let's get
to the show and it's official Apple's
WWDC keynote will take place on Monday
June the 13th at 10 a.m. Pacific time
after official invites were sent to the
press this week that's just under two
weeks away and you know we expect to see
something special this year like new
MacBook Pro rumors which are on fire and
this time it's cool to Mac with leaked
photos of what's claimed to be the next
MacBook Pro that features a space for
the rumored oled touch bar above the
keyboard the photos also suggest that
almost all the connectors will be
replaced by USB C ports with two on each
side and a hole that appears to be a
headphone jack see apple's not getting
rid of the headphone jack on everything
now the pictures don't indicate how much
slimmer if any the new MacBook Pro body
is but reports have pointed to a release
in the fourth quarter of this year
now WWDC 2016 needs something to get our
attention beyond software updates and
hopefully we'll hear more about the new
machine now in tech that we hope to see
in Apple's hardware Samsung recently
announced a 512 gig non-volatile memory
Express solid-state drive that combines
all the components into something
smaller than the size of a u.s.
saij stamp it's designed for next-gen
PCs and ultra slim notebooks and
capacity start at 128 256 and 512 gigs
Apple is used samsung solid-state drives
in the past so they could bring this to
MacBooks and more in the future but
nothing has been confirmed with the
drives being so new also Intel has
announced its next gen cabby Lake
processors that are on track to release
by late 2016 advancements over skylake
and performance battery life and media
capabilities come to the seventh gen
Intel Core processor the belief was that
skylake would be dropped into the next
line of MacBook Pros but now based on
rumors and timing cabie Lake could go
directly into the Refresh lineup if not
you can't imagine users being happy
about getting a processor that's already
out of date a month or two later for
flagship Apple machine give us cabby
Lake Apple also what else could we see
at WWDC how about a refreshed Apple
Thunderbolt 5k display with a GPU inside
now reports say inventory has been
unavailable or limited in multiple
stores around the world and the timing
would be ripe current Apple machines and
even the rumored MacBook Pro are unable
to run a 5k signal over a single stream
cable which could potentially mean a
built-in graphics card in the new
display would be able to work with
almost any Mac because it would be
driven by its own internal graphics card
so we will see what WWDC brings now I'm
also a huge fan of the Amazon echo smart
assistant and Google's
now going for their own with the Google
home but what about Apple a Senate
report says Apple has explored putting a
camera in the rumored Amazon echo like
rival device that would be self-aware
and detect who is in the room by using
facial recognition technology the device
would be able to instantly pull up a
person's preferences such as music and
lighting that they like well you know I
like the lights dim and dark with some
of that R&amp;amp;B
now the report says Hardware could be
released by year's end but it's more
likely to be available in 2017 Apple
could still change its plans to include
a camera or even scrap the device
entirely but you don't want to be the
third player in a market and that's what
it feels like right now
and finally iPhone news you know we
couldn't go a whole show without hearing
something about that iPhone a new report
from Japanese outlet Nikkei says Apple
will be moving to a three-year major
iPhone cycle claiming that the device
will also bring a new vibration motor
capable of producing more complex
patterns and earlier iPhones
now it could be an evolved version of
its current taptic engine that produces
different types of vibrations and
feedback I'm not sure what other complex
vibrations could really do to enhance
the use of my iPhone but then again
don't knock it if you haven't tried it
and I know last week we talked about the
potential of a new iPhone only bringing
16 gigs to start off but a claim by an
IHS technology analyst says supply chain
research indicates the iPhone 7 will
start with 32 gigs for the 199 base
model ok I will wait and see but if you
want the latest iphone 7 leaked here's
another for microblogging site Weibo
with the redesigned antenna lines a
space for the new single lens for the
4.7 inch model and that rose gold color
because you know rose gold it's what
everything should be now all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can email us at the Apple buy to
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tom tell
us what you think of this brand new
Apple buy 10 you know what I will read
some of your responses both good and bad
because I could take like a big boy
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple
are you seeing this what is this hey
where's the rose gold man rose gold my
ass oh that's good yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
