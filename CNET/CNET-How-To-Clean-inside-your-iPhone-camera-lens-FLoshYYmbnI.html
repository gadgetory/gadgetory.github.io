that the pictures I was taking on my
Apple iPhone 5 we're turning out hazy I
look closely at the back of the lens and
notice that there was actually dust
trapped inside the glass I don't know
how it got there but I'm going to show
you how to clean out your iPhone 5s rear
camera you're gonna need some tools for
this project I've got a P two pentalobe
screwdriver I picked up from I fix it I
also got this spudger tool though a
credit card can also work in a pinch
there's some suction cups here I'm gonna
use this screwdriver to help pull on one
of the suction cups got a lens cleaner
pen and some compressed air all right
now to start off we're gonna remove the
two pentalobe screws from the bottom of
the iPhone and use a little screwdriver
here and this is pretty easy to do but
the tricky part is not losing the screws
I'm glad I have a white table here if
you don't have a white table to do this
just get a nice sheet of white paper and
try not to do this over a floor or a
carpet or anywhere you're gonna lose
these screws once you've got those out
next step was we're gonna separate the
swing from the base of the phone now I
notice that it comes up best when you've
got the suction cups here near the home
button it'll kind of pull up this way
the first time I tried it it was really
tough it didn't seem like we were gonna
come off
but subsequent attempts were a little
bit easier I'm gonna use the screwdriver
here that's kind of loop into this hook
whatever kind of suction cups you have
is probably gonna be a different thing
let's see the trick is get it going but
not pull too hard where you're gonna rip
this thing right off cuz there's some
very delicate little ribbon cables in
here that if you ripped out would be
very bad so now I've got just a little
bit of it open here on the end I'm gonna
use the spudger tool coming here move it
around kind of will unclip it from the
sides top I think the suction cups off
we have here now when you first lift up
under the hood you're probably gonna
notice some dust right away you can use
the compressed air to clean some of that
out this were a full camera replacement
we'd be tempted to pull out these cables
and be able to take the screen entirely
off to really get access to the camera
but since we're just gonna be cleaning
it out what we can do is just twist this
gently and you'll notice the cameras
right here using just your fingernail or
one of these tools you can just a little
bit pull it back and there you have
access to the glass cover for the lens
and the lens itself I can use the lens
cleaning tool first clean the lens very
gently they move over to the glass
that's covering the lens and then if you
see any other dirt and grime around
there you can just rub that away or you
can even use the compressed air to blast
out anything that might be remaining
alright once it looks good
I'm gonna fold that camera back into
place gently I'm gonna twist the cover
back into place - and now starting with
the earpiece side I'm gonna plant that
back in and then slowly squeeze back
towards the home button kind of like
you're squeezing out a tuba toothpaste
I'll squeeze back in the place the last
thing we needed to do is put those
little tiny screws back in the bottom a
little magnetic tip on the screwdriver
let's hold the screw in place I fix it
also sells a little iPhone liberation
kit that replaces these little pentalobe
screws with standard Philips style
screws we'll make it a little easier if
you ever need to access the innards of
this phone again later but for now
putting the old ones back it's working
just fine I'm gonna power the phone back
on check out the camera and if all went
well your lens should be crystal clear
so there you go that's how to clean out
the rear camera on your Apple iPhone 5
