here is the infadoos Oh hobo 510 this is
a new robot vacuum from Hong Kong
manufacturer that produced one of our
least favorite products last year but
this is their new offered to the robot
vacuum world is it any better actually
yeah it's quite a bit better the clean
mat qq5 the robot vacuum we tested last
year had a lot of just intrinsic
problems with it the bin was terrible
you couldn't take it out without
spilling stuff not good that this one
has a much better bin it's not a perfect
bin but compared to that bin it is a
great bin also this one is better at
navigating it didn't fail our cliff test
and it just picks up stuff as well as
you would expect from a budget price
robot vacuum this one costs 239 on
Amazon you can shop around maybe get it
for around 200 I think that's a good
price but let's take a look at how well
did in our tests as you can see it does
a really good job with small particles
things like rice and I tested popcorn at
my apartment we test sand and sawdust
all those things it picked up very well
it tested well on carpet on short Berber
style carpet on hardwood all these
surfaces got pretty good numbers I'd say
better on hardwood than on the carpet
but still good and good enough to rely
on one weak spot though was pet hair the
infinito just didn't do a good job
picking the stuff up it would get
tangled in the brushes and not make it
into the bin so all of those tests were
pretty bad the Infini vote also wasn't
quite as intelligent as some of the
other robot vacuums that we've taken a
look at that takes a little longer it
kind of guesses about where it needs to
go it'll go over a lot of the same areas
twice before it finds new stuff to pick
up so it's just not quite as efficient
or smart but if you leave it going it
will get the job done the infini vote
comes with a remote control that is
circular in shape you'll be able to
steer the thing remotely yourself or a
set of time for it to go automatically
stop start whatever you need to do all
from through your remote control right
here
the Infini who also comes with an
invisible wall generator plus an extra
filter and an extra brush i think you're
gonna want to have that extra brush
handy because take a look at how the
brush spins
it hits that wheel every time it goes
around and so it's gonna wear down a
little bit faster to me that's a little
bit of a design flaw which they hadn't
done it quite like that the infant new
Volvo 510 is not as good a robot vacuum
as the neato signature pro or the Roomba
880 but it's also not as expensive a
robot vacuum and relative to the price I
think it's actually a pretty good value
especially if you don't have pets and if
you have hardwood floors you're seeing
that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
