cnet.com and I'm here with the JBL on
beat as you can see this is an iPad
stereo docking system it also takes the
iPhone and the iPod touch but the big
deal here is that it's supposed to work
with the iPad now the one small flaw is
that while it has a swiveling arm design
it doesn't swivel with the iPad that's a
real problem because if you want to
watch movies in landscape mode you can't
swim over the dock it won't stand up it
is not designed to work with the iPad
you can do it with the iPod Touch or the
iPhone but not the iPad apart from that
this is a pretty good little stereo
system it is fairly lightweight so you
can take it from room to room and it's
designed to sit on a bedside nightstand
does have a little bit of a funky design
the front looks a little bit like a
woman's formal dress some people won't
mind that some people will this does
sound decent it plays loud has decent
amount of detail it'll fill a small to
medium-sized room and that's really its
strong point it's a little thin on the
base because it is so small and there
isn't much in the way of stereo
separation but it is a decent sounding
little system around back it does have a
couple of extra features there's a USB
port so you can connect this to your
computer and sync your iTunes there's
also a video output however that is a
composite video output so the picture
isn't gonna be all that great but you
could send the video from your ipad or
iphone to a TV that's all there really
is to it
there isn't any built-in bluetooth like
there is on its bigger brother the JBL
on being extreme which does retail for a
lofty $500 this one goes for about $120
online that's down from its list price
of $150 when it first came out last year
in 2011 wouldn't call it a bargain of
that price really should be less than
$100 particularly because of that design
flaw where you can't put your iPad in
landscape mode really an iPad stereo
docking system should allow you to do
that so it's really hard to recommend at
this price I'm David Carr noise and
that's the
JBL on meat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
