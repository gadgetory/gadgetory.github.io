look at the alienware 14 allie ware a
division of dallas stripped down its
product names at least these used to be
called things like the m14 or m14x now
it's just the alienware 14 as you can
tell it has a 14 inch screen unlike most
of the laptops that we've seen this year
this is not a touchscreen in fact even
honor it's not even windows 8 this is
actually a Windows 7 laptop although you
can get Windows 8 as an add-on that's
largely because the gamers seem to
prefer windows 7 they don't like to go
through the windows 8 tile interface to
get to their games I think at the end of
the day it doesn't really make a huge
difference this has windows 7 which may
feel like a bit of a throwback all the
villain like a throwback is the fact
that this thing is huge for 14 s laptop
look how thick and gigantic and heavy
this is you could really stack up two or
three ultrabooks next to it and get to
about the same thickness of course
that's so they can cram in all the high
end gaming parts an alienware like other
high-end gaming laptop manufacturers
gives you a lot of options to choose a
you know CPUs and GPUs and different
types of hard drives I was pleasantly
surprised at this particular
configuration we have that 1799 it's got
a 4th generation Intel Core i7 CPU it's
got in videos 765m GPU which is pretty
good and it's got a dual hard drive
that's a 256 gig solid-state drive and a
750 gig regular hard drive all that
together was 1799 it's not a huge
bargain but I'm very comfortable paying
that price for those parts in this model
especially because it has a full 1920 x
1080 screen and the other 14 inch super
gaming laptop that we've seen recently
the razor blade 14 it's much thinner has
reasonably similar parts but it has a
terrible screen that has a lower
resolution and does not look nearly as
nice as this one of course because it's
an alien where'd you get all the crazy
kooky lights like back here and little
running lights on the side I
particularly like the the backlit
touchpad that's a new touch that is
probably the only kind of goofy visual
aesthetic thing that I really like about
the rest of it is a little bit the dorm
room shake but if you're in the market
for an alienware you know what you're
getting i'm dan ackerman and that is the
dell alienware 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
