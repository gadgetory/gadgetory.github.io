Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 it's thin light and
capable if you know anything about
Samsung tablets its features won't
really surprise you it's essentially a
skinnier version of these Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 without the S Pen Stylus of
course it includes a micro SD card slot
a 1.3 megapixel front camera and a 5
megapixel back camera there's a very
useful home button and the less useful
menu and back buttons a few years ago
Android brought these buttons into the
software so I just think it's a little
weird and possibly unnecessary to put
them back on the hardware however it
does free up a bit of screen real estate
there's also an IR blaster on the
tablets edge that works in tandem with
Samsung's watch on TV Guide slash remote
control software microUSB for charging
and transferring dual speakers and a
headphone jack on the top round out the
notable physical features multi window
which allows you to run two concurrent
apps makes its way over from the note
line and though it doesn't work as
seamlessly with your finger as opposed
to a stylus it's still a welcomed useful
feature for multitaskers but it's still
disappointing it doesn't work with every
app I really like how the Tab 3 fits in
my hand it's about the same way as an
iPad Mini and since it's not nearly as
wide it's easier to hold in one hand
it's definitely plastic but thanks to
its smooth rounded corners and well
placed features it doesn't feel cheap
the screen has a 1280 by 800 resolution
which while no longer impressive on
larger tablets is still high enough to
offer a high pixel density on an 8 inch
screen leading into an impressively
sharp and not to mention bright display
gains performance won't blow your hair
back or anything but it's good enough as
to not be distracting it's a low cost
$300 for 16 gigabytes of storage which
is maybe a tad much I would have been
much happier with something in the $270
range still with all the features it
offers it's difficult to raise two
biggest Inc about the price having said
that though a lower price would have
been much better
