this is the Yui roll a hundred dollar
waterproof Bluetooth speaker it comes in
multiple color options after the UE boom
and mega boom this is the third wireless
Bluetooth speaker in uese line and
instead of sticking to the cylindrical
design of those earlier models it's gone
with a discus shape for this
less-expensive speaker what's nice about
it is that you can lay it down flat or
pull out its integrated bungee cord and
hang it from whatever you want including
a showerhead overall the speaker has a
nice sturdy feel to it and it's got some
heft to it as well
weighing in it eleven point eight ounces
or 336 grams a built in rechargeable
battery is rated for nine hours of music
playback which is pretty decent and the
speaker has a 65-foot wireless range
which is double what your typical
Bluetooth speaker offers there are
volume controls on the top of the
speaker but no pause play button or
speakerphone capabilities as I said this
model is completely waterproof ipx7
certified with a set of ports that are
sealed off and it can be fully submerged
however it doesn't float but if you buy
the role from you e's website you do get
a little life preserver with your
purchase so you can have this speaker
hang out in your pool or another body of
water the sound is very good for speaker
this size and price and the speaker
manages not to distort at higher volumes
however you're not going to get as much
bass or volume as you would with the UE
boom or mega boom but that's why it
costs a good deal less than those
speakers you can't make left and right
speakers and create a stereo pair like
you can with you ease boom speakers but
joining the speakers together allows you
to project sound over a wider space I'm
David Carr noise that's the UE roll
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
