you that juicing is the secret to
detoxing your body and staying super
healthy there isn't a whole lot of
repeated solid evidence that juicing
lives up to claims like eliminating
toxins or improving your immune system
but a lot of people will agree that when
they drink juice they just feel better
I crave juice when I'm hungover because
it gives me the feeling at least that
I'm doing something healthy again I
think it rejuvenates me on a cellular
level I drink juice every day I would
think juice more if it was free the
gnarlier it tastes the better for me if
you're serious about juicing though
buying it from a juice shop can get
expensive you're better off doing it
yourself there are essentially three
ways to juice at home first there's
centrifugal juicing when you drop fruits
or veggies into one of these juicers a
fast-spinning blade chops it up and
simultaneously pushes it through a mesh
filter these machines can be cheap but
there is a catch some say that because
the spinning blade produces heat
precious enzymes are destroyed in the
process you still get your juice it's
just maybe not as nutritious
then there's the famous cold-pressed
juicer you'll also hear it called a
masticating juicer because the food gets
crushed and then pressed to extract a
juice much less heat is created but yeah
they're a lot more expensive
there is one more juicing option but
it's a lot more like a hack you use a
blender so here's what you do you blend
up your ingredients in a high-powered
blender then pass that liquid through a
fine mesh sieve milk bag or cheesecloth
to get rid of all the fiber so all
you're left with is that juice even
though there isn't a lot of evidence
that juice gonna make you a superhuman
somehow at least temporarily it has a
way of making you feel that way for me I
think I'll stick with the blender method
just for those times when I need a
little pick-me-up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
