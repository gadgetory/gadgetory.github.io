home's energy usage it can be hard to
figure out which devices are using the
most electricity
you could always venture out to your
electric meter but old analog models
like this one at the C net smart home
are particularly difficult to read and
they don't provide itemized lists of
individual devices and their energy
breakdown the two hundred and ninety
nine dollar sense Home Energy monitor
wants to make it easier to see which
products are doing the most damage to
your monthly electric bill and to some
extent it delivers on this promise the
first hurdle is installation this is not
a DIY process you'll want to enlist an
electrician to remove the breaker panel
and to hook up your sense unit it should
only take them about 10 minutes though
after that you can see real-time stats
of your home's energy usage in the sense
app since learns new devices over time
and will shoot you an email letting you
know it's identified your dryer or your
fridge this worked fairly well but the
discovery process took weeks and after
more than a month of testing since has
only managed to ID three specific
devices and two unnamed motors you
simply don't have any control over how
and when sense learns new appliances and
that can be frustrating since told me
the strength of your Wi-Fi connection
can impact how quickly it finds specific
products but even so I expected it to
detect more devices in five weeks since
is a decent energy monitor if you want
to view added glance whole home stats
but it doesn't do a great job
distinguishing among individual devices
it also costs 50 bucks more than its
competitor neurio I'd skip cents for now
and hope it improves its device
detection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
