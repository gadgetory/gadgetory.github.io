camera so similar to the Piper NV and
the canary all-in-one security device
this thing can do a whole lot first it
has a built-in 93 decibel siren which is
pretty loud it has motion detection but
it also has some other surprise features
so like the Piper and B it has a built
in z-wave hub so you can actually pair
and connect various z-wave devices
basically whatever you want so I
connected a water sensor it also has an
Alexa skill so you can control your
various z-wave connected devices with
your boys so turning on the lights or
turn them off and you can also create
your own custom messages things like
Alexa record a video clip as far as
specs go this camera is roughly
comparable to the nest cam
it has 1080p live streaming and also 130
degree diagonal field of view but
compare that to the Piper NV which also
has 1080p but it has a 180 degree
fisheye lens so in terms of wide-angle
Piper definitely does a better the
coolest thing about it as an all-in-one
DIY device is that it actually works
with a DT canopy so canopy is ADT's open
API that extends ADT's basically
professional monitoring and other you
know camera and video storage to this
device so instead of having to be locked
into a several month contract and deal
with termination fees and installation
fees it's on a month-to-month basis and
you can opt in to whatever level you
want but it's limited in that there's no
free options so if you don't want to pay
for ADT then there's really no reason to
get this device because Piper and canary
would do it better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
