bluetooth speaker that sits somewhere in
the middle of Sony's lineup of wireless
speakers well it doesn't have the
built-in Wi-Fi streaming of the larger
more expensive SRS x7 it's one of the
best sounding speakers in its price
class and a better value hi I'm David
Carnot here to give you a quick video
tour of the speaker which took me a
little bit by surprise after reviewing
the good but not great x7 I wasn't
expecting that much from its little
brother but as soon as I turned it on I
was impressed by the amount of bass it
delivers for its small size and it's
clean relatively natural sound from a
design standpoint this sports the same
simple minimalist design of its larger
siblings with the same glossy finish and
a choice of red black and white for the
speaker grille cover on top of the unit
you'll find a few different buttons some
of which including the volume and preset
sound modes are touch sensitive and yes
that glossy finish will attract some
fingerprints so be prepared to wipe the
speaker down from time to time as far as
extras go there's that aforementioned
speakerphone functionality along with
NFC tap de perak technology for
smartphones that support it
there's also Aptech support and audio
input for non bluetooth devices and more
importantly a USB charging port on the
back that will charge your smart phone
it can charge tablets too but it's only
1.5 amps so it would charge them very
slowly in many ways this could be
strictly with Boz's $200 Soundlink mini
and perhaps even boses soundlink
bluetooth speaker 3 it's a portable
speaker but due to its design it's more
of an indoor speaker that at 2.5 pounds
can be easily moved from room to room
battery life is rated at 8 hours which
is slightly better than the Bose mini 7
hours it's right there with the sound
like many in terms of sound quality and
has a similar sound profile with a lot
of bass for its small size as with all
these compact bluetooth speakers it does
have its limitations but like the Bose
products it managed to eke out a lot of
sound from a small frame without
distorting
I also found that it didn't move around
at higher volumes like it's larger
sibling the x7 does in the end there's a
case to be made that this is a better
buy than the bose sound like many it may
not have quite as sturdy a design but it
sounds as good and add speakerphone
functionality as I said it's one of the
best sounding compact wireless speakers
in its sub to another price class and
it's definitely recommendable if you're
looking for a portable wireless speaker
that you plan on using mainly indoors
