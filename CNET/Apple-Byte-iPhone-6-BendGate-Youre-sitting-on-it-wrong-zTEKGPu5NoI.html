the Apple buy for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple and I know
there were some of you out there that
got all mad after I put the hammer down
on Apple last week but if last week was
their worst week ever this week is their
worse diss worst week ever yeah no see
it actually does so let's just start off
with iOS 8 and did any of you run the
iOS 8.1 Update you know the one that was
supposed to fix a bug so that healthkit
apps would be made available on the App
Store and also improved the reach
ability feature for the iPhone 6 and
6-plus
well it also disabled cellular service
and killed touch ID functionality for
many people early upgraders and it
seemed to affected the iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 plus users do I even have to
say it
you already know that's a bad apple oh
and we're only on our first story so
Apple then pulled the update and people
stuck with a screwed over iPhone are
recommended to restore it with this
tutorial that you can check out here on
the scene at link infact Apple even
promoted the release of iOS 8.0 point 1
with their new ad campaign iOS 8 the
next brick thing and no that's not real
all right now that's just what recently
happened but we're not done yet with
every phone release the youtubes are
flooded with every torture test known to
man just to show how durable these
phones really are we've seen them drop
scratched with a knife dunked in water
and Hammer because we have no idea
what's going to happen if you drop a
hammer on the screen of an iPhone oh and
look it shatters but then here comes
bendgate
early complaints from customers claim
that their iPhone 6 plus was actually
bending in their pants with photos to
back it up and everyone's like no way
that can't be
but unbox therapy put it to the test and
physically Bend an iPhone 6 with their
bare hands now that dude either is The
Incredible Hulk
or he bent it with his bare hands and
I'm pretty sure he doesn't have green
skin now that's another bad apple so the
iPhone six-plus bends and I'm not trying
to minimize this but then it brought out
a history of other phones that have also
bent and how many people has this really
happened to a handful out of the record
10 million sold over the weekend sure
but do you feel good knowing you can
bend your iPhone with your bare hands no
you don't in fact in a genius move
Apple immediately address the issue with
another ad campaign the iPhone six-plus
you're sitting on it wrong now Apple
hasn't addressed the issue yet and this
isn't something that's going to get
fixed overnight but I told you the sixth
plus was not made to fit in skinny jeans
so for every hipster fashionista and
Twiggy legged individual thank you
skinny jeans for helping us make the
decision to buy an iPhone 6 because that
6 plus is huge and now you know why I
called this the worst diss worst week
ever for Apple oh and also hitting the
theaters this week starring Tim Cook and
Johnny I've bend it like iPhone 6 now
there are actually some good stories
this week here's a couple of really good
things about the iPhone 6 and 6 plus the
new iPhone cameras ranked first together
in the respected DxO mark mobile test
that's considered the definitive ranking
with an overall score of 82 surpassing
the Samsung Galaxy s5 and the sony
xperia z3 and every other competitor the
iPhone 6 and 6-plus cameras set the gold
standard for smartphone image quality
according to them with faster focusing
very good and generally reliable auto
exposure and fast and accurate autofocus
even website snap snap snap
did a cool feature where they took the
same picture with every generation
iPhone that's worth checking out to see
how it's evolved and really improved
over time so good news the iPhone is
back on top again for smartphone
photography all right now it may not be
advertised but the new iPhones also
support fast charging and are equipped
with the hardware to support two point
one a charging but ship with a slower
power adapter we know it we might as
well just throw out another bad Apple
while we're at it
okay I'm actually getting tired of doing
that now there are a variety of options
out there but the easy bet is just
getting apples 12 watt power adapter for
20 bucks or if you have an iPad already
you'll have one of these you can also
use that 20 bucks better with other
options like Belkin surge + dual 2.18
travel charger or a variety of other car
chargers that support fast charging as
well all right no one knows for sure
when the Apple watch is coming but a
report from the information says Apple
would be lucky to ship it by valentine's
day the report also makes a point that
Apple is really trying to get the Apple
watch out by the end of 2014 but they
missed their target now a Valentine's
Day would be horrible Apple don't do
this even if you can you're really
asking guys to choose between getting
flowers chocolates or taking out their
significant other to a nice dinner
versus waiting in line overnight for an
Apple watch and nothing says I love me
like getting an Apple watch for myself
alright let's announce the winners for
our detail for MacBooks com giveaway
where I asked you what did you do for
iOS 8 last week
Congrats go out to fo Burt who deleted
his daughter's first steps video for iOS
8 not nice ELISA works had to sit
outside in a McDonald's parking lot for
an hour and a half to use their Wi-Fi
