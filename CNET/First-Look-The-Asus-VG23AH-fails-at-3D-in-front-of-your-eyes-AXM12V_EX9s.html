with a 300 dollar IPS monitor with a
good amount of connections and herbal
options if your answer was something to
the effect of by including really bad
passive 3d you'd be getting warm and
I'll get to that later hi I'm Eric
Franklin and today I'll be taking a
first look at the Asus VG 2 3 aah the
Isuzu sports back tilt height adjustment
and swivel for connections it has two
HDMI ports DVI and VGA and thankfully
the ports it off to the side of the neck
and not directly behind it as they
normally do on some other asus monitors
they still face downward though and not
back like I would prefer overall build
quality feels ok but I'd be lying if I
said it didn't feel a bit plasticky and
even with this pretty wide foot stand it
still wobbles like a crazy weeble when
not from the sides the OSD array uses a
Seuss's typical OSD design where the
Menu button acts as the inter button
which is kind of annoying and takes some
getting used to but it does have useful
options like 6 different presets red
green and blue adjustments and of course
brightness and contrast with the IPS
panel you'll see wide viewing angles
from pretty much any direction when
you're using the theater preset movies
look pretty much how movies should with
full deep colors and deep blacks it's
hard to see dark gray details but that's
what the night view preset is for games
look fine nothing really special and I
wasn't offended by their performance
there is a bit more green tint that
would like but seriously I could throw a
pair of 3d glasses and easily hit
several monitors that have this problem
speaking of 3d the passive 3d
performance is bad
there's tons of ghosting the depth level
is low even when turned up to max and
since its passive games run at only half
the resolution that's not something too
noticeable on every monitor but here it
definitely is the Asus cost about $300
which is a great price for IPS and the
overall performance is good so I don't
have trouble recommending it based just
on that you also get some useful ergo
options and
the OSD navigation design is but the
options are useful look if you're
excited about 3d or if you've never
experienced it before don't make this
your first experience because you likely
won't be excited about it anymore check
out my full review for more info
once again I'm Eric Franklin and this
has been a first look at the Asus bg2
