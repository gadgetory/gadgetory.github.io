and designing products that are useful
is really the same thing for me the
beauty makes them useful and the
practicality makes them beautiful we
don't really separate the two we've
worked in in the home environment we've
worked in tech we work in wearables
obviously everything needs to be better
designed I believe in designing the
products and the experiences at the same
time there's a lot of tech products that
are over featured that I have a lot of
unnecessary things and so what we try to
first understand is what are what are
the key features that people are gonna
love what are the things that are gonna
help them every single day of their
lives so these products are used several
times a day to unlock my door to see who
is at my door to let somebody in by
they're giving them a PIN code or
sending them a digital key and so it's
really important that that these are
designed at the same time it needs to
look like a piece of hardware you know
we didn't want to have a display on it
that you know yet another display that
kind of flashes at you and tries to
communicate information for you so when
we have lights coming on on the product
to indicate functionality it comes
through the metal for wearables to
become you know something that everybody
wants to use and not just wants to use
when they exercise or you know for a
specific activity they need to be
thought as 24-hour wear I think as
wearables continue to evolve towards
being much more like jewelry and
accessories I think more people will
adopt them we have some projects right
now that are looking at robots and how
can robots not look like robots not look
like you man oh it's out of the movies
but rather beautiful objects that will
deliver a little function in fact you
know the August smart lock is a robot it
knows that I'm coming towards the door
and automatically unlocks the door
before
get there so it it has a brain and the
physical ability you know a little robot
that would open the door for me
every time someone says you know there's
not a lot of room for innovation in a
certain field like say like smartphones
they're more mostly like large you know
black rectangles these days every time
people say that I think there is a great
opportunity to do something different to
surprise people and August our goal is
to work on things that actually will
make a difference in people's lives will
allow them to go about their busy lives
and we know will make it easier to do so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
