I'm seen at Kara Tsuboi joined by Cena
senior reporter daniel Terdiman welcome
Daniel thank you big news in the social
media world twitter went public this
morning we sure did yeah yeah and this
stock is doing pretty well I've been at
what $45 $45 after being priced
yesterday at $26 so that's quite a pop I
know you're not necessarily a financial
analyst but do those numbers surprise
you does it is it surprising anyone that
it is so high right now well I bet it
surprises Twitter and that's why they
priced at 26 but I did see some reports
in the last few days that suggested you
know thirty-five forty dollars for the
shares so you know some people certainly
were aware that it was gonna come out at
that range a lot of people couldn't help
but compare Twitter's IPO to Facebook's
IPO year and a half ago and with
Facebook you know we saw them dip really
low to half its initial value before
climbing back up right what do you think
is different about Twitter why are they
seeing such success right out of the
gate what do they learn from facebook
well I think first of all they they they
studied Facebook's IPO and so you know
some of the problems one of the things I
think is that Facebook put out too many
shares so it kind of diluted by deluded
the value a little bit sure um plus I
think that there was just some
fundamental problems with Facebook they
hadn't figured out how to make money off
of mobile whereas Twitter really is a
pure mobile service and everybody knows
that they know that's where the eyeballs
are these days is our mobile and I just
suspect that you know they huddled with
their bankers and kind of like figured
out what the problems were they went
with the New York Stock Exchange instead
of Nasdaq so they really tried to do
things very differently than Facebook
Twitter might have figured out the
mobile but at the same time they never
turned a profit under 17 years of
existence right that's gotta change now
that your public right well they
certainly have to hope so um you know if
you look at their numbers their amount
of revenue has certainly been going up
and I think its young gonna be double
this year that it was last year so you
know the trend line is in the right
direction their costs are also going up
at the same time more high arms there's
no guarantee they're ever gonna make
money but you know I I believe in
Twitter i think that advertisers seem to
be you know signing up and believing in
Twitter and you know there's a lot of
room for them to grow the one problem is
that they've kind of saturated the
market in the United States and most of
their advertising revenue comes in the
United States so if they don't figure
out how to make money off of our
internationally that's where their big
problem could be how does this
advertising or all this growth how does
that look for the average user what are
we going to see different in our
accounts it's really hard to say I mean
you know you know you start to see those
like promoted tweets and everything show
up you know the big thing that Twitter's
been doing is it's sort of like the
amplified program which is partnering
with TV networks another you know like
ESPN and NFL people who create video
content and so they're figuring out how
to embed video content into tweets and I
think that's where we'll start to see
more advertising it'll be you know I
think the advertising is going to be you
know prominent you like you'll want to
watch NFL clip you'll have to go through
an ad first and so you know the age of a
tweet just being 140 characters and
nothing more I think that's long past
Wow now assuming Twitter closes today
you know in that steady mid forties
range what do you think this is really
going to mean for the landscape of
social media sites and their public
offerings in the future well it's good i
mean if you if you're a pinterest or you
know snapchat coming like that you've
got to be you know like chomping at the
bit right now also squares we know jack
dorsey's other company yeah you know
they there was a wall street journal
story yesterday that said squares
starting to think about a an IPO for
next year so yeah i mean the the market
looks like stock market has is doing
very well right now twitter having its
stock price do so well you know it's got
its kind of look good I know all of us
here at Cena are gonna keep a close eye
on this and people around the world to
Twitter followers especially absolutely
