the top tech news of the day plus
whatever crap we want to throw in I'm
Ben Fox Rubin and Samantha Reds first
tonight is the big night for the
republican national convention with
Donald Trump scheduled to make his big
acceptance speech the event so far has
dominated Twitter this week Sam Keating
tell us more about this yeah it's gone
crazy Nielsen's ocial said that there
was one point six million tweets sent by
nearly 500,000 people I was one of them
you were one of them okay that was on
Monday and then 1 million on Tuesday and
it's just blowing everything out of the
water like pretty little liars and wow
pretty pro wrestling smackdown yeah pro
wrestling Smackdown you would expect
there to be a lot of tweets on that so I
don't know what I'm interested in seeing
is and so I feel like the RNC there have
been a lot of gaps a lot of missteps so
there's been a lot to tweet about a lot
to comment on do you expect the DNC
which is going to be next week to be as
active I mean like if it's a little bit
more predictable maybe people aren't
going to be tweeting as much yeah I
think if someone hasn't plagiarized a
speech there might be more less tweets
um I don't know if the DNC is pretty
relaxed and I think they'll be less
right and everybody knows like Hilary is
gonna waltz in there there isn't gonna
be this whole Bernie Sanders thing so
maybe there's gonna be less snark and
less commenting so who knows on to the
next on to the next thing tinder is
rolling out group hangouts essentially
you get together with your group of
friends and then you find another group
of friends to throw into the mix Sam do
you think this makes sense if I could be
really weird I have I heard that it
actually was quite odd and everyone sort
of just sitting around and they don't
really know each other cuz I feel like
when you go into a room you like you
know go into little cliques and little
grapes and then trying to combine those
two it's you know it doesn't make a lot
of sense to me socially but at the same
time I guess I kind of understand why
Twitter sorry tinder would want to do
this in that maybe they're gonna expand
out from just being like a hookup or a
dating site so yeah I wanna like get to
know each other I think that's the move
it sort of like to find your best
friends yeah whatever it's kind of kind
of weird okay next also apple is
expected to make three
billion dollars i think is over the next
two years roughly on pokemon go yeah
that's a blast money right there yeah
that's pretty impressive and this is
because people any like this has become
such a phenomenon that people are
spending a lot of money on lucky eggs
and pokeballs and all sorts of stuff
like that Andy or something yeah I don't
know but you you'd admit it to me
yesterday that you haven't even been
playing any Pokemon go I can't never
played that is unbelievable that your RC
net in turn and have yet to spend any
time on Pokemon go that I would never do
any of my work I mean I'd have an
article and be like uh nope gotta go
find a zoo bet that is basically what we
end up doing so but well that's why even
in turn so do you do you think that
three billion dollar number is actually
legit or do you think this is like kind
of a flash-in-the-pan kind of thing and
I off what depends on how long people
are still gonna play this game I mean if
it crashes and burns then no but I mean
if people still seem to be pretty
excited yeah I would say so all right
with the last minute we have left we're
gonna get to our fourth story last
warning came out with its newest gorilla
glass which is used in just about every
major smartphone the improved glass can
be dropped from selfie height without
cracking at least most of the time so i
will tell you yeah i mean like nothing
is like shatterproof or crack proof but
so this is Gorilla Glass 5 I will admit
though that every single time I used to
write about Corning the commenters would
always say well the this this glass is
terrible because my phone cracked so I
mean no no glass is perfect but maybe
this all at least make people a little
bit happier or maybe your phone won't
break every time who knows I love the
idea that is from selfie height so
you're sitting there trying ticket I
made that right pic like down it goes
that is usually what ends up happening
so yeah um and look at that we are out
of time if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on cnet I'm
Ben Fox Rubin I'm Samantha road thanks
