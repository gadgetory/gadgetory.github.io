through Germany on my way to a small
town called puppet I'll just somewhere
between Cologne and Dusseldorf that's
about seven hour drive from London to
get here and I've done this in a rather
delicious Porsche 718 Cayman GTS which
is a sheer joy to drive particularly on
Germany's unrestricted Auto bars but
it's not this car van I'm here to tell
you about I'm actually on my way to see
something much bigger and it's this the
vogner mobile performance s quite
possibly the most luxurious motor home
on the entire planet
welcome to tackett's
from the outside it might not look like
much you'd be mistaken for thinking but
it's just a regular coach as it passes
you on the motorway you maybe even think
it's an upmarket tour bus for an indie
band on their way to play a venue that's
far too cool for me to be allowed in but
what you probably wouldn't expect is
that this understated vehicle is
actually a 5-star luxury hotel on wheels
inside you'll find a palace a luxury
lounge designed to give you the most
decadent experience on your road trip
you'll find real sheepskin carpets
throughout as well as it's gorgeous
marble effects going on back here and at
the top we've got real wood cabinets all
of which is completely customizable see
one of those people that fancies
throwing some horrible shades of hot
pink around the roof and then speaking
of customizable the same goes for the
sound system up here in the roof you can
put whatever you want through here to
turn this into a rolling disco there are
solar panels up on the roof of course
which should help keep the power flowing
to your fridge your microwave and your
dishwasher that's right this thing has
its own dishwasher and over here we'll
find a lovely storage space for your
finest crystal glassware and I'm told
that this has got suspension that
specifically optimized to make sure that
this doesn't rattle about when you're
driving now it's just an incredible
attention to detail but you might expect
that given this somewhat lofty price of
almost 1.7 million dollars if it's a
luxury property you're after then that
sort of money could buy you this rather
delightful four-bedroom open-plan house
in Hawaii or alternatively you could get
this six bed country Manor in Yorkshire
very beautiful part of the world
alternatively if it's a car you're after
then that money could get you over eight
Aston Martin DBS that's brand-new models
as well but none of those options
combine luxury living and travel unless
you can somehow get a house the size of
a cathedral on the back of a pickup
truck the performance s then is the way
to see the world and it has every
convenience you'd hope for
the smart heating throughout of course
and beautiful lighting up here in the
bedroom ceilings and speaking of the
bedroom it's a full size double bear
does actually comfortable
none of this camping bed with a rollaway
mattress nonsense this thing actually
demands a good night's sleep now I've
actually just come back from a two and a
half thousand mile road trip going
around some of the most beautiful parts
of Europe in a VW camper and while I did
love that little van there are
definitely many things I prefer about
this thing for one I can actually easily
stand up and walk about which is a rare
treat for someone who's six foot two in
fact the whole outside wall actually
mechanically extends outwards when you
park to make the living space bigger
there's a hot running shower too which
is infinitely more elegant than the one
in my actual London flat and over here a
proper toilets now I don't want this
video to become crude but anyone who's
ever done a long trip and had to endure
a terrible service station bathroom will
appreciate just how important having a
really good title is but even better are
the two 40 inch television your bedroom
in living room which means when you're
getting tired on your road trip you can
plug in your games console and wile away
the hours making poor link here climb
even more mountains but the best part of
this RV is that you don't need to be
bored on those long drives and now we
find out why I brought the Porsche
and you just thought it was for fun yep
that's right this RV has its own
hydraulic lift to keep a sports car
neatly tucked away when not in use
jaw-dropping an extra 70 grand on this
Porsche just to have a toy for the
twisty roads might seem like a bit of an
extravagance but when you're already
spending well over a million on the RV
itself what's an extra 70 grand so the
performance S is probably best thought
of then as more of a land yacht just
imagine one of those massive luxury
super yachts in the monte carlo bay
packed with comfy couches and chilled
champagne differences this thing's got
wheels and it's barreling down European
highways road trips are amazing holidays
that give you the freedom to go wherever
you want and whenever you want to go
there road-tripping in this thing
however means that you don't have to
leave your five-star luxury lifestyle
behind so what do you think to this
massive vehicle is 1.7 million dollars a
bit too rich for your blood do you make
