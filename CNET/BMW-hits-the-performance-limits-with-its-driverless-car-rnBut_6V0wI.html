now driverless cars are a huge topic
here at this show earlier this week BMW
showed me their version of a driverless
car on a racetrack let's go take a look
at that video now out on a racetrack
north of Las Vegas BMW put me in the
passenger seat of an m6 it's using to
test driverless car systems a BMW
staffer was in the driver's seat
although he wasn't doing much driving we
got on the track he put in an automatic
mode and the car started to go around
the track as fast as it could it took
the turns following a good racing line
to get maximum grip through the turns
and put on as much speed as it could we
went through a series of turns like that
then we came up to the slalom this was a
series of cones at the BMW had to
negotiate get beard through the cones
perfectly hit a chicane and then turn
through that really nicely and then
finally the most exciting bit of this
tour was the wet corner the adobe had
made one corner of the track wet and the
car went into that corner and
immediately went into a sideways drift
the car by itself was able to counteract
that gripped by cross turning the wheels
compensating for the turn until I got to
the dry where it could go straight once
again the interesting about this car is
it was actually using a GPS trail to
find its way around the track the
purpose of this research a vehicle was
so BMW can test its longitudinal and
latitude control systems these are
systems that actually determine how the
car handles the corners just like a
driver would and they make up essential
parts of a future autonomous car
especially one that could handle
high-performance driving
this is an exciting day out on the track
for me and it's prickly fascinating to
see how the car could handle all these
high-performance situations by itself
this is the future of autonomous cars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
