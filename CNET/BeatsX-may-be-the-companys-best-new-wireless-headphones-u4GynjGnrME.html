headphones ahead of the holiday buying
season but only this one the beats ex is
a truly new headphone and the first one
designed with the help of Apple's design
and engineering teams you probably won't
see it in stores until November but I
got an early listen and was pretty
impressed with both the fit and sound of
Beats first neck band style headphone
the band itself which beats calls a flex
forum cable has two wires running
through it that are made out of a nickel
titanium alloy which was developed by
the US Navy in the 1950s and is
apparently very malleable durable and
lightweight key to it here is that it
gives the band just enough rigidity that
allows you to roll up the headphone so
it fits in an included compact carrying
case you can't do that with an LG tone
headset the magnetized buds adhere to
each other when you're not using them
and they did fit my ears well they house
eight millimeter drivers and the beats X
sounds natural for a bluetooth headphone
with good detail and strong bass that
isn't overpowering like Apple's air pods
the X also incorporates Apple's new
custom low-power Bluetooth chip the W
one and delivers up to eight hours of
battery life which is decent on top of
that if you give the headphone a quick 5
minute charge via its lightning for yes
I said lightning not USB you get two
hours of usage beats calls this quick
charge feature fast fuel to get a more
secure fit if you're running or doing
something athletic you also get a couple
of sets of wingtips the X's sweat
resistant as an integrated microphone
and beats has redesigned the remote talk
button to make it more tactile and
responsive at $150 this headphone isn't
cheap but it is the least expensive
wireless headphone from beats and cost
less than Apple's air pause and sounds
better I'm David carnivore cnet.com and
those are the beats X earphones coming
this fall and definitely worth checking
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
