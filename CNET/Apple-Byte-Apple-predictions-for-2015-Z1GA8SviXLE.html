Biden with the new year there's always
something to be excited about with the
anticipation of apple releasing new
products and the hope of what we might
see in the future so this is my apple
byte 2015 predictions episode and
disclaimer this is for fun I could be
right and I could be wrong but we will
let time be the judge so first up the
hottest product in 2015 from Apple will
be not the Apple watch but the new Apple
TV say what yeah I'm going out on a limb
here now sure the Apple watches all the
sex appeal right now but how many people
are really going to buy it people are
still trying to convince themselves that
they actually need a SmartWatch just
because Apple is making one now now
here's why I say Apple TV there's
networks like HBO CBS and others like
ESPN and the NBA have already agreed
that they will offer their programming
as a streaming ala carte option in 2015
and we'll hear plenty of more networks
do the same and we already know Disney
and ABC will be on board with their
Apple connection rumors of an actual
standalone TV have slowed to a whisper
and if Apple can bring us a set-top box
with a game-changing interface and ala
carte TV network options that no one has
been able to deliver yet then that could
be your winner for 2015 and yes sure
they might still sell an actual TV set
but more likely a new Apple TV set-top
box that's more useful than a SmartWatch
and more affordable than 12 and that's
my bet which leads me to my next
prediction how many apple washes do you
think the big a will sell in the first
year now if we look at some historical
data with recent new product categories
the original iPad was a product people
originally said they didn't need at all
it started at 399 and sold roughly 15
million units for the first gen ipad in
year one so taking that into
consideration and the fact that two
million smart watches were sold for all
of 2013 I'm gonna go pretty conservative
and say that the apple watch will sell
eight million units in 2015 and
fitness bands as a whole will double the
Apple watch now the big a will still
sell the most smart watches out of any
of the big companies but they won't sell
as many watches as they did iPads for
the first generation and see that's the
best part about trying to tell the
future you don't have to write
hahahahaha did someone say future it's
me yes me is nastradamus your future
floating friend oh hey no she telling us
you know i miss you man where have you
been ha that's great I haven't missed
you at all in fact I just flew in
because I heard there was a cookie party
ok well the Apple biters you guys have
some questions in we wanted to give them
some answers well then make like a
doodoo and go first question ok so
here's the first one Sean Matthew asks
where the heck is the ipod touch I have
a 5th gen and I want to get a new one ah
yes the ipod touches in China China look
for it next year with 128 gigs of
storage and it will look exactly like
the ipod touch kitchen please challenge
me challenge me next question
Nostradamus campinas de los wearables no
real ojos intelligent a's realmente
Quentin el Ã©xito Andrew loss consume me
Doris Oh see next question so noster
Tongass should I trust Apple pay well
yes yes so far so good and you only have
one finger but you know what they say
everything is hackable even my father's
magazine stash hahaha nice where's your
so if you know everything who's gonna
win the NBA title you know I'm a Golden
State Warriors spent all that Stephan
curry is so nice but they need a backup
center and better shooting off the bench
for some scoring punch that's right not
only do I know
crystal balls I no basketballs oh oh hey
no sir thomas i notice a little
different are you wearing eye shadow
next question hey knows your Tongass are
you single are you on tinder are you gay
yes uh not yet and maybe next question
nostra Tongass what do you think Apple
need to do to be successful in 2015 so
why yes yes the answer is simple more
new products and less products that look
exactly like the ones from the year
before just like my gypsies ah that is
all
yes me one and only knows the Tongass
all right everybody thanks so much for
watching the apple byte and we'll be
back after CES 2015 and we'll see you
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
