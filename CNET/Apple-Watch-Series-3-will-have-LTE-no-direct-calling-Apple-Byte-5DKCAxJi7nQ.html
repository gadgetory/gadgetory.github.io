welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
it's another packed show with the Apple
watch and the iPhone but let's start
with the latest it's all about the Apple
TV now The Wall Street Journal reports
Apple has set a budget of roughly 1
billion dollars to produce original
content over the next year we've been
asking for something like this
forever and we've said it over and over
again content is king now 1 billion is
about half the amount HBO spent on
content last year and just happens to be
the home of the show you might have
heard called Game of Thrones Jack Harris
I've always wanted to say that now all
it takes is a couple legitimate hit
shows to get people's attention and it's
about time they dip into their two
hundred and sixty plus billion dollars
of casts are sitting on Apple becomes an
instant player because of its size but
they have a lot of catching up to do for
example Netflix they spent 6 billion
dollars on content in 2017 alone and
they're putting out so much good stuff
you can't even keep up anymore
but what were the hits that started it
for them all how about house of cards
and orange is the new black and come on
now Shonda Rhimes just left ABC for
Netflix that's how powerful they've
become plus those scandal scenes can get
really steamy
at least that's what I have been told
now we've seen the leaks about a
potential 4k Apple TV coming this year
as well so put this all together and
there's some nice momentum in the Apple
TV space Plus ESPN just launched a new
version of their Apple TV app that
allows you to watch up to four live
streams simultaneously perfect for
college football season now there will
be other modes like split-screen
picture-in-picture or three games at a
time ESPN is also considering using one
of the screen tiles for stats and
scoreboard updates in the future but
these are the types of apps we want to
see on Apple TV things that you can't do
anywhere else but it's taking a long
time to get there all right another
video services coming a native Vudu app
for the 410 Apple TV is expected to
arrive on August 22nd the video service
has more than 100 thousand titles to
rent and buy but the best part it
supports 4k streaming of many titles
with Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos audio
and this could line up perfectly again
for the rumored 4k Apple TV and if you
want to see a leaked that could be
totally true or totally false and this
is a real reach but a user on the
Chinese microblogging site Weibo
released pictures of what he described
as Apple's OLED TV spy photos it still
doesn't make sense for Apple to jump
into a low margin and crowded TV set
business but you know what I'll just
leave those right there and tons of
Apple watch news this week the economic
daily news reports the series three
Apple watch has entered the final
testing phase in the manufacturing
process with mass production starting
soon after that and everything lining up
for a September release a new report
from KGI securities Ming Chi Kuo claims
that the new Apple watch will bring LTE
support for the first time but it's
unlikely to support direct phone calls
now Kuo says it probably won't support
phone calls this year because Apple
wants to improve the user experience
with making calls before they roll it
out instead it could support voice over
IP services like FaceTime audio or Skype
now he also adds that the Apple watch is
likely to use an e SIM or what we call
an imbedded sim instead of a physical
slim slot due to the lack of physical
space in the Apple watch now rumors have
also pointed to the new LTE Apple watch
being supported by major carriers in the
US but that may not be the case with
international carriers on its launch
Kuo says the form factor and watch faces
will stay the same size at third
millimeters and 42 millimeters with LTE
really being the main selling point also
CNBC reports we can expect to see the
new Apple watch announced at Apple
September iPhone event no one else has
confirmed that and we don't even have a
date for Apple's event yet so we'll just
have to wait and see all right let's
jump to the iPhone 8 we saw the Apple TV
leaked earlier but if you're really into
low quality looking videos from inside a
factory another leak from Weibo
allegedly shows rear shells for the
iPhone 8 from a production line getting
polished with the little you know wax on
wax off and then another video where
they're hanging on racks now the one
thing to pull away from this if they are
true is that there's no sign of a touch
ID button on the rear shell I'm also
curious like what type of spy cameras
are we using these days is 2017 and I'm
not expecting iPhone quality but I know
we can do better than this can't we you
know what that is there's a bad apple
alright and look at this these images
claim to be the wireless charging pad
components for the iPhone 8 earlier
claimed said it would be sold separately
might even arrive late alongside in iOS
11.1 update after the iPhone launches so
with the next iPhone just around the
corner I thought it would be a good time
to see what does Apple by nation think
they'll end up calling the new iPhone
now here's the result from over 1,700
respondents on the Twitter and it was
really close between iPhone Pro and
iPhone 8 with the iPhone Pro getting 31%
of the votes and iPhone 8 getting 29%
now you know me I also gave people a
chance to send in their write-ins
Douglas Jones called it the iPhone
dollar-plus I'm down with that
Marco Don Juan wants it to be called the
I fate net what the heck is that and I
would tie here they should definitely
call it iPhone future and give me a cut
all right let's not forget about the
iPhone 7s or what's believed to be
called the 7s alleged design schematics
reveal that the 7s design will be
slightly bigger by less than a
millimeter for all dimensions of height
width and thickness now the speculation
is that it's related to the new iPhones
glass backing that's needed to support
wireless charging the lens bump is
believed to actually shrink a little
from eight point one eight millimeters
to seven point nine two as well now
there's been no leaks related to
measurements for the 7s plus up to the
point and iOS 11 received its sixth beta
released this week alongside watch OS TV
OS n you know Mac dos hi Sierra but the
biggest thing that stuck out to users in
iOS 11 Apple changed the App Store icon
for some reason and left it to the
Internet to compare it to popsicle
sticks or you know arts and crafts at
your local preschool this guy said hey
it's the same logo as my wife's company
now no matter what you do Apple guess
what sometimes you just can't win on the
interwebs
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
