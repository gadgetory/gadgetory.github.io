all hands and robots on deck at this
Amazon Fulfillment Center in Tracy
California there's tens of miles of
conveyance that's always running around
the clock ready to make sure we get the
product to the customer on time when you
place an order Kiva robots whiz around
with shelves of goods a picker grabs
your item then it gets sent down
conveyer belts to be packed and shipped
the process takes just minutes and this
year Amazon is cut delivery time from
days to hours in select cities and
through our new program Amazon Prime now
which is in 20 cities which can offer 1
hour 2 hour delivery on thousands of
items but what if one hour delivery
could be cut in half
Amazon thinks it's possible with drones
revealing a new prototype in a recent
video has the ability to leave a
building like this and deliver to
someone's backyard in 30 minutes the
drones can fly for 15 miles and
potentially deliver a number of smaller
goods well over over 80% of the of the
items in this building weigh 5 pounds or
less and can be delivered by drone the
company appears to address safety
concerns in a patent from the filing
drones could use lasers to detect
distances and objects in their path
Amazon won't say when to expect the
primary service the real hurdle on this
is the regulatory hurdle and we're
working very hard with organizations
both here in the US and globally to
bring those regulatory hurdles down so
that we can make this a reality whether
that happens in time for the next
holiday season is still up in the air in
