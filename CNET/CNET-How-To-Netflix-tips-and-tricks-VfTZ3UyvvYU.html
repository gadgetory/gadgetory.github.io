movies up friends recommend or we stick
to our favorite shows but there are much
better ways to browse Netflix and get
the most out of it and today I've got a
few tips for you the first one is
instant watcher calm now the website
looks like it was built overnight but
it's actually full of a lot of great
information so in the Left column you'll
see most popular titles from the last 24
hours and in the right column you'll see
new and noteworthy titles like Mission
Impossible all right at the bottom is a
really great feature it's notable titles
expiring soon so these guys are watch
worthy titles that will soon disappear
from Netflix so watch them before
they're gone so if you click on a
movie's title like Mission Impossible
you'll be taken to the movies page
you'll see a little synopsis but also
you can play the movie from this page
and it'll launch Netflix or if I don't
have time to watch it I can go back
click on cue and as long as I'm logged
into Netflix it'll be added to my queue
pretty neat okay this next tip does take
a couple steps to set up but once you're
there you are going to love it okay so
what you need to do is first install a
Firefox add-on called greasemonkey so
basically what greasemonkey lets you do
is hack your browser and this trick is
one of those hacks now if you want to
know more about greasemonkey
you can check out the full tutorial on
CNET how-to but for now I'll show you
how to install rotten flicks with
greasemonkey okay so i'll restart the
browser and the next thing I'll do is
just google Rotten flicks all right from
this page just click install and
greasemonkey will ask you if you want to
install it yes we do
so now when I go back to my Netflix page
and if I hover over a movie a little
Tomatoes shows up right there so I'll
click the tomato and check
get out there's the run Tomatoes scored
now you can click that score and you'll
be taken to the rotten tomato page
genius okay we talked about a couple
third-party ways to improve Netflix but
now let's talk about the built-in tools
that make it better you probably noticed
that whenever you log into Netflix on
your computer or your streaming device
it shows you recommendations sometimes
are good and sometimes they're not so
good so there are two ways to improve
these recommendations the first one is
to always rate the movies you watch so
for example I can go to my instant queue
and see my recently watched movies here
I'll just give it a rating like How I
Met Your Mother
four stars just do it it takes a couple
of seconds and it will make Netflix as
suggestions a lot more accurate
okay the second way to improve
recommendations is by filling out the
taste preferences survey I bet you
probably didn't notice it before but
it's right in this taste profile menu
and just click it right there okay it's
a very lengthy survey so you don't
necessarily have to fill out everything
you can also choose different categories
like story lines release date subgenres
it is a little time consuming to fill
out the survey but the more information
you give Netflix about yourself the
better these recommendations will be and
yes I do want to watch The King's Speech
so hopefully I've given you a few ideas
on how to make your Netflix experience a
lot more awesome but if you want more
tips check out my blog on how to
cnet.com and if you have any questions
or suggestions along the way hit me up

Vaknin I'm gonna watch some Netflix
