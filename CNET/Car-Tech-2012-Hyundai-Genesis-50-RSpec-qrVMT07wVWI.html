the BMW 5-series
and the Mercedes II 550 no pressure
there let's jump in the 2012 Hyundai
Genesis sedan 5 liter r-spec and check
the tech now from the outside there's
nothing terribly exciting about the
Genesis sedan nothing bad about it
either it's kind of like a more evolved
Camry and I don't mean that as a
backhand compliment it doesn't have a
lot of aero kit stuff bulging fender
wells staggered wheel sizes or any of
the typical cues of an AMG or an M car
but that's okay because it doesn't want
to play at that lofty level
now the first thing I say when I get
into the cabin of the Genesis is it's
quite simple it's kind of restrained
part of that is because they're
competing with some very elaborate cars
at a much lower price point and here's
your standard heading on all these five
liter r-spec cars that's an 8 inch color
LCD it's not touch it's all operated by
this controller here which is kind of in
the I drive Audi MMI family as you can
see the map resolution is really good
and even when i zoom well in i'm going
to get really nice tight dot resolution
very good fonts on the actual street
names themselves but most folks are is
going to enter an address you can do
that of course a couple of ways you can
go to this navigation menu right here or
you can use voice command right here on
the wheel let's see how well it works as
you can see I've got a tel stupid that
I'm in the navigation command mode even
though I hit the voice button while I
was in navigation that's a huge fail now
the other issue I've got with this guy
is this weird mishmash of back commands
back commands are critical in a car when
you want to go back in your crumb trail
to where you were
there's a back button here but it
doesn't always take you back so if I go
to the radio settings here for example
and I want to go to some settings and I
go over here and I play with my tone
controls and then I want to go back to
this menu on the left you would think
the back button would take me there but
it only gets me half way there then I've
got to go do something different to go
continuing back to this menu and that is
used a knob to go left so it's a weird
mix of back button and left kick on the
knob and you never really know which is
which another problem here very
complicated mess of buttons there's map
and guide on one button and this
navigation and menu on another button I
don't get it now in terms of driver
assistance tech this car is kind of low
tech high tech there's no blind spot
technology available for you but there
is a button over here for lane departure
warning it is an advanced technology but
it's a warning it's not the kind that
gets in the way and will actually get
you back in your lane so it's kind of a
middle the warning comes through beeps
in the car and I think it Yanks on the
seat belt kind of judders the belt as
opposed to some cars that will shake the
wheel others will shake the seat same
thing goes for parking there's no
automatic parking technology available
on this car you've got a nice rear-view
camera but it doesn't do anything
particularly novel it doesn't show
trajectory it just gives you some
distance
markings and sub curb lines but again
it's stuck as our bumper sensors around
the vehicle as you expect in this car
one choice only on the gearbox not a
manual transmission that's not where
this fits this 8-speed automatic is
pretty impressive that's a lot of gears
and again that's going to be very much
at the top of the stack with the number
of cogs you're going to get a
transmission these days and as we're
going to see on the road it works pretty
well
Hyundai's Day I'm proud of this motor
and it's a big boy you know that's come
in a long way from what Hyundai used to
stand for a few years ago it's a five
liter v8 it's gotten awards for being
just a really beautifully engineered
motor and the numbers are good 429
horsepower 376 foot-pounds of torque
notice the big drop off there in those
two numbers because this guy is a direct
injection motor but there are no
superchargers or turbochargers as I
mentioned direct injection is a big part
of how they get so much power out of it
but also how they get pretty good mpg
this 4,100 pound car goes to 16 little
over 5 seconds while still delivering
1726 epa rating now while this car
competes with some german brands that
offer a lot of optional or even standard
all-wheel drive doesn't happen here on
the genesis again part of the cost
containment strategy rear wheel drive
only and as you can see the engines
mounted traditionally longitudinally
with plenty of it in front of the axle
line right here
you know when you're a car like this
competing with some serious German and
established Asian competition you've got
to do the basics right first and I can
report the Genesis does that very high
refine ride quality even they've got a
sports suspension it biases more toward
comfort then towards sport that may
disappoint you if you're looking for
some kind of a bargain AMG ride but at
this price you couldn't get there
along those lines the suspension of
course doesn't communicate back that
much Road the steering doesn't either
it's going to be more of a comfortable
responsive car than an extremely
performance oriented car the engine even
under full load never gets to any weird
grinding notes that's another important
win they've got to do here because that
doesn't sound like performance usually
it generally just sounds like cheap when
an engine degrades into ugly noises now
this lane-departure technology the
switch over here only works at 43 miles
an hour and above according to Hyundai
that leaves out a lot of driving where
you don't get the assistance of it I do
find though that it's pretty well
calibrated in terms of when it picks up
the line and decides to alert you a lot
of cars don't do all that well but it
doesn't start till a relatively high
speed now speaking of getting up to
speed that's one thing this car does
really well in its cruiser fashion I'm
here on a twisty road in what is a big
car with a pretty good amount of pounds
on the hoof 4100 as I mentioned and it
has no problem getting up out of its own
way that's because it makes its power vs
pretty straightforward displacement and
precise injection as opposed to any
turbo chargers or blower in there which
tend to introduce a little bit of delay
in some this car goes after the luxury
brands at a lower price and nails the
basics in that alone it's quite
appealing but if you really want to go
high-tech II seen that style you're
gonna be finding some key stuff missing
okay pricing in Genesis five liter
r-spec is kind of a simple procedure
it's 47:4 delivered with the technology
you see and that's the technology you
get you can't take this thing any
further seen that style with options cuz
there ain't Dani now the picture as I've
shown you is one of kind of a middle
ground glass is half empty and half full
in terms of the kinds of tech and the
sophistication of but you have to like
this car as delivered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
