for this is a collection of edge I am
very confident that we have reached new
level of a North culture with the new
note 4 and the note edge but the next
evolution of s-pen is capable of so much
more it's the key to unlocking the full
potential of the note 4 and for the
moment you take it out you're taking the
first step and unleashing that potential
for yourself we've also added a very
powerful feature called smart select it
allows you to capture several pieces of
content in a row for example a series of
images from websites or different text
messages from your favorite blogs and
you can take all of those that you've
selected and save and share them with
your friends via email or a text message
I with Note 4 we're going beyond the
numbers and focusing on ease-of-use and
real quality photographs that's why
we've made note 4 with superb cameras
front and back Note 4 has a full a 16
megapixel back camera with smart smart
OAS that's optical image stabilisation
and 3.7 megapixel front facing camera
with an F 1.9 lens that's why when
you're using your either camera on the
note 4 your photos will always be clear
and bright today as you heard from DJ
we're introducing a special edition of
note 4 called the Galaxy Note edge
this edition is completely new using a
curved display innovation that we know
will make a difference to how you
interact and use your smartphone it all
starts with an extended screen along the
side of the device we call edge screen
and it's a fresh new vision for what a
display can be and the possibilities of
edge screen as you can see we are really
excited about because when the developer
community starts to add to this
experience for today though let me show
you where we're starting the main screen
and the edge screen our quad HD plus
Super AMOLED the edge creakin how's your
frequently used apps as a way to extend
your homescreen instead of having them
always along the bottom an edge screen
can also become a series of seven
scrollable panels that you can customize</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
