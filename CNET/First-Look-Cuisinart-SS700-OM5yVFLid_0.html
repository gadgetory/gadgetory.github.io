this is the Cuisinart SS 700 one of the
first things you notice about this
machine when you take it out of the box
is how heavy it is at almost 16 pounds
it's far heavier than any of the other
machines we tested and we like that it
inspires a lot of confidence in the
design and the construction as you can
see it looks really sturdy to brew a cup
of coffee you simply open the brew head
pop in your k-cup right there and close
it you'll hear a pop as the needles
puncture both the top and bottom of the
cake of the reservoir will pull water
into the internal heating tank where it
will take less than four minutes to heat
this machine brews a really nice tasting
cup of coffee we liked it it was a
little bit watery but not bitter it
reminded us a lot of diner coffee which
is definitely not a bad thing another
thing we really like about this machine
is that it's fully programmable and you
do this through the control panel screen
right here you can program water
temperature settings with a range of
five or six degrees you can also program
whether the machine will turn on
automatically in the morning or turn
itself off automatically after a
specific amount of time so if you're
really busy in the morning and you want
your machine hot and ready to use at a
particular time every single morning so
all you have to do is through your cup
of coffee in less than a minute and go
this is definitely a great option the
screen is forward facing which is nice a
lot of the other machines we looked at
have a screen that faces upwards so the
only time you can see it is when you're
standing directly over the machine to
use it you could actually use this
control panel screen as a clock anywhere
in your kitchen and it could be visible
this part is removable to make room for
a travel mug or for cleaning both of
these parts are completely dishwasher
safe this machine will brew coffee in
four six eight ten and twelve ounce
sizes its price point is one hundred and
ninety nine on the manufacturers website
although we found it on third-party
sites for as low as 100
one of the things we really liked about
this machine is that it came with its
own reusable filter this is great
because it enables you to use your own
brand of ground coffee that you may
prefer we should add however that the
Cuisinart was a little disappointing in
our taste tests when we use fresh ground
coffee we far preferred its performance
when it was making k-cups it's a great
great machine if you are looking to make
K cups and if you have a particular
brand that you would like to continue
using but as far as ground coffee is
concerned if you would like to use your
own we recommend the Bunn my cafe and
see you I'm Katy Pilkington with
cnet.com and this is the Cuisinart SS
700</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
