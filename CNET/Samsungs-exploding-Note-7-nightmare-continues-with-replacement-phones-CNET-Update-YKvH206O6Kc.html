back to using Samsung phones we got
ourselves another note seven Catching
Fire this time on an airplane but the
burning battery was actually one of the
supposed good replacement phones here's
how the nightmare situation went down
according to local news reports a
Southwest Airlines flight at Louisville
International Airport was getting ready
to take off when a passenger Bryan green
powered down his note seven and that's
when the phone began making a popping
noise and started smoking he took it out
of his pocket threw it on the ground and
then the note seven burned through the
carpet and smoke seeped into the cockpit
leading to the evacuation of the entire
flight I heard some popping that sounded
like a ziplock popping open ziplock bag
popping open and looked around to see
what that was and there was smoke just
billowing pouring out of my pocket at
least it was before takeoff the man
confirmed to the verge that he got the
replacement note 7:00 on September 21st
and he showed a photo of the box that
has a black square it indicates the
battery's supposed to be safe Samsung is
skeptical that it was a new note 7
saying that it is working with
authorities in southwest to recover the
phone and confirm what happened
the problem with Samsung's batteries is
not limited to the note 7 remember last
month a different Samsung phone a Galaxy
core caught fire in the hands of a
six-year-old boy in New York while he
was just playing a game on the phone but
Samsung has not issued a recall for any
other galaxy models Samsung recalled the
note 7 worldwide due to the faulty
lithium-ion batteries and the Federal
Aviation Administration issued an
advisory about not using the phone on
flights if you get on a plane with a
Samsung phone even if it's of our
policeman note 7 don't be surprised if
you get suspicious looks or are told to
shut it down because until we know why
this guy's phone caught fire how can you
know for sure that replacement phones
are safe that's it for this tech news
update I'm Bridget Carey you can stay on
top of the biggest stories and scene
