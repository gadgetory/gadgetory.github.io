speakers to its lineup including the
mini and the max first up is the $49
mini this has the Google assistant
built-in it has a touch panel so you can
do things like start and stop tracks you
can also use voice commands like you
would on the regular Google home comes
in three colors and it's pretty small it
fits very neatly in your hand there is
nor a 3.5 millimeter jack however but
let's move on to the max now this is
Google's big stereo 4 big listening so
you have stereo sound it's got a smart
sound system that adjust the audio to
where it's positioned in the room you
can also mount it vertically or
horizontally there's a touch panel on
the top to adjust volume and it has six
microphones two offers and two tweeters
in there it has USB C at 3.5 millimeter
jack and Bluetooth comes in two colors I
actually heard it play and it sounds
really impressive for a speaker that's
that size the base is pretty heavy
Google played us a couple of different
tracks the little acoustic number and I
could hear all of the vocals and the
guitar like really well separated you
can also pair to Max's together and hear
a really full stereo experience and also
get a multi-room capability as well it's
gonna be 399 dollars
and Google says that you can actually
turn up the microphones to listen to
your voice more clearly if there is
noise in the room like a fan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
