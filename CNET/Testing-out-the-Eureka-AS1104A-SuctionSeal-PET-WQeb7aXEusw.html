we're going to be looking at the Eureka
a s110 for a suction seal pet vacuum
this has an MSRP of 199 dollars although
Eureka's website is selling it on sale
right now for 169 making it an even
better value the first thing you'll
notice about this vacuum is its size
it's a formidable sized appliance and it
weighs 20 pounds meaning it's not a
lightweight vacuum so if you are worried
about carrying something up the stairs
there are lighter weight vacuums that
you should consider this kind of falls
towards the low end of the middle price
range that we were looking at with the
top being the DC 41 animal complete at
six hundred and forty nine dollars and
the bottom being a dirt devil which runs
just over a hundred dollars but one of
the things that I really love about this
vacuum besides its price and performance
both of which are excellent is how it
boasts some really unique features that
I haven't seen on other vacuums and also
how it offers two options for total
customization one of these features that
I like the best is this retractable cord
at the press of a button on the side of
the vacuum the cord winds itself up
inside the vacuum so there's no cords to
trip over or to worry about wrapping
every single time you vacuum which I
view as a huge convenience factor
another feature that we really like is
this dial on the front that allows you
to totally customize what type of
flooring you are vacuuming whether it's
a bare floor a low pile carpet or a high
pile carpet and there are ranges in
between so that you can customize your
vacuuming performance so that it will do
the best on whatever kind of flooring
you have in your home but perhaps my
favorite thing about this vacuum is just
how easy it is to use I think as far as
the user interface goes this Yuriko was
my favorite in that all of your controls
are at the touch of your left foot
turning the brush roll on and off
reclining the vacuum and powering it on
and off they're all right next to each
other and easily accessed and used
there's also a handy dial on the side
that lets you customize whether you want
the vacuum to do floors or whether you
plan to use the extendable hose and wand
for tools so if you're looking for a
budget-friendly vacuum that you can
really customize to meet your basic
needs
or more specific needs this Eureka is an
excellent option and the sale price
can't be beat foreseen at I'm Katie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
