it's the first hardware product from
Facebook it aims to take messenger video
chats and make them feel more like
conversations to call someone with
portal I simply say hey portal called
Dave or whatever the name isn't the
person you're calling someone the
interesting features right up front is
no matter where I am in my room it has a
thing called 2d posts and what it does
is it reframe to pitch here so right now
it's frame nice and focused on my head
to shoulders but if I move over here it
will be my whole body you can see the
whole room so if I'm doing something
like cooking or maybe I'm playing with
toys or playing a Mike dog or cat you
could see that happen and I'm all the
way back here and the camera just knows
where to frame me and Here I am again
and his friend Mimi pretty cool and when
there are multiple people in the frame
you can prompt portal to focus in on a
specific person with a feature called
spotlight the portal comes in two
different models a 10-inch version and a
15 inch one called the portal plus and
they look a bit different on the outside
the portal plus has a larger speaker and
can rotate its screen 90 degrees between
portrait and landscape now on the inside
they are identical running the same
processors and software keen on privacy
Facebook design portal to encrypt data
locally on the device this is admirable
but the question remains will people
trust portal security after the
controversy of the Cambridge analytical
scandal other ways portal protects your
privacy are with a physical mute button
on the top and with a camera cap to
cover up your lens when you're not
counting but some of the real fun parts
of portal are additions that you can add
during the video conversation there are
snap chat like effects that turn you
into a rabbit wrap show marks or that
put a cat on your head you can also
share music you're listening to on
Spotify and Pandora the song is
synchronized for both you and the person
you're chatting with and one of the
coolest features is aimed at families
and it's called story time it has five
interactive story books that you can
read Facebook is working with publishers
to add even more mr. wolf was looking
for our little piggies Oh
oh here he comes oh I'm mr. wolf I smell
someone new in my neighborhood I want to
get those piggies on top of all this
when you're not making calls portal can
display Facebook photo albums that you
choose and parts of your newsfeed and
there's also Amazon Alexa built right in
all right this is the portal plus at
3:49 there's also the portal that's
$1.99 you can bundle them together and
save $100 you can pre-order starting
October 8th on Facebook Amazon or Best
Buy and these will start shipping at
early November that's the portal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
