should I get I use a couple of key
questions to narrow down what they're
looking for and help them pick the right
laptop for them now the first question I
asked somebody is how many days per week
do you feel like you're gonna be
carrying this laptop around with you if
you say I'm taking my laptop with me
five days a week to work and back on a
commute well then you want something
very thin very small you take your
laptop around with you maybe to work or
to the coffee shop two or three days a
week maybe just occasionally well then
you can get a regular mainstream 13-inch
laptop maybe even a 14-inch one now if
your laptop stays at home all the time
or at the office all the time maybe you
just take it home once a week or very
occasionally then you can get a bigger
screen more mid-sized laptop 15 inch
sometimes 14 inch model these are bigger
they're heavier there's some times more
powerful they can have higher resolution
screens they could have more component
options they usually have more ports
that makes it more useful but also a lot
harder to carry around the second
question I ask people is how much do you
want to spend on your laptop now if you
want to spend $1,000 $1,200 for a ton of
fantastic choices no problem there and
if you want to spend less $800 even $500
even less we can point you in the right
direction
maybe towards something like a
Chromebook which is usually less
expensive and less capable than a
full-featured Windows laptop but still
very useful for a lot of people now of
course usually if you spend a lot more
on a laptop it's probably going to be
good for a few more years because you've
gotten more powerful components you have
an actual body of the laptop that's
probably made of metal instead of
plastic it's going to stand up to abuse
better so you get more years out of it
before you feel like you have to replace
it
the third question I usually ask is is
there anything really special you needed
to do if you're using it in a in a
business environment you want to make
sure that maybe it has the biometric
security that you want like a
fingerprint reader or a facial
recognition camera one of the most
exciting areas and laptops right now is
in gaming laptops we're finally at the
point where you can get pretty much
the same powers you would from the very
high-end expensive gaming desktop and
something that's much smaller much more
compact a gaming laptop that's because
the new mobile versions of GPU chips
from nvidia and AMD are just as good on
the laptop version as they are on the
desktop version
another thing to watch out for is modern
laptops sometimes don't have all the
ports that maybe classic laptops had
today some laptops only come with one
port or two ports and usually those are
USB type-c ports which is a very useful
type of port to have but you need to
have equipment that's compatible with it
or have all the adapters and dongles
that you'll need to connect your legacy
stuff to this new tiny USB C port you
know it drives people the most nuts
about their laptops and they're not
wrong it's battery life everyone always
feels like their laptop should last all
day and it very rarely does we're
getting a lot better with battery life
now and I can definitely say over the
last several years battery life and
laptops has expanded we have laptops now
that have 10 hours 11 hours 12 hours of
battery life don't discount battery life
when you're shopping for a laptop and
most importantly don't believe what it
says on the box when it comes to battery
life because those tests are not quite
as rigorous as the testing we do over
here at scene at listen to our battery
life numbers will give you a much better
picture of what you can expect from your
laptop
