we're looking at the iris home
management system from Lowe's now this
is a system you can get in a variety of
kits the two options across 179 are the
safe and secure kit and the care and
comfort kit safe and secure we'll give
you the keypad the motion sensor and the
two contact sensors for doors and
windows along with the hub that controls
at all if you go up the care and control
route you'll get the thermostat and this
plug and play module your third option
is the smart kit which costs $2.99
that'll give you everything you see here
Plus this range extender to help make
your system a little more robust as home
automation networks go iris does shine
for its wide compatibility with a
variety of z-wave sensors and devices
you can use smoke detectors and leak
sensors you can use a whole multitude of
sensors to monitor your home and the
iris app and website will cover at all
that's pretty comprehensive we like that
quite a bit however some of the
components that come with the system
didn't work quite as well as we'd like
they work reliably and they do what
they're supposed to but take this keypad
for instance for one it's not that loud
if the alarm goes off it's not a hugely
significant alarm I don't think it would
be as frightening or as alarming to an
intruder as you'd like it to be also
it's a little bit laggy the buttons when
you press them don't always respond as
quickly as you'd like when the alarm is
going off I put my code in and hit off
and it would take a couple of tries to
go through and disarm the system that
would be a little annoying if I had to
do that every time I came in from work
at the end of the day so I'm not sure I
like this keypad that much I also don't
like that it doesn't have an inherent
cellular backup you can get that as an
add-on that will tack on an additional
five to ten dollars a month in your
monthly fees as far as fees go you'll
have to pay $10 a month to access the
full features of the system and that
includes automating things and
scheduling things and doing all the
stuff you probably want to do with it if
you decide you don't want to pay that
$10 a month you can still use this
system but it's in a very limited
capacity I think you're probably going
to want to be ready to pay that $10 a
month
iris gives you two free months of access
to the complete slated features so you
can decide for yourself if it's worth it
I think you probably will so if you're
hoping for a fee free option this
probably isn't the one for you all in
all I like the potential of this system
for home automation a little less for
home security I think that it's got a
great amount of compatibility with
z-wave devices you can add locks lights
and
you can think of over Zi will probably
work with it so that's great however
like I said it's not perfect I don't
really like that you have to pay $10 a
month for everything when there are fee
free options like smart things that do a
great job so I would shop around before
committing but give it consideration for
