is announced we start hearing familiar
feedback from long-term fans sounds
great but you've got to have a Mario
game and frequently those requests are
framed like this I want it to be just
like Mario's always been but I want it
to be better well that may seem
contradictory but me verse will help
meet those dual desires in New Super
Mario Brothers you not only will you be
able to see what others are saying when
the meze gather around the Wii U Main
Street well you'll also be able to
connect right within the game friends
family or any other player might be
talking about the overall game
experience about specific levels about
hidden areas or difficult jumps and you
could probably expect that one of your
buddies will be bragging about his high
score that's probably going to be me or
their record time it's a new real-time
social window that opens up right as
you're playing we'll be talking more
about these miiverse features tonight in
our developers roundtable but for now
let's take a look at the game itself
here's new Super Mario Brothers you
as you may already know this Mario game
can't be transferred to the from the big
screen to play personally on your
gamepad but you may also notice
something else what we're calling boost
mode with up to four people using their
Wii remotes to race through the course
one more with the gamepad and use the
touch screen to helpfully place blocks
along the way or you and a friend can
work together to set a new standard for
a speedrun currently the benefits of Wii
U will be evident with Nintendo
published titles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
