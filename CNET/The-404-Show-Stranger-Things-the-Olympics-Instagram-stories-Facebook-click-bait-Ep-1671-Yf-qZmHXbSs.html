was it yeah we spoke with jeff Nimoy oh
he you were here for that yeah I brought
him in when he came in from LA he talked
about his dating website where people
were matched by what they ate okay all
right it's like the paleo match yeah
he's obsessed with the teleod was like
the first do to really do the whole
Paley right he started that she started

uh ladies and gentlemen if you recall
Zack Weinberg whose is just a staple for
a very long time well if you work in now
if you are one of those loyal hardened
veteran 40 for listeners you'll remember
Zack as the voice behind tuna Tuesday ah
this is dope this is like canon yeah
that's all stuff this goes way back
around the time that you started coming
on the show Wow yeah back in the day
it's great to have you back man right
back thank you for having me it's oakley
sure I'm glad we've been talking about
this for a while you and I are close
personal friends I'm glad we were able
to swing this together and their studio
looks it's a much nicer upgrade than
where we were less it looks even nicer
than it was two weeks ago did something
changed that they painted they paint you
didn't that's weird all right you're
colorblind well I knew that something
was different I didn't know if it was
the panels or what but can I say one
thing about so just one thing may I
these sound boards are tweaking me out
there so not even oh oh you think they
need to be you think somebody just came
in was just like okay let's just scotch
tape the spot yeah his name's Brian and
he has only one I that's really
offensive Gavin okay so you've already
managed to offend off the office time
Zack used to work here back in the day
and now he's doing something else that I
work in finance you working fine
hold out he sold out finally yeah fine
so what's the next big short let us know
don't tell anyone on the air but let us
know secretly off air so we can sort of
put our money in the right place plastic
okay you think plastics I think she'll
be so in the 60s during the Graduate
plastics were big and then it's making a
comeback everything gonna be plastic
knew it the worst possible things for
the environment are coming back I knew
it you think so yeah you think see there
was that whole wave of like oh we got to
protect your even one nod and now it's
kind of just like everybody's like you
know what screw this we're gonna destroy
this place as fast as possible yeah go
out on top yeah let's go out with let's
go out riding the missile down some men
just want to watch the world burn hey
telling you that's Russa's favorite line
at age 30 all right so plastic plastic
watching world those those um those
plastic things that hold 6 aluminum gas
those are making a huge comeback but
they actually want you now to throw them
in the ocean right out cutting them now
remember you know after school you gotta
cut it so the fish don't get stuck think
about how screwed up that the lesson
that is for like a young kid so I
remember when that doctor today
yeah it stuck with me too but it also
stuck with me like we put all our trash
in the ocean I mean like that's in order
to do that's what we do we don't we
don't do anything productive with it
there are literally dumped it in the
ocean so don't make it a necklace for a
turtle I think they're biodegradable now
or at least they're saying that they're
very great yeah you can eat them you can
actually eat them all now we're gonna
make them on bio dude here we're going
back we're gonna use oil to make them
some against that yes um so we got a lot
to talk about this week I shook did you
guys know the Olympic starts tonight I
knew that they were coming up I knew it
was like at some point next week but I
was not aware i guess at the opening
ceremony tonight yeah I didn't even I
just like you know obviously you can't
escape the coverage uh for from you know
Rio where it's like this is the worst
idea we've the IOC's ever had like well
the Russia covered the pre Russia
coverage was pretty bad coping well not
no no I mean all in Sochi yeah and Sochi
everyone was like uh the hotels don't
have electricity and running water but
it was no it nothing like this Rio pre
coverage of like horrible things
happening some I guess he was like some
guy
I in Rio who lives in Rio now but is
like a former jujitsu expert yeah almost
got robbed by two guys in motorcycles
they like bashed in his windshield with
like the back of a gun he grabbed the
gun in a jujitsu move and shot both of
them Dylan yes oh my god that was an
event oh right yeah yeah that's the new
biathlon it's very tough only the best
of the best Wow good at them thats dark
crazy we wasn't not a safe place these
days and I'm sure there are safe areas
but it's been like this for a while they
said there's a main highway where
literally there's a gang members hanging
on bridges or outside the perimeters of
the how and just shooting well I just
like duck hunt no it's like a couple of
months ago I was reading about this and
it's so absurd the security is that the
u.s. men's olympic basketball team
actually chartered their own private
yacht which good for them sure they have
the money for yeah and there they have
all the security that they need they've
got gambling TVs private chefs so as
long as they're like apparently that's
all anybody cares Mazzy eulogist on a
yacht in the middle of the shot oh my
god like outside the outside the actual
city it's like okay now it's time to
play bass clip or and they'll just no
transport they'll just somehow transport
them to the arena they'll play we'll get
back on the yacht in here they're
staying somewhere else so uh I didn't
know it was starting I thought that was
kind of hilarious right yeah oh my god
this actually going like there's a
there's no metal event tomorrow Wow um
so all the Rio thing although all that
awfulness that's going on in the
background is sort of peppered with
these other weird stories that are
coming out of Rio that aren't about the
awfulness and and and and the sewage and
the dire conditions that athletes are
having to endure and the Zika you forgot
about all right as if we could pile any
more on top of this diarrhea salad
yeah ooh that's a nice visual uh yes
Zika right this terrible when I born
there I like that was the first place I
started hearing I think they've thrown
the word epicenter around okay that's
right I don't know if it's ground zero
but I got imagine the poopy water is not
helping out like or does help as it were
at the Zika to
rolla for Pope yeah the spread and
apparently they like something i read
something about like there's a surge of
like condom use amongst the athletes
because they're all freaking out that's
probably good I feel like that should be
so they weren't using condoms for was
all just seeking or free-for-alls like
the sixties and now they're like hey
maybe we should yeah rap is olympic
village known to be access like orange
again yeah young people yet there think
about its able reading 10 to 23 year old
navy training for the past couple years
yeah let up yeah but you're not supposed
to have sex right before you know her
fevers are very high happy go down boys
you're right it actually will uh it'll
it'll sort of handicap but i did hear
some one of the australian team showed
up at olympic village like a few days
ago and the coach was like uh nope and
just like left and they're staying in
like a private hotel situation cuz it's
a nice village is just like a hostel
yeah it's it's no good which athletes
are pulling the most hell volleyball
players I've gotta say they're probably
doing pretty good I think I feel like
weightless lifters probably too much for
a lot of people and a lot of them are
what you would think they're like big
yeah yeah yeahs swimmers the swimmers
probably part oh yes swimmers big time
auto dope smoking with this commercial
just Michael Phelps I guarantee she will
feel like all of them are getting stoned
what like what I feel like that's not
all and X Games people right is there
like skateboarding no skateboarding is a
true yes keep nose keep warning is a
would be a summer thing skateboarding
Ross is not in the Olympics it should be
if snowboarding is in winter
skateboarding seen some extreme sport
yeah they need to go back to I I'm not
gonna watch the Olympics I'm gonna watch
them by accident what would make the
Olympics fun is we should go back to you
when Olympics first started I would
watch five Americans yeah fight five
Germans in a pit like they like tea mmmm
a team us that the occasionally no I
don't know I'm just making it up I was a
guy ran like 23 miles oh no that was a
marathon you know I want to see
tug-of-war sure feats of strength I
don't know maybe that's just me me go
back to athens and
is now all we have is like the girl
dancing with a ribbon and that's one of
the web wait is that summer yes that's
it astex yeah is that also when that's
no that's summer yeah so why is that
summer wait it's indoors I think it's
pretty obvious why certain things are
summer my otherwise gymnastics summer
yeah but why should that be a winter it
should be neither should spring Olympics
you should have spring alone if you have
enough Olympics all right I'm feeling
that that that's fine where they guess I
guess so anyway uh sorry came out the
other day a Japanese athlete racked up a
five thousand dollar bill yeah from the
data spent playing pokemon go yeah that
sounds about right sounds all right I
guess Brazil roaming charges Brazilian
roaming charges kind of cost I think you
use like 50 megs a day or something if
you're playing pokemon go right you play
this game I do come on dude does um I'm
just asking I don't I don't I don't know
I'm still playing it my wife and I
people hated now walked out and the
hardcore players hate it because they
remove tracking what's that mean
basically you could like oh there's a
Jigglypuff nearby you can you know and
there's like a marker showing how far it
is from you and you like track it down
gotcha but but they remove that so the
park or probably monetizing this so you
can buy pokeballs to capture Pokemon you
could buy inventory increases you can
buy incense to like attract more Pokemon
this is a sense yeah it does this have
legs to last years were this is gonna be
an off a financial guy now wants to know
whether he should be investing who's
developing this Nintendo ya know what I
antic their stock went up that Janet
went fashion right cuz people realize
Odin head only owns thirty-three percent
of Pokemon the Pokemon cutaway show what
see I mean it does it shel likes to last
a while right you so I don't like every
other well here's the interesting for
Nintendo in particular I think the
interesting thing is for the first time
ever they've tapped into this market
that they never were able to touch which
is the mobile space good so this big
company is finally making money here but
it's even gave him like no but they're
making tendo's making money I'm sure
they're making money indirect you're
right so the but the big takeaway is
okay so if if like ten percent of people
that we're playing it at the peak are
still playing it let's say a month from
now yeah
that's a good sign because it means that
Nintendo which has several other
properties that they wholly-owned coming
to mobile soon has a chance to keep this
ball rolling where it's like oh this is
a new source of income where their
console sales are sort of died out
that's what I want to ask you does this
show that all the old nintendo and sega
games yeah maybe i'm behind the curve a
little bit but that's why I've know as
you can i mean yeah yeah the UM to just
play on the iphone lay the blades of
steel in the Mario is ever or is that
just rumors that are gonna keep circular
that'll happen the funny thing is those
games I don't think would necessarily
push crazy sales it's more games there's
simply dying designed for the mobile
experience because playing like blades
of steel or Mary or whatever with like a
virtual touchpad is not summer fun even
for guys that are 30 to 40 that are
commuting or knows I mean that grew up
with those games that they've definitely
contemplated doing it's like that
problem with those games is you buy it
once and that's it and that's it but
with a mobile design game Michael
Pokemon go they're getting tons of money
because people were constantly buying me
and has more content they can just keep
adding I don't arch ink ports of the old
school 8-bit games is like the future
mobile isn't that coming out in December
the Super NES yeah that that's not okay
you won't get into your TV right you
think that also well we're gonna do
really i will do roll so that just goes
right into the TV yeah and I could play
80 games that are pre-loaded onto 30
games that are pre-loaded onto it comes
with two controllers one controller by
another 60 bucks seventy sixty dollars
for the thing another to battle I think
that'll do really well I think that'll
be a big one you do that to Sega has
already actually done that yes that
array of that just didn't realize it
because I was only like five games at
sega really sonic sucks and you know
like say you were a sonic kicker we grew
up across the street you love say I do
toejam and earl that was the best I'm a
huge I I was a big Sonic 1 through
knuckle that yeah they're good games but
i think this big time rose rose colored
glasses regarding like all those eyes
like a flame and also something really
good games but i think empirically
speaking mario for me is a better game
yeah like Mary brothers 3 is a better
game in any of the songs no Zelda for
Genesis right there was nothing
amazing adventure canidius sonic yeah
sonic was their flagship french i was
their big one and they had some other
ones they had some other ones yeah but
it never got to like you know Mario was
like you like pick up turtles yeah and
do stuff yeah side you just go left or
right real quick yeah maybe but he was
badass why cuz he go so fast you like
what was it what was it I don't know
she's need for speed that nineties like
hey this is what's cool it's like a
badass blue creature I think sonic was
so popular but just because of the speed
I thought I think like yeah I thought oh
there seems to be like more powerful
graphics happening here well I mean
Genesis look the hell a lot better than
original intended totally but not you
know but not with an s an essay right
exactly anyway cycling back has unit did
then olympics i get to japan yeah this
got this poor japanese athlete 500 bill
that was funny and then the ioc which is
the international olympic committee has
told all the press which by the way is
the biggest press draw like more press
travel to the IOC think the only thing
to the Olympics yeah to the app the
Olympics the only I think second place
is like the RNC and the DNC to press
everything ends in SC it's using
invention okay so so CBS comes to you
give on hold on okay fine we'll get back
to what this story yeah yeah CBS comes
to me as I do every more they knock on
your door with less locks on your doors
likes role play a little bit here hello
Jeff oh that's not les Moonves is voice
but fellow uh Oh mr. move as you look
dashing how can I help you yes Jeffrey
we need someone to cover the Rio
Olympics what okay uh really you don't
have like old know everyone decided to
drop out of the last minute for unknown
reasons then we need you to go we've got
a first-class ticket right here you will
be staying in the Olympic Village sounds
German and why is he sound like this mr.
movies are you give a cold I'm trying to
be multicultural in the spirit of the
Olympics Jeffrey will you join us um I
will not be going but you will mr.
Moonves with all due respect I just
don't think it's it's a good idea for me
to go you know like how you know Zeke
has got a scary thing
in right you know I'm not saying we're
trying to get pregnant right away again
but like maybe in a couple years and I
think the jury's still out on whether
that's like a safe thing to do and I
respect the I'm gonna decline i hope
that doesn't your fire you would not go
I would not I would not go either would
you go full ride to be honest no no
you're just kind of said why is it said
I I'm saying going to you limping should
be something everybody's like oh wow
that's a bucket list thing I want to go
that me acorde experiment in a
demilitarized I'm saying in this case it
said that you would have to say no to it
because it's it is war zone it is that
when I was in London send me to London
go doing the heartbeat i do really
wonder like I think I go to Sochi don't
go to Sochi before we how much of this
do you think is trumped up the danger
not sure how much is Donald Trump tup
yes how much either how dangerously it's
like legit while website like you're
walking at the dead wood and more like
thank you been confirmed okay that's an
issue and we know that so the waters
been confirmed as well I in eight people
so so interesting fact about the water
that all will talk about Sanjay Gupta
did a really interesting sort of piece
honorees like yeah the waters super
toxic and effed up but no one's getting
sick really yeah he said we're just all
sick to me the local market is it the
locals how thick I don't know if that
seems like Yoda jet you could be a in
the way that like you know if you travel
to Mexico you're not supposed to drink
the water in Mexico but it's not like
everyone in Mexico is getting sickness
from the wall someone's drinking that
not having a problem right I don't know
maybe it's the Mick Jagger effect were
like you do enough drugs it just starts
to agree with you yeah um so there was
that and then what we owe and then the
violent joseph s so for me I feel like
Zika alone yeah regardless of the
turmoil that seems to be going on here
in Rio so as eco is in line you wouldn't
go probably not yeah you know like a
scare for anybody that's a 30 to 40 s is
a weirdly up to because like it doesn't
seem that bad on its face yeah because
when you get it you kind of just have
heads you're not gonna die from it but
look like the weird and again like
there's also like strange nervous system
things they were talking about I don't
we don't know what the hell's going on
with this thing just sex offspring it
affects your kids
to find out about five years from now
yet it's not so you know it kinda thing
I don't want to mess around with ya arm
so yeah and others like places in in in
Miami that it a new york all to new york
city they've mosquitoes carrying it yeah
they did yes yes you don't know our know
in the city there's cases of it in New
York City losing my right now but that
doesn't mean it's here that means
somebody could have trail you're right
it's not here in Manhattan it's it's
more Hoboken area it's more right on my
corner you don't think good news is what
is the good news Zack we don't have to
worry about that case we can just watch
it on her big-screen TVs and our
air-conditioned apartments true you know
I was just outside though i'ma little
scary I just think this whole Olympics
is gonna feel a little bit kind of what
we were talking about a week or we don't
want to see anything bad to have now
obviously but after all of this build-up
if it were to go as plan and everything
would be hunky-dory can't be like what
seemed like you know they're lining up
to jump into the pool and is that a
sewage spill and the next thing you know
the water is just completely brown
international TV it's just like that I'm
okay with its like the Olympic I'm Andy
barge just claps his hands like a
blackjack dealer yeah like no right
right here they lose that everyone bails
yeah Adam okay right I feel like the
next potential real disaster is FIFA in
where the guitar yes FIFA situation
sounds very similar maybe not with the
crime aspect but like the abject poverty
poverty and heat and dangerousness and I
just feel like this needs that at one
point go really bad just so for the
future everyone's like oh we're not
gonna do that again can we have a
designated the world is big enough yeah
I know it doesn't matter plays alright
so pick a spot rescue Rena the island of
South Africa South Africa okay yeah why
saw ever I feel like you can get every
climate and condition you need there no
not snow is aware to love you for the
summer yeah all right no but even if you
picked one universal location probably
in Italy you'd want somewhere that's
like very know Italy gets too hot what
about American would also do this a
jersey what about new to Jersey you know
they originally wanted to put Israel
somewhere in like a part of New Jersey
like that was one of the places they
considered for
they were talking right in the 40s so
why don't you just just pick that same
spot for the Olympics ever yeah that'd
be so rad because I mean Jersey gets in
the winter it's cold as hell the summer
windows windy yes is always in the same
place every year three is in the same
place just have the Olympics okay NJ I
owe so much in deeper everyone can like
plan ahead chris Christie would love
this we got enough people in New Jersey
we don't know we don't need half there's
a lot of farm with the Pine Barrens are
like empty just knock them down just
money was there so uh and then this is
another crazy story about the Olympics
coming from our good buddy Chris plan so
apparently the IOC has sent out a
message to all the press covering the
Olympics they are prohibiting the
transformation of video footage from the
Olympics to be turned into gift good
luck how are you gonna stop that anyone
force that you can't call youtube and be
like hey take this down like who's
hosting that gift by saying that aren't
they kind of just putting themselves up
to just get crap you do want gifts when
are you gonna get an even lower not only
that like a lot of sports so so if
you're CES and you're carrying a sports
event obviously can run footage from
that if your ESPN same thing but if your
SB Nation which is a Vox publication
like we're you know SB Nation's not
allowed to run video footage and cap it
right so for a lot you know if you're
editorializing something all a big
solution that people come up with is
using gifts right so without that I mean
what are you gonna do you don't have any
visual that's right exactly the crying
Jorge's yeah whatever you guys familiar
with that yeah it's this yeah yeah I
don't know if you techy dudes yeah a lot
of video you don't follow sports it's on
the Internet okay if it's on the
internet on the internet guys know about
the language from the broadcast
standards and practices that the IOC
sent out says it says additionally the
use of Olympic material transformed into
graphic animated formats such as
animated gifts etc is is expressly
prohibited looking at one person one
unlucky dude or woman he's gonna lose
their job to give you the first one so
just to set an example yeah just to try
to scare
crap everybody they are massively
litigious like they will definitely pull
that they'll find somebody get out
yeah they have will find the network
that they work for it'll be yeah I mean
I'm not remember what were they so
worried about what issues I think it's
the license I think like it is such a
tight stranglehold on licensing that
material pictures are okay yep yeah well
and they also a big optical question to
that if that thing said vines I was
awarded yet what if I'm in the audience
watching i snapchat a story you're gonna
get arrested I don't know yeah you're
probably going into the Brazil's all
probable probably just yeah shoot
extradite you God all right we're going
to take a break when we come back russ
has a crazy story I want to talk about
Facebook a little bit and a series on
netflix that has pretty much taken over
our collective lives all this when we
return the 44 show is supported by citi
cards with android pay how cool is it
that we live in a world where you can
use the same device to listen to our
fine program and buy your morning coffee
groceries and more and did i mention
it's a super fast way to pay just use
your citi card with android pay at the
register get in get it get going
download the android pay app on google
play or visit citi com / android pay to
get started android pay is available for
eligible CD consumer credit and debit
cards
ingeus
so that sounds familiar to you because
you've been watching stranger things on
Netflix arm oh my god this show is a
great show man you know and we're not
gonna spoil anything if you haven't seen
because it is real time only or episodes
you only halfway through Zach and I
finish that arm what you know I mean
it's there's a lot going on yeah it's
it's Spielberg era uh sci-fi like a
tease yes Goldberg sci-fi but there's
there's a little more horror I think
yeah it's um I think it definitely rings
like the Stephen King in John Carpenter
yeah they yeah I think without the
horror it feels like a close encounters
an ET NE t uh there's a lot at the end
by me yeah I think 80 is like the most
on the nose especially like after a
couple episode little poltergeist yeah
sure it's all there so um you probably
heard about it I just I it makes me I
don't know it makes me just feel things
that I not felt nostalgically because
now it's kind of our turn they have this
yeah where the the shows that pay homage
to the 60s and 70s are sort of they're
not done but they've been done they've
been done yeah the eighties they've
tried it but this I don't think anything
else plays into something that's so
identifiable to the decade that we grew
about 80 show that's not a thing the
other was it now for wednesday that
wasn't a tease ya didn't do so avid
duffer brothers i was reading an
interview that they did and they were
talking how they was the creators Asia
yeah they were born in 84 yeah today and
look I was born in 85 Jeff you were at
82 was 83 your 83 so I mean when you
think about it we did i'm not saying
that we were children of the eighties we
probably didn't play Dungeons and
Dragons or maybe more magic the
gathering and whatnot yeah for sure but
I look the fact that we still graduated
from the 80s and we were at least five
six seven years old at the time we
remember the nostalgia of it but it
brings you back to a certain place and I
didn't think at first I would like it
and then after one episode you're just
like wow it makes you feel some sort of
way type away hey yeah Drake say that I
think
exactly I actually slept on my couch um
two nights ago because he fell asleep
watching it um no because I would made
me feel like a little kid again I was
like it was such an asst the seriously
you wanted to flow we went to bed in the
other room yeah and I was we we finish
this series and I'm like well I feel
like a little kid I'm like in like with
the with the blankets over my head but
footsies my pajama pants on and I'm
gonna for this yeah this is like amazing
i'm sleeping on the couch all right it
took it a little far but i respect that
it really got to me i think uh this is
so much about i think like for me a lot
of and especially the opening title
sequence that's great I'm there's
something I'm so in love with so it's
the music it's the music like visual
that the actual titles like the weirdo
on Jim street or whatever was calling
about that like they channeled this sort
of undiscussed like vibe that day well
some 80's can't be horror had that like
they're channeling it too so on the nose
and so well without being parrot yep
Abby right it's also perfectly
formulated you've got the small town
middle narrative got the down-and-out
sheriff kelly loves his booze you've got
the the broken home with the main
character in check I think you've got
the government conspiracy like but they
make it work they make you work and I
also think like there's so much
production and an art direction that is
so freakin on the nose like there's a
certain kid like that just can't be
that's a real campaign I get like some
of it looks like they found a lot of
wood paneling I found a lot of the
things that just like I basement
basement yeah the base my boys with a
light touches in tractor like that is
exactly what a kid's baseman in the 80s
look like you like that is the base have
they done anything the duffer brothers
before the yes they did I think believe
they wrote a couple episodes of wayward
Pines night Shyamalan a novel adaptation
now the world is theirs whatever they
want whatever large another season of
this for sure so have they said if it's
uh without ruining anything have they
said if it's another anthology it's an
ongoing Aziz is gonna be a sexy so the
story keeps going so please watch it if
you haven't obviously if you listen to
the show you are the perfect demographic
audience for it
I got or one in three days yeah we we
bet with having a job the best part was
like Stacey watched the first two in
like I've never loved it when she had no
idea about that oh and I'm like to I'm
telling you like just just and it was
like this amazing magnet just locking in
yes like we gotta blow through that I
have friends are watching it that
wouldn't be into the whole sci-fi sort
yeah and it's funny they all say the
same thing the music is literally so
they're coming out with the soundtrack
yeah course oh I saw an Instagram day
now so like all right we've heard you
loud and clear yeah oh yeah but the
soundtrack brings you back Fleetwood Mac
all that good yeah it's really a clash
they did it's it's really it's really a
piece of a special piece of television
so go check that out we just wanted and
again like it also kind of like uh so
you know makes me think of a few video
games too when can we talk about it
another couple weeks feel like what is
it okay the show just came out in July
like a clicks come out and be like okay
so we're at the point now where we think
ninety percent of the potential nerds in
our audience have completed I've watched
his completion so now people can talk
about on social media I think there is a
an unwritten law of like when it's okay
to start dream on I think it's a couple
months he came out what July fifteenth I
think mill around there I think we got
every week three and a half I always say
like a good rule of thumb is like what a
few weeks after it gets removed from the
prime placement on Netflix right or like
a next neck Netflix series comes out
that everybody's talking about whether
it's whatever huge change of season no
that's that's a long time what is that
it's everything like September yeah
maybe they really have seized it like
the way netflix does yeah i was gonna
ask me you know they're sort of like
distribution schedule like do they have
a new series every month is it multiple
series every month i think their plan
their hope is to have one every month um
but i don't think they're at that now or
if they are they're putting out a lot of
crappy stuff that i don't care about i
can't believe how many freaking original
shows that it's correct yeah can I ask a
bigger picture question of course you
can this is the show me the picture does
this just proved how much talent how
many scripts are sitting on slush piles
all across the country that this is
going to be without sounding cliche like
a television revolute way there
yeah I've been like that for okay so
where does it end I mean does it well
are there just gonna be other netflix
into because it has to stop against
somewhere as long as just launched a one
thing i think there's going to be a
Content bubble where like it's over sec
i won't i'll but people won't be able to
pay for all the good exactly like so
you're now subscribing to 19 different
things you're just the Hulu HBO netflix
plus most people like I think FX is like
the kind of FX an HBO for me or like the
chat powerhouses is not going to be in
the way that there are 200 cable
channels of course not you can dance but
when you look at like the the the high
production value solid storytelling
drama stuff like strange things like
you're you know whatever a break even i
watch the man at the height yeah I tower
I castle how much can the more how much
can you hold watch feel like if you ever
want to see a group of people's faces
turn red walk into any bar in new york
city at night and watch a group of
people talked about the new shows that
they're watching everybody's got the
veins in their neck pop not ready to say
what show their watches it's impossible
to keep all right so it makes me think
like just a how sad is that there's
gonna be so much talent out there for
the past 20 years when there was just
network TV i gots no door yeah i like
the darker brothers 10 years ago this
show would have never done right and
they talked about how everyone passed on
ya on the honour way to nine to twenty
rejections there is e so I mean though
it's a really good time for that but I
agree it will come to a point where it's
just like nope sorry we don't have any
space was just mostly is that what I'm
already there but then I think we're
there to like I can I am not watching
every like how many times some you gotta
watch penny dreadfuls you gotta watch
that watch bloodline got a lot much but
it's like come on i can only i dare you
to watch daredevil season one to watch
that yeah like Argo i'm getting yelled
at all I know there are exceptions
Fargo's annex against why should watch
every shows any exception that is you
know and it just gets to a point where
how much time do you have yeah to watch
all these shows yeah yeah I don't know
how much time do you have to scroll
through another app that has the bunch
of stories I've gotta yeah I feel like
you do is you don't need to use your
entire brain torino you catch area so
snapchat are basically got
um copied yes week as Instagram
introduced their own stories now I I
understand imitation is the best form of
flattery but did you have to use the
same damn word like they didn't even
call it anything else golden the sound
right if it were they calling you
stories about snapchat is that forensic
good from Zuckerberg just laying his on
the table going snapchat what's up yeah
you know look it's a dog-eat-dog world
that snapchat has a product Zuckerberg
on facebook Owens Instagram and so he
put it out there I'm not mad at him no I
me so here's the thing like instagrams
are better in my opinion it's a better
platform in terms I and white van
snapchat it's more intuitive right
snapchat is is more popular yeah right
but Instagram works better in my opinion
why guys are the fact that once it's
there you could repeat a minute I'm just
saying like functionality like
functionally you have to be pretty
advanced technologically speaking to
really understand snap right there I
have a lot of friends at are very smart
their lawyers I they can't figure it out
right well lawyers aren't the brightest
people I'm kit but up but no I feel like
a lot of people don't understand how or
they take for granted how good it is to
have like an app that just works and i
think you know don't forget like so now
that stories are a part of Instagram I
follow different people on both of those
platforms so now I'm getting like that
snapchat experience from the hundreds of
people i follow on instagram and it's I
kind of liked it better the Instagram
yeah the only thing they're missing like
you said are the are these facial rec
affairs the geo tags that'll come with
yeah that alike I guess there but
apparently there was a company that
snapchat bought sure to get that why
don't I call thing for nobody else you
that I was saying but all yours on your
stupid video I don't have that guy I
mean I don't know who do who owns
masquerade I'm sure they got sure
there's some 40 year old kid somewhere
sitting in his mother's basement yeah
now that's 100 per student can figure
out all right you two can figure it out
well thank you even though faith in the
both of you that I had to I don't know
if you do that we could probably like
play the video game of that
oh I can build a house in Minecraft I
can't build a house so what does this
mean is snapchat is it rest in pieces
it's fine I think I don't I honestly
don't know what it means and it's a good
question because someone asked me that
on CBS I was like I don't know are they
kicking themselves in the ass for not
selling it when they should have for the
amount of money that they know they're
fine because they have all the big 10
users yeah those users are not going to
leave and the younger audience does not
like instagrams right just snapchat so
but for me it's like I think there's
something kind of special about I also
think that the Instagram the tech under
the hood yeah performs better for me on
my phone okay like I open up SAP channel
more stable yeah it just I think it just
has a better foundation sure that
somebody older that's using it such as
myself in my thirties I'm getting old do
you or get it's easier for me with with
Instagram it's an it's all an aggregated
it's at all in one I've got pictures and
now at the top I have I think that's a
better it's better it's more laid out
more like oh yeah ah it's more conducive
to being you know productive on I like
it we have too much time on our hands is
the morals do you think that's what a
watch other two wonderfully James you're
clearly not spending enough time
catching pokemon so yeah mr. have got
him already not yet wrong guy in
Brooklyn who did right now you what's
the prize yeah pride infinite lameness
become a pokemon master see if there was
money at she that's how they can get
people such as myself involved or just
the average person a cash prize award
apparently it does not matter because
they hit like 80 million users like
they're fine they don't need convincing
i don't know i mean i can even a cash
prize like whatever I mean you would get
trounced by people then I mean people
might get a yeah all right we got to
talk about facebook though before we get
out of here and then we gotta get to
russ's story uh which you are hyping up
your the hype man today I am the hype
man i haven't typed it on the show but i
do think it's a good story um so
facebook is changing its newsfeed to get
rid of clickbait yes so this is actually
explained to me with clickbait is like a
five-year-old okay so click bait is a
headline that over promises but under
deliver you won't believe what this
person did at the Olympics I've been
cleaved on those forever sixteen ways to
get your
penis the size of Milwaukee the good
land so you're meeting to telling me
yeah so then you click on that I all
those times I clicked on to make my
penis bigger was all for naught for a
thing is all for naught because
clickbait is designed to confuse and
deceive yeah and the whole life is a lie
right now you realize I mean I could
have told you that a long time ago but
uh but yeah that's what's a way yeah if
facebook wants to make sure that the
links that they're promoting on facebook
are better lead people to better content
so they don't have a bad experience on
the problem to inherently is that a lot
of people get news from facebook so it
is in Facebook's best interest to curate
that to a point where they can be a
reliable news aggregate wow what I was
good yeah well that's his facebook still
as big as it was yeah it one at a six
106 people on earth norm is it it's
crazy it has well I get the volume
ability to reach there are people still
as active on it as they are Instagram
snapchat I will let you in on a little
bit information duh so cnet you know
obviously has channels everywhere we
have snapchat we have yoga nothing comes
close to the Facebook still still it is
a big deal and you right how long are
you could make a facebook for I'm
actually considering deleting like my
tee time but it might be time um but
yeah so that's a story with that they
are obviously using an algorithm that
they are training to sniff out they may
claim there are patterns without
clickbait headlines which makes sense
the way Google does that is they track
so if you click on a link and then you
go back that's the same thing they're
implementing similar stuff yeah but it's
so it's not just the the cookies that
measure time but it's also language and
and predictable stuff yeah so the you
know it's interesting though because a
lot of people have different definitions
for what clickbait is right it's like a
very broad definition of floating
definite it's a floating definition some
people are like want like all the
details everywhere so like if a headline
is here's the release date for Star Wars
Episode nine um some people gets out of
that clickbait because they're like well
why don't you just tell us in the
headline
ah so there are varied definitions of it
um here's my Masai people you know I
don't like quick bait or garbage sites
that make you click through 16 images in
a stupid gallery and pop-ups show up but
to keep media sites alive you need to
click somewhere on them like we need the
views guys just click every once a while
when you see something oh my god no he's
that was dark that's true kind of
desperate it's that whatever super if
people want all the information up front
in the headline it does not benefit us
at all different you're describing two
different things sure okay you there's a
difference between deceiving yeah and
out and over promising yeah and being
providing creative well thought-out
lucid headline you're right but I would
say there are people on the planet that
think very differently from you I
understand that but we have to we have
to encourage a positive culture change
yes and and I don't always too dour it
sounded bad you know that I'm not always
the I didn't have breakfast this morning
as we've discussed your falling apart my
memory off a cliff uh I am the first to
knock facebook for existing but i'm glad
i can fight facebook no i know i'm not
saying that but i am very happy that
they are taking making an initiative yes
i think it's like a to help fix the
problem that they are very much a part
of yes agreed so I applaud that and
hopefully a change is made over time
changes now the problem is that we've
talked about millions people see too
much stuff come across their feet on
facebook and take it as gospel yes and
that hopefully is something they are
trying to target yes well see it's time
for story time ladies gentlemen all
right I'm ready don't build it up too
much uh too late okay Russ always has a
weird wacky story that he likes to share
with us I don't know last time was like
the cab but I had thing that was okay
your best story yeah I don't even know
anymore k remembered something fell in
the shower and I thought it was a bug
right so
yours low let's see if you can leap over
it at about 4pm yesterday I got multiple
text messages since my phone I was in an
email I was in a meeting and I got out
of the meeting and I look at my phone
and there's tons of text messages one of
them said do you know a melissa another
one said someone is in mom's apartment
who is this person whoa my mom text me
who is in my apartment what is going on
you need to call me right away the one
in New York the one in New York so
there's some background my mom is moving
to the city she is slowly moving stuff
in so she's been in the apartment you
know once a week maybe two times a week
but semi infrequently as she moves you
know from upstate into the city she got
into the apartment she arrived at the
apartment yesterday at around 11am kinda
open the door um the air mattress that
she had put in there to sleep on
temporarily was moved into the other
room what and there were women's clothes
on the bed shut up oh my wait a minute
some squatting in there someone was
squatting in the room now some
background you all need you I need to
know that so it's a doorman building so
when I wasn't how would they get in
decor man's lover apparently paying off
the doorman gave the keys and the keys
are all tracked so we know exactly who
the person was when they gave the keys
out and we have video footage of the
person doing it so according to the
doorman who claims ignorance he was not
in cahoots with this person is what he
says so ignorance being I just gave your
keys yessum I mean he clearly screwed up
pretty damn big he's got to go she goes
doorman unions they're tough she um came
to this woman came to the apartment uh
downstairs was like hey so I'm the new
owner of this place so it's not how
would but like timeout how does she know
that that that apartment was in a
situation that could be squatted shore
valid question so my mom's been having
people come in and work on the apartment
construction knocking down some walls
putting new walls up etc oh you guys
don't want to do and that's interesting
so so somebody um my guess is that
someone in
building must have um somewhere said hey
this apartments empty no one's in it you
could come in here and stay what so
that's a baseline of level information
but that's not even you don't even know
the veracity of that like but I can't
fathom that anyone would randomly walk
up to apartment and assume that no one
lives there that's so weird Cena so I'm
like streeteasy you can see it sir I'm
just drawing it out there but it cannot
list it it's not listed it was never all
we're not selling it yeah I'm not
selling it there just like renovating a
little right so that doesn't make sense
doesn't make any sense so um even
weirder is the people downstairs said
the floor below you no no sorry the
doorman doorman or whatever yeah said
something about it being this girl named
Melissa who's one of her sons um one of
your son's girlfriends what now I date a
girl named Melissa about eight years ago
no way and there was a time no wait
there was a time it's not her okay so
now you should have waited to tell sorry
I don't care but there was another river
there was a time when I added her name
to a list saying like she could have
access to it so maybe someone in the
building saw that list but I checked
again with the update was living there
eight years ago and they were right I
was living there eight years ago so
there was no indication of that on the
list nan gotcha anyway so this whole
thing happens while i'm in this meeting
and I'm like frantically trying to get
an update what the what is going on so
unlike talk to my mom she's very upset
she's like well I we gotta call the cops
I'm like okay well I'm gonna come down
there at six and will file a police
report so I go down there I we walk over
the police station which is a few blocks
away we're like hey it's the same thing
happened it's like okay we'll send
someone over there like an hour later
two guys come two cops come and we start
walking through the part so we have
neither of us have been in the apartment
since my mom showed up drop the dog off
because she had no price to put the dog
and then went to babysit her
granddaughter this is great so okay so I
paint on painting the scene here so I go
up I have the dog on a leash with the
two cops with my mom and we
walking through the apartment and now my
mom has stuff in the apartment nothing
is missing there's like some clothes
like just a little bit of stuff here and
there nothing's missing the clothes are
on the bed and the cops are like walking
around with flashlights they're like
looking in each the rooms and like
always this year stuff is this your
stuff which is my moms like no it's just
the stuff on the bed and then they go
into one of the bathrooms there's a
in one of the band no my she left there
was there was a move I think in a DNA
tested yeah so go so the cop reaches
into the toilet lights it literally what
my mom said when they found the was
holy so can you can you test that
my mom asked the cop the cops laughs not
know they were serious but like I like I
you know what I like I couldn't they yes
they so they could but here's the
background is if you're gonna do DNA
testing there needs to be a pretty
serious crime not someone crazy here why
a dead body five feet away yeah middle i
would say burglary you'd probably maybe
do it and maybe arson serious birth
about how these dollars ever uh sure
arson uh yes murder hitter yes a violent
crime yes uh drugs if they were like uh
man we don't usually have testicular for
squatters yes a low-level low-level
crime yeah so he's like um with the cops
are like it talking to each other like
you know what are we gonna do here and I
should and and and the cops the cop
targets on my way add to my mom and he's
like well you know here's the deal um we
don't know who this person is uh if you
recognize the person when you see the
video let us know but otherwise like
change the locks that's pretty much all
you can do yeah so there's sure there's
no wait like sweet there's a crime that
was committed of course but there's no
way to like she's gonna come back no why
because a the building now has her photo
but she'll but she might walk in the
door right she might walk in the door
well she'll walk in the downstairs door
no we gotta get her and then they'll see
her poor man's gonna be like yeah come
here yeah and then and then like knock
her over the head no no we heard her but
I'm seeing like maybe we put her in the
janitor's closet
the cops cops I gotta put her head into
the toilet with a product you work with
the dog remember this bad dog so
apparently she had dogs with two small
dogs with her and she heard like barking
like neighbors heard some barking I
thought I thought it was a dog's poop in
the toilet very well right we'll never
that's amazing I would never understand
how she knew it was okay to squat there
must have been someone don't want so or
someone maybe like working was for
people who were working on the place
coming and going so they I mean people
worked on the place people not people
that didn't work in the building that
were contractors came in and were
therefore whatever a week or two and new
for one hundred percent certainty that
no one was there this is New York City
have some very weird squatter laws like
after a certain time you could you're
allowed to it's not just New York City
there are weird laws elsewhere as well
where it's like if you've been here but
there there's also injured his ways to
like kick people out sure so yeah I
think your mom is your mom afraid like
she yes she was she was very she was
very those persons got the keys you
gotta change along well the chant the
locks have been changed the building
pain to paid to change locks of course
we're asking them to pay to replace the
mattress because who wants to sleep on
that mattress to clean the apartment
because like gross yeah and it was their
fault like it has already flushed the
toilet oil is flushed after the cops
left was that like a ceremonious yes
well I understand that the squatter
didn't flush well yeah right there in
the name that's weird the squatters
maybe shank maybe they should check the
plumbing may be here well maybe she yeah
flush and it came back there well there
was a really focus my fault yeah no it's
actually gonna take the poop beat
illness the cops were very concerned
that it was gonna come back up a one we
flush but thankfully everything yeah my
god I've never seen anything like this
so that must been an interesting little
sojourn for them and I don't know what
they normally fill their days with but I
feel like sure that was an easy day for
them yeah probably pretty easy job they
go home to play tame but like I can you
imagine that like doorman building nice
apartment just random oh yeah weird
right it's weird and then and there's
there's an X Factor here that we're
definitely missing like who was the one
that provided the
like the Melissa thing is very random
and weird so we can start a podcast
about you know like Syria was like that
new cereal yeah we gotta fill these
bison if anyone know it has any
information yep don't do anything yeah
that's a weird story right good job yeah
I was a good one thank you that was a
good one that was my first story I've
ever heard of your so you have
credibility with me now the bar is a
little too high now and now your bars
way above average yeah and that's
interesting you have anything funny you
want the interesting thing you want to
tell us before we get out of here no I'm
kind of over this no no you don't want
to ever come back no I love no chef at a
time yeah this is a lot of fun I promise
therapeutic it's better than therapy
that's the only reason Rosen I do it yep
pretty much the only way we can like she
had very cheaper only way to get up in
the morning yeah just come here and do
this I like it we were I guess I will
say why going back to the whole
Instagram thing ID I follow I realized
this morning 998 people on Instagram
that's all high and since all the
stories are up there now yeah I'm now
seeing stories from people like I don't
care so in the header cleaned it out I
got sounds like 450 I actually feel
better yeah yeah feel like you shed a
few pounds right but it's like you talk
about what yeah and I'm sure there's
gonna be yes which I have to we'll wrap
this up but anyway there's got to be
some sort of psyche behind it like even
though following people that I don't
give a damn about yeah I know nothing
about it still thought we were pressing
on file I don't know I know that's so
millennial be they say but just gonna be
seared sign yeah I mean sometimes life
for three years and it's like goodbye
goodbye yeah but somebody that I would
never see your talk tits I don't say
like Holly understand weird it's
psychological I think uh you know I
think we need to like I think it's
there's somewhere along the line of that
there's fault at the point of like you
shouldn't feel that way like it's
understandable why you guilty for
feeling that what right here I am
unfollowing some bikini model from Hell
eh who uploads to bikini pics a day for
the past three years that was pretty
detailed that was very and I have like
30 of my breaking up with ex-girlfriends
be fine what's the psyche behind that
it's like it's weird it is very now
every time i'm sitting here or on my way
over i'm uploading my instagram it's
like oh there's not
many uploads like bikini girl bikini
girls in LA where we're messed up we are
mad generation I just hope me somehow
