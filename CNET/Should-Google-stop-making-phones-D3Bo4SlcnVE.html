about Katie google has confirmed that
it's going to be doing a big event on
October fourth and it's expected to be
launching new smartphones but what I
want to know you is do you think Google
should be still in the smartphone game
soon there's any point in Google still
making phone hardware or is it better
off out of that business that's a really
good question Luke because I wasn't a
compliment and the when Google first
launched its own smartphone which was
the original Nexus phone yeah it was a
really exciting product and it got loads
of attention it was sold out online I
remember for ages oh yeah and and it
offered you know the kind of specs that
you wouldn't necessarily be able to
afford otherwise so you know the the
processor was much more powerful and and
the design of the phone was nothing to
write home about I mean the Nexus
devices have never been kind of like
flashy cool phones to look at and it
also attracted a kind of a crowd of
people that were really interested in
having that really kind of pared back
Android experience that they could
customize without all the kind of bulk
that you get with with a samsung phone
so work back then you know the Nexus I
think had a really important parts play
and I'm not sure whether that's still
the case well I'm I have to say I'm with
you because you're right google has an
incredible pedigree when it comes to
making phones the Nexus I think was the
Nexus forward particularly Nexus 5 as
well huge sell out successes but it was
because as you say they offered great
hardware at a really low price and now a
copiers down the line I don't think that
so unusual anymore if you look good
cheap phones from basically everyone
whether it's Sony your huawei or LG
motorola in particular yeah fantastic
affordable phones yeah and I think it's
really it's lost that unique selling
points I think I think while i still
prefer raw pure Android to you know
there's the Android skins you get I
think undoubtedly they have all
generally got better in the quality has
come up so I would rather see Google
actually to be honest focusing on
less on phone hardware and more on the
software side yeah because if you look
at the stuff that they've been doing
they're like Google assistant that they
were talking about it at Google i/o
sounds really cool Google should be the
company that is absolutely crushing the
AI game because is the company with all
the data right I mean deep mine for
example it's got access to all of that
kind of really cool ma I stuff that a
lot of other companies just don't have
yeah and a lot of phone companies you
know hardware companies don't have and I
know that a lot of companies are working
on their own versions of these things
but I feel like Google's were already
streets ahead and then there's the
there's the aloe messenger as well which
has just just very recently come out and
that looks pretty cool as well and yeah
if that takes off but it feels like all
the coolest stuff that Google's doing is
software based and so I was actually a
little bit surprised when when they sort
of teased this phone business I mean we
should say as a disclaimer that we don't
know of course what Google is going to
be doing only Google knows for sure but
the rumors are strongly pointing towards
a phone Google's a little teaser video
that they did definitely indicated a
smartphone shaped thing given the price
of the Nexus models whether it was ever
really about making a profit on these
phones and I think it's almost more of a
an opportunity to showcase and what the
next generation of phones can do sure
and I guess what Android can do yeah
undoubtedly these vines will come with
whatever Google's cooked up you know AI
in assists exactly and these the Nexus
phones also have a track record of
getting the latest version of Android
much faster and I think that's improved
a lot over the last few years it used to
be a real problem for android phone
owners and it's much better now but you
know in terms of you know these kind of
technologies maybe we're going to see
Google you know bring out something that
is beyond what the general android
smartphone can deliver in which case you
know that that might be quite exciting
yeah that's true that's true all right
well the finders are rumored to be
called the pixels and pixel XL but we'll
find out for sure exactly what Google's
got cooked up on the fourth of October
seen it well of course be there spring
you all the lake
anyway we've had our say but we want to
know what you guys think on this should
Google still be making flights let us
know what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
