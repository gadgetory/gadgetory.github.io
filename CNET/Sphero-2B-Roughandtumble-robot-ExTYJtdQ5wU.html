net here at CES 2014 we're taking a look
at the Sphero to be a robot that you
control with your phone so the Sphero 2b
is the sequel to the Sphero which you
might recognize from rolling around on
the floor of your local toy shop you
control this robot using a smartphone it
works with iOS or Android you can see
the controls here using this app you can
actually drive the thing you can also
change the color of the logo which I
particularly like they communicate using
Bluetooth 4.0 and you can use several of
them to have a kind of shooting match
that they fire invisible virtual
missiles out of this logo on the front
and if you manage to hit your enemies
Sphero to be there then they'll lose
some health the to beat is cleverly
weighted so even as it's spinning around
and tumbling all over the place the main
body part actually stays kind of central
you get one hour battery life and it
moves at five meters per second which
your buttocks tells me is roughly as
fast as most humans so you can
definitely chase someone something I
particularly like is that you get all of
these different kinds of tires this one
here has the these knobby tires which
are kind of all rounder I think this one
over here has these smoother drift tires
if you're into some insane drifting
stunt action I'm told that you can get
about three feet of air if you ramp one
of these off a jump these models are
just prototypes but the final version
will be on sale in holiday season 2014
I'm told and they're gonna cost $99
which impressively is cheaper than the
first Sphero find controlled robots
what's not to love I'm the Westway for
more from CNET's at CES 2014 go to CES
