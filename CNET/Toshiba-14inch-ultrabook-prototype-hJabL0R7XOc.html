that they have so you'll see this later
in the year hopefully and hopefully they
look just like this and again it's got
the bigger screen it's still pretty thin
it's not as soon as those 13 inches but
what they're trying to do is they're
trying to say we can take that 13 inch
ultrabook give it a 14 inch screen later
almost season 15 inch screens and those
become machines that you can use it work
all day a 13-inch great for traveling
rate for that you know a couple hours of
the coffee shop airport lounge whatever
but all day every day you're not going
to use a 13 you need a 14 or 15 so once
you get up to this size then you have
something that's almost as thin and
light that you can actually just use as
your full time machine and that's what
ultrabooks up until now I think our
degree you have not been able to do I
feel like I'm skeptical of that though
the idea that you have to have a 14 or
15 inch machine to work on because it
just monitor and keyboard oh then you
got to get like a docking station and
plug stuff in yes that's true I agree
it's clunky it's a clunkier solution but
it'll at least for me it allows me to
have a tiny laptop that is true I don't
know if it's I don't know necessarily
where it's going to slide him left to
see I think right now there's not also
it may be just go to everybody knows
what the macbook air is doing and it
just as simple as that Apple doesn't
have a type of product the moment that
fits into that category so we'll go away
I don't you know what is that exactly
and there definitely are people to want
the keyboard i think is it probably that
is hardly giving that finger left yes
and that real this is a very toshiba
design sensibility that seems to be what
they you know you have the
differentiating cues right the HP Envy
line very design centric machines always
have been really beautiful toshiba it
really does this brushed aluminum we've
seen that on some of their tablets and
their other laptops and then of course
dell just looking like a macbook air
