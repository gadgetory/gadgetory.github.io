camera is one of logitech's first
devices to fall under its rebranded
Logie name that's gonna be all of the
future stuff that's related to the
Internet of Things here's what I like
about this camera it has a really
straightforward at the 720p is crisp and
about on par with the neck your Arlo's
performance and you can easily scroll
through your activity feed to see your
recorded footage but this camera's
battery power is pretty bad I tested it
on more than one occasion and with even
light use it tended to last for less
than two hours and take even longer than
that to recharge so as far as a
functional portable rechargeable camera
this one really really fell short and
part of the reason that this app is so
easy to navigate in the first place is
because it has almost no features you
can't set activity zones there's no
ability to customize motion sensitivity
there's basically nothing in the app at
all in fact Logie kind of hijacks the
whole user experience from you basically
deciding what's important and what isn't
and controlling everything on your
behalf so some people that are really
new to DIY might like that it's
basically just a watered down version of
a webcam but other people who are
looking for more advanced customization
and control or even third-party
integration just won't find it with
Logie circle there are a lot of ways
that this camera falls short and you can
read all about it in my full review at
