only can Patrick get great pictures and
video little Jeremy who's so nervous he
could throw up but Patrick can also be
in the video pretty much every
smartphone out there today has two
cameras the main camera on the back that
also shoots video and the front-facing
camera that you can use to take pictures
of yourself with the galaxy s4 Patrick
and shoot video with both at the same
time if you can capture the scene he's
looking at while also inserting himself
in it and the dual camera mode can be
turned on and off by clicking a button
on the screen then when viewed the video
will switch from the full screen video
taken with the main camera to the dual
screen taken with both that way you can
be in the whole video if you want to or
pop in and out another great feature is
our air gesture it allows you to
navigate the phone without actually
touching it with air gesture you can
fast forward or rewind move apps around
look at photos even browse the rat web
all with just a swipe of your hand and
if you're working in an email or browser
you can move your hand vertically and
the page behind the one you're viewing
will appear do I want to talk about the
samsung smart scroll and smart pause yes
that's a revolutionary innovation based
on the galaxy s3 smart stay this allows
the galaxy s4 to detect whether or not
you're looking at the phone so if DD was
watching a video and something caught
her eye
the galaxy s4 will automatically pause
the video so that you don't lose track
freaky and when she looks back the s4
would it start again yep DD look back at
your phone do I have to you have to come
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
