right now we're taking a first look at
the new Fitbit force fitness tracker
with the price of one twenty nine ninety
five the four stands at the top of
fitbit's current line of high-tech
health and wellness products and as you
might expect this gadget goes well
beyond your average pedometer looking at
the force you might assume it's fitbit's
previous fitness tracker the Fitbit flex
that's because it could be a splitting
image of the earlier product both use an
angular wrist strap design and have a
dark glossy strip bisecting its front
face the big difference here though is
the forces larger size part of the
reason for its more sizable footprint is
that the force boasts a real
alphanumeric OLED screen with this
display the force can show detailed
activity data such as steps distance
traveled calories burned and stairs
climbed the force can also highlight how
many active minutes you have currently
under your belt
I think being nicest feature of the
forces screen other than its bright and
easy to read is it displays the time
it's a huge development in a small wrist
style fitness device and helps both the
force and Fitbit branch out into
SmartWatch territory
another SmartWatch likability the force
brings to the table and uncharted
country for Fitbit is phone
notifications the company promises that
the force will soon be able to receive
alerts for incoming calls the catch
though is this ability is only planned
for iPhones running iOS 7 or higher
similarly if you own an iPhone or
Samsung Galaxy s3 galaxy s4 or no two
handset you will be able to use the iOS
and Android Fitbit apps to sync the
force over a wireless Bluetooth
connection additionally the app lets you
log meals to count calories compare food
intake against energy burned through
exercise and even sync with Fitbit Saria
Wi-Fi scale to see if your weight has
gone up or down add to this the Fitbit
forces sleep tracking and silent alarm
clock abilities and you have one
powerful Fitness product on your hands
I'm Brian Bennett and this has been a
first look at the fit
force</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
