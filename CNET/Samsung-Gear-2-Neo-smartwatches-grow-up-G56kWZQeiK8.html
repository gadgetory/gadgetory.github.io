released the Samsung Galaxy gear
SmartWatch but it is already on to round
two and three
I'm Jessica Valkyr Christina it here at
Mobile World Congress 2014 we're gonna
talk about the Samsung gear 2 and gear 2
neo you'll note that Samsung has dropped
the name galaxy from these watches and
that is because it is switched over from
Android to Samsung's own home-brewed
Tizen operating system now you're not
going to notice too many differences
when you use the watch itself instead
you're going to notice all the small
incremental changes that Samsung has
made now the most important differences
between the gear 2 and the Neo is that
the Neo doesn't have a camera it's also
a little bit lighter and it's also made
out of a plastic polycarbonate material
instead of brushed metal on the gear 2
so will be a less expensive device so
what you're going to notice on the gear
2 is that the camera and in fact the
microphone everything has moved up from
the straps to the body of the device one
of the reasons for this could be just
ease and another reason is that Samsung
wants you to be able to interchange the
straps now each of these comes in three
different colors but you can really swap
out any standard strap the straps here
are a little bit textured and they do
have that typical closure that we saw in
the regular galaxy gear now the watches
are also rated ip67 for dust and water
resistance and there is an IR blaster
that will let you control your TV
through the watch on App samsung says
that is launching over 800 apps for the
Tizen based gear 2 and gear neo and that
SDK is going to be open to developers so
they can develop apps as well otherwise
it looks pretty much the same house the
same size screen as before bright and
colorful with on-screen controls
pedometer there is also an integrated
heart rate monitor so that will hook
into all of your health apps the camera
also gets a really tiny bump on the gear
- it's 2 megapixels in this one with
autofocus samsung says that it has
extended the battery life so your watch
won't just last one day it'll last 2 or
3 depending on your usage
I'm Jessica Volcker Christina you can
check out the gear 2 and the gear 2 neo
