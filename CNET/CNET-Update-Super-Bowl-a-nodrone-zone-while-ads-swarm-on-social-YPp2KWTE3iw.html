at the Super Bowl I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update for the first
time ever
Facebook is hitting you with Super Bowl
ads in real time during the big game on
Sunday if you like or type in anything
relating to the Super Bowl or football
such as Patriots Seahawks even the word
deflate you'll have ads targeted to you
Facebook doesn't do real-time
advertising or anything real-time for
that matter I mean it takes 24 hours
sometimes to see what your friends post
but the social network is trying to
follow the advertising success of
Twitter Twitter's real-time ads have
made headlines
remember when Oreo tweeted during the
blackout in 2013 after that viral moment
there now our advertising teams assigned
to create spontaneous social media ads
for whatever happens and Facebook wants
to be part of the sensation it's
estimated that sixty six billion dollars
will be spent on TV ads for the
Superbowl social media now is another
part of that spending pie we never know
what's gonna trend on the championship
game but the FAA hopes it won't involve
a drone the Federal Aviation
Administration has declared the
Superbowl as a no drone zone the FAA
posted this 15-second video clip to
YouTube encouraging anyone going to the
University of Phoenix Stadium in
Glendale Arizona to leave their drone at
home and the flight restrictions extend
to a ten-mile radius around the stadium
drones are not on the official list of
prohibited items but I'm sure security
will be eager to confiscate any unmanned
aircraft they find and honestly anyone
flying a drone at the Super Bowl is
probably drunk droning as we learned
this week I can get you in some trouble
the quadcopter drone that crashed on the
White House lawn Monday was said to have
been remote-controlled by a drunk
government employee but to avoid future
national security issues of drinking
while droning the maker of the
quadcopter a company called DJI says
it's releasing an update to prevent the
craft from going into no-fly zones and
now that includes spaces around washing
in d.c the updates going to roll out
soon to the Phantom to phantom 2 vision
and vision plus perhaps organizations
that are not drone friendly will be
investing in ways to fight drones with
drones the rapper ax is a drone designed
to hunt fine and disable other drones
the engineering team is remaining
anonymous for now and it hasn't posted
videos or photos of the drone in action
yet but the website does have a
slideshow of the concept where it
intercepts a target drone by flying
above it then drops a rope into the
targets rotors which sends it crashing
to the ground
