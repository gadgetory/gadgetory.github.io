okay time for final impressions on the
Moto X after our night on the town all
in all I really like the Moto X i like
how customizable it is i love the google
now integration i love the way the voice
controls work what I don't love is the
same thing that I have never loved about
a motorola phone the coomera the night
shots are terrible and there's just no
way to improve it I don't care how fun
it is to go like this and launch it so
if you don't care about taking pictures
at night then I guess it's a perfectly
good phone and it is but I think most
people want to use it 24-7 so that makes
this a kind of reluctant do not buy
