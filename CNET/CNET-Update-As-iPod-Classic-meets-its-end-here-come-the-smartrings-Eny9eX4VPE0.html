I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update while Apple introduced two new
iPhones and a watch it also decided it
was time to say goodbye to the original
iPod music player Apple's no longer
selling the iPod Classic it was the last
music player with a screen that wasn't a
touchscreen this sixth-generation model
with its click wheel debuted in 2007 but
it was 13 years ago that Steve Jobs
introduced the first iPod and the iPod
kick-started a digital music revolution
but when the Apple watch goes on sale
next year it could also change our daily
habits people will use their wrist as a
way to answer messages or as a remote
control for music and TV or even wave
their arm around like some magic wand to
activate different wireless sensors that
can open doors and pay for train tickets
but while some folks still wrestle with
the idea of doing so much computing on a
wrist and whether it's worth the price
there are companies already looking to
your finger as the next step the motaz
smart ring would give a buzz and display
notifications when someone's calling or
texting you the company did make a
SmartWatch but it's still working to
raise money for the ring on IndieGoGo
it's not the first smart ring there's
also ring Lee it has an actual gemstone
and it lights up and buzzes when you get
a message on your phone so will smart
earrings be next maybe that'll be an
upgrade to the iPod shuffle now what
about the next generation of cable for
those of you that want to cut the cord
from your cable subscription listen up
Sony's working on launching a fully
online TV service and when it does it'll

Internet Intel's also trying to cook up
a similar internet TV offering Sony gave
no word on when this would actually
launch as for the world of video on
demand
