for cnet's here at mobile world congress
2014 in barcelona we're taking a first
look at the huawei talk band be one so
huawei is getting involved in the world
of wearables this is a combination
headset and wristband this black section
here has a 1.4 inch oled display and you
can pop it out like this and wear it as
a bluetooth headset as well as letting
you make phone calls this thing also
talk to your phone to track steps you've
taken how many calories you've burned
and also how well you've slept one bit
of good news is that its water and
dust-resistant which means you should be
okay to take this thing in the shower
you might be wondering how you charge
this thing well we were very surprised
to find under the strap here there's a
standard USB on the end of this rubber
strap so you can just charge it by
plugging into a computer once you charge
it up you get seven hours of talk time
or a whole two weeks of standby time
this thing is going to cost 99 euros
when it goes on sale let me know if
you're tempted do you like wearable tech
or do you think it's all too much hassle
let me know and check out senior com for
much more from mobile or Congress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
