I'm cnet's car i cboy joined by senior
writer Seth Rosenblatt hi Cara hey Seth
so today we've learned that a major
medical group has been hacked yes I some
Chinese hackers yes tell us about the
the breach so the group was hacked by
unknown Chinese hackers using what's
called an advanced persistent threat
which means that the group uses a
variety of techniques to get at specific
information and they're not looking just
to get financial data they're looking to
get specifics from whatever database
they're going after 206 hospitals were
affected 4.5 million personal records
and this was community hospital services
that just name the group yes and how
many states I think was 29 states okay
and the information that the hackers
were after it's not really clear they
didn't get anybody's medical records it
looks like it was just a names email
addresses Social Security numbers and
that's actually enough if you can
identify them to other similar addresses
or names you could probably wind up
creating credit cards in that person's
name or doing other kinds of identity
theft techniques so what if you're one
of the people who has been affected 4.5
million people what can you do to
protect yourself that's a good question
unfortunately right now I don't think
there's a lot that you can do besides
keeping an eye on your name as it
appears you know on the internet keep an
eye on your personal records make sure
that you there's no charges to your
credit card that no extra cards get sent
out and just be vigilant and it's it's a
little bit scary but it's unfortunately
all that you can do at the moment and it
seems like there's nothing that these
people could have done to protect
themselves proactively you know and
that's really what I think the big
problem here is that this is another
example of a company that has a lot of
personal information that is not taking
the necessary steps to protect it and to
protect their customers in this case
it's hospitals they could have been
going after a specific senior executive
that's a very common technique for
advanced persistent attacks but honestly
it's hard to tell right now
so what do we know about this hacking
group and what their motivation might
have been like you said an executive or
just to kind of send a message to the
American government to show me details
we really don't have any details on this
particular group there's certainly a lot
of news about Chinese hackers they're
not all the same group and we don't
really know anything about this one at
the moment whether it's connected to
their government or not right exactly
okay so in the meantime just to keep an
eye on your information and keep an eye
on your information if you do have to go
to a hospital it's a good idea to ask
them what they do to protect your
information it may not actually gain you
any information but it lets them know
that you're aware of what's going on
great good tips Thank You Seth
