8 at an event in New York City on August
23rd CNET section editor Jessica dole
cook gives us the lowdown on what to
expect from the note 8 and what it can
do to win back customers after the note
7 debacle so it's out that the Galaxy
Note 8 is gonna have a larger screen
with possibly curved sides all around a
dual camera that means a second camera
lens on the back and possibly a stylus
that you can talk into so it takes our
voice memos there are also rumors that
there might be a pressure-sensitive
display that you can touch down on sort
of like on the iPhone and also that the
fingerprint sensor could be underneath
the screen and that would be a big
change because on the galaxy s 8 it's on
the back of the phone next to the camera
and it's pretty inconvenient this phone
is so important for Samsung the Galaxy
Note 7 had this battery disaster some
units went up in flames this was really
bad Samsung had to recall millions of
units and it took the phone off the
market so this is actually the first
time in two years that loyal Samsung
followers have been able to buy a new
note device there are a ton of huge
devices coming out this fall including
the follow-up to the Google pixel the
Apple iPhone 8 LG's got the V 30 coming
up it's just gonna be a really really
busy time for Android and Samsung has to
prove itself it's gotta prove that the
note 8 can be safe it's got to prove
that it can be good and it's got to
prove that it can be worth the money
especially these V the competitors that
are coming out
it will be really interesting to see if
this is the last that Samsung talks
about the new at 7 disaster and if they
go out of their way to address battery
concerns or if they'll kind of paper
over it and just carry on but it's
possible that they'll emphasize again
what happened and what they're doing
this time to make sure that the battery
is safe
and that could just be going over what
the procedures were what the findings
were with the inquest we might also see
a change to the battery or they might
tell us that they've gone ahead and
changed to other manufacturing
procedures in addition to the 8 point
battery test that they already talked
about I think it just makes good
business sense for Samsung to reward
these loyal note followers who had to go
through all of the inconvenience and
maybe the fear that their device might
blow up throughout the recall and then
come back to Samsung and by its most
premium device and one that is really
for power users
so Samsung already does wireless
charging and water-resistant and it's
expected that the iPhone eight is gonna
have it too and really really narrow
that gap between them also if the iPhone
eight manages to come out for the same
price or a little bit less you know I
think it's going to be a tougher sell
for Samsung so try to get people to want
to buy a note device with this extra
s-pen if these people might be just as
happy spending a little bit less for the
Galaxy s8 or the Galaxy S eight plus so
if the rumors are true then the only
difference pretty much between the note
8 and the s8 plus would be the S Pen
Stylus and a second camera on the back
unless any of those other features come
into play too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
