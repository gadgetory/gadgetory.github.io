cnet.com steve jobs recently announced
apple's new service at the worldwide
developers conference in San Francisco
it's called iCloud and it finally lets
you wirelessly sync your music books and
apps across all your devices the full
version of iCloud won't be available
until fall but you can start using some
of these features right now the whole
point of iCloud is that music and other
media you purchase on one I device can
be automatically downloaded onto all
your other devices as long as they're
using the same iTunes account to get
started using iCloud you'll need to set
it up on each device you want to keep
synced so gather up all your idevices
like your iPhone iPad or iPod Touch
first go to settings then store here you
can set your device to automatically
download new music books and apps you
downloaded onto other Apple devices and
Mac or PC apples letting you connect
with up to 10 devices just switch the
different content categories to on and
automatic downloading will be enabled if
you're on an iphone or ipad with a
limited data plan I suggest leaving the
option to use cellular data off because
if you turn this option on automatic
downloads will be counted against your
data plan if you leave this option off
automatic downloading will then only
work when you're connected to Wi-Fi now
change the itunes settings on your
computer iCloud requires itunes 10.3 or
later and you can download it by going
to apple com / iTunes once you have it
go to preferences then store here you
have the same options as your idevices
and you can check the items you want to
keep synced so now that I have these
settings enabled if I download a song in
itunes it'll also start downloading on
my iPhone or if I download a song on my
iPad it'll be added to my library on my
computer but if you're like me you don't
have a lot of storage space left on your
device for my iPhone I left automatic
downloading off but since my computer
has lots of storage I kept automatic
downloading on for
everything on my iPhone I'll manually
download new content to do this go to
iTunes then purchased you'll see a list
of all the songs you bought on any
device to download them just hit the
cloud download button you can also view
songs you purchased but haven't put on
your device by going to the tab on the
right the same goes for books and apps
for books open I books and head to store
then purchased for apps go to the App
Store then updates then purchased except
on the iPad where purchased gets its own
button to manage your content in itunes
go to the iTunes Store then purchased in
the right sidebar in this screen you can
download previously purchased items at
no extra cost for now I cloud only
supports music books and apps but Steve
Jobs explained that the rest of the
features like calendar mail and photos
syncing will come in the fall and will
get you caught up with those features
when they arrive for cnet.com I'm Sharon
Vaknin and i'll see you on the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
