finding it at the best price is so
critical these days so let's bring in
the cheapest person we know and I say
that in a loving caring way Rick broil
has been tracking and posting Black
Friday and Cyber Monday not for a day or
two not for a week not since Halloween
you've been on this since like midsummer
tracking the holiday buys is that right
Rick no I told you the cheapest guy I
know in a caring way
wins that TIE fighter drone back there
I've got the x-wing so let's stop all
right so give us a couple ideas just a
teaser we're gonna come into you
throughout the day as we go to
categories here throughout the hour any
couple things that are bad that are
bubbling up in your mind right now in
terms of the trends that are happening
with this year's deals deals go this
year and I've actually got a TV deal
coming up very shortly to share with
everybody but everywhere I look I feel
like I'm seeing just like unbeatable
prices on some TVs high-end and low-end
alike so if you're you know gearing up
for the Superbowl or whatever it is this
might be the time to grab that big
screen okay good good that's always a
big winner because it's a it's a good
gift for the family I mean TVs are a
perennial when it comes with what's
going on around the holiday shopping
thing and do we also have another
special deal you've got going on here
with an LG OLED and an echo yes probably
one of your favorites the LG OLED TVs
are widely regarded I think is some of
the best on the market right now and
we've got a pretty sweet deal going this
is a 65 inch LG OLED TV that sells for
2,500 bucks just about everywhere
through our exclusive dealing with daily
steals we're saving $200 on that TV is
literally the best deal on this model
that you can find anywhere right now
just for you yes you've seen that
viewers that's big that is a great price
it wasn't that long ago when we were
excited that a TV like that was maybe
list at 6,000 now with erosion in the
market and then the special deal we've
got this is coming down to like normal
TV pricing OLED used to be so rarefied
okay so thank you we're gonna convince
you in a moment here Rick I want to set
over to New York now and check-up with
Dan Ackerman Dan's my man when it comes
to laptops and while so many other tech
devices get a lot of the limelight you
know the new form factors of phones
folding is suddenly on the on the
horizon voice devices gotta have every
one of God but you know the laptop keeps
staying in there everybody still has a
laptop
been such a durable category everyone
still needs one right so you know you're
gonna have a home run if you give one
where do you direct people big picture
these days damn very quickly I was
hoping that discount on that TV wasn't
too because I just bought that one it's
I I called the midlife crisis TV because
every 40-something Brooklyn dad I know
just bought that 65 inch LG OLED it's
like a flat Porsche 911 killing
everything I couldn't wait I had to have
it I also have to have if I did not have
a laptop and I was gonna go buy one I
would consider the latest version of
Apple's MacBook Air which has been
pretty much the most popular laptop in
the world for about ten years now you
can't go anywhere coffee shops airport
lounges college campuses and not see a
whole bunch of airs but frankly they've
been getting a little longer the tooth I
don't have an old one with me right here
but the screen was bad
the keyboard was old it was really kind
of bigger and heavier than a lot of
newer laptops because they hadn't
updated that design in six or seven
years Oh Brian's bring me one right now
let's take it let's take a look Oh in a
classic an oldie but goodie but look at
that it's got this big silver border
here it's just not a modern feeling
laptop anymore so what Apple did was
they finally after years of everybody
begging for it they got the new one
right here this is the new MacBook Air
looks kind of like the MacBook Pro it's
got a much better screen than the old
one obviously a new keyboard bigger
touchpad it's thinner it's lighter
there's just one cat's because there's
always a catch no ports well okay
there's two cats yeah
ports hello oh you got a couple USB
ports but it's also more expensive the
MacBook Air was famously the $9.99
laptop and any college student could
maybe save up for a couple months and
get themselves a $9.99 MacBook Air that
could last them you know through four
years of college now it's 1199 and that
what kind of hurts at $9.99 it would be
a you know an instant must buy no
questions asked at 11 you got a lot of
competition but I still think they did a
very nice job with this long-awaited
refresh well look at least you have the
headphone jack let's be honest we got
that anyway
let's switch tech to TVs now we've been
relying on cats for around 15 years now
for his no BS take on what TV to buy now
David I want to kind of tap into the
latest here what do you recommend so
I'll start with the TV that really
impressed me this year for being really
inexpensive but still having a great
picture we review a lot of TVs that are
you know spectacular a high-end models
we also review some that are kind of
Junkers this Vizio e-series this year
they kind of they really hit the sweet
spot in terms of picture quality for the
money not quite as good of a picture as
my very favorite TV I'll tease that you
know that's gonna be talked about a
little bit later but this one is
insanely inexpensive let me tell you for
the 43 inch
it's $310 right now the 65 is is 630
that's the 65 inch you see there on our
video that's when I reviewed and it goes
all the way up to 75 inches so this
series has full array local dimming
which is the feature in an LCD TV that
really improves the image quality it's
the thing where you know the the behind
the screen there's these LEDs they can
turn on and off depending on the
brighter or dimmer parts of the picture
and it is a truly a big improvement in
image quality to have on these TVs and
this is basically the cheapest TV on the
market with that feature busy does a
really good job of making that work
really well this TV is also compatible
with 4k HDR Dolby vision all that stuff
for again a TV that starts at $310 so
the Vizio e-series actually the the big
sale started today coincidentally enough
all around just look at Best Buy their
prices are live right now for these
prices there's good as they're gonna get
for the buying season so you know again
if you're looking you know you're a home
theater guy you really want that picture
quality to be as good as it can be for
you know very little money start with
the Vizio e-series okay now let's proved
cheapskate approved with prices like
that I thought I was hearing it wrong
it's like how much
alright so odds a Dan let's go to you
for a tablet now uh you know rightly
related to the notebook category a lot
of folks are saying maybe it's time now
that I move from a notebook to a tablet
and try and make it do what the tablet
or what the notebook has always done our
we there or are they still two separate
categories as you would advise a shopper
easy answer they are two separate
categories still occasionally people
come around and say Oh a tablet that's
just as good as a laptop it's the same
thing they're really not appellee if it
has this commercial with a little girl
working on her her iPad and somebody
comes by and goes oh what computer is
that and she says what's the computer
which fine but that being said sometimes
you still want a tablet they're great
for watching movies they're great for
reading ebooks or
comic books even there's a lot of things
you could do with the tablet the basic
iPad the new 2018 version of that is
frankly the best all-around deal in this
category because it does almost
everything fancier things like the iPad
pro do but it cost a heck of a lot less
than they've done just enough updates to
it
to make it really worthwhile I think
it's usually 329 I bet you'll be able to
find it for 250 or so around Black
Friday / holiday time at a whole bunch
of different stores and the big addition
this year is that it has added pen
support so the Apple pencil that
previously only worked with the iPad pro
now works with the regular plain old
nine point seven inch iPad which makes
it a much more functional machine and if
you want to do cool style of stuff and
drawing and sketching you're all hooked
up now okay so straight up iPad is a
winner and with that pencil technology
feels more modern than your just buying
another tablet it's not just another
iPad because those last for a long time
and you go what am i yeah upgrade for
the proper reason yep sounds good well
let's jump into some of our viewer
questions on CNET live hashtag and also
on the phones we have a lot of people
calling in which is fantastic thank you
so much don't forget to tweet us
CNET live and give us a call at eight
eight eight nine hundred CNET let's
cross to our first question now from
Joseph from Ohio has a question for us
about the Apple iMac hello Joseph
welcome to CNET live viewer on the air
what's your question yeah hello how are
you guys today I'm doing the great thank
you so what did you want to ask us about
the iMac you had a very specific
question
I do would you recommend a process to
buy an iMac even the the iMac has been
updated this year in 2018
that's a great question let's throw that
once again I think that's a good
question Apple tends to follow their own
schedule in terms of updating products
the IMAX that's the all-in-one desktop
computer with the big screen has not
gotten a processor upgrade this year but
they did last year so it's not really
that far out of date if you want to do
basic you know web surfing email watch
movies not really playing games that's
not really a marketing but you know
basic Photoshop and things like that
it's still find a sentence Jen Intel
processors in there now are perfectly
are perfectly good will they update it
next year probably will it be a
generation behind in processors by then
probably if you want to go absolutely
bonkers
there's something called the iMac Pro
which is you can tell the difference
because it's in a darker space gray and
cost like $5,000 and that's the super
fancy version of the iMac from last
December so that is very up to date it's
got a different class of processor in it
so if you're a super professional who is
doing like you know 4k video editing and
like professional professional level
stuff like that you could get an iMac
Pro but basic one I think they're fine
they're not that out of date aren't
processors so so brawny now Dan that
unless you're really flexing them you're
in good shape
entirely correct and almost all of the
advances in the last several years have
really been more in battery life and
efficiency than than raw power which
again you don't really need because
almost anything you do can also do on a
Chromebook which is basically just a web
browser sounds good well I hope that
answer your question Joe so thank you so
much for calling and you go in the
running to win all of those amazing
prizes make sure win enter the giveaway
to win that HP laptop - thanks for
calling thank you so much all right
thank you so much that was Joseph
calling there and another switch to the
C net live hashtag we've got so many
questions coming in let's take a look at
a couple of them now let's take a look
at this one from Thomas what is the best
TV for under $400 with the best quality
picture preferably good for gaming cats
this one screams you all over
what do you think that's a lot of I
gotta say that TV that I just talked
about the 43 inch of Vizio e-series
would be the one that I choose you know
again it's right in that price range
oh it's $310 so look you save 90 bucks
or you can step up to the 55 inch for
430 now gaming is one of these things
where what you care about is input lag
so that's the you know between the
controller and the the screen you know
reacting to that there's lag built into
all TVs that they have fancy processing
all the stuff it increases it a lot of
guys have game mode now the game mode on
the video that test was about 25
milliseconds which is really really
short great input lag and of course the
set looks really good with the full
array local dimming so I'd go for the
Vizio e-series 43 inch and save a bundle
there 310 bucks so cats it sounds like
one thing you want to do with whatever
TV you buy is to find out if it does
have a game mode that will basically
take out a lot of the processing and
make it a little more of a straight shot
from your console to the display yeah
and and a lot of the you know the TVs
now if they're a little more expensive
they have really good game modes in
there because they have a lot more
processing but the cheap TVs like this
Vizio they don't have too much
processing begin with so you know again
they're not gonna let it build in that
much input lag but all the manufacturers
now are putting in game modes even with
4k HDR there's a whole different set of
processing to bypass when you before Kay
gaming so you know that's actually one
of the newer advances in TVs and keep an
eye on it cuz we test it here see it
sounds good should we take one more yeah
let's do it let's do one more cool sue
from Minnesota has a great question
about the iPhones hi sue you are on the
air welcome to Cena
hi hey I read the review on Instagram
about the iPhone XR and wondering if
that's still the best the best phone for
an iPhone to get and then the second
part of that is how do you figure out
what the best network is oh this is a
great question sue let's I guess let's
tackle the first part of that so the 10r
obviously is not quite the most
expensive iphone that you can get that
is the 10s and the 10s max and when it
comes to performance let's chat a little
bit about how it
feels to use dan I want you to sort of
chime in here with your thoughts too on
the 10r versus the 10s what are your
thoughts on kind of like how it feels to
use both of the phones is there one that
kind of suits better use case more than
the other
yeah these the 10 are or a lot of people
call the XR and I'm not gonna correct
him because you know wisdom of crowds
and all that I feel like it's 90% as
good as the full price 10s but it's less
than 90% of the price so that makes a
lot of sense to me it's got the design
that looks like the other ones just the
screen is not an OLED screen there we go
LCDs not know it but the ultimate
mainstream mainstream ability test of
the 10r is that my mother just ordered
one and she is is is very thrifty but
likes good technology and and it's very
cautious about what she buys so the fact
that she called me up and said I'm about
to hit by on a 10 are you know just
making sure that's that's the right move
and she had already decided that shows
you that's the mainstream phone to get
this year that's the value played that
you're not gonna be disappointed with
totally agree and Sue another thing to
remember is that the ten are and the 10s
actually share the same rear camera at
least the wide-angle lens so the photo
and video quality is gonna be pretty
much exactly the same so you're getting
a really good camera for a lot less as
Dan said but I the question about the
cellular connectivity is really
interesting because I guess it really
depends on where you live the big
question about where you are in the US
depends on you know what network is
gonna suit your needs right yeah yeah
the other thing that's hard about that
sue is there are some things going on
that are that are very hard for us to
put into a review because they're
localized and they're not even that
obvious for us to unearth different
carriers or the same carrier will use
different radio waves in different metro
areas based on what they've license from
the government so they aren't is they
aren't like on the same FM frequency in
every city if you want to put it that
way they use different frequencies in
different cities and they also have
different levels of coverage coverage
matters to speed it's not just whether
you have data or not a better coverage
means you it will have more robust
connectivity and that will allow greater
bandwidth and that's what you're looking
for in speed so start with a coverage
map you can look at the coverage map of
any major carrier go to their site just
Google like Sprint or t-mobile or
Verizon coverage map start with good
coverage first
coverage is your ground support for
getting good speed although it doesn't
exactly tell you that and then beyond
that the most important things to talk
to people who hopefully you know in your
area who've all got each different
carrier hopefully all on a modern phone
because phones can slow you down and
then say hey who's the great result in
the one that swears the least for me has
the best speed with its wireless
wireless is always wanting in the real
world 5g is looking to address that but
you know I mean Verizon gets a lot of
kudos for its speed that's that that's
an old saw from way back but it's one
that I've earned over the years I got to
say in my experience okay
well they're getting a lot of press
these days with everybody I've talked to
it so I'm just wondering if that's
really true but t-mobile is also doing
some Oh some really aggressive stuff
with speed on their network as well so
there are another good choice that a lot
of folks often didn't think of because
they are sort of you know in the second
tier below Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T but a lot of
good stuff coming out to mobile and of
course AT&amp;amp;T has always had a good
network so it's very local
so ask people you know and look for good
coverage on those maps yeah and any any
point on the 5g network that's supposed
to be coming out nothing to worry about
you need to wait for your and current
phone you're gonna buy to get tired and
in about 18 months or two years then 5g
will be really well debugged and out
there there are no 5g phones on the
market yet I don't think we'll see any
to mid next year because the speck upon
which they would design them internally
isn't even approved yet that's expected
in June of next year then the factories
can start making them this is a 20/20
story so you're good on a 4G phone for
now thank you thanks all right thank you
we got going on here good good calls and
thanks for getting on the Twitter with
the questions that Twitter listen to me
like I just got the Twitter like I'm a
millennial but Twitter okay let's talk
about headphones now you know headphones
are a perennial group pretty low gift
for a lot of people around the head of
the holiday season because they come in
a lot of different price points and
everybody uses them at this point in
history right so let's let's hear now
from the guy with the Golden Ears first
of all about about what the best things
are to think about sound wise here
David Carr Noi has has got to look here
for some of the best headphones he's our
guy who knows about listening like
nobody else I'm David Carr for cnet.com
and I've got a cute top holiday
headphone picks for you let's start with
the popular premium noise cancelling
category or in the past Bose has
dominated but this year I give the
Editors Choice Award to the Sony Joh
1000 X mark 3 Sony tweaked the design of
the mark 3 and it's now right there with
the Bose in terms of comfort it delivers
excellent sound and noise canceling is
loaded with features and has strong
battery life it's only downside is that
well it's expensive at $350 Bose
QuietComfort 35 - remains a good choice
in this category but the Sony is just a
little bit better right now my second
pick is the Jabra elite active 65 t
their set of truly wireless earphones to
compete with Apple's air pods not only
do they fit some people's ears more
securely than the air pods but they also
sound better because they have a noise
isolating design that doesn't let sound
leak in like the air pods open design
does I'm also a fan of Plantronics do in
your noise-cancelling neck band style
headphone the backbeat go 410 they're
little like boses quiet control 30
headphones but cost a lot less and can
plug into in-flight entertainment
systems with a headphone cord that
connects to its USB charging port
they're a good everyday headphone that
features good sound and good noise
cancelling moving on to my budget pick
the trivet X free tune it may not be as
comfortable as a bose or sony headphone
but you'd be hard-pressed to find a
better sounding or better built
full-size of bluetooth headphone for $50
as far as sound goes it really does
measure up to headphones that cost a lot
more if none of those models sounds
enticing I've got plenty of others to
choose from in our full gift guide these
days there's no shortage of headphones
and we'll be covering all the best ones
here at CNET thanks for watching
always trust carnally on headphone
results this guy is so thoughtful and so
careful about headphone which is great
because they're so subjective you need
someone who really puts a lot of
it has a lot of breadth of experience
with them and karna is great at that
now let's find you some deals now Rick
headphones come in a wide range of
prices from deep into the hundreds to
like 50 cents those one lines ones they
get free on the airline's they obviously
are making those for like 10 cents and
they can afford to give them away what
do you got for some deals hopefully
somewhere between those two poles this
is an in-ear noise-isolating headphones
earphones should say from one more and
it's called the quad driver and as
everybody knows quad means four and four
is better than three or two or one so
you got four drivers inside this little
thing and this is a THX certified
product so if you really love your ears
like you want to treat your ears this is
the thing to get these normally run
$1.99 but as an exclusive for everybody
who's watching today we have these at
129 and that is I think the lowest price
I've seen on this product and you know
as I said if you if you want to splurge
a little bit and get something that's
that's really special I like these a lot
that's good to know I mean I gotta tell
you I've always been underwhelmed by ear
buds you know I'm looking for I'll see
phrases about you know deep bass
response and they rave about how rich
and robust the sound is and they just
never strike me that way they always
sound thin but of course I use a lot of
over the ear headphones so I'm I'm
setting a high bar so I'd be curious I
meant to try a pair of these sounds like
they've got some some multi driver
technology that might really make them
deliver some real breadth and depth of
sound versus being kind of like a you
know a better version of a cell phone
call earbud all right thank you for that
I know it is four four is better for is
better than three and better than better
than one I like that how we learned that
that was good car no I just mentioned of
course so you can find all of our CNET

updates there again just search see net
holiday gift guide or go to
cnet-dot-com-slash-loaded gift guide but
now let's get right back to taking some
calls and some tweets Lexi you got to
you got so many people on the line
waiting so thank you so much for your
patience we'll try and get to as many as
we can
let's cross though to Chadwick from
Kansas City who has a question about the
new iPad pro hello Chadwick hey guys
how's it going
live really good what's your question so
you were talking about the iPad but
apples now touting the new iPad pro and
I was just trying to figure out is it
really worth the extra money to go to
the pro or was 2018 version you were
recently talking about just as good to
go with great question let's throw this
one to Dan in New York I mean they're
for different people they call it the
pro because they're there saying oh
professional artists and professional
designers are gonna like this I mean
frankly they did a really nice job
redesigning the iPad pro this year
because they've gotten rid of the the
home button it's now all screen almost
like an iPhone 10 so it's really
arresting looking and I like that a lot
and obviously the screen is great and
it's more powerful but unless you're
doing the types of things that really
require that extra power that extra
screen X resolution the access to
high-end accessories like the really
expensive keyboard you can get with it I
still think that a regular 9.7 inch
everyday iPad that again is going to be
about two hundred and fifty dollars from
a lot of places this holiday season is a
better overall product for more people
especially because if you just had
stylus envy you can use the Apple pencil
with it now so it still gets my vote
that said the new pro is pretty
sweet-looking
I hope that helps you make you a
decision a little bit more easily
chadwick thank you so much for calling
so much and you go in the running to win
all of those amazing prizes so let's
grab another call now I think we'll
switch to Melissa from Miami so she is
calling in and asking is there a
headphone
hello Melissa come in your unseen it
live can you hear me hello Melissa
she's in a snowstorm hi hello hi hi
you're on CNET live you live on the air
what's your question hi I have a
question regarding the headphones you
guys were talking about is there a
preference functionality-wise and maybe
comfort wise for a runner for someone
who who runs marathons and who's
training for one that's a great question
I think the big thing I found when I am
using headphones or earbuds for running
I mean it depends are we talking
headphones do you want that over a fill
you want the earbuds obviously for me
earbuds are much more preference than
running I mean I guess great yeah so I
mean with the thing is with earbuds is
that it's really a question of the fit
and how much of the sound isolation that
you want to get in or out so say for
example if you're running with something
that's an in-ear earbud and it's
isolating all of the sound it's probably
not the best idea even though the music
will sound amazing if you're not really
hearing a lot of the external sound
especially when you're running if you
think about things like safety obviously
I like to have a little bit more of an
open design I find sort of say ones from
Bose like the sound sport Wireless are
quite good on that respect but then
again if you want more of an isolation
sound you might want to go for something
like the Bates X record about those
headphones have you tried those out for
running or anything and found that they
kind of had in it what's the sort of
sound isolation like that yeah I
actually don't care for a sound
isolating earbud when I'm running
because I find that I hear my footfalls
like bum bum bum as I'm running and I
don't care for that I was gonna mention
the aftershocks I don't know if you've
tried those at all there's the
aftershocks Trek's in the aftershocks
air and that is of course aftershocks
with the less common zi spelling and not
an S so those have exactly what you're
talking about they're bone conduction
and so they kind of rest right here and
you can hear ambient noise as you're
running but you also get a really good
sound and they're not cheap and they
rarely go on sale but that's what I like
to run with I hope that helps answer
your question a little bit Melissa and
good luck with the marathon
thanks okay so uh let me reveal some of
my picks for the person who's into
giving gifts to the driver whether it's
a driver who loves driving as a you know
a sport as a as a passion or the person
who spends a lot of time in their car
just cuz they got a long damn commute
first off I don't think you can go wrong
this year with a dash cam in fact one of
the gifts that we have in our giveaway
the stack that we're seeing there behind
us is going to include some van true
dash cams you see one there in the red
box that sort of hexagonal tube looking
thing or here it is here in the box van
true makes some really interesting dash
cams the latest one which is one of
those were giving away which is called
the on dash T 2 includes microwave
sensor technology so when the car is
parked the camera is looking out to find
motion it's a motion detector through
glass and it'll start recording when
some rat-bastard comes up to vandalize
your car so that's pretty cool
it doesn't just wait for a bump or a
collision which a lot of dash cams do
another one I want to show you here on
my monitor is from Pioneer and it's
called the nd DVR 100 this one is pretty
basic it records in HD and it stamps the
clips with GPS coordinates so you know
where it was recorded not all dash cams
do that it's about a hundred and eight
bucks good price what I like about it is
it's a name-brand pioneer even though
they're close to bankruptcy right now
but they're still a name-brand and it
integrates nicely in your windshield as
you can see if you look at the design of
that it doesn't just hang down on some
nasty suction cup it adheres to the
glass kind of like a factory forward
camera this is a very slick solution for
the person who doesn't want a lot of
dreck in their car now if you move away
from dash cams again they're very
affordable
everyone's gonna use them that's my home
run the other way to go is to look at
giving someone a new car stereo or as we
call them today a head unit there's one
from Sony that is their newest one it's
called the XA VA X 1000 it is carplay
all the usual media choices no CD of
course and this one is only three
hundred dollars list I'm seeing it for
about 250 or so Street if you want it to
have carplay and android auto you go to
one called the ax a VA X 200 and that
one has both platforms and it lists at
$500 again you'll find better Street
prices or if you want to go check out
something from Pioneer they are 1300
eniac
his carplay only I bring up pioneer cuz
Sony and my experience has had some
buggy issues with phones staying
connected to the head unit that I think
is still frustrating although the latest
unit should have worked that out and if
you want on pioneer that has both
carplay and android auto apple on
android in other words you go to the
2300 NEX list on that only three $319
that might be the odds-on winner right
there that's an amazon price i should
say but still it's a really good price
all of these fit into what's called a
double den unit which is a very standard
kind of a tall car stereo know that they
require installation and that's gonna be
some additional cost or some elbow
grease if you or your recipient knows
how to do it but that will utterly
modernize an older car sounds good and
i'll reveal what i am recommending very
very shortly but before then Rick do you
have any more deals to share with us oh
you know I do let's talk about home
security canary makes a really cool home
security camera called the all-in-one
and so more than just the usual video
feed and motion detection this thing it
also has an air quality sensor and a
temperature sensor and a siren so it
will actually function as an alarm so
it's pretty cool and you can get the
canary all in one and a year of
monitoring service so it really is kind
of the whole the whole deal the whole
suite home security deal for 149 now
normally that bundle would run you 268
bucks so this is a really great
exclusive sounds good and now I know
that you're asked this all of the time
but let's be honest like is now the time
that we should be buying or can we get
these deals like any other time of the
year like should we be panicking going
the only time I can grab a great deal is
now through Black Friday Cyber Monday
into the rest of the holiday season or
you know when else should I be looking
oh you know I always tell people
everyday is Black Friday there are deals
to be had all year round there are some
pretty good pretty special deals
available this time of year but if you
miss out don't panic you will find
similar maybe not as good but similar
deals all year round and of course at
Cena comm slash cheapskate I give you
those deals every single day of the year
sounds good and I believe that you
have a couple of extra shopping tips now
for us I do you know I know a guy who
knows all the things about saving money
Black Friday Cyber Monday and all the
rest of the year so take it away that
guy hi everyone Rick the cheapskate
broidy here to talk about everyone's
favorite holiday
no not Arbor Day I'm talking about Black
Friday that's the day when all the
stores have the best sales of the year
and don't forget Cyber Monday the other
day when all the stores have the best
sales of the year
with prices already cut to the bone you
can't possibly save even more money
can you well you can and I'm here to
tell you how when you buy something on
Black Friday Cyber Monday or pretty much
any other day of the year
always loop in a cash back service like
Ebates be frugal or top cashback these
sites offer cash rebates at thousands of
stores and you get those savings even if
you're already using a cash back credit
card it doesn't matter if you're buying
an item that's on sale for the lowest
price ever you'll save a percentage of
the final purchase price it might be 2%
5% or even more but the more you shop
the more it adds up it's easy to get
swept up in all the Black Friday Cyber
Monday hype because stores promised the
best deals of the year but are they
really you can find out by installing
honey a free browser plug-in that can
show you product price histories at
stores like Amazon Best Buy Target and
Walmart better still honey can
automatically locate coupon codes for
thousands of stores meaning you might be
able to get an even better deal than you
thought there's another browser add-on
that I recommend and it's called price
blink like honey it can find coupon
codes for you while you shop but it will
also compare prices at other stores so
if you're shopping for say a SmartWatch
at Amazon price blink will alert you if
that same product is available for Less
elsewhere
price blink and honey also have wishlist
features meaning if Black Friday and
Cyber Monday aren't producing the price
you want you can set up an alert and
they'll notify you if and when a price
drop occurs
so there you go fellow cheapskates the
tools you need to save even more money
during these major shopping holidays
seem smart I'm just gonna say that hey
you know here's a tool I need to be
better during the holidays and that is
trust in all these different platforms
you use them all you mentioned a couple
there Ebates you mentioned price blink
honey a couple others how do these
sights first of all why and how do they
do what they do I'm not a big believer
in commercial altruism are they are they
getting kickbacks from retailers or
manufacturers are they selling my data
to the Russians what are they doing Oh
mention Russians come Commander broadsky
so these sites make money basically by
directing you to where you're going to
shop so a cash back site you start at
the cash back site you click through to
Target or whatever the store is that
site gets a little bit of a kind of
referral commission for sending you
there and they kind of share that
commission with you and so that's how
they make money that's how they're able
to pass along these rebate savings to
you that's the high-level overview of it
I've used them for years successfully I
don't get a lot of spam in my inbox I
really think that if you want to save
extra money cashback service is
absolutely a must it's it's found money
it's free money so I don't I don't have
any privacy concerns or data concerns or
spam concerns anything like that you
have my blessing any more than being on
the internet right okay let's get down
to some more questions and and tweets
Lexi what do you got queued up we got so
many questions you can give us a call on
eight hundred nine nine nine
oh sorry nine hundred seen it eight
eight eight nine hundred seen it and we
are gonna go to Alan from Texas now Alan
thanks for hanging on the line you were
on CNET live you had a question about
fines I do thank you for taking my call
I want to know I've got an Apple iPhone
7 and I've got about a year paid off on
it am I better off trading it in and
getting an upgraded model but now
carrying more payments or just letting
this phone go out for about three and a
half years and then starting over at
that one that's a great question I think
a lot of people are in a very
similar predicament to you and when it
comes to phone upgrades it sounds like
you you know you have a couple of years
left and how how is the seven treating
you is it is it you are you feeling like
you want an upgrade because the seven is
still a pretty proficient phone in many
in many respects especially if you
upgrade to iOS 12 and you put all of
those benefits there on so unless you
want the you know the benefits of faster
processor or a slightly better camera
maybe it's not quite the time to upgrade
for you but I don't know how is it
feeling for you Oh phone's operating
great it's fine and that's not my
question my quandary is if the phone
wasn't going well and it'd be a
no-brainer to go ahead and switch but I
think it's so I'm great what you don't
know is what it's gonna do tomorrow
right right that's a good point I mean
the thing is though I mean we we
obviously get really caught up in the
latest and greatest and it's really easy
to do that I feel like if the phone is
still performing exactly as you want it
to and you've got you know the latest
operating system you're keeping it
up-to-date and then maybe it's not quite
worth updating I don't know coolly do
you have you do you have Apple care on
that phone I do yes so it doesn't matter
you know in many respects what is coming
up in the future in terms of a lot of
things that are covered you're covered
you're already paying that in there so
it's already part of your expense of
having the phone I'm big on letting the
phones go longer in the tooth you know
the trend used to be a lot of people
used to change a phone every 19 months a
few years ago now it's extended out to I
think 32 months is the average ownership
of a given phone by most of us that's in
the u.s. I think so we've all gotten the
idea that you know what the phones are
only incrementally better as they move
forward you know they have some amazing
new features they have a notch that does
this or that or they have the cameras
are getting better but we haven't gotten
to that point now where we've had a
major breakthrough that says I've got to
get off this 7 I'd sit on it for a while
until there's a foldable phone from
Apple then maybe you got a couple years
at 7 Allen thank you so much thank you
all right let's go to a question that I
think is tailor-made for Dan in New York
this one is coming in from John in
California hi John welcome to say it
life
you're only Airin seen it live 10 Daniel
volumen you had a question about laptops
for us we'll come back to you we'll come
back to you John alright let's jump to
another one we had of Jim in Michigan as
well representing Michigan today we have
a budget laptop question from you Jim
yes I'm just looking for a
recommendation for a budget laptop that
has a solid-state combination of a low
price and a solid-state drive I think a
lot of the nicer Chromebooks out there
are probably a good choice especially
for a kid I like the Samsung Chromebook
plus which is under 500 bucks has a nice
solid state hard drive and a touch
screen and a stylus and even runs
Android apps in addition to regular
chromebook stuff that's been my budget
go-to choice for a while now and what
are you looking for in terms of an
operating system in this new laptop or
you want you Mac Windows or are you open
to Chromebook and Android
either one yeah it's not he's not
blocked into anything ok that's
interesting so you've got a lot of
flexibility so the world is his oyster
right Dan I mean he can shop
aggressively on our list of the best
budget laptops which as you mentioned
starts with Chromebook Samsung
Chromebook pro at 550 yeah and you can
go into configurators on anyone's
website yeah and get it where you want
it ok all right so yes so go to our yeah
go to cnet.com look at best laptops the
easy to find right in our navigation
there on the site and then you can look
at the budget tab and we always filter
the best budget laptops right there and
that is constantly updated as well great
thank you for calling Jim and just
quickly let's jump to seeing it live the
hashtag on Twitter if you can take a
look at some of the tweets that are
coming up we have we have something on
any deals on the 70 plus inch OLED
screens this season that is from Matt on
Twitter how about that cats 70 plus
inches Oh LEDs what does Matt consider 7
does Matt consider 7 grand a deal do you
consider 7 grand the deal I don't know
no right now we're rec
you know 75 inch TV from Vizio that's
you know around 2 grand so you know if
you're gonna go oled you're gonna pay
whatever that is you know two and a half
times as much unfortunately
LG has not gained to make their 77 inch
size affordable in least and then it
really need to because they're kind of
in a class by themselves so I think for
the foreseeable future it's gonna be you
know two or three times more expensive
than a similar LCD TV that performs
really really well like this Vizio P
series that I like a lot at 75 inches
all right cats let's stay on this vein
now and go from some of the largest and
with the priciest some of the best
technology bring me down now to a value
set that has a really good price and
good features especially around OTT and
streaming what do you got there cuz
that's kind of the sweet spot I want a
good price I want good streaming built
in and I also want it to be a decent
size maybe you've got a brand that isn't
household name mm let me let me think
Brian screaming really good price yeah
quality maybe not the name you might
have heard of but maybe one of the one
of the biggest fastest growing names in
fact longtime best selling Amazon brand
is TCL so this is the Roku TV that we've
been recommending for a long time but
this year TCL really hit it out of the
ballpark with their 65 inch 65 our six
one seven Roku TV there's also a Best
Buy version it's actually even less
expensive that thing is nine hundred
bucks right now at Best Buy or 65 inch
TV and let me tell you for that money
picture quality is amazing so this has
that full array local dimming I talked
about earlier with the Vizio e-series
this thing's even brighter the picture
quality is just it's really really
really really good you're gonna be it's
impossible to spend less money on a 65
inch TV than 900 and get a picture
anywhere near this good there's plenty
of TVs that are in that same ballpark
that cost a lot more from other brands
including Vizio and you know Samsung and
LG the usual suspects but if you're you
know really want to spend as little
money as possible for an excellent
picture you know in side-by-side
comparisons this thing really knocked it
knocked knocked out of the park so the
other thing as Brian alluded to is
streaming so you can always buy a 4k HDR
streamer hook it up to any TV get really
good
performance from that but Roku is my
favorite streaming system and this TV
has Roku built-in so it's very very
simple to immediately just pick up this
simplified remote and start streaming 4k
HD our Netflix Vudu all the the great
streaming services are right there and
it's super simple Roku TV puts you know
your inputs your game consoles or your
cable box right on the same level they
almost treat him like an app on the home
screen they were the first to really do
that so it's a very simplified easy to
use experience in a very powerful TV
that does you know again
superb picture that also comes a 55 inch
or 600 bucks but really I love that 65
inch size when you're when you're yeah I
love the Roku integration Roku has been
our favorite since the dawn of OTT
platforms I mean it's just been always
the best realized about as well as
anyone is gonna do in breadth of content
easy to use remote I'm so glad to see it
a TV that you like
lexy let's go from the biggest screens
that we're talking about the smallest
screens smartwatches you've got some
pics in there I do sir we often get
caught up in talking about the latest
and greatest which is totally fine but
for many of us it's not quite within our
reach so I wanted to talk about some of
the fitness trackers so obviously Apple
has the Apple watch series 4 which is
the latest one that's come out just a
couple months ago this year but I want
to recommend the Apple watch series 3 it
is last year's model now you're not
actually losing out that much in terms
of the features and the specifications
especially once you put watch OS 5.1 on
there now they watch three versus the
four it's a slightly smaller screen in
terms of like you get less of the actual
content on the screen itself you don't
get things like the fall detection and
obviously the EKG sensor which hasn't
even been activated yet on the series 4
but everything else you're getting
pretty much on par you're getting the
same roughly the same amount of battery
life unless you're doing epics six hour
hikes in which the series fall will be
your go-to and you're getting all of the
same kind of functionality that you
would expect thanks to watch OS 5 so I
think that one is a pretty no-brainer
when it comes to the Apple watch if you
are wanting one with GPS and LTE
connectivity which was the series 3 what
should the one that set it apart from
all of the previous Apple watches so I
think if you want LTE and GPS and you're
not ready to spend five
hundred dollars on the Apple watch
series four then the series three is the
one to look at and speaking of fitness
trackers an alternative to the Apple
watch if you are a platform agnostic and
you want to switch between iOS and
Android or if you are just on Android
you can consider something like the
Fitbit Versa and this is the one to get
if you want all of that battery life so
you get about four days of continuous
use out of this and what I really like
about the Fitbit is its extra fitness
features say if you want to do some sort
of fitness tracking and then also have
personalized workout so you can actually
use the coach app and it gives you
step-by-step a lot of those workouts
that you need to do so it says like do
five jumping jacks and then do five
planks I mean it's torturous to say that
on your wrist and not having a personal
trainer shout it in your ear but I think
it's quite nice to actually to have it
there as you can see now on the screen
you can have things it indicates all
sorts of little videos and tells you how
to do things so I like that about the
Versa and of course four days of battery
life you just cannot beat that under
$200 under $200 now and there are more
Black Friday deals coming out so that's
the one to look out that's such a smart
insiders pick because a lot of folks
look at smart watches and they get a
little bit put off by the price
especially since they're still kind of
forming their role in a lot of people's
lives still a little bit of a niche but
that one is a much safer pick unless you
absolutely can see why you're buying an
Apple watch like Lexy mentioned is that
one hits to the home run of fitness a
lot better or really well for its price
I should say let's go back to Ackerman
here for another talk about what's going
on with some laptop picks we did touch
on the new MacBook Air that's how we
kick things off you're just joining us
now on the show we said what's our best
laptop to go to everyone seems to have a
MacBook these days and he goes with the
new air which has needed a lot of
improvements and got them what else you
got that you like out there Dan well if
you want something that's kind of the
size and shape and general character of
a MacBook Air which is really the most
useful overall laptop size for carrying
around but working all day to death but
either you don't want to spend as much
as the new air cost that's 1199 to start
and it goes up from there or you're just
you just don't want a Mac you're you're
one of those anti Apple people or you
need some specific Windows software
there are many reasons my my current fee
alternative to that is another new
laptop and that is this guy right here
that is the Microsoft Surface laptop -
now the first generation of this surface
laptop which unlike other surface
products is not a tablet of any sort
it's just a plain old laptop I thought
was ok it was a good first step the
second generation one is even nicer it's
got a 13.5 inch screen it's got current
8th gen quad-core processors versus only
do core in the in the new MacBook Air so
this is actually gonna be faster and it
just kind of looks cool it's got a nice
clean look and they even managed to fit
in a good old fashioned USB a port
you're not stuck with the USB C on this
although you don't have any USB C so you
really have to pick your poison there
the nice thing is this guy starts at 999
which is what the old MacBook Air used
to start at and apparently Microsoft's
store they have a store the Microsoft
Store is going to have $300 off on some
configurations of this maybe not the
cheapest one on or around Black Friday
we know the number but we don't know
exactly which configurations are gonna
have that deal but that's a nice chunk
off and something that just came out
like last month
yeah nice machine really nice machine
there they've really started to focus
and hone on getting into the real market
and staying with it you know what do you
tell people who go to the mall if they
still go to the mall and they walk by
the Apple Store and it's like packed and
then they walked down to the Microsoft
Store that might be in the same mall and
you can fire cannonballs and not hit
anybody should that put anybody offer is
that just a difference in retail
presence I want to go find the mall that
has the Apple Store and the Microsoft so
I've got one right out here and I think
there's a good YouTube video in there
somewhere we're gonna see what happens
they're not really the store business
you're like showcase stores yeah a few
of them it took them forever to get one
in New York now they finally have one
and it's actually kind of nice and they
sell a lot of other stuff too they
sometimes have good prices on stuff but
you can usually get the same prices
online I think they do more they service
more online in the Microsoft yeah I do
in the store okay and I want to mention
to people you know I am for years now
I've been running Windows on on a
MacBook Air with boot camp which I'm
always surprised how few people I run
into who do that whenever I have my
machine at a conference or something and
people say why you're running
windows on there is that parallel Sugano
it's boot camp it comes with Mac OS and
I've never met anyone else who's doing
it
you good there's two of us were the two
boot campers okay there's three all
right well there's I I should I should
mingle and hire a higher socio-economic
strata and I'd meet more people who do
this but the thing is it's a really good
rate of run Windows not just a kludgy
rate way to run Windows which it is not
at all I want to tell folks that so if
they're trying to you know struggle
between these two camps you can have it
all on Mac hardware it runs Windows
exceedingly well in fact I think I get a
little bit better battery life running
Windows on a Mac then running it in Mac
OS much of course it retains okay thanks
guys good thoughts there on what's going
on with some of the of the laptop takes
a lot going in there if you have
questions for our panel and we start a
little bit of time in the show here
triple-eight 900 seen at triple eight
nine hundred two six three eight or
Lexi's watching Twitter where our tag is
seen that live hit us with that hash
tagging will see your question come in
before though we get to any more
questions Bridget Carey has taken a dive
into this year's tech toys and I mean a
dive she turned herself into an elf and
got to work take a look if you dare hey
folks what's up
bridgie the elf here senior toymaker at
Santa's workshop so here you want the
inside scoop on what toys are gonna be
hot this year well let me tell you all
the high-tech stuff sure is changing the
game for us toy makers it's making
things way more complicated I mean
everything now is packed with motion and
touch sensors some even answer to voice
commands just check out Zoomer the
playful pup
roll over
there you go good boy good boy do you
have to go pee
and then there's for real Ricky the
trick will open pub now as his name
suggests he does do tricks get it you
can feed him
and he poops out the treats
you know robots maybe getting more
advanced but trust me a pooping toy
never goes out of style
now I'm sure you've heard of Hatcher
moles well these mystery toys are still
hot and the new ones are these babies
you have to help hatch out of their eggs
to find out the gender is it a boy is it
a girl it's a it's it's a more
complicated Furby and I do mean
complicated just look at this list of
things you have to study to know how to
raise a little furball now if you want a
real dinosaur to train check out this
clever girl alpha training blue she's
got everything a kid wants to pretend
they are a jurassic world velociraptor
trainer because you have to do certain
combo moves with the motion sensor
clicker to level up your relationship
and you can control it like a puppet
oh I'm sorry do you want something
bigger
hopefully we can go bigger hey bring in
scout this is the first kid tracks right
Emal's
it's a country loving pony named Scout
it's like a Power Wheels Jeep merged
with a Disney animatronic robot this 70
pound pony has fully motorized eyes ears
and head and of course wheels on the
feet to ride it around there are 100
sounds of movements there's a
rechargeable 12-volt battery and there
are two forward speeds one backward
speed and it can go up to 4 miles an
hour Scout is smart to know when you
feed it treats and when you brush its
hair now that's how tech puts a new spin
on playtime I better clean this stuff up
before Santa gets back excuse me
Wow there is something so wrong with
tech toys I'm just putting it out there
okay wow that's those are disturbing the
one that proves and the other one that
pees I got one that does that
it's called Charlie's a cat so if you
want to have a real go get an animal
don't go with batteries and a remote
control good grief Oh cats it was
unsettling it reminds me of those toys
from the 80s remember when they had the
actual babies but no babies that you
would feed and then they would yeah the
egg is wrong yeah it's real wrong Wow
okay all right well let's get back to
some calls and tweets Bridget we got so
many questions coming in thank you to
everyone who's cold and tweeted in let's
jump to Kevin in Michigan who has a
question for the this acquittance is a
computer for $99 Kevin what is this all
about well yeah I just won the Walmart
$99 laptop for Black Friday is that good
for ten-year-old let's see I'm gonna
have to look and see what that is does
anybody have gonna pull it up now here
yeah so am i $99 laptop that's right
okay right actually useful info Rick are
you aware of this machine $100 laptop
Walmart huh I'm gonna go ahead and say
that anything for a ten-year-old is
gonna be fine hang on beaches got it
pulled up we go on the main screen with
that again beach we can try and take a
look if we can a theme of this is ahead
I don't know if this is yesterday tablet
it's $100 this has to be the one smart
tab 10 to 10 inch two and one tablet
with keyboard so it's a convertible
for a hundred bucks I'm gonna try to
scroll down let's look for some specs
we're just doing this kind of by the
seat of our pants hear anything more
further down you don't see respects dad
go to the table go the top four aspects
tab anything there now all right so I'm
gonna make an executive decision here
and say no that's a that's a hard pass
now $99 for a Chromebook you could
probably get away with that'll feel okay
this thing any ten-year-old is going to
throw it is gonna I want to know she
likes play games now 100% no I wouldn't
pay 99 cents for that yeah Kindle yeah
yeah oh yeah that's a great idea
actually Amazon has these great fire
tablets that get down the 10 inch one
gets down to 99 bucks do you pay a
couple it's more and get the kids
version which actually is great comes
with a free subscription to a ton of
cool games and stuff my son is one of
those and he and he loves it a lot of
these door Busters the super cheap
computers do um tablets that you see for
blacks yeah I mean are not worth it you
may feel like you're saving a lot of
money but whatever you get you're just
gonna throw away in like a week a lot of
them are just awful
I found a refurbished Acer Chromebook
for $85 so that's that's per there's an
example a Chromebook fits in this and
get away with and they actually made for
a kid too because they can't mess it up
too much
that's a great way to go so Chromebook
really makes sense therefore what you're
looking at instead of $100 laptop when
you see too much for the price and then
it does everything it's a convertible
it's got this it's got that it's like
you got to realize what
had to cut corners on its durability and
with a kid that's the wrong place to cut
corners so look at a Chromebook or look
at the Amazon fire tablet line I think
you're gonna do a lot better than also
Chromebooks are being widely used in
schools now more so that's right pads
yeah they've taken over the education
market lately so you're gonna get double
duty there your child recipients gonna
say great I don't just play on this I
actually can use it for school great
question thank you so much for calling
Jim and now let's change tack and let's
head over to we have a question from
Josh in Tucson who has a TV that is on
the fritz hi Josh what's your question
yeah I have a vizio currently that the
screen is randomly started blacking out
on its I have to talk with their
customers for lights can see part
another video and so I'm looking at some
of the ones that Costco has specifically
the 70 inch LG and it gets real mixed
reviews on my knife here I see what you
guys have to say about it well we know
the man with the answers Katz what do
you think here yes already here at about
here about that you know I hear a lot
from people my ex you know brand TVs on
the fritz
you know I'll be honest with you I hear
it about you know LG and Samsung and you
know TCL as well Vizio is you know very
popular along with those other brands so
reliability is very similar on these
entry-level TVs you know if you if you
don't want to buy a vizio though my next
recommendation would be a TCL just
because they do have the best picture
quality for the money they got that
great Roku TV operating system I
mentioned 65-inch is generally where
they max out you want to go to 70 you
are looking at probably an LG or Samsung
and those guys you know again you're
gonna be paying a little bit more money
for them you know then you would for the
equivalent Vizio your picture quality's
not gonna be that much better but you
know if you already your Vizio already
die then you get that peace of mind of
that different brand so go for it
alright thanks so much for calling Josh
and best of luck with the new TV now
let's jump to seeing it live on twitter
the hashtag if you can just take my
screen we got a lot of questions coming
in so you don't have my screen all right
well I'll just reach I will just I will
just read them then so we have a
question from Ken
who says I'm looking for a tablet like
the sous zenpad s 3:10 the 9.7 inch I
want the memory
I want the fingerprint scanner I want
something around 9 to 10 inches but do I
need to wait for CES coming up what do
you what do you think I mean it's dad I
know this is a that's an interestingly
specific question where you see a lot of
new stuff and the Sioux's always has a
ton of new things to announce there they
usually don't come out right then it's
usually Oh take a look at them now and
then maybe in the spring maybe in the
summer you'll see them especially from a
manufacturer from a Seuss that's not
us-based you see things you know and
some things may be right away some
things may be in three months six months
they often don't know so if there's
something specific you're looking for
and you want to see if it's at CES
that's great and all but don't expect to
get it like mid-january as soon as the
show is over yeah good point a lot of
the stuff shows up later occasionally
this stuff will show up much later
and so CES isn't exactly retail
availability of a lot of these products
its announcement for weathervane for
what's coming up in 2019 exactly and
let's take a look again I've seen it
live so many questions coming in thank
you to everyone who has tweeted us a
question and of course cold to Joe says
what is the best deal on a dashcam any
of the high-end brands holding sales
good question the Pioneer that I showed
you earlier that one was a hundred and
eight dollars so not exactly the
cheapest out there you can find here's
the thing a lot of the dashcams out
there like if I just go to Amazon right
now and let me just search dashcam and
you're gonna see a whole bunch of them
come up here we go and now let's look at
our results and here's a whole slew of
these you're not gonna recognize almost
any of these brands even the van true
we've got here isn't exactly a household
name among big Cee makers it's a really
good dashcam the thing about these is
they're all universally very similar the
guts of them are not much different and
you're not risking a lot at 40 to 60
bucks is a sweet spot for a lot of these
dash cams I wouldn't feel terrible about
going with any of them I've tried a lot
of them and for the basic features which
is it will record a loop on as big an SD
card as you put in it
we'll record when it gets bumped it will
record when in the car is in standby
mode parked when it gets bumped and and
it's and it's HD those are kind of your
four things that make up a standard dash
cam they all do that so you're not gonna
go wrong I I think a lot of these are
actually pretty good for being decent
and then you get into the better ones
like the van truce the pioneers are some
connected ones that are hundreds of
dollars that use for g-cloud right now
to do their upload that's a different
market all right all year right yeah
yeah let's let's jump in we have a
caller from from Canada this is Daryl on
the line you have a question about
gaming hi Daryl what's your question
hello Daryl
yeah hi hi you had a question about
gaming consoles and subscription
services yeah so I've seen you guys do
some videos about classic consoles and
mentioning them as like not really being
arrival to the subscription services
that I offer classic games right so I'm
trying to figure out which of the
current consoles that I should get this
year for Christmas for myself and and I
was wondering does Nintendo has
something dies that is worth getting or
should I maybe go with Playstation or
Xbox for their servers and services good
question I actually it's true all the
subscription services but Dan I know you
have yeah that's right Simon Nintendo
actually just launched their their
online subscription service I think it's
pretty inexpensive 20 bucks a year or
something like that and you get a couple
of classic games with it but it's more
to allow you to play newer games online
with other people that's what all these
consoles do the PlayStation and the Xbox
you have to pay oh that was me again
coming back to myself but with with Xbox
you can also get the Xbox game pass
which gives you a big Netflix like
selection of games you can play
on-demand PlayStation has something
vaguely similar for older games but with
the race at regular things PlayStation
Plus and Xbox Live do you get like one
or two free usually pretty decent games
a month you could download and keep as
long as you
a member but I really think the hardware
choice comes down to number one which
platform has the games do you want to
play on it obviously want to play Mario
Cart and Zelda it's clearly gonna be the
switch which is a great system if you
want to play that new spider-man game
then it's gonna be the PlayStation if
you want to play you know fallout 76 or
our Red Dead Redemption - it's probably
whatever your friends are playing on so
you can have that social utility of that
shared experience of playing with them
there frankly both very good and I think
there's a lot of comparable prices
between them if you want to go super
super super high-end they will tell you
one thing I've discovered which is that
if you're hooking it up to a big old ad
4k TV everything like that the Xbox one
X the premium version of that is better
than the PlayStation Pro just in terms
of the sheer horsepower it can kick out
okay good stuff thanks Dan good
comprehensive answer there on that one
and thank you for the call so now let's
do a lightning round running a little
bit long on the show here let's go
around the horn one more time and get
any final pixs or mop-up around cats
what else you got in your in your bag
for people to recommend this one's easy
thirty bucks the Roku streaming stick
before you add one of these things to
your television they also have a four
cavers it's a little more but the basic
$30 one gives you everything you want
also controls your televisions volume
and power boom Dan give me something
true everybody needs a Roku but I'm
going the other direction I'm going 250
bucks for the Anki vector which is the a
smart robot du jour and they just today
announced that Alexa integration is
officially coming I think in
mid-december
he's a smart robot already you can
answer you know questions tell you the
weather and I gotta tell you kids love
him I just put him down in the on the
floor he bleeps and bloops and follows
him around for a few hours I get some
peace and quiet it's fantastic he wants
to say hi he's just waking up now yeah
the vector they say it's the robot that
doesn't want to take over the world but
I would add but looks like it does I
mean that's a mean burly little thing
he's so aggressive looking little little
aggressive thing I don't trust a little
aggressive ones alright let's go to
brodo give me him a last deal or two
Rick what do you got okay I got two for
you and there
identical-looking earth day so first up

trackers now that they have solved the
problem of the non replaceable battery

4c net viewers today
that's great gifts for you great gifts
to give away so definitely hop on that
deal and then this is the new mighty
vibe which is a portable Spotify player

know about this product but it's one of
the only ones that I know of that lets
you take your Spotify playlists offline

whatever so it slips up all of your

get the last word what do you got for us
we have one more from Dan though we had
to sneak I'm gonna get into the hot -
business I'm gonna start selling hot -
that's going we haven't talked enough
about STEM toys for kids and things that
teach science and engineering Nintendo
lab Oh which is those cardboard kits you
get and you build these these real
physical engineered devices that work
with your Nintendo switch is fantastic
there's a whole bunch of
and kids and they make all kinds of cool
stuff their incredibly complicated in a
way that really only kids can figure out
but every time I tried to put one of
these together it's been fantastically
fun and I'm just gonna quickly say mine
in my new obsession when it comes to
stem stuff is 3d printing I printed out
this little Holiday Gift Guide sign for
us right here pretty good up for people
in the office I got a mana price your
mana price makes cheap stuff I got a
$400 monoprice 3d printer and it is
fantastic because kids can see how you
design stuff in 3d and send it through
the printer how it gets assembled I
think it's a fantastic idea and then you
can man program the robot to throw it at
your head great great well all that
learning makes you hungry right if you
think about you know Meal Time Pizza is
everybody's favorite food hands down I
know it's my personal favorite so I have
just discovered this this machine it is
eight hundred dollars ignore the price
oh but this is this is an amazing thing
it is it from Breville it is a Smart
Oven it's called the pizza Yolo and it
actually has a range of temperatures so
it can go do anything from a deep-dish
Chicago style pizza to New York to even
a wood-fired simulated pizza it gets up
to 750 degrees Fahrenheit around 400
degrees centigrade which is something
that just normal ovens can't do you put
a pizza in and you pull it out and it in
like 2 minutes it is just like a wood
fire pizza I gave it to people around
the office
we probably gonna have pizza for lunch
because this thing is amazing
I look at just look at that like it's
just making my mouth water right now
looking at that it's you know wood fire
pizza without the wood and without the
fire and it lost me at eight hundred
bucks but you got me back because
there's a knob that has a New York
position at least they know good pizza
I'm on the fence then it's gonna go well
