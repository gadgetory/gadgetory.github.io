Sennheiser momentum to the second
generation of the company's excellent
over your headphone that details for
$350 new for 2015
Sennheiser's tweaked the designs of both
its momentum over year and on ear models
both of which now come in wired and
wireless versions and have a new folding
design that gives the headphones a
little smaller footprint when they're in
their included carrying case both this
new wire momentum too and it's wireless
sibling have larger ear cups so they fit
over your ears better than the original
momentum and they don't pinch anything
the designers also made the ear cup
softer and the end result is that the
momentum too is clearly a more
comfortable headphone than the original
it's also worth mentioning this model
comes in a version that has a cable with
an integrated remote and microphone for
Android phones as well as a model geared
toward Apple iPhone users personally for
$350 I think you should get both cables
in the box what happened to use both
Android and Apple devices well some
people may not it launched the headphone
is available in two colors black and
ivory but expect more colors to be
available down the road like they were
with the original momentum as for sound
well this headphone uses refinement and
seems to bring out the best in all types
of music well the biggest difference
between this second-generation momentum
and the original is the improved comfort
and folding design the sound has also
changed though not drastically this new
version is less bright voices are more
fleshed out and the bass impact is more
viscerally felt for a deeper dive into
the sound quality in comparisons to
competing models such as the audio
technica ath mr s7 and the nad viso hp50
check out our full text review but
suffice to say the momentum 2 is a
strong contender in its price class and
well worth considering if you're looking
for a premium over ear headphone that's
designed for both home and mobile use
I'm David Karn away
