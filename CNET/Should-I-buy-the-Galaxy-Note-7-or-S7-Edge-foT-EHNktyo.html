phone and you're not sure if you should
get the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 or the s7
edge one of them has a stylus that you
can use to write draw and navigate all
over the screen and the other one does
not but they both have a really
beautiful curved screen designs a great
camera and a fast processor there are
some little differences here and there
like the notes screen is very slightly
bigger than its batteries a little
smaller and the curves look a little
different but don't get bogged down in
all that stuff instead you should focus
on these three important things first
one is the stylus if you don't think
you're ever gonna use the s-pen then
just go ahead and get the edge but maybe
you're not sure if you'd use it or not
so let me tell you how I use it I like
it for taking all kinds of notes meeting
notes the to-do list places I should go
the next time I'm on vacation somewhere
I like how navigating keeps the screen
at fingerprint free and gives my thumbs
a break from all that scrolling and
tapping that I usually do I also share a
ton of photos and the note here it lets
me mark them up before I send them to my
friends the second point is price the
note 7 costs more than the s have an
edge but it also has double the storage
you get 64 gigabytes compared to 32 that
means we can keep twice as many photos
videos and games on the phone before you
need any extra memory card
finally there's battery life the note 7
S battery is a little smaller and it
didn't last quite as long in our tests
that's important if you want to eke out
every minute of battery life but you can
juice up both phones wirelessly if you
have the wireless charging pad or you
can use the wall charger
either way expect to charge your phone
at least once a day so the bottom line
is get the note 7 if you like the pen
you want a lot of built-in storage and
you're feeling flush with cash otherwise
the galaxy s7 edge or maybe even another
phone will be just right for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
