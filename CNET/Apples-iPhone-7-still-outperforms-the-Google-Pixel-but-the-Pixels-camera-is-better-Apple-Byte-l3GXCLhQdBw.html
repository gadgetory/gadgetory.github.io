the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple now we
aren't seen any record sales numbers for
the iPhone seven people are still in
line and the response has been positive
overall but as time goes on the iPhone 7
is still having more issues of its own
now first up users are reporting that
some iPhone 7 and even some 6s s are
having their activation locked with the
wrong Apple ID email linked to the phone
that means they can't sign in they can't
unlock it and they can set up the phone
and then they have to wait for an
expedited replacement phone that sounds
fun now there's also the story of the
exploding iPhone 7c Samsung and Apple do
really like to cop each other I kid but
it's a single case and it's not a
widespread issue for Apple just yet but
it happened to a customer says he
received an iPhone 7 that had exploded
in transit to him and he has no idea how
or why it happened but then we also have
an exploding iPhone 6s that was just in
the users back pocket when it exploded
resulting in second-degree burns now
Apple has not addressed the claims other
than replacing the defective units also
we heard about Google's pixel pixel XL
phones sure they look pretty similar in
design on the front side to the iPhone
and if you haven't checked out what
they're doing with artificial
intelligence it really blows away
anything Apple has right now but the
iPhone 7 can still brag when it comes to
benchmarks after initial Geekbench tests
show that the iPhone 7 significantly
outperforms the pixel now the pixel has
a multi-core score around 4100 and a
single core score of 1580 in multiple
tests while the iPhone 7 scores around a
5600 for multi-core performance and
around 34 34 it's single core the pixel
is touted as having the best mobile
camera ever
according to DxO marks rating system
with an 89 beating out the iPhone 7
which scored an 86 we also know the
rumors for the next 10th anniversary
iPhone in 2017 with its edge-to-edge
glass and the long-standing rumor that
the fingerprint sensor will be embedded
into the glass that idea just became
more of a reality after patently Apple
found a new patent granted to Apple that
describes technology that allows a
fingerprint to be recognized
anywhere on the screen and not just at a
fixed location on the screen now we know
not every patent happens but come on you
know this one is happening and a new
report from a co2 car supports earlier
rumors that we'll see three different
sized iPads for its next refresh in 2017
they claim will see an updated twelve
point nine inch iPad pro with a true
tone display a new 10.1 inch sized iPad
pro and instead of the current nine
point seven inch they are reporting will
see an updated 7.9 inch iPad Mini with
an apple smart connector for speakers
and true tone display as well
the other interesting thing to note here
Mac gotta car says all three new iPads
will still keep the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but you know it's Apple
so we will wait and see now alleged 8nx
benchmarks have been surface from tech
tastic and appear to blow the current
a10 processor out of the water with a
single core score of 40 to 36 and a
multi-core score of 65 88 this processor
if it is the a 10x is destined to be
packed inside of the next iPad pros plus
recent iPad patents also show that Apple
could be using magnets in a whole
different way to give future iPads more
capabilities patently Apple shows off
what they are thinking with a new
magnetic array system that would finally
allow the Apple pencil to securely
attach to an iPad pro with magnets
something the surface pro has done for a
long time but that's not the only thing
they're thinking of when it comes to
magnets another patent shows how magnets
on the corners of an iPad could work in
conjunction with a protective case for
the iPad and if the iPad detects that
it's falling the magnets would
temporarily pull the iPad away from the
impact point and shift it inside the
case while it's falling to avoid direct
contact but there's still one more use
case and it makes a lot of sense
functionally how about using magnets on
the edges of two iPads to connect them
together and create dun-dun-dun the maxi
pad hey Apple call me you know if you
end up using that name again these are
all ideas and they may not end up in
final products but it's what Apple is
thinking about now we know Steve Jobs is
one of if not the greatest thinkers and
innovators in consumer electronics so we
wanted to take a moment to remember him
this week
it's been five years since he passed
away at the age of 56 Tim Cook took to
Twitter and wrote a quote from SJ most
important have the courage to follow
your heart and intuition
remembering Steve and the many ways he
changed our world you know Apple is a
much different company now and even if
you don't see them as being the same
innovator they once were they are still
the world's most valuable brand despite
their first ever drop in iPhone sales
they have now held the top spot in inner
brands annual rankings for the fourth
year in a row with Google at number two
and coca-cola at number three but we'd
also like to take a moment to remember
the third generation Apple TV after
Apple has decided to discontinue it and
remove it completely from the apple
online store
and we finished things with the best
thing I saw this week we all know what
that new Mack scent smells like when you
crack open the packaging and you break
that seal for some people it's a way of
life well now you can have it in the
form of a scented candle for twenty four
bucks thanks to the people at 12 South
it's called the new matte candle it's a
hundred percent soy wax hand poured in
Charleston South Carolina and it smells
like a brand new Mac it's so popular
that it sold out so I'm just gonna wait
for the restock you know to UM set the
mood for that special moment all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at brian songs
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
