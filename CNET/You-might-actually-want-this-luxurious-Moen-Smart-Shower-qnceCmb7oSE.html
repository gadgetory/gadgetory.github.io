morning routine the you by Moen smart
shower adds useful smarts to a precise
digital shower controller via the app I
can turn on my own preset complete with
a customized message the shower turns on
and warms up then pauses and lets me
know when it's ready I can make a cup of
coffee in the meantime without worrying
about wasting water and when I'm ready I
can just hop in and enjoy my shower
you can precisely control the water
comforter via the app or right here in
the shower but the moment isn't magic if
I turn on every single nozzle the water
pressure is gonna suffer and there's
nothing this thing can do if you start
running out of hot water
but the valve that controls this panel
is really good so if you touch the
toilet that's right next to the shower
the temperature isn't gonna bust you can
use the app to customize timers for your
shower as well after this 10-minute
clock runs out the water will shut off
automatically so you can keep your
team's time in check though even after
it shuts off on its own there's nothing
to stop the team from just turning it
right back on and you can also mess with
your spouse by turning on the body spray
nozzles from afar the four outlet system
here is $2,200 a two outlet version is
1160 and that's just for the control
panel and the valve that attaches to
your pipes that doesn't include the
shower heads you see here or the money
you'll need to pay a plumber to install
the thing if you're renovating anyway
the price isn't bad for a digital
control valve and panel to its credit
Mon didn't add much to the premium for
the smarts alone but you can get plenty
of basic faucets and showerheads for a
couple hundred bucks even nice ones so
as the first smart shower we tested the
you buy Moen is cool and it's handy to
have but it's very much a luxury
purchase through and through not a
necessary smart device by any means
unless of course remotely annoying your
family members is worth the costume
