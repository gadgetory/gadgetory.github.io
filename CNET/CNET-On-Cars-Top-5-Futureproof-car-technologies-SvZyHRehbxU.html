easy in your car option one of those and
you knew you were good to go at least
through the end of the Clinton
administration but today's car tech
comes and goes a lot faster in fact you
may have never gotten around to having
rear seat entertainment a hard drive in
your car or satellite radio and they're
already heading toward Lane I'm Bryan
Cooley with the top five in car
technologies that should be future proof
in your next car number 5 USB hotspot
support this is a little odd but your
passengers do expect to have their
tablets and laptops online these days
when riding in your car studiously
ignoring you make it easy on them with a
car that supports USB wireless modems
this is mostly a Ford thing at this
point and increasingly your passengers
devices have their own connectivity but
I like the general idea of at least one
USB port that can work with and
understand a wireless adapter for
whatever comes next
number four SD card navigation when your
cards nav system is based on an SD card
instead of one of those dorky old DVDs
or a hard to update hard drive you can
download and install updates without a
trip to the dealer even add factory
navigation after you've bought the car
by just popping in one of these cards
this idea is spreading but so far mostly
a Nissan and Ford thing number three is
the aux jack yeah it's hardly tech at
this point but the lowly aux jack is
still a thing of simple beauty it works
with every portable ever made requires
no fancy cable or setup and typically
sounds great the downside is it's dumb
as a post it doesn't know when to mute
doesn't charge your device and doesn't
show anything on the screen
number two is USB ports for your media
like on your computer USB is becoming
the god connector in cars plug in a
thumb drive or your smart phone or an
iPad and reveal its musical guts while
also charging it and even controlling it
from the car the downside is the
sometimes erratic interface and file and
codec support depending on what your car
maker
chooses to recognize it's a little wild
out there before I get you to the number
one future-proof tech out there right
now for your car let me give you a
glimpse of what could trump these all
something called mirrorlink
it's just coming on the market in 2013
and it turns your phone into the brains
and the media for your entire car from
navigation to calling to music to
whatever apps you have on there that are
approved the screen on the dash just
becomes a dumb display everything is
powered by the phone and since the phone
does so many things so well perhaps
better than your car this idea makes
sense here's the caveat car makers are
still a little bit wary of it because it
means one less area where they can make
their car unique but it's worth watching
okay our number one technology to
future-proof your car is Bluetooth in
two flavors calling and streaming
calling is quickly becoming more
important than radio Bluetooth
hands-free is almost universal in cars
today with the exception of a couple of
really cheap cars that don't include it
and a couple of really pricey German
cars that have the gall to charge extra
for it fast behind Bluetooth calling is
bluetooth streaming which doesn't care
if you have an Android iPhone or
Blackberry device the music just plays
in stereo no cables the downside of all
Bluetooth tech is that being Wireless
you won't be charging while you drive
and some streaming systems don't show
you any information about what's being
played just some dumb splash screen
which is infuriating
for more car tech top fives like this go
to see net on cars.com i'm brian coulis
thanks for watching
