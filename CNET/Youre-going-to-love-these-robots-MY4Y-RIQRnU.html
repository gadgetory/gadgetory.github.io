robot well if you've got about $1,300
and can wait until the March timeframe

originally launched as an IndieGoGo
campaign in November
these robots which are currently in red
and blue colors but will be coming in
more colors soon are about a foot and a
half tall so they're pretty small but
they can do a lot of things there are
two different ways you can interact with

smart home appliances like your lighting
system and even set alarms for you
the alpha-2 can recognize your face and
take photos and when 20 moving joints it
can even practice yoga with you right

should run an hour

means building blocks in Chinese it's an
educational toy that is especially
developed for kids to teach them spatial
perception so there are two different

yourself

cost $100 and the more advanced hit will
cost about 200 it'll show up sometime in
