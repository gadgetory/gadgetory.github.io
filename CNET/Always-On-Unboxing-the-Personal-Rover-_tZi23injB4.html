this box it's been outside my office now
for weeks inside is the personal rover
electric scooter PR 800 be which near as
I can tell is kind of like half just
electric scooter motorized scooter and
half Segway competitor so obviously I
want to know what's inside and I brought
my knife to this job hope I didn't bring
a knife to a gunfight because it's like
a really serious but before using the
personal rover please see the manual and
video at personal rover.com flesh manual
I mean I'm a fan of not having a paper
manual but it's not like I'm going to
stop and go back to the internet
think of this juncture I might go watch
the instructional video and check out
the manual hi guys this is personal
Rover electronic transportation device

assemble it right now okay let's see
gently push forward to activate break BR
EA k huh whenever you ride the personal
transportation vehicle you risk death or
serious injury as expected the personal
rover weighs 90 pounds it's 43 inches
long and 20 inches wide the handle
height is 45 inches in the wheel
diameter is 10 inches the motor is 800
watts the max distance it can go on a
charge as 12 miles it's max speed is a
highly dangerous sounding 15 miles per
hour the estimated charge time if you
can figure out how to charge it is for
28 hours shipping weight 95 pounds it's
made of steel and aluminum and it can
hold up to a 220 pound human suggested
age 13 and up it has an auto power shut
off warning feature which I can imagine
you might need it also comes with an
optional cargo box or you could pick one
up at your local grocery store and
there's an optional storage cover you
