peanut this is a first look at the
Samsung montage this is a new phone for
Virgin Mobile now a Virgin Mobile like a
lot of other carriers right now is
leaning heavily on smartphones this is
not a smartphone but it does have a
slide-out QWERTY keyboard so this is
really a phone that you're going to use
mostly for messaging and for phone calls
however there is Internet and you can
get data in one of Virgin Mobile's
payload plans so that will involve text
talk and web the screen is a little bit
on the small side but it's acceptable
because you have this navigation here
you also have this dial pad phone is
pretty roomy comfortable to hold the
slide-out QWERTY keyboard to has two
soft keys as part of the screen and I
think that is a very spacious keyboard
the keys to me are a little bit flat and
I got tripped up a little bit of my
typing it's not my favorite keyboard of
all time but it's definitely got the job
done and I was able to compose text
messages pretty easily for a phone that
you will be mostly using to make calls
I'm happy to report that call quality
was pretty good during my tests
it wasn't flawless but conversation
flowed really easily and there was
nothing too distracting for those of you
who like pictures there is a 2 megapixel
camera on here but without flash I mean
the out autofocus the photo quality is
going to be variable I also like the
physical shutter button there's a micro
SD card slot as well so you do have very
convenient access to external storage
and you will be able to store and play
music there is bluetooth on here but
there is no Wi-Fi and no GPS however the
phone does only cost $49.99 and Virgin
Mobile is a no-contact carrier to read
the full review go to cnet.com I'm
