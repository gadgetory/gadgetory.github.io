and you guess it another episode of the
359 podcast with Roger Cheng and Alfred
and good morning morning everyone he giw
that's right happy Wednesday everyone
we've got a we've got an extra pack show
we're gonna try to cram in four stories
in or podcast whoo yeah we'll be talking
about eighteen t confirming the launch
of directv now that they're over the top
service for the fourth quarter their
bits questions about it I don't know if
it's gonna be delayed I mean they had
been to land while they're teasing a
hundred channels at a very aggressive
price so we'll see what that is we're
also talking about a story The Alfred
wrote on also an eighteen t testing out
a technology called air gig which I
think will deliver super fast internet
speeds across the power line so they try
to do this before we'll see if this is
this is the this is where it actually
work out and then Google a low messaging
service launched today we'll be talking
a little bit about that and why the
world needs another messaging service
even from google which has way too many
already they don't and then lastly we're
gonna ended up with and uh something fun
would be talking about the hyper adapt
one point oh those are the nike shoes
inspired by back to the future part two
I'm excited it's all about the look I
don't yeah it was a little the
self-lacing shoes it is if they look
like you know like grandpa shoes I'm not
like I don't care if they lose
themselves you see what they look like
they look pretty good yeah alright maybe
it's just an old man my style is way
different than everyone else's but
alright let's so let's get started as
always if you have any questions about
these topics leave them in the comments
section or producer Brian will pick out
the best and we will do our best to
answer them all right let's get this
podcast in the bank yep here we go in
three two welcome to the 23 29 when we
talk about the top tech news of the day
and all the other crap we want to throw
in I'm Roger Cheng I'm out for doing so
are you cord cutter 18t may have service
for you the telecom giant confirmed
today that will launch an over-the-top
or online streaming service called
direct TV now in the fourth quarter the
CEO T's more than 100 premium channels
very very aggressive price point you
know are you a cord cutter to you do you
have a cable subscription absolutely i
am a corpse so r is this something that
would excite you eighteen t is not
exactly synonymous with you know hip new
services it is an eighteen t over the
top surface though something you'd be
interested I haven't had a cable
subscription in about ten years now and
I never plan on going back I mean
there's so many live streaming services
out there that I don't need television
to watch that I can watch it on my
computer and just chromecast it right so
this is this is a service that is I mean
you it's for mobile it's for roku it's
not for its not delivered a traditional
means right it is you download an app
and you can play on your app whether
it's on roku your phone or tablet so it
is sort of a true alternative for court
hard and it's a it's sort of the full
slave channels but that's not that
attractive to you I'm still very
skeptical of mobile viewings it's such a
small screen I mean I get I guess you
can chromecast it yeah but at the same
time you know what are you running or
Roku yeah if I'm near a chromecast
though I'm probably gonna have my laptop
with me and then I should just
chromecast it from there instead of you
know doing it from my phone right I have
seen people watching baseball games
though their phone online that's been
very successful for them but as far as
what i'm using i can't say I'd subscribe
to something like that and is it the
fact that it's you'd be paying for a
hundred plus channels many of them you
know you're not probably not gonna watch
anyway that to me has always been the
downfall of cable companies where they
don't let you you know select your
channels ala carte right so i don't
we'll see if it actually makes an impact
another eighteen t is also making some
other news you wrote about this
yesterday yes it's called the air gig
basically it's using these plastic
antennas that you put on top of power
lines they've tried this before google
and IBM have both tried doing this about
ten years ago but instead of their plan
where the broadband goes through the
power line this one it's the antennas
using the power lines to guide signals
along it so so it sort of travels along
side the power line yeah so it's still
using the power lines right just not
there
I mean the big deal here is by using
paralyzed by using not their own
infrastructure they can go beyond their
geography you know the only there only
really in certain parts of the country
they can go after rural markets they can
even go after overseas customers by
using the same technology so that means
technically or that could potentially
mean high-speed access for a lot more
people it's interesting for them to use
an infrastructure like this you see
companies like Facebook where they have
their Aquila drone right where you know
they're making an entirely new
infrastructure google has their balloons
project where you know it's interesting
that they thought you know why don't we
just use something about that already
exists yeah the tribe makes a lot of
sense Google's a low messaging app
launched today between whatsapp Facebook
line in a myriad of others does the
world need another message camp I have a
problem with a low in the sense that
they did not just integrate it in with
hangouts right hangouts is already an
established app a lot of people use it
you know I use it almost every day and
for me to have to download another app
it seems like Google every time it comes
out with a new concept instead of let's
add it to something that we have already
let's just they just make a whole new
app for it right well look the hook for
a low is the integration with Google
assistant it's chat bot with enough
smarts to answer your questions like a
normal person all right lastly before we
wrap things up nike confirmed that it
will be launching its hyper adapt one
point 0 safe self-lacing shoes inspired
by back to the future two on november
28th alfred are you excited I'm excited
for the self tying feature I just don't
think that looks like a cool sneaker why
does it have the lights on the bottom
because it's from Back to the Future
that I don't for me that's why it's kind
of awesome the last time I wore sneakers
were of lights on the bottom was also
the last time I had cable TV well there
you go all right for more about these
stories check us out at seen it I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening and that's a cut on the audio
podcast recording and I want these shoe
right right I'm sorry they I and I where
I'm I'm like what some people might call
a sneakerhead but like that now does not
look cool to me obviously I don't know
much about
legitimate sneaker wear but i don't care
if they light up yeah and i wanted i
think i just want the self-lacing
feature yeah that's what i said i dint
features i mean i'm okay with this I'm
okay with a look of the shoe though it's
pretty not offensive to me it's kind of
if anything playing I just wish they
went with the ones from the actual back
to the future the Air Mags actually they
did make those they just didn't self
lace yeah yes they didn't like a charity
auction yeah they should have that they
should have released is bad design use
that design for this if they're really
doing a call back to back to the future
it should have been those because those
sneakers look incredible and these don't
just wait at some point there'll be
another movie anniversary and they'll do
the whole shebang that way so we've got
the actual Air Mags that don't self lace
and now we have Nikes selfless just
because they want to own that gimmick I
guess yeah someday those two will meet
will say I mean I still look I still
think they're pretty attractive glowing
shoe or not I actually I want to see how
the glowing part works is it just does
it like glow when itself laces is a
constantly lit or how does that work
also do you have to charge your shoes
now yes you do apparently you've got a
charger shoes every two weeks that's
ridiculous well as power to half I mean
if itself laces it's got to use power so
it's got to be charged right we're gonna
get to an age where we're gonna have to
charge everything yes it charge work
that's what wireless charging is for
it's gonna save we're just gonna like
put our shoes in our phones all the same
wireless charging pad will be fine
there's a really good meme joke thread
something from reddit I saw where it's
like my friend came over one night and
asked if he could use my USB port to
charge his cigarette but I was using it
to charge my book the future is stupid
haha I one time when I was a statement
exaggeration actually yeah i-i've one
saw a guy charging his uh ecig on his
laptop oh and at first I thought he was
like downloading something come on
software update for you yeah it actually
also runs iOS test is just yeah anyone
out there charge something weird or
anticipate what's the next thing we're
going to have to add to our charging
repertoire we want to know also anyone
out there want to get the shoes
let's all go in together because we're
probably gonna have to chip in all of
our money tight know that that's the
real hook there like how much of these
things gonna cost I think they'll be
pretty cheap think so no no man it's
like it's they're gonna position it as
new technology new technologies ever see
if anything it might be released on a
limited sale and then a bunch of people
are gonna like resell it for much higher
I mean that's what they did with the
limited releases hi mags well the Air
Mags cost how much does those were
fortune yeah as I'm collector item yeah
it was eliminating release no but I
don't think that this is gonna be a
cheap shoe yes so remember when they did
the Pepsi thing too that was so last
year yeah yeah that was like twenty
bucks a bottle or so crazy like that
yeah I mean it's a collector item if you
drank that you're stupid yes cuz it's
just been see houses Pepsi who this
coming from the guy who downs like for
Kansas shelter in like the against
healthy show Pepsi not much not much
according to recent studies debatable
robber is asking about kinetic kinetic
charging wouldn't that be kind of an
interesting feature to see if I shoes
could charge like other charts himself
watches back in the day bingo yeah that
actually makes a ton of sense how is
that not native that's why I thought
they didn't need to be charged but i
guess not that thing has a does it have
a micro USB port or maybe yeah i don't
think anybody's got a wave does it gotta
like water kind of like edward actually
does that mean that these shoes aren't
waterproof if you have to charge them uh
not necessarily i mean you know your
iphones waterproof so now it is by
holidays I don't that's a really good
question I don't um you know I thinking
back to the the hyper dunks that LeBron
ahir to hit a pair of smart shoes a few
years back but it was like a sensor that
was in the soul that was waterproof
fellas very water resistant so I don't I
can't imagine this one isn't work with
they can't it starts raining yeah shoes
the shoes in it anymore yeah by Samsung
Samsung suncor's oh they're just gonna
take that fur never however let it go
know how to go how about solar powered
phones solar powered phones I feel like
that would not be that practical aren't
there there's solar batteries out there
are solar chargers yeah yeah exactly
problem is they don't collect energy
fast enough for your phone yeah you need
a sergeant surface area to do the trick
right and for the the ones that are
portable enough it takes hours upon
hours for to actually work and so to to
embed solar panels into a phone even if
it was a large phone it would take days
for that phone to fully charge we've
actually the plug our road trip package
I mean our reporters went out to the
budgeteers refugee camp solar chargers
are a main source of power for a lot of
these refugees yeah and the issue is
like they could get maybe a five percent
charge from that thing after a little
while and then someone else it's got to
come in and use a charge but it's it's
not very efficient Hassan is in school
right now and he's not supposed to be
wise YouTube rebel I love it a son you
are a kindred spirit we salute you good
luck and enjoy detention tonight there
you go what what school do you go to yes
on where are you we're not gonna report
you but should be should be learning
instead yes well hopefully we're judging
you he's so learning valuable lessons
about sneakers sneakers yeah fashion the
right kind of fashion go well we're
happy to have you yes um what else
cord-cutting let's talk or coding we
always talk cord coding yeah i mean look
court kinase a favorite subject of mine
i was a cord cutter for a while but
actually once i moved back to the move
to the burbs i ended up buying like a
full package of verizon fios services
i'm pretty sure once like my two-year
promotional ray comes up i will be a
court cutter again well now that they're
putting sports on twitter there's no
reason yeah not much yeah yeah yeah whoa
email just realized I don't want to
watch my TV all that often I mean I
spend most of our time if i watch stuff
it's on my phone or my tablet and it's
usually the like HBO Go or Netflix that
just I don't watch traditional TV
although yeah I don't know if I exactly
count as a cord cutter only because I
have an antenna like one of those oh
yeah yeah one so i did i had the same
deal when i was in the city i didn't pay
for any subscription TV surface but i
did have an antenna that got me at least
the basic channels yeah so I watching
olympics in sports that's pretty much
all I need yeah then 10 actually covers
you for a decent mountain sports your
movie you're pretty good and that's
that's free if you can get reception
yeah the city that can be a tricky thing
yeah that's kind of what I go through
yeah it was great in my old apartment
with my new one there's like a tree that
blocks on PBS for me so it's very
unfortunate is it a trump tree uh got a
misshapen topics just the leaves
are always orange yeah public broadcast
is a pain on the tax dollars uh and as
anyone tried all o it like firsthand
here haven't tried first hand yet I am
interested in you know chatting with the
chat BOTS and seeing if Google Google
assistant is as as human as you know
they're they're pushing it to be I think
the chat pod feature is great because
it's it's basically real-time fact
checking on people where you know they
say something and then I can just do at
Google and then you're wrong and this is
why I look I think there's so many
snarky replies that people can use with
a low I was thinking more if you're
lonely he has to talk to you finally
have someone a message if you have no
friends you have google so you can
always message us on the 359 by the way
there you go uh vid effects is really
dreaming big here what about a phone
makes food for you but and then when
it's lost you it knows your gps assuming
you got a chip in you and it just walks
back to you wow that is a that is a
pretty fantastic division in big yeah
well I wouldn't mind the phone that
cooks for you that listen we paid we
just got self-lacing shoes let's wait a
little bit right I don't think a phone
would be a good cook probably not I
don't know probably better cook than me
it's like chopped terrible battle
tradition I'm terrible yeah let's uh
let's put some money down let's take
bets on how long a low will last before
we wrap this up what's how long will all
OH be out there before it goes the way
of the wave I think it'll be I think a
bit around for a while just because of
google assistant google has I think
they're betting a lot on this AI there's
this battle of chat bots or battle bots
going on between all these other
companies
so if they want to keep google assistant
relevant they're going to want to keep
pushing google this they're gonna push
google home they're gonna push
everything that use a Google assistant
and so I think for that sake you know
they'll try to keep it relevant they'll
try to keep I think let start moving
services into it or they start
prioritizing a low they'll find ways to
make it relevant the other ones have
been kind of a experimenting hangouts is
successful but yeah I mean I think it'll
be around for a while I mean eventually
that technology can be repurposed though
the AI is its own thing whether y'all
owe itself lasts in its encapsulated
form right as you know maybe it's folded
at a hangouts yeah that I think that's
probably more likely they just keep the
Google wall is just covered in crap that
they've thrown to see what sticks and
now that's how they operate yeah they've
got the money to do it and we wish you
the best of it affects he says thanks
for the inspiration this is what I'm
planning to do when I graduate we are
rooting via the phone that cooks food
for you yeah yes I want to see it do it
man I'm serious that's uh that's
inspired I'm that that's kickstarter
fodder right there oh yeah I don't know
anybody who wouldn't want that we would
spill some serious take the phone that
makes potato salad yes oh my god yes
let's combine all of your circle yes
full circle all right that's probably a
good good place to rest of the day all
right thanks for listening everyone if
you like anything you saw or heard here
chicks on cnet our podcast is also
