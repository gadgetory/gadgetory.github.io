CES and it's been surprisingly hard to
get a hold of its fitbit's first foray
into the wearable space taking on the
Nike FuelBand I think they discovered
that a weird little thing that clips
onto your clothes and gets lost all the
time is actually not a winner all right
let's get it out of here
it says do not load our transport
package if damage because the
lithium-ion batteries so I hope it's not
damaged because we flew it to Vail and I
flew for you purists in the unboxing
world the whole box okay
Fitbit return information just in case
hopefully we won't need that a very very
very swollen up packaging thing because
we went on the airplane don't go
anywhere
little balloons and then after all that
it's just this little deal II point ok
box over there we got the kind of slate
blue color that's kind of attractive
actually it's good-looking it looks at
first less a little more attractive than
the fuel band I mean the fuel band has
that kind of punk rock matte black thing
going for it but this is very stylish
and that whoa and it all comes apart so
it's pretty easy to unbox that's good
news see what's in there an extra band
ok this is kind of a weird thing about
the Flex
it actually comes with two bands they're
two different sizes I personally find
this a little bit wasteful because could
you just I could order like a small one
or a large one I know how big my wrist
is cuz this one's just gonna get thrown
away I think Oh what else in here
it has this tiny little USB dongle for
wireless charging it can also thankfully
because this is a big complaint about
previous fitbit's wirelessly sync with
your phone over bluetooth but it can
only do it with iPhone and with some
Samsung Galaxy phones not the whole
Android family kind of a letdown and
then you still need this little guys
you're gonna have to use up a USB slot
if you want to wirelessly sync it's
close
not perfect but we're getting closer
from that and then here's the little
charging cable for the actual tracker
because the actual tracker is just this
little small this tiny little tracker
thing just goes inside the band actual
band doesn't have any of the technology
in it that's it for the box let's do the
specs the Fitbit flex tracks your steps
your calories consumed and your sleep
which is kind of cool it has obviously a
wristband design with a little LED
screen the lights show you how much
progress you're making toward your daily
goal there is Bluetooth 4.0 syncing it
can only do direct sync with iPhone
Samsung Galaxy s3 or galaxy note the
Flex software on the phone gives you
ways to analyze all your stats and
people love all that data the Flex band
is water-resistant so you can wear it in
the shower or in the rain and Fitbit
says it can also be submerged for up to
33 feet presumably that means you could
go swimming with it it comes with a USB
cable and a socket adapter the battery
life according to Fitbit is five to
seven days depending on usage the Flex
also has a vibration motor so it
vibrates whenever you hit your daily
goal and you can also set a wake-up
alarm so it will gently wake you up with
vibration the Flex cost $99.95 so at
first blush the Flex looks promising it
fixes a lot of the problems with the
original Fitbit people love that cool
Fitbit data collection and this band is
attractive it's lightweight and it's
water-resistant so I have high hopes for
it now I'm going to take it on a little
bit more of a complete road test and get
it a little bit dirty meanwhile head on
over to Sina and read our editors full
review for what they think is well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
