to the Apple buy for everything good bad
inside the world of Apple and we're just
days away from the release of the Apple
watch and we'll also announce the
winners for our Mortal Kombat X giveaway
now let's get to it
and we've already seen online videos for
both the alleged sapphire glass cover
for the Apple watch and the ion X glass
cover for the Apple watch sport being
tortured and put to the test with
different scratch tests now some of them
are practical but I'm not so sure I'll
be running my wrist in constant direct
contact with a piece of coarse sandpaper
all the time the same alright just
before the April 24th release Apple was
granted patents for the Apple watch
sport band which has unique fold under
design element with the strap the
classic buckle that connects with
magnets and the link bracelet that has a
spring-loaded butterfly clip and release
buttons on some of the links for a
custom fit now these are actually unique
designs that deserve a patent also the
Apple watch edition with the exclusive
gold link bracelet is making its way
onto high-profile celebrities like this
picture of Beyonce lost in with it at
Coachella that pretty much set the
internet on fire now JJ Abrams didn't
get the same treatment but people still
went gaga over his stainless steel Apple
watch at Star Wars Celebration and so
what celebs are getting the Apple watch
early but you can too that's because
some pre-orders with four to six weeks
where a June delivery estimate have seen
their order status change to preparing
for shipment could this really be
happening so you're telling me there's a
chance
yeah well maybe for you but not for this
guy late and if you're curious what some
of your favorite apps might look on the
watch developers Steven trot and Smith
has created a tool that lets you take an
early peek at apps like Twitter and its
small screen layout you can also check
out Instagram and how its formatted and
the ESPN app with its scores and
highlights plus one thing the Apple
watch will also be able to do is control
your keynote or PowerPoint presentations
and you can see what that looks like in
these images as well now and some not so
great news for eager 12-inch MacBook
owners many users are experiencing a
spinning beach ball during the setup
process that has stalled the setup for
as long as 30 minutes now Apple is
suggesting users avoid the delay by
moving through the setup assistant
without connecting to the Internet then
once the laptop is set up restart it and
manually join your local Wi-Fi
connection or plug into Ethernet
pain-in-the-butt apple's addressing it
but at least you know what to do for now
and that's why you should tell your
friends to watch the Apple byte alright
WWDC 15 is coming in the first part of
June we're ready for it but are you all
now according to the WWDC 15 attendance
policy you may not use selfie sticks or
similar monopods WWDC is also banning
wearable recording devices like Google
glass which is actually probably gonna
help you meet more people in real life
now no selfie sticks I can't believe it
so that begs the question are they also
banning the belfie stick because you
know taking a picture of your booty it's
kind of a thing now but we always know
Apple is typically slower in terms of
adopting new forms of technology so next
year WWDC attendees I can assure you
selfie sticks would be added to that
list and if you're an Apple lover that's
up to no good
make sure you keep your tech toys locked
away somewhere that's after a scorned ex
found out her boyfriend had been
cheating on her so she did the next
logical thing she dumped his entire
Apple collection into a bathtub full of
water and posted it on Twitter now this
dude will be bobbing for apples for
reals now the submerged collection looks
like it included one eye Mac and iPad
two iPhones two MacBooks and Airport
extreme and more now Apple recently
published a patent in early April to
make the buttons on its iOS devices
waterproof but it won't help this guy
all right let's get to the winners of
our Mortal Kombat giveaway from last
week where I asked you what you thought
about my mom and her comments on the
Apple watch why are you wasting your
money of that now over email has soos de
Dios writes in with moms know best plus
she's kind of cute you must have gotten
your looks from your dad yeah he sees
how did you know and on Twitter metalman
said I don't think your mother is a
tiger mom but she sure might be a cougar
but she doesn't look anything like a
cougar all right congrats to both of you
thanks to everyone who entered and will
get the games out to you as soon as we
can that's gonna do for this week's show
now I'm really hoping none of you waits
in line outside of an Apple store on
Friday because they aren't selling the
watch in store so don't be that person
you can email me at the Apple bye to see
Netcom or tweet me at brian tong and I
will answer after my nap time thanks for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
