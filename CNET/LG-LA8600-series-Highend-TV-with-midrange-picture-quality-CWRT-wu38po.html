this is the LG la 8600 this is a 55 inch
LED LCD TV there's also a 6 th member of
the series which is LG's best for 2013
that's neither 4k nor OLED it's a
standard 1080p LED TV with all the bells
and whistles the LG can throw this year
one of the coolest bells and whistles is
something Savelle on step down LG's as
well that's the remote control LG's
remote is sort of like a Nintendo Wii
controller and that you kind of wave it
at the screen you can have the cursor
move around this here has been improved
and I found it more precise than ever
it's excellent for moving around the
menus navigating a whole bunch of icons
even using the web browser and it works
with pretty much everything although
there's some apps that are not supported
but majority of them are LG smart TV
suites also been improved this year to
include the ability to show you live
current television programming that's
right you put in your zip code and your
cable or satellite provider and it'll
show you upcoming TV shows I will also
allow you to sort those shows and show a
bunch of different thumbnails at once
you can sort of by genre as well as
whether they're SD or HD and all totally
found the system worked really well it's
such a little bit better than Samsung
similar system this year it's called on
TV on the LG and it's available on this
8600 as well as a couple of other
step-down TVs but not every smart LG TV
TV also builds in cable box control so
when you select one of those programs
that change the channel on your cable
box you can also call it the virtual
remote again it's pretty easy to use
that virtual remote when you use the
motion control systems you can reach
those buttons on the remote pretty
easily compared to a system where I have
to drive around like Samsung's and try
to activate those buttons using a
standard cursor arrangement
all told however I did appreciate using
a standard universal remote a little bit
better than this one especially for
heavy DVR users other features on this
LG include a pop up camera it's really
only for Skype however Skype is included
as one of the apps but Stevie doesn't
support the gesture control and facial
recognition found on Samsung's high-end
camera equipped television one of the
real strengths of the LA 8600 is
external design this is one of the
nicest looking TVs on the market the
edge around the screen is extremely thin
it's got a little silver trim here
there's also a little thicker area along
the bottom the stand is really slick
looking - it doesn't allow it to swivel
but the U shape is pretty distinctive
and it gets the
nice and high although it's not quite as
low-profile and aggressive looking as
some of the other TVs out there of
course as an LED TV it's also really
sliver thin when seen from the side
around back there's four HDMI ports as
well as three USB ports and a couple of
her visions for analog LG's also known
for its passive 3d system as TV includes
four pairs of the lighter unpowered
glasses that are really comfortable to
wear the main downside on the 8600 is
picture quality in 2d it just doesn't
measure up to the high price the TV's
black levels are a little bit lighter
and less realistic than some of the
other high-end TVs on the market there's
also a couple of hot spots on the screen
so picture uniformity isn't quite up to
snuff on the other hand the color
accuracy is excellent a video processing
is very good but despite those strengths
the picture quality 8600 isn't quite as
lovely to expect for its high price
that's a quick look at LG's la 8600
series LED based LCD I'm David Katz my
