razors ever turn off at CES is project
Ariana it's a high concept projector
that's designed to not replace your main
display but actually to complement it
it's an ultra wide 155 degree fisheye
lens and at para 3d sensing cameras and
uses that hardware to basically paint
some combination of in-game footage for
whatever game you're playing you're
related images like maybe weather
effects and co-ed lights via trades was
from a lighting system over your your
wall that even you're silly in an
attempt to make an all-enveloping game
environment for you rather than just
looking at the screen itself now this is
just a prototype
it's also designed to work as a
standalone high-definition projector
which would help it feel you know a
little more practical than just having a
separate projector just for ambient
lights and images around your room it's
actually a little bit similar to a
Microsoft idea from a few years ago
called a newer room that was a never
released prototype we saw at CES back in
2013 now of course like all these
concept pieces and razor Sammis for them
this may or may not ever actually come
out but having checked it out in a live
room with a gamer playing a real game it
was definitely a very cool expansive
experience that made me feel much more
immersed in the game that was being
played</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
