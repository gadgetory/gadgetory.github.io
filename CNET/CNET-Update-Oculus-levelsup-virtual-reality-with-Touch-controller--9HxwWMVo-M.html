way to play games with your hands I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update oculus is leveling up the virtual
reality experience with a new type of
game controller that lets you use your
hands to interact with the game now when
you look at people using virtual reality
headsets you see a whole bunch of this
people reaching out their hands while
they look into a 3d environment now that
motivated the team at oculus to create a
new type of motion sensing controller
called the oculus touch this set of
controllers has the usual analog stick
buttons and trigger but it also detects
finger poses with how you hold it so you
can give a thumbs up or point or wave as
part of the game it takes motion a bit
further than our old friend the wiimote
but it's still a prototype the actual
first oculus rift headsets are going to
be coming out sometime in the first
quarter of next year and they will come
with an Xbox one wireless controller and
a little sensor on your stand to detect
how you move in the room but the company
still isn't saying what all this is
going to cost oculus which is owned by
Facebook also showed off the final
design of its headset at this press
event it's going to be wrapped in fabric
for a smooth feel and the headphones are
removable if you want to use your own
oculus also teased some upcoming games
that were made specifically for virtual
reality taking advantage of the illusion
that you're inside of the game we're
going to hear more about that next week
during the big III video game expo in
Los Angeles while Facebook's oculus
wants to change the virtual world Google
is going after another project to change
the real world google announced the
launch of something called sidewalk labs
it's an independent company that's
dedicated to improving life in big
cities that means looking into how to
improve things like energy use cost of
living and transportation which goes
with that whole self driving cars thing
it's the idea of the perfect
Tomorrowland world minus the jetpacks
search and advertising are still
Google's main revenue stream bringing in
50 billion dollars annually so why does
google stretch itself into this far-out
project
like self-driving cars google glass
internet via balloons or like it
announced in 2013 to go on a mission to
extend the human lifespan it all comes
down to making more money from data if a
city is smart enough to know how we are
moving through the streets if you can
report a pothole right when it happens
if parking lots told you when they were
full so you can get an alert to your
phone if the mailbox told you when the
postman came by or not yeah there's
plenty more data for Google to turn into
a business that's it for this tech news
roundup and there's more at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
