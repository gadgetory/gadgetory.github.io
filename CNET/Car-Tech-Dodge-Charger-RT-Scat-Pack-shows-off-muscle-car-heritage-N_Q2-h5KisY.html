muscle car than any other automaker
today
I'm driving a 2015 Dodge Charger r/t
scat pack and this is just one of nine
versions that Dodge has the color of
this Chargers modestly called b5 blue
now that's a historic Dodge paint color
and looks great in the Sun dodge says
this model draws influence from the 1969
charger but I think it looks a little
bit more like the first-generation 1966
charger due to the roofline in the shape
of the hood anyway you cut it though
this is a full-size sedan plenty of room
in the rear seat for passengers this
naturally aspirated 6.4 liter v8 starts
off like a gunshot
it makes for an 85 horsepower and 475
pound-feet of torque and that's all
going to the rear wheels through an
8-speed automatic transmission there's a
ton of torque from this engine and it's
more than easy to get the rear tires
loose even when I'm sitting at a
stoplight I can feel the whole car shift
around it's like a wild animal in a cage
now the industry went to metric a long
time ago for engine sizes but dodge
still referred to the 6.4 liter is a 392
that's cubic inches but as much as this
charger holds up traditional muscle car
values it's quite a bit of modern tech
here there's a display on this remote
cluster where I can monitor real time
horsepower real time torque and g-forces
this 8.4 inch touchscreen on the dash
shows dodges UConnect system one of the
better infotainment systems around with
navigation digital audio and hands-free
telephone system one of the things I
really like here is Yelp integration I
could just push the Yelp app search for
any term get a list of results and the
navigation will take me where I want to
go
all right let's price out our 2015 Dodge
Charger r/t scat pack base price for
this model is forty thousand nine
hundred ninety dollars delivered to go
see nuts that will have navigation for
five hundred ninety five dollars and
what we don't have on this model is the
driver confidence package with a blind
spot monitor that's five hundred ninety
five dollars or the technology package
with adaptive cruise control that's
nineteen ninety five we'd also want to
add the Beats Audio package with ten
speakers that's another nine ninety five
and so that puts us at a total of forty
five thousand one hundred and seventy
dollars a lot of old-fashioned power in
this charger r/t scat pack and you'll
pay for it in for mileage I'm talking
about well under twenty miles per gallon
average but you will turn heads with the
looks of this car the sound of that big
v8 not to mention when you screech the
tires every time you take off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
