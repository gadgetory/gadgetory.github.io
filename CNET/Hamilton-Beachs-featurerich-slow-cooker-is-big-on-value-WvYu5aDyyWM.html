appliances here at the Hamilton Beach
set-and-forget 6-quart programmable slow
cooker when you first look at this slow
cooker it looks pretty standard like
every other slow cooker you've ever seen
but I really love the slow cooker it's
only $59.99 and it's incredibly
predictable which is basically
everything I ever wanted from a slow
cooker it'll follow the recipe you don't
have to worry about tweaking it or doing
anything crazy to make your meal perfect
you can really just set it and forget it
it offers all of the standard features
that you'd expect from a slow cooker
like a timer a warm mode high and low
settings but it also offers a couple of
other things that I think really set it
apart from the competition one of the
smaller things that's kind of simple but
I really love it is that it comes with a
serving spoon that just snaps right on
top of the lid simple but it makes it
really easy for transport I also love
these lid clips so if you're actually
taking it to a friend's house for an
event it won't spill everywhere all over
your car it also comes with a
thermometer probe so say you're cooking
a whole chicken insert the probe into
the chicken select 160 degrees
Fahrenheit and it will default to warm
mode when it's reached that temperature
one thing I don't love about the slow
cooker is the display it's a little
dated it's a little bit counterintuitive
but it's still serviceable thanks for
watching my review of the hamilton beach
slow cooker i'm megan Willerton for seen
