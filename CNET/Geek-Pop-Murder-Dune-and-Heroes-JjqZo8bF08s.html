I'm Tom Merritt big pop is the show
where we keep you up to date on the
latest in geeky movies television books
and much more if it's geeky will tell
you about it let's start with movies out
this week is dark matter a movie about
astrophysics and murder this is
excellent we're losing now we're cooking
with gas the story is based on the true
story of a Chinese student who shot and
killed five people at the University of
Iowa in 1991 he apparently did it
because he thought his research was
being overlooked Dark Matter the movie
premiered at sundance and when the
Alfred P Sloan prize for the best
feature film dealing with science or
technology it also stars Meryl Streep
and murder he's in way over his head
coming soon to your computer most of the
folks who brought you mystery science
theater 3000 have started a new project
where they mock B movies they're calling
it cinematic titanic let's get a little
taste do you have boozing brain check
the warning signs

foot of the burning their treatment of
the oozing skull is now available on DVD
or for download that can be burned to
DVD you can also catch the crew doing
their thing live in dallas texas april
26 oh I love it when they prep the
potato tableside like that and finally I
mean finally Frank Herbert's dune is
being brought back to the big screen
prepare yourselves for another helping
of the sky paramount got themselves the
right to dune they brought Peter Berg on
to direct and they're looking for a
writer who can keep the script faithful
to her birth story good idea peter berg
by the way directed the kingdom and is
best known for his starring role in
chicago hope so we hope they can
actually make a good dude movie yeah as
you know David Lynch made the last one
much maligned I heard the director's cut
was much better yeah well I thought the
director's cut was much better but the
directors extended edition was not a
director's cut it was actually a cut
that someone else did it David Lynch
said remove my name from that I thought
it was even worse wow yeah well actually
it was that's right it was replaced by
an Alan Smithee credit Smithee being and
apparently a common pseudonym but used
by directors who don't want their name
attached to a film that Alan Smith he's
done a lot of good stuff in fact over 64
directorial credits alone including the
pilot of the show MacGyver hopefully the
new movie will be very good and maybe
todo won't be called on to do the music
because have you seen that commercial
that they've been doing not good enough
about that let's move on to television

news NBC revealed this week that they
will not be cancelling heroes surprise

and I'm excited if you were however also
excited about the standalone spin-off
called heroes origins nBC has nuked
plans for that's been off saying it's
just too much to deal with right now but
they did announce new heroes action
figure too much to deal with there's

them right now you know what I think
though they just wanted to make sure
heroes stayed good and I support that
