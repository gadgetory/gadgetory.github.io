we're taking a look at smart things
smart things as a kid that you can get
online though I'll help you automate
your home with the help of these nifty
sensors now you'll plug in the
smartthings hub to start with this is
ninety nine dollars and all you've got
to do is plug it into your router and
plug it into a power source and then
download these smart things app for your
iOS or Android device it'll find your
hub it'll connect your system and get
you started and you'll be ready to go
with just the smart things have
installed in your home you'll be able to
track when your phone comes and goes and
then automatically trigger events based
on that so if you leave your home and
you want a z-wave control thermostat to
turn down the heat you can do that you
can set that all up and that's really
cool you can get additional sensors as
well there are a lot of things that are
smart in the smartthings catalog one of
the smart things be like a lot are the
contact sensors that they use we've seen
these in a lot of systems you stick them
to your doorframe in the door and when
the magnet separates it lets you know
that the door is opened or the windows
open door the cabinet whatever you want
the nice thing here is that these also
have built in temperature sensors so you
can use them to track how hot or cold it
is in a given room that's a really nice
feature in a very smart little
multifunctional device there's also the
motion detector you see this in a lot of
systems too but this one also has a
range extender built-in so if you
incorporate it into your system you'll
have a stronger signal and that's good
because the smart things up isn't quite
as strong as i'd like there's also a
moisture sensor there our fries
detectors and all sorts of gizmos you
can get for the system that our official
smart things gadgets also you can
automate other devices that are z-wave
or zigbee enabled using smart things now
no matter how many devices you add to
your system you'll control all of it
from the smartthings app for iOS and
Android devices it's a very good-looking
well-designed app that looks great but
it's a little cluttered and a little
confusing about how to create
relationships and set things up &amp;amp; turn
things off I wish that the app was a bit
more streamlined and a bit more
user-friendly because right now certain
aspects of it are a little confusing
like I said the smartthings hub on its
own is available for ninety nine dollars
and I think that's a great place to
start just because it can already detect
your phone out of the box however if you
want to get some additional sensors a
contact sensor motion detector or
whatever you want
I check out these smart things kits that
are available they've got a couple
bundles for 199 and 299 that seem pretty
interesting for cnet I'm reckless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
