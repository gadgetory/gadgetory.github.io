vehicle you are probably retired lived
in Florida not anymore
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
electric vehicles that are ready for
primetime
these are v's from major makers that are
all sold in the US
honestly that mostly means California
where the new law requires car makers
sell a certain number of V's but that
said these are all well sorted and
poised for mainstream success or at
least a good shot at it no golf carts
here and the prices I quote are will
destination charged but before federal
and state tax credits because we're not
a tax website we're gonna rank these
guys by their range on a charge and
their miles per gallon equivalent that's
kind of the MPG rating for an electric
car will also tell you where they fit on
the price scale let's go number five the
Toyota rav4 electric range 103 miles
Ege seventy six prices a little over 50
grand bass this is the new rav4 electric
not to be confused with that cut AB
warmed-over one that they did original
it's the only crossover on our list by
the way and it's a real fresh entrant on
the market it impresses us as the only
non Tesla product that has a Tesla
powertrain nice pedigree handles well
and that range of three digits over 100
miles is the only time you're gonna see
that until we get all the way to number
one especially impressive considering
this is also the tallest thing on our
list number four the Fiat 500e
range of 87 miles mpge 116 prices a
little over 32 grand
now this recent entrant comes in with
edge you saw great numbers on Range mpge
and price a nice trifecta it's more
refined better handling and more fun to
drive than a standard Fiat 500 charge
time is just four hours or so if you've
got a 240 outlet but I slot the Fiat at
number four because on a 110 outlet the
charge time is glacial 24 hours for a
full battery charge you'll have taken
the bus to a four-door Nissan dealer and
bought something else by then it's also
a little too small for most Americans to
take seriously
the same still goes for the Fiat brand
at this point number three the Ford
Focus electric range 76 miles
mpge 105 prices out just under 40 now
pushing 40 grand makes you say for our
focus but the car looks great it's
tacked up as Ford's off an arm and
leverages the underpinning of what is
already a great conventional compact car
plus it's got a very sporty demeanor
along with its green one and they can do
a real fast charge full charge in three
hours and change on a 240 outlet which
can mean hours less on the team than its
competitors the chief one being number
two the Nissan Leaf range 73 miles MPGe
115 now pricing at under 30 grand that's
part of why swapped out the leaf and the
focus on this list since the last time
we did it because of a massive price cut
that now makes the leaf the cheapest
evey that seats five now the leaf still
looks like Barney it's biased toward a
smooth ride more than a sporting one and
it charges more slowly on 240 than that
Focus but the new lower price lower cost
to charge and run and at least the
availability of a 480 volt charge if you
can find one are all compelling to this
market before I get to number one I can
tell you it will not be the Chevy Volt
or the Fisker Karma
as important of electrified cars as they
are they aren't strictly electric cars
they are range extenders that's a
separate list once there are five to
compare oh and the next time we do this
rundown the pending Chevy spark evey may
bump somebody off of it
our number-one electric car hands down
is the Tesla Model S range 208 miles MPG
e89
base-price though a little over 70 grand
now it's the first ev2 in car of the
year it's also like the highest rated
car Consumer Reports has ever looked at
it looks hot goes like hell has great
range and you can even option that range
up to 265 miles it's 17 inch central
cabin screen rewrites the rules of cabin
tech on the other hand the former base
model which got about a hundred and
something miles of range was just killed
off so now you start at over 70 grand
and if you want the 265 mile range it
started a little over 80 grand and up
still this car doesn't just accomplish
an electric conversion it converted the
market to be ready for an electric car
that really aspires we cover electric
and electrified car innovations all the
time that's CNET on cars.com i'm brian
coulis thanks for watching
