in San Francisco it is not enough just
to have free Wi-Fi in your hotel anymore
here at hotel Zetas we're looking at the
highest of the high tech hotel top we
have to be relevant in the tech world
technology is advancing so rapidly you
have to stay current hotels in the past
would update technology every three to
five seven years even you have to update
your technology almost every year
nowadays so what exactly is hotels edit
doing for starters they've created a
lounge so guests can play video games or
even call the family from the road over
Skype they also have a wii u console
running we street view which is a
virtual reality google map system that
gives guests 3d street directions and
what this does is gives you a 360-degree
street view map of basically anywhere
you want to go in the world we have
pre-loaded 70 destinations that is
fantastic no that's so much better than
the thing where I mean I appreciate the
thing but where you spread out the map
and then draw a little line at the pen
we're here and then that never works for
me okay so we can sort of navigate to
any landmark what are we looking for
here we rolling your bridge yay now we
don't have to go there in real life it's
so windy sure walk across yeah let's do
it oh look at this we're totally on a
date Duke to do well we're in the middle
of the street that's not gonna do it
let's get on the sidewalk what else do
people do when they're up here Dupin up
with this thing one of the things we
find the most is people like to show
people their hometown okay like if they
met at the hotel bar and then by the way
you have my
um that's where i was born held on that
way that's delightful oh I can
completely imagine that people do this
no yeah if they have a couple drinks
totally come on up i'm gonna show you my
house hotels around the country see tech
as a new amenity and a new way to bring
in savvy travelers at yotel New York
guests check in at touchscreen kiosks
and a robotic luggage handler takes the
bags hotel 1000 in Seattle has a body
heat doorbell that lets housekeeping
know if you're still in the room an aria
resort and casino in Las Vegas lets you
customize almost everything about the
room like how and when the lights and TV
come on and when the curtains
automatically open or closed at zetas
rooms offer some of the latest high-tech
amenities as well this suite is decked
out with a samsung smart TV music from
Jambox a retro Atari 2600 and a
streaming movie dock for your iPad so
this is our G linked by obsess and what
this does is any mobile device that you
connect to it there's a button on the
top that says TV you press it and it
will stream whatever you're looking at
on your mobile device to the TV oh
really oh here we go oh uh this was not
the movie as watching last totally is
the movie he was watching class my
girlfriend must have hacked my netflix
account so this is our jam box by
jawbone and it's a mobile sound system
where you can connect it via bluetooth
so basically you're just kind of gone
around and picked out great technology
to put in these rooms yes everything
mobile everything wireless for business
travelers that have built this high tech
conference room complete with a large
screen delta projector and Livescribe
pens well the last ride pen
allows you to record anything you write
in here in a session so it's already
recording right so everything we say I
be taking notes laughing and all the
notes that Molly records will be
streamed via Wi-Fi to our Evernote
account another great thing about this
software in this system is that we can
connect up to 20 devices to it via Wi-Fi
so completely eliminates the need to
have one person pilot a presentation
each person can have their own portion
jump in and out of the presentation new
rule all our meetings are going to be
here from now on of course all these
great high-tech features have their
drawbacks whether it's technical
problems or the need to constantly
upgrade the tech the hotel business is
competitive and managers are always
looking for an advantage it's funny that
there's almost like an arms race so to
speak with our comp set is everybody's
trying to find the newest latest thing
to one-up each other so it's going to be
really interesting to see what happens
in the next couple of years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
