reviewing the plant link smart sensor
this plant sensors job is to give your
plant a voice so that when it needs
water it can tell you that we do you
place this guy near your plant in the
soil this is going to communicate with
the base station the base station is
attached to your router router goes to
your computer and boom you can check on
your plant remotely at home anywhere
the online set up is going to ask a
little bit more of you than the physical
set up you're gonna have to identify
your plant type the soil type and then
you actually get to nickname your plant
but the first hiccup occurs when you're
identifying that plant type the online
database isn't gonna give you much help
there's no pictures there's no plant
information so if you don't know what
type of plant you're dealing with this
online database isn't gonna help you
once you're up and running this device
is going to tell you the moisture level
of the soil surrounding a plant then
it'll compare that to the range your
plant likes again it knows your specific
plant type and it can make a very
specific recommendation within an hour
others to give you plant specific info
take a full watering cycle about a week
at least by the time a full watering
cycle passes this guy is gonna have a
full calendar for you ready to go with
scheduled watering dates it's cool and
it does what it says it can do extremely
well they're gonna send you an email
when it's time to water from the
perspective of the plant you nicknamed
your gonna get your own plant emailing
you humorously begging for its life it
was great motivation for me to actually
get up and water the thing all of this
together cost $79 that said additional
links for this are only 35 meaning if
you've got multiple things to measure
and you want that smart technology it's
actually a pretty good buy the plant
link might not be the smartest or the
most comprehensive system out there but
it will give your plant a voice too
when it needs to be watered and if
that's something you need help with the
plant link might just be a smart plant
sensor that is worth checking out for
