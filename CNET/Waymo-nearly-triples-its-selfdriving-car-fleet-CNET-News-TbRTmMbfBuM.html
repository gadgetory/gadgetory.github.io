self driving tests alphabet the parent
company of Google spun off its
self-driving project into a new company
called whammo just last week the tech
now housed within whammo as a company
has been developed by Google since 2009
now way moe is taking delivery of 100
modified to chrysler pacifica hybrid
minivans chrysler altered the drivetrain
chassis and electronics to meet way Mo's
needs way moe will add in its
self-driving tech which includes a
computer sensors and telematics taking a
look at these modified minivans the
integration of the tech looks a lot more
natural and less tacked on however it is
still obvious that these are not your
run-of-the-mill minivans the roof of the
vehicle features a pod that resembles a
hard roof cargo box on top of that is a
dark dome that houses a spinning lidar
assembly lidar is used to map out
surroundings using lasers the dome looks
similar to those on other Google
self-driving cars also there are small
structures housing more sensors over the
front wheel wells of these chrysler
pacifica and then there's a way mold
logo on the rear doors so if those
alterations didn't tip you off the logo
should way mold previously had a fleet
of about 60 self-driving vehicles this
new addition will help weigh most speed
up its pace of research and development
to date those cars have racked up over 2
million miles on public roads for more
