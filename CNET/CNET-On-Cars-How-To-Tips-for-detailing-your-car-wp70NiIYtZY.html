kind of like this one but instead of
spending the next five years paying for
a new one how about you spend one
afternoon making this look like a new
one you get a sense of satisfaction and
a new looking car
now wheels with their complicated
patterns and dirt in every little nook
and cranny are breaths the best reason
to have someone else wash your car I
hate doing these that's why I found this
stuff the motorcycle guys turned me on
to it's called s 100 wheel cleaner if it
avoids you having to go through every
nook and cranny with one of these dumb
brushes I'm in next it's time to wash
the car and the first thing you do is
just get it real wet okay bucket number
one bucket number two this one's where
you're gonna make your soapy water fewer
folks do number two that's gonna be
plain water to rinse the grit out of our
wash mitt periodically so we're not just
spreading it around the car now what's
unique your suds Adam is an automotive
car wash don't go grab the strongest
stuff you got under your kitchen sink
and you don't use a lot of it Nick it is
a sponge but I like these little kind of
weird little finger II wash mitts saves
you a lot to get in there with your
fingers that goes on into the suds start
at the top of the car inside the wheel
lift around this rocker
oh here's an old trick the old guys use
they take off the nozzle and do a simple
rinse with just the hose they reason it
all comes off as one piece and takes the
dirt off better it's either a bunch of
BS or really brilliant physics but it
costs nothing to try okay Chuck the
chamois and look into one of these
deionizing filters for the final rinse
you can also find big ones on wheels
I hate drying cars okay all the major
stuffs been removed but how about the
invisible stuff here's how you know it's
there take your hand the one without a
ring on it
and run it over your paint can you hear
that you should never be able to hear
your paint but you can cuz all those
contaminants are stuck in it's like
upside down sandpaper we're gonna get
those off with a clay bar looks like a
couple of pieces of yellow silly putty
and little envelopes there you've got
this spray that you use to lubricate the
clay as it glides over your paint and
another rag you're gonna have a lot of
those when you get done just kind of
mold this thing out till it's you know
about the size of the palm of your hand
select a small area of the hood or
whatever panel you're working on get a
little bit of this stuff going there
that a foot square is what I like to do
and take this clay get it on there and
just go back and forth you'll know
you're done when it no longer sticks and
if you can see that but see all those
brown and black speckles in there that's
embedded grime that was stuck to the
paint I wish you were here on our shoot
location the difference between this and
this is audible and totally tangible now
if you drop this gun on the ground
throw it away you don't even want a
chance taking some net grit from your
driveway and working into your finish
now if you've discovered some new chips
in your paint this is the time to touch
them up before the wax goes on
okay finishing now with our surface
correction to get in one of the biggest
misunderstood areas about cleaning up a
car and that is polish versus wax
they're often mixed up in people's minds
polish is a micro abrasive that will
take off a fine layer of your finish and
delete scratches in it wax is something
you use to seal the finish after you've
washed clay barred and or polished it
whatever
combination most people have put so much
on that they get polish and/or wax down
in all their crevices you don't even
need to go within a half an inch of
crevices that way you never have that
problem let it dry to a haze takes about
a minute or two okay then a separate
nice dry buffing rag that's not moist at
all to get this haze off and that takes
almost no effort at all
now wax is something you put on to
protect all the work you've just done
put this stuff on pretty liberally and
again almost no effort here think of it
it's like a moisturizer or an aftershave
you just did a real deep clean now you
want to put something back in there and
make it feel good now tiresome folks
think putting tire dressing on looks
tacky
others think detailing is not done until
you have put it on it's up to you I use
armor-all but I get the low Sheen
natural finish stuff I just spray it on
leave it on I don't rub it in or
anything like that
all I do is take off the excess after
I'm done I'm not taking a break the
old-school trick is to take newspaper
want it up get some window cleaner on it
and use that to polish your glass today
we have a more high-tech solution and
that stuff like rain-x which turns your
glass into a more sealed more
hydrophobic environment it balls this
stuff in kind of like a Polish or a wax
and once it dries to a haze you buff it
off you'd be amazed how the water runs
off look here as I spray with a water
bottle on the side of the windshield
that I did seal the side that I didn't
you can see that water just runs away on
the rain-x side it's good stuff
Chrome cleans up great with glass
cleaner you can also use real fine steel
wool if it needs it but only if it's
real metal there are lots of products to
restore those faded black parts these to
work pretty well for me though none of
them do it permanently
next thing is Lexel is great for leather
you're probably seen this stuff it's not
cheap but it really works and if you've
got extremely stiff dried-out leather
take a bit a little sloppy handful
massage that stuff in till it's a wet
mess then leave it that way in fact I
might even put a little plastic over it
keep it moist Park it for a day or two
out of the Sun come back and wipe off
the excess that leather will have come
back to life for general use around the
car like this once again
low Sheen armor all same stuff we use on
the tires and when you're doing your
glass I use a non ammonia glass cleaner
spray away is a great one this stuff is
great for the glass as well as we
mentioned earlier great for the chrome
getting these little crevices where
chrome and bezels meet that's where this
little eraser pencil comes in handy just
come along in there and just dial around
that area and then give it a quick brush
you may think this stuff is tiny but in
sum this is what says new and fresh to
your eyes not the broad stuff like just
smearing some armor all around okay
you're just about seeing the light at
the end of the tunnel of your detail
what do you do to keep the car nice day
to day first of all keep one of these
big old car duster brushes in the trunk
don't use it on a filthy car but if it's
dusty these are great they sharpen the
car right up glass cleaner is great for
glass as well as for chrome bright work
around the car again real quick spray it
on microfiber rag take it off and then
you've got these instant Detailers a lot
of brands of these give it a quick
spritz with this wipe it dry it's kind
of a cleaning waxing all-in-one nice
half a day is about what it's gonna take
you to do your car right when you're
done you got a car that looks phenomenal
it's actually more fun to drive because
you just feel good about it I'm sure you
got some great detailing tips that I
don't know said them to me on cars at
cnet.com and I believed your car cleaned
up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
