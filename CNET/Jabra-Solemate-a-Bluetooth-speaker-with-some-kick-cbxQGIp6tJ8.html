cnet.com and I'm here with the Jabra
soulmate this is a compact bluetooth
speaker and it does have unique design
it does look a little bit like a sneaker
and follows in the footsteps of the
Jawbone Jambox
it's a little bit bigger than the jam
box and it does offer a little bit
bigger sound I can't say the sound is
all that much better than the jam box it
is bigger it this does fill a small to
medium-size room with sound and it does
sound pretty good and I think a lot of
people will be impressed with its sound
at higher volumes it does get a little
bit harsher sounding is a little bit
muddier but admit to maybe level seven
or so it can play pretty loud and does
sound fairly detailed and offers good
bass it does have that treaded underside
that does look like the sole of a shoe
and what's good about that is that this
thing doesn't move around when you're
playing it at higher volumes some of
these smaller speakers when you pump a
lot of bass through them they will shake
a little bit this one however is stable
it also does have this little loop on
the side it makes it pretty easy to
carry around like that everybody will
carry around like that but I did find
myself using that loop this also comes
with a special carrying bag that bag
allows you to put the speaker inside the
bag sound gets out but it is
water-resistant sand resistant so it is
good for taking to the beach with you
the jam box of course comes in multiple
colors this one however only comes in
two this is the black version there's
also a white version the last
interesting feature is that there is a
line in court built into the bottom of
the unit it fits right into the tread
and hides away you can then pull it out
and use it with non bluetooth devices
and it is a nice feature to have that in
many ways this is very much like the
Jawbone Jambox it does have voice
prompts when you turn it on and when you
pair the device also it does have a
built-in speakerphone a battery life is
also pretty decent you get about eight
hours of music out of this without
having to recharge and all in all this
is a very solid speaker it does
cost $199 there's a lot of competition
in this market right now the jam box is
right around 179 there are a lot of
other speakers at $1.99 so I can't say
this is an incredible deal at that price
I'd really like to see it around 149 but
it's certainly a solid compact Bluetooth
speaker I'm David carnelian that's the
Jabra soulmate Bluetooth speaker thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
