in the world that's right it's a French
experimental boat called Leto up there
and this 70-foot trimaran with its
marine style wings practically flies on
the water I took a ride with its skipper
Allan table who first dreamed up the
design as a young child when I was back
at school I was ten I explained my
teacher I want to stop my studies I want
to fly why didn't you return you started
designing then it's one life yeah and
the engine is passion I have no watch or
no calendar on the schedule noticing
just the winner my paper my pen my
passion the first time I thought about
the premi√®re fois AHA man when I started
I started on a scale model a wooden
scale model and support the stability no
was not good and progressively after I
wanted to design another one a one-third
scale model I was living outside I had
no house and during six months I was
outside with my carbon fiber my
aluminium and I had a first help from
our logic engineers you say what are you
doing so crazy project it was edema I
was a 18 somehow you have gotten people
to give you money to keep building
flying boats yes look I started not have
that job I was his passion has taken him
all over the world chasing sailings
biggest speed records we also go we
broke the absolute speed record over one
of the columella our top speed was
around the 56 not 105 kilometer
in case you didn't get that he said 56
knots
that's almost 65 miles an hour and it
feels even faster when you're on the
boat the technology that makes this boat
so fast mostly comes from airplane you
have the wing design right Bernoulli
principle to get lift okay in the water
it's exactly the same we use wings
working in the water and we create over
12 knots we create lift to both take off
and the hulls are out of the water there
is no drag and progressively is as the
acceleration is really powerful because
we have no drug over 100 kilometers were
only 2 square meter in the water table
is not a one-man band he has a team of
five others including his co skipper
Jacques vensim Mycoskie Barranca Chekhov
was a time we won the world is the most
experimented guy on board but she's a
woman I'm changed I am changed for my
experience and result there
[Laughter]
here were Java one guy Sui on the deck
here in Litella so unless we insider
slipping or cooking or living here in LA
tell yes just come on the money it's a
hotel yes I'll return a.load on come on
Maria I will I will show you okay come
on
screw the kitchen here is the kitchen
here is the kitchen here the bathroom
and fork nice he is a duly comment
announcement you can enter here I'm
living here yes here yes here is our
measurement system engineer facing the
computers on me I'm living here inside a
the sweet spot to liver one is sleeping
here the bus and two guys here and love
only gonca the bathroom the kitchen
under computer on measurement systems
wait I thought that was the bathroom
[Laughter]
so now it's perfect never perfect
no never perfect but but I want you to
fly job done now I want to cross the
eight passengers implicit Transpac the
Pacific between LA and ry next spring
and after I would like to cross the
Atlantic in two days and a half with a
new boat a new designer among the design
at the moment and the ultimate dream is
to to fly around the planet but we need
to stay humble oh yeah one thing at a
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
