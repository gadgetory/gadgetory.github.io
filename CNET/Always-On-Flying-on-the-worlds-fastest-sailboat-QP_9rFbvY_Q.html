in the world that's right it's a French
experimental boat called lead off Dale
and this 70-foot trimaran with its
marine style wings practically flies on
the water I took a ride with its skipper
a LAN table who first dreamed up the
design as a young child when I was back
at school I was 10 I explained my
teacher I want to stop my studies I want
to fly why didn't you return you started
designing then it's one life yeah and
the engine is passion I've no watch or
no calendar on the skid you noticing
just the wind of my paper my pen my
passion the first time they exalt about
the premi√®re fois wait jalebi hey
homina everything is different on the
day when I started I started on a scale
model a wooden scale model and sabato
the stability was not good and
progressively after I wanted to design
another one a 1/3 scale model I was
living outside I had no house and during
6 months I was outside with my carbon
fiber my aluminium and I had a first
help from Iowa tech engineers you say
what are you doing you crazy
project it was a Rhema I was a 18
somehow you have gotten people to give
you money to keep building flying boats
yes doc I started you I not have that
job I was that job his passion has taken
him all over the world chasing sailings
biggest speed records we also go we
broke into absolute speed we called over
one article milah our top speed was
around the 56 not 105 kilometer
in case you didn't get that he said 56
knots
that's almost 65 miles an hour and it
feels even faster when you're on the
boat the technology that makes this boat
so fast mostly comes from airplane you
have the wing design right Bernoulli
principle to get lift okay in the water
it's exactly the same we use wings
working in the water and we create over
12 knots we create lift to both take off
and the holes are out of the water there
is no drag and progressively the
acceleration is really powerful because
we have no drug over 100 kilometers we
have only 2 square meter in the water
table is not a one-man band he has a
team of five others including his co
skipper Jacques Benson Mycoskie Barranca
Chekhov was a time we won the world yeah
he's the most experimental guy on board
but the muskie the most queasy
no honey I don't think she was afraid
she said with us yes yes she's a nun
knows a woman I know I am I'm not
changed I'm changed for my experience of
adult there
here were you have a one guy swings a
Decker here in litera so unless we
insider sleeping or cooking or living
here in LA tell yes
just come on the money come on this is a
hotel
yes I know tell a low-down come on Mario
I will I will show you okay come on
through the kitchen here is a kitchen
here is a kitchen here the bathroom and
fork nice is a duly comment announcement
you can enter here what I am living here
near the kitchen the door yes here yes
here is a our measurement system
engineer facing the computers on me I'm
living here inside a the sweet spot to
live one is sleeping here the boss
I'm two guys here and we've only go car
the bathroom the kitchen under computer
on measurement systems where I thought
that was the bathroom everything is
better in here
so now it's perfect never perfect
no never perfect better but I want you
to fly job done now I want to cross the
a passage simply the Transpac the
Pacific between LA and ry next spring
and after I would like to cross the
Atlantic in two days and a half with a
new boat a new designer everything among
the design at the moment and the
ultimate dream is to to fly around the
planet but we need to stay humble oh
yeah one thing at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
