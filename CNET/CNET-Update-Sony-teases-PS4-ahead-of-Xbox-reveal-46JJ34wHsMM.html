bend your screens I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your Seanad update yahoo has
officially bought the popular blogging
site tumblr for 1.1 billion dollars
yahoo wrote a tumblr post about the news
with its own animated gif and i wrote in
the post we promise not to screw it up
over the weekend many tumblr users were
writing about how they were worried
yahoo was going to change the site for
the worse not only is yahoo trying to
buy up a slice of internet cool since
tumblr is popular with a younger
demographic but it also wants to drive
tumblr users to visit yahoo content and
as for making money off tumblr yahoo CEO
marissa meyer told investors in a
conference call that yahoo will look
into new ways to introduce ads tumblr is
massive there are more than a million
blogs with about 900 new posts a second
right before microsoft unveils the next
xbox console sony released this teaser
video with blurry shots of the new
playstation 4 and if you look quickly
there's this rectangle and there's
something circular and another sheep k
well sony says it'll finally show us the
system on jun 10th at e3 in los angeles
there is some speculation that Apple
will be rolling out a new version of the
macbook air that's because several
official apple resellers are listing the
13-inch laptop as being at a stock
that's according to the blog
AppleInsider if there's low inventory at
authorized Apple outlets that usually
means Apple's holding off on shipping
more because the new model is about to
be revealed Apple has a developer's
conference in June so maybe we'll have
to wait three weeks to know more the
future just got more flexible LG says it
has a bendable and unbreakable
smartphone screen and it's going to show
it off this week at a tech exhibit in
Vancouver Canada LG's OLED screen is
apparently thinner lighter and more
flexible than conventional LCD displays
and last month LG said it's going to
launch a smartphone with this flexible
screen at the end of the year LG is not
the only one testing out this technology
samsung demoed a bendable and roll
will display during CES in January if
you visit Pinterest you'll notice there
are new types of pins with more details
if you pin a recipe from a magazine you
don't just see the photo it also has
details on ingredients needed pins
shared about a movie could include names
of the cast and a rating but it only
works with third-party websites that are
working with Pinterest to include this
extra data you could also come across
the pin button in some mobile apps as a
new way to share something that's your
tech news update you can find more
details at cnet com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
