Android that's the good news but there
is some bad news
most Android users don't have access to
it Samsung announced today that the
gaming phenomenon be exclusive to with
Samsung Galaxy s7 or newer devices until
August well what's interesting is that
it's not available on the Google Play
Store that's right
you have to use Samsung's own game store
to download the game to access the game
store go to settings advanced features
then games and turn on the game launcher
you can find the game launcher with the
rest of the apps once in the game
launcher you can search for fortnight
there you'll find the four megabyte
fortnight installer the launcher will
then download the almost two gigabytes
game annoying yes
but that's the way for my developer epic
games by avoiding the Google Playstore
they conveniently avoid google taking a
30% cut from all in-app purchases
considering that fortnight and iOS has
made 100 million dollars in just three
months epics saving a big chunk of
change
epic won't officially say that's the
reason that's a pretty strong incentive
epic CEO Tim Sweeney pulled see net last
week that open platforms are an
expression of freedom the freedom of
users to install the software they
choose and the freedom of developers
release software as they wish with that
freedom comes responsibility that
responsibility now falls partially on
epic since there have already been a
rush of Port Knight knockoffs hitting
the app ecosystem with the time being
we're just talking about Samsung times
we played fortnight on the galaxy s 9
plus and it's the same for tonight you
continental of obviously the mobile
version as inferior controls without a
physical controller but it runs smoothly
and there are plenty of players thanks
to all the possible functionality with
important the all-important draw
distance is solid but your battery may
be paying the price of all you planning
we lost over 60% of our charge and about
the power of but
as for the rest of you Android users
you're going to have to wait until beta
access is released over the next few
days you can sign up for the beta right
now it's for tonight calm slash Android
but if you can't wait for tonight is
available on PC switch ps4 Xbox and yes
