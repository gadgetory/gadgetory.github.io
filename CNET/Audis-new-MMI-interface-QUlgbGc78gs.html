you'd expect to see lots of cars lots of
people by the way but one of the things
that caught my eye the most was actually
about this big a display of some of
their new ideas for mm I there in car
control interface come take a tour with
me okay first of all here's the present
audi MMI if you're not familiar with it
you've got a knob you can turn and click
you've got four regions around at that
map to menu choices on the screen
corners you've got this multifunction
panel with a knob for volume and on/off
and over here the newest thing you've
got this touchpad that could also do
handwriting recognition so that's the
state-of-the-art great but a little big
they found in the little tiny city cars
they're showing now there's not enough
console a real estate so what do you do
you do this take a look so here's a much
more compact way of doing all the same
stuff check it out the handwriting pad
is now on top of the knob and those
various buttons for radio media and nav
there now and a set of compact little
rocker switches right there and those
buttons that took up room for track
forward and track back those are now
integrated in the volume knob kick right
kick left look how small that is ok then
there's this one this is a future thing
not ready for market but it's killing me
it's very cool this fabric pad here has
Braille underneath it I mean not real
Braille where you can read the letter
with your finger but Braille like
regions of pins that are sticking up to
create little high spots so check it out
right now you can't really see this on
camera I feel a high spot for those
icons if I click on one
I now get a list and it totally changes
the pad now I feel rose that map to
those lines Isis you get what I'm
telling you here now I go to the map you
see all those point of interest icons
those are raised on the pad it works a
lot better than it tells believe me I'm
not sure if it's intentional but there's
like this little piece of black shimmery
silk / little bumps kind of obscene
isn't it gets attention three ways today
next year in their small cars someday
and all their cars that Audi's letting
you control the technology that is
really what cars are kind of all about
these days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
