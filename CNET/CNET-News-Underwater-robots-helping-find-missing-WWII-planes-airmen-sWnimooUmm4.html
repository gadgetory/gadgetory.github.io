I'm Sina at scar Tsuboi joined by senior
writer Daniel tournament Daniel just
returned from a trip to Palau in the
South Pacific what were you doing there
I was out there kind of documenting this
expedition by a group called the bent
prop project along with photographers
from the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography and the University of
Delaware and what they were doing is
hunting underwater in the seas just off
of Palau for airplanes that were shot
down during World War two where there's
thought to be as there are lots and lots
of Airmen who are missing in action what
have they found well this year right
before I got there they found two
airplanes one was a TPM Avenger and the
other one was an f6f hellcat and these
are planes that they've been missing
since 1944 what is the ritual but they
do find one of these down planes because
this is a huge piece of history obvious
right they took the boat to right over
the two different sites and they did
this twice once once for each site and
they had what they called a flag
ceremony after they folded them they
handed them to one of the bent prop team
members who and as a former Navy
lieutenant commander and he will
personally make sure that those flags
eventually end up in the hands of the
families of the airmen what is involved
in discovering these planes how do they
find them locate them it's there's so
many different pieces of that it can be
anything from you know an eyewitness
account from a Lowen who saw where it
happened
the team spent a lot of time at the
American National Archives looking
through you know old records trying to
find any anything that refers to the
planes being shot down then the
technology element of it which
it's a fairly new oceanographers have
these underwater autonomous vehicles
called Remus's and they look like little
torpedoes like $300,000 a piece and
they're they're packed with all these
sensors and cameras and everything so
they they are programmable they're
autonomous they put them off the boat
they sink down underwater and then they
go out on these pre-programmed missions
and they'll work these grids kind of
like going back and forth and back and
forth and back and forth scanning the
seabed the oceanographers will kind of
like literally go through like frame by
frame by frame of this imagery looking
for anything that seems out of the
ordinary what about the average tourist
if we were to travel to Palau can we
experience any of this World War two
history there's an old Japanese plane
that is there now it wasn't actually
sunk there apparently they they brought
it there to make it available for just
the average snorkeler but but for people
who are a little bit more adventurous
there's all kinds of things that are in
their original spots and that like you
know dive tours would but it would take
them out what are some other must visit
spots on Palau if you're gonna travel
that far so you have this lake that's
seawater and that has like rising and
lowering tides and in this lake
jellyfish lake you have millions of
these beautiful non stinging jellyfish
and they're just sort of you know
magical or slow moving around and you
can snorkel in amongst them as long as
you're careful well we are glad you're
back in one piece thank you so much for
sharing your stories CNET senior writer
