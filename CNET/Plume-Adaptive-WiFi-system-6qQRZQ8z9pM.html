system this is quite unique because
instead of just two or three hardware
units this comes in a bunch you can get
up to six unit here in a pack but the
true that you can use as many as you
want
it's already worked you take one of
these pieces here is called the bloom
part now connect this one to your modem
and then connect the rest around your
home one for each room and that's it
you're done now you have a Wi-Fi at
every corner and if you happen to extend
your home and have more rooms well get
more part and again you are done pretty
cool right what's even more cool is this
mobile apps here so you can use it to
very easily set up your network and then
view your home networks as a solar
system mesmerizing
now the not so cool part first is the
pricing now what does this cost
$69 you can get three of them for 179 or
all six for $300 but remember you need
one of these for each room and even a
small house can have a more than six
rooms so in the end that can be quite
expensive and the thing is if you live
in a small home even a single router
that cause less hundred dollars can get
the job done you don't need a system
second it's a performance now each of
this is quite small so the rent is not
so great but it's not a problem because
by desire if you have a one of this in
each room you are never more than 10 or
15 feet away from a part anyway in my
testing the speeds almost always
fluctuated between 25 megabit per second
- 125 megabit per second and even at how
25 megabits per second it is the slowest
ever seen compared with any other Wi-Fi
system or routers I've tested at 10 or
15 feet away that's set if you just want
to be online or stream Netflix it's no
problem because even 4k content which is
the heaviest streaming task requires
just 25 megabit per second but if you
want faster local Wi-Fi speed for most
serious things this set will not cut it
and finally there's almost no feature
well you can do port forwarding and
that's it no web filtering no online
security nothing else and you do need an
account with bluem this I before you can
make use of this system and the system
need to connect to the vendor at Oldham
and that means without the internet you
cannot match your whole network and the
vendor can know everything you do with
the system and by the way you need a lot
of woonsocket before you can use this
system and if you have a children or pet
this part here can be easily mistaken as
toys in that scale here's my solution
you get another set and give that out to
them to play with and if that's keep
them happy well then and only then it's
money well-spent almost as well span as
a temp you span on this video and that's
because I'm dumb go and this is the
bloom adaptive Wi-Fi system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
