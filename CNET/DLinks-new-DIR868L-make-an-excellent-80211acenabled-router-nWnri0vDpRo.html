h68 L wireless AC 1750 dual man bigger
bead cloud router phone dealing now if
you don't believe this is something
special try saying it name three times
in a row
in one breath now this is special not
because it's look like a cheap computer
speaker or a thermos but because it is
probably the best rail from dealing to
date now this is a gigabit router on the
back here it has four Gigabit LAN port
and one gigabit WAN port the one port
connect to the internet source and
provide Internet to the rest of the home
network it's important to have this fast
port because if you're lucky to have a
superfast internet connection such as
Google Fiber of Verizon FiOS this router
can handle it I'm not too lucky well
it's not too bad to have a fast port
either it's also a USB 3.0 port here to
host an external hard drive or a printer
this is also a true dual band Wi-Fi
router that offers very fast speed on
both BAM you're offered up to 450
megabit per second on the 2.5 gigahertz
frequency band and up to 1.3 VTP per
second on the five o'clock band now you
can only get the fast speed if you use
the 802.11 AC client with the router but
the rural support all existing Wi-Fi
client regardless of the standard now
this router here comes with a very
responsive and well-organized web
interface now in most billing routers
you can use this interface to access and
manage all of it feature and settings
including adding a my dealing a cow to
the router once you haven't done that
you can go to the my dealing portal and
remotely manage the router when you away
this is why it's called a clowder you
can reach it through the cloud but
there's more the router come with mobile
apps a few of them actually one of them
is the my dealing light mobile app that
allows you to also manage the router
when you are on your phone or your
tablet the second app called dealing
sharePort mobile is designed to stream
media
store on the connected external hard
drive to your smartphone or tablets on
the go or where at home in a local
network now this app will pretty well in
my trial you can find content based on
the type beat photo music or video you
can also browse it by folders the
playback is quite smooth when your local
network it's not perfect though for
example you cannot play music in the
background let me show you and it's gone
now even if you don't care about the
mobile apps you can still enjoy the
router that's because in my testing it
was very fast and also offer very good
Wi-Fi coverage and the good news is is
not too expensive either costing some
hundred and seventy dollars not cheap
exactly but cheaper than others for more
on the router check out the food reviews
calm and remember to follow me on
Twitter Facebook or Google+ or if you
don't that's okay and forgive you that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look at the dir 868 l could
use a bare name router from dealing
