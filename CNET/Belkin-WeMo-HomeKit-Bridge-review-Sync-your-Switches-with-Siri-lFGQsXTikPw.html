your lights and appliances or control
them right from your phone now the new
Wemo bridge for apple homekit wants to
let Siri take control to plug it into
your router and sync it up with Apple's
home app on your iOS device and you'll
be able to control most of your existing
Wemo accessories alongside other home
kit compatible gadgets or turn things on
and off using Siri commands available
now the Wemo bridge retails for $40 and
that actually seems pretty fair to me
after all if you want to control your
remote gadgets using an assistant like
Alexa or the Google assistant but you'll
need to spend at least that much on a
compatible smart speaker like one of
these asking $40 to add Siri into the
picture seems like a reasonable ask in
comparison is the nice thing here is
that the Welo bridge is really easy to
use you plug it into your router using
the attached to nine inch LAN cable and
then you plug it into power with the
included micro USB cable open up the
home app and tap the little plus sign
icon to add a device then select the
Wemo bridge from there it'll
automatically import all of your devices
into the home app like a bouncer
checking their IDs and letting them
inside the home kick Club one more thing
I like about the Wemo bridge is that it
supports a pretty wide assembly of giemo
gadgets along with the current gen Wemo
mini and MIMO dimmer devices like this
original first should we little light
switch and even the first gen Wemo smart
switches that aren't even sold anymore
are all supported by this home bridge
plug it in and the all be home kit
compatible now Belkin told me that we
Mo's wired motion detector would be
supported as well and indeed the Wemo
bridge brought it over into the home app
when I tested it out however it was
often unresponsive and the home app
couldn't even tell that it was a motion
detector to begin with so I couldn't use
it
I suspect that more fine-tuning is in
order hopefully apple and Belkin find a
fix in all in all I think this is a good
product at a fair price that works as
promised if you've been patiently
awaiting the day when Syria can turn
your Wemo gear on and off and all the
lights and appliances you've got plugged
into them then your wait is over
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
