latest laptop last year the company came
out with its first clamshell laptop and
that was comparable to the Apple MacBook
but this new model is more comparable to
a MacBook Pro that's because it offers
more than just two USB C ports and it
has a few useful new features that last
year's model doesn't have one of the
most standout editions is the discrete
webcam instead of being located on the
top bezel the wide-angle camera is
hidden as a spring-loaded button between
the f6 and f7 keys simply present wants
to open the webcam and again to close it
it's definitely a unique security
feature but the unflattering low angle
is a very unfortunate trade-off the
laptop also adds a slick new touch
screen with anti fingerprint coating
Huawei squeezes a 13 point 9 inch screen
in a 12 inch chassis giving the laptop a
91% screen to body ratio
it also has super narrow bezels adding
to its luxe appeal the laptop also has a
full sized chiclet keyboard extra large
touchpad made with graphic designers in
mind and the same chipset based
fingerprint reader as certain Huawei
phones
according to alway the laptop is made of
the same type of sturdy high-grade
aluminum alloy that's used for aviation
purposes so bending shouldn't be an
issue the laptop definitely looks trim
and trendy but laying a little under
three pounds it's heavier in comparison
to some of the ultra portable laptops
these days if the mate book x pro looks
like something you're interested in
buying don't get your wallet out just
yet Huawei has yet to announce pricing
or availability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
