and it's called photostream and it's
going to bring the cloud to photos how
many times have you taken photos on her
iPhone maybe of our kids in the
afternoon and wanted when we got home to
share them on an iPad and have to go
through the process of moving them over
wouldn't it be great if by the time I
got home they were already there on the
iPad well that's what photo stream is
going to do for us across all of our
devices so again I take photos on any
device puts it in the camera roll and
that will be automatically uploaded to
the cloud where it's stored and
automatically downloaded to all my other
devices including in this case a Mac and
so I've got my photos on my iPad just
waiting for me when I get home now in
addition I can import photos I didn't do
iPhoto as an example on the Mac it'll
upload those to the cloud and do exactly
the same thing with them by pushing them
down to all my other devices so it's
apps that I its photos that I take or
photos that I import and we built this
right into the apps I hope you've seen
that as we've gone through this we've
built this right into the app so there's
nothing new to learn
so photo stream on the iPads photo app
we've built it right in and right next
to albums we have a button called Photo
Stream you push it and you're looking at
the photo stream it's that simple
there's not a separate app that you have
to go learn it's right there in your
Photos app it's right there in your
Photos app on your iPhone it's just
right there with all your other albums
there you go photo stream
on the Mac on the Mac we built it right
into iPhoto and so it's right there on
the side your photo stream and on a PC
they don't have a Photos app so we use
the pictures folder right in addition to
that we've even built it in to Apple TV
so Apple TV Apple TV talks directly over
to the internet directly to the photo
stream servers doesn't even go through
your PC talks directly the photo stream
servers so you can watch the photos
right on your Apple TV so one of the
problems we faced was that will photos
are large and will use up all the memory
on your devices
there are also large they'll consume
vast amounts of storage in our server
farms so we've came up with a great
scheme we're gonna store photos on your
devices we're gonna store the last
thousand photos right let's store the
last thousand and any photos you want to
keep permanently just move them into an
album and they'll stay forever but
they'll be parading by you the last
thousand photographs on your Mac or PC
because we have more storage will store
all of them you can get rid of them by
just deleting them but we'll store all
of them and on the server will store
them for 30 days which is more than
enough time for all your devices to
connect and automatically download those
photos so we think we've got a great
system here that's gonna move our photos
around among all of our devices even
Apple TV so that when I take a photo
anywhere I can view it on all my other
devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
