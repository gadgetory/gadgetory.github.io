testing floor here in sunny Louisville
Kentucky and this is our refrigerator
buying guide video I'm standing right
next to the LG smart think refrigerator
and this is an example of a French door
model and also a smart refrigerator it's
a very nice high-end unit and that's
pretty typical for French door
refrigerators they tend to be bigger
they tend to have a lot more features it
tend to be the nicest and most expensive
refrigerators you can buy for your
budget though you might be looking for
something a little simpler and don't
worry there are plenty of types
available and plenty of variety to
choose from now this fridge has a
capacity of 31 cubic feet and that's
quite a lot the average adult needs only
4 to 6 cubic feet that's about two many
refrigerators worth and if you have a
big family this might be great but if
you are just looking for a fridge for
your apartment or want to share with a
roommate or two this is probably too big
and you'd want something a little
smaller and simpler and so for that you
might want to start by looking at a top
freezer unit and these are the simple
basic old-fashioned refrigerators that
we all remember from childhood freeze
our on top refrigerator on the bottom if
you go the top freezer unit you're going
to have a lot of variety to choose from
and they're going to be at a bargain
they're very cheap compared to one like
this so you can find a very nice unit
that's top freezer but has some nice
features not as much as this no smart
screen or anything like that but will
still do the job for a budget fridge you
might also want to look at a bottom
freezer unit and that's exactly what it
sounds like it's a top freezer
upside-down
you've got the freezer on the bottom and
the fridge on the top so if you want
clothes easy access to your frigerator
ingredients and don't care too much
about bending over to get into the
freezer then a bottom freezer might be
for you if you want something that's a
little more feature-rich than the
standard top freezer or bottom freezer
but maybe not quite as expensive as a
unit like this then maybe check out a
side-by-side unit these tend to have
more bells and whistles built into them
not quite so much as one like this but
some do and they tend to be a little
less expensive than French doors once
you lock down exactly what type of
fridge you want and how much space you
need inside of it you'll probably want
to turn your attention to the style and
features that are right for you
one style that's particularly trendy
right now is to go with a cabinet depth
model and these are refrigerators that
are built by perfectly flush with your
cabinets and that gives it sort of the
look of a built-in custom fridge without
actually having to build anything in as
far as features go I recommend you take
a look at what foods and ingredients you
buy a lot or eat a lot and love to have
and think about the features in your
fridge that can take good care of those
things if you eat a lot of frozen
dinners or you like to buy food in bulk
and then freeze it to save money you
might want to look for a unit that can
protect against freezer burn if you like
frozen pizza you might want to look for
a unit like this Samsung that has a
special pizza drawer that can make
storing them really easy are you a wine
enthusiast
there are fridges that have built in
wine racks maybe you'd like to throw a
lot of parties in that case look for
units to have flexible shelving and
storage options so you can fit party
trays and giant cases of soda and of
course there are an increasing number of
smart refrigerators like the LG right
here on the market today so if you want
a smart fridge take a look at it they've
got some cool features this one's got a
touch screen there are some of you can
control by your smartphone there are
others that have Smart Energy Efficiency
settings and those are kind of valuable
because in most houses the refrigerator
is the biggest power hog for more
helpful buying info check out the rest
of our buying guide and also check out
our review section to see which
refrigerators we like the most for CNET
I'm right Chris
