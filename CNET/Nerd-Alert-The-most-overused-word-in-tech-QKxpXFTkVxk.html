Valley you're surrounded by a lot of
people who are in some way connected
with the tech industry either you work
for a company or you do PR for them or
you write for a publication covering
tech like em yours truly and one thing
that I always here and I hate it every
time I come across it is the word
disrupt disrupt is the most overused
over pitched over everything buzzword in
Silicon Valley I actually feel sorry for
the first person who might have used
that word to pitch a genuinely
disruptive product like a television or
something if you are like Nikola Tesla
talking to me i don't know the chicago
world's fair or something with some
booth babes telling me that you're
alternating current will disrupt the
system fine that's all good these days
though know your Tupperware party Airbnb
service will not disrupt anything your
tinder app but for dog lovers singing
nope not a disrupter and the only thing
you're smart step counter health tracker
stock will probably disrupt is my social
life because everyone will find out that
I use it and call me a loser disrupt is
basically the HPV of Silicon Valley
lexicon because nearly every person will
say it and mean it at some point in the
end it's just lazy copy Peggy Olson
would be ashamed of you because if
you're not going to spend enough time
constructing a compelling narrative
around your product well then who's to
say the product itself isn't phoned in
as well it's an annoying term and I'm a
millennial so trust me I know a lot
about terrible words because I Yolo and
swag and all that good stuff and so
disrupt just needs to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
