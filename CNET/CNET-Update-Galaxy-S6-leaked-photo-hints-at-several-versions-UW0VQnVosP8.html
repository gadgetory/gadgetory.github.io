a few different flavors I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update it
appears that the upcoming samsung galaxy
s6 will come in several styles and
that's according to exclusive images
obtained by cnet Korea and our sister
site ZDNet Korea a South Korean
electronics distributor provided the
images that show different versions of
the s6 including an edge style version
with a screen that curves over the sides
we're only publishing one photo though
to protect the sources identity the
galaxy s6 is expected to be revealed at
an event on march first during Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona Mobile World
Congress is a major international trade
show where we learn about upcoming
smartphones and tablets and one new
brand of phone you may soon hear more
about is Polaroid yep Polaroid is making
Android phones and a French Android news
site reports that there's going to be
several models called the Thunder the
omega the cosmos and the Phantom I hope
they have some feature built-in for when
you shake it you know Polaroid for its
cameras but actually it's not a stranger
to the Android world it makes some
tablets including 24 kids and speaking
of obscure smartphones the first boom
boom to phone is going on sale soon now
if you're saying boom what that's okay
it's mostly only known by tech nerds and
developers right now the boon to
operating system is open source and it's
different than what's out there now
because it won't have traditional apps
instead it has these home pages called
scopes that blend information from
multiple online sources a nearby scope
will show whether restaurants from time
out and even nearby reviews from yelp
your future phone may not scratch so
easily the smartphone glassmaker Corning
revealed that it's making a new type of
Gorilla Glass material that's both tough
and scratch resistant the composite is
nicknamed project fire with a pH and
it'll sell it to smartphone makers later
this year in other news if you own a mac
computer new photo library software is
coming soon Apple's killing
photo and the photo editing program
aperture and replacing it with the
program simply called photos a developer
version is being circulated now and we
have some details up at cnet but most
folks will be getting it as a free
software update in the spring as part of
OS 10 Yosemite and the navigation of
photos is similar style to what you find
on the iPhone the whole thing is
designed to make it easier for you to
move photos between your iPhone your
desktop computer and what you save to
iCloud storage it will have tools to
tweak your images but don't think of it
as something that can compete with
Photoshop that your tech news update you
can find more details at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
