here man I'm just fixing this from a
second no no I'm waiting for a girl to
call me right now when you're messing
things up and I'm the idea and I need to
do this then do it fix it fix it you
know what I'm done jerk whatever says so
what's good Brian song here and welcome
to the apple pie for all the good of bad
inside the world's baffle and you guys
can't escape the hottest rumor about the
Cupertino kitties latest project yep
Apple is working on a SmartWatch now the
story broke in the New York Times that
the big a is experimenting with
smartwatches made out of curved glass
they say the watch would use Apple's iOS
platform and Corning the makers behind
Gorilla Glass have developed a bendable
glass called willow glass and the device
would stand apart from others because of
their understanding of how glass can
curve around the human body now
Bloomberg added in their own report that
a team of about 100 product designers in
software and hardware are working on a
wristwatch computer which shows it's
really past the experimentation phase
and in the development phase now we
already know about the Kickstarter
project pebble that started shipping
last month and at the time we call it
the best SmartWatch ever Tim Cook has
commented on wearable technology calling
it an interesting area but the book
hasn't been written on it yet now my
take on the Apple watch I'm not a fan
until I see it and I'm not going to be
that guy connecting headphones to my
wrist to listen to music now no one's
figured it out yet but in past patent
filings Apple has been working on an
entire platform for wearable and
attachable computing several years ago
they recently refined that filing this
week and we're given the rights to
continue working on the patent it
includes movement monitoring devices
that's like an adhesive strip with a
processor detector communications port
and a battery that can track movement
and tag events with time and date
information and also it includes
event monitoring devices that could be
used to monitor and report humidity
chemicals heart rate pulse weight and
environmental factors now the two
devices could work together in concert
and could also be applied to things like
body armor or even weight monitoring so
these things may not be directly related
to a SmartWatch but it's clear that
wearable technology is an active area
Apple has been working on and you guys
do you even know what they might called
watch I have no idea now in some real
official news Apple has updated the
retina MacBook Pros with new processors
with the 15-inch model featuring a new
2.4 gigahertz quad-core processor and
the high-end model now between a 2.7
gigahertz processor with 16 gigs of RAM
the entry-level 13-inch retina macbook
pros are now two hundred dollars cheaper
starting at 1499 with 128 gigs of flash
and the 1699 model gets a 2.6 gigahertz
processor and 256 gigs of storage also
guys the 13-inch macbook air with 256
gigs up flash I know there's a lot of
flash there also dropped one hundred
dollars with a starting price of 1399
and the high-end non-retina 15-inch
model has been eliminated so bottom line
guys it's more bang for your buck across
the board now March is coming up and
Apple is typically had a major product
announcement so if nothing is happening
you got to leave it up to someone to
create a new story now Jefferies &amp;amp;
Company analyst Peter me sec expects
that Apple will hold an ITV related
event next month where Apple could
introduce a new SDK for Apple's new TV
platform but not the TV itself the loops
Jim dar imp will shot it down real fast
with a quick nope and really an event
just for that no way alright guys
there's always more Apple TV news and
Reuters reports that shares of German
luxury TV maker low surged after more
rumors that Apple is looking to put a
bid in for the company now loes designs
are very Apple s and the German
manufacturer is partially owned by sharp
let's see the hard drive company the
company's management team and the rest
is freely traded now a low spokesperson
told Reuters that they were unaware of
any offer and a rumor back in May of
last year was the first between the two
companies but was shot down back then as
well alright guys so the quick bites the
evasion jailbreak has now been loaded
onto over 7 million iOS devices so far
with a jailbreak update already
available for iOS 6.1 point 1 I still
haven't jailbroken mind because I get
tired of keeping up with the updates but
really it's some good stuff and also
forget about Apple's high-priced
lightning cables monoprice and Amazon
are offering their own cables for 1177
and 1499 instead of paying 20 bucks
before text so you guys should jump on
that and we missed this one last week
because the timing / show it happens but
apple reseller France systems to Apple
inform them that the new Mac Pro will be
arriving in spring of 2013 if they are
to be believed now this was after
finding out sales of the current mac pro
will be halted on march first due to new
EU regulatory requirements and you guys
before we go we'd like to say happy
Valentine's Day to everybody and if you
guys don't have a date right now well
