Mountain View California checking out
the Solar Impulse 2 solar-powered
airplane i'm here with pilot Andre
Borschberg he's been piloting this thing
all over the world so tell us about the
plane you guys just landed from Hawaii
tell us about your journey so far we fly
around the world with a method powered
by solar energy only and if you fly with
the Sun you need an airplane which is
extremely energy-efficient you'll be
able to fly through the nights and to
make it efficient we had to build an app
in very big it's bigger than a 747 with
the weight of a car this was the the
challenge the aviation industry told us
13 years ago it was impossible we
decided to delete ourself and that's the
result what are some of the challenges
you guys have run into during your trip
so far and understand the batteries get
overheated what other kinds of
challenges of you guys run into if you
realize it's an experimental evidence oh
you are discovering what you are doing
you know when you board the airplane you
have to be ready for the unknown we had
surprises I had the major equipment not
functioning of the departure engineers
wanted me to come back that was the
first time that the weather window was
improving over the Pacific Ocean and I
decided to continues but big emotions
big turmoil in the team itself some
people threatening to resign it was
really difficult but you know through
phone conference and 20,000 feeds we
could agree that that everybody was
keeping the support on the project and
make it feasible and
it happens to be successful afterwards
every leg is a challenge because every
leg you discover something else the
weather can be different it's an app in
which is completely completely different
to what has been designed so it's it's a
constant learning process but so far I
think what we can say is that the
technology web here which is solar cells
which is electric motors which is
batteries we function in the same way
that's agreed functions on the ground I
mean if communities want to use
renewable energy they will do exactly
the same that what we do a discipline
these technologies are very reliable so
it's a demonstration here of what we can
do on the ground in our world in our
cities in our communities if you tell us
a little bit about the battery
technology that you're using on the
plane battery we use our lithium polymer
battery so quite similar that what you
have in computers what you have in the
test lock ask for example I think we
push them a little bit further because
weight is extremely important we made
them lighter but at the end these are
similar technologies that you can use on
the ground what is the top speed of the
airplane at this point the dog speed is
modest it's about 40 to 50 miles but the
big advantage is that you don't have to
go down to refuel now at least realize
we at the time of the pioneers you know
when the wright brothers so Charles
Lindbergh flew they were alone they flew
slowly and if you realize that from the
first flight of the Wright brothers he
took 66 years to go the moon this was
the trigger moment to make the further
development happening so this is a first
step in the direction of electric
aviation of potentially maybe green
aviation aviation using less or no oh no
co2 so it will take time to see this in
transport a plane but you need a first
step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
