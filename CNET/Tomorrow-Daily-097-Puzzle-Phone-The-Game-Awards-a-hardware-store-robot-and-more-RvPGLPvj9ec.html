entered the market for modular
smartphones a new award show for video
games we've got all the details yes and
a robot helper is officially put into
service at a hardware store right here
in the US that's scary yeah tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the Internet well
down to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scyther joining me once
again and kale anonymous yeah we got a
video game or show so can we just get to
this we have say we can get in a second
and second we're gonna get to that okay
so before we do that though we have to
have the graphic so let's hit the
headlines we're cutting right to the
chase thing it's cutting right to the
chase okay so very first story today
this is really interesting so project
ara is a google owned project that is
working on modular smartphone so you
know how a PC gamers build your rig you
switch things out you upgrade your video
cards all the good stuff upgrade ram
over time to solve it kind of the same
concept for phones so they want to use
like modular things well this company is
really interesting this is called puzzle
phone this is a new challenger
approaching okay yeah it's very
interesting so they say that they have
created this kind of sustainable smart
phone that will last longer because of
upgradeable parts so in a similar vein
of project ara but the way they do it is
a little bit different so project ara if
you've ever seen pictures of this it
looks like a Lego board like it's
literally just like pieces of a
smartphone all along the back and it
looks like a little puzzle this one
puzzle phone is what this is called is
three parts okay so they split it up a
phone into three different sections the
spine which is the LCD screen the main
buttons the speaker and the microphone
the heart which is the battery and some
secondary electronics and then the last
thing is the brain which is the
processor and things like the camera
okay nice so this is really cool so it's
a modular standard and what they're
saying is that basically those are the
three basic smartphone parts that you
would want to upgrade on you probably
for example want to upgrade things like
the processor and the camera at the same
time yeah so one of the things about
project are that a lot of us have kind
of had questions about is how viable is
it really for a consumer market because
it's really overwhelming I would imagine
to have to pick out all those parts just
like you would do building room computer
for a lot of people that's very
overwhelming they don't even know where
to start and so this company is saying
we'll listen we can do this and it can
be modular but we can make it really
soon
yeah it's very simple and if we have
three parts then maybe regular consumers
will be more apt to try it do they talk
about the upgrades like like you know
what you like I know what you would
upgrade but like did they have any
improvements that there would be like oh
this is the brain that's in there now
this is the next time here's and
hairspray okay so next step I would
imagine over the course of the next
probably a couple year or two if they're
on the same kind of timeline that
project Aras on we're going to start
seeing these sort of use cases where
they say well here's this camera and
here's a picture of whatever and then
like we're gonna switch it out for this
camera and here's this so I have a
feeling we're going to start seeing all
that but not in this particular video
that we pulled for today's have any have
any providers adopted this yet or is it
just kind of like a theory this is very
conceptual so far kind of prototype but
they did say that for an OS it'll be an
Android fork at first but then the cool
thing about this is that they said they
want to make it compatible with other
operating systems in the future so they
can encourage a huge development
community yeah so they want to be able
basically for you to say i want android
on this phone Oh next week maybe I'll
switch out the camera and make it a
windows phone cool or maybe I'll do that
like this is really cool stuff so I
think it's really fascinating I I love
and I've always said that the future of
phones is going to end up being just
like computers we had this sort of for a
while there we have this kind of
processor race where was like how many
cores can we get into a phone and now
we're at a point where just like pcs we
kind of plateaued out a little bit like
we're still getting better but we've
kind of plateaued to a point now where
people are like okay well what about
we're not modifying them like a nice
swap out parts like that's the new thing
yeah because you can't do anything with
an iphone but you're still not gonna be
able to do anything with an iphone yeah
no I'm just saying like in comparison
yeah speaking of rocky it looks kind of
big it looked kind of chunk I have a
feeling prototype device I mean it's
always gonna be a little bit bigger um
and more i look you're always gonna kind
of see these prototypes be a little
bigger than what retail would be but i'm
really curious i mean i suppose your
purchase but I'm very very interested
yeah just keep an eye on puzzle phone
cuz it does seem very fascinating okay
the game awards tomorrow about it
tomorrow the the game awards are going
and in Las Vegas and you can watch it
streaming on a device that's right it's
not on TV you can watch on twitch and
you can watch on your xbox and your
playstation want the whole list but what
of where you can watch it go for have it
ok you can watch it on PlayStation
Network Xbox Live we use steam twitch
IGN gamespot niconico MLG kotaku and of
course YouTube so basically on the the
lack of success of a lot of other award
shows a lot of us are excited about this
one because it's kind of fueled from
exactly where it should be which is like
you know people that are into the
industry so bright Jeff Keely himself
was partially responsible for bringing
this annihilation he's the ringmaster of
this whole thing yep there's a lot of
new categories ones that you know a big
big name company wouldn't have even
think to put in there and and there's a
lot of there's a lot of really good
judges so I can i assure with you some
of the the place the categories because
it's the thought I think it's the most
interesting well part of the most
interesting there's category for best
remastered game that's it yeah there's a
lot of that going on there is and that's
a really good idea a lot of work in that
there's also fandango's gonna sleep that
next year here we go again all right so
uh eSports player of the year so many
buds big in eSports yeah which is a huge
thing one of my friends is nominates
that's good well aren't you fancy a
trending gamer so anybody that's like
doing uh you know like you know the gate
let's play let's play life is a bank
fluence are in the gaming industry nice
that's kind of a popularity contest I
feel but we'll see how that goes are in
category so they are popular but but
then there's best fan creation this is
celebrating anybody who's you know
inspired by gaming and is make something
out and there's there's a lot of
variance in this such as twitch plays
Pokemon if you remember it's like yeah
put anything direction we did that on
the show we do best zelda rap ever by
Egoraptor there's there's and then
there's like a minecraft song so there's
a lot of really cool you know a lot of
the cool category I have to say the one
thing I always look forward to for shows
like this is the is the unveils the
reveals the trailers like they're saying
they're gonna have was at fourteen or
six or eight to 16 new trailers you are
never before seen world exclusive
there's no for if you could have your
kale
yes there's no fallout born but uh
there's and also Xbox says they're not
going to be revealing any Xbox exclusive
reveals so that still leaves
multi-platform PlayStation and Nintendo
all of which NPC all of which are
totally supporting this yeah I've heard
that not just a no-name show no this is
it a lot most of the triple-a developers
in the industry are behind this why not
watch it it's the first it's the first
one it's possibly the one that seems
like the most legit and like most fun
they're not like what and hosting is Kim
Kardashian it's nothing like that I'm
excited to watch it so hey I you know I
will I will watch it Oh game of the year
kit can we can we I know bayonetta 2 is
nominated okay so here that you're the
game of the year nominees kgotla let's
see if you guessed any of them for you
none or Dino aside from bayonetta to
attain a tattoo all right amazing dark
souls 2 good game a lot of people are
like darn it a dragon age inquisition
hearthstone whoo amazing and
middle-earth shadows in Mordor awesome a
zoo yeah so a great list I feel like
Dragon Age check this out check this out
making me what's happening are all like
like a medieval period things I mean
look at middle-earth fantasy swords and
stuff yeah hearthstone yeah dragon is a
little weird and dark souls except for
Bayonetta there's no future tech stuff
there's no like alien stuff which is
like iphone as rares or games no no more
games that crazy gonna be an interesting
year to see which which sword wielding a
baby dragon age dragon age I think it's
what are you ready you think dragon age
yeah okay so that's your vote I'm gonna
say middle-earth dragons of Mordor all
right no distractions a board or doesn't
why you see where my headset so there
you go her you got next sorry with that
geek out is doing down there uh so ash
bot is a robot that actually was
announced a couple of months ago but now
it is actually officially in service so
this is I was very excited to hear about
this I wanted to see exactly how was
gonna work in the real world before
talking about on the shove those
promises promises and so this is by
lowes innovation labs you're watching
the video here here's the robot is that
saw spot every time osh is for orchard
supply hardware which is the chain
that lowes actually owns so it's a
smaller chain that's a hardware stores
or orchard supply you're able to walk in
you talk to this robot you can bring him
the cool thing that they doubt about
this robot is that you could bring in
like a tool apart and say hey I need
this what is this and then the robot
could tell you oh hey it's over here
follow me and then they take you to the
parts section where you could get that
bit which is kind of awesome but the the
other cool thing about this is is that
it speaks multiple languages so in the
video they actually have somebody
speaking to it and Spanish it
understands really cool and you can also
ask it for things like I'm looking for a
hammer like and she's like I'm looking
for hammer help me find a ham or
whatever but here's the thing is that
this finally went into service so this
is the shiny promotional video that low
that Lowe's labs put together so we got
some real stories okay so now I get some
real-world use case our friends over at
ARS technica if you're familiar with ARS
technica I've got to go to go check it
out and there's actually one in service
now in Silicon Valley so there's a bunch
of reporters there and didn't quite go
as planned the robot they asked for
screwdrivers and it's which it separated
the word screwdriver and then it
couldn't understand what you're asking
for because screwdriver one word is
different than screwdriver to know so
didn't really get that and then once
they fix that as a like an error it they
were able to find screwdrivers that's
fine ah so what was the dude what was
the ratio like just by assumption would
do my assumption it seemed like it
didn't it wasn't great so as I got
seventy-five percent fail right you know
how annoying self checkout lines I was
gonna bring that up to like that it
feels like it's maybe like that where
you're gonna be screaming at this robot
just getting really frustrated but they
also said there were a lot of reporters
there and then at one point it just got
really confused and it was like I'm
sorry I just can't help like it just oh
no idea was happening so well you see
that's the thing is is that all these
things sound great but wrote like the
robot technology is not right so when
you wanna use when put in use it stuff
you've been to a hardware store maybe
you have or haven't and you see the
person that's helping people out and
there's using like a couple of people
waiting for them hovering ish yes I'm
always those always me I'm always like
huh
ring just going like well whenever
they're done like I'll ask and this
robot isn't be wandering around with
people helping old ladies Vivian just a
trailing line of people just waiting to
try the robot yeah the osh bot osh bot
b'gosh is that gonna be a thing so I am
in that's cool no it's I'm sure to get
better and the thing is is it is in use
which is it's always nice to actually
see something go from hey this is a
prototype to actually being used in the
real world even though it's a little
buggy still pretty cool yep so it's
phase one like let's get about a break
you might first gen you know what you're
getting right leg again it's like the
mechanical spider are wait until it has
hammer thrower arms oh yeah ya see it
should have some that are just like it
can dispense it like the whatever the
most common items are it can just
dispense those items that's one thing
that they're actually pretty excited
about which is down a collection of
course but they're like we want to know
what people are most commonly asking for
in the store so maybe she's right fine
oh maybe easy fun and probably also
raise prices but on that note we're
going to take a quick break we'll be
back in 30 seconds we're going to talk
about what we're into this week before
we let you go for the weekend like as if
you're in school and and then we will of
course talk about our phone talker for
the day and then we have something a
little different for user feedback so
don't click away tomorrow daily
welcome back welcome back welcome back
where we've returned and it's that time
of the week once again we're kill and I
discuss all the things that we are
obsessed with this is called into it I'm
gonna let you go first no why I you have
to go first oh I do so it's well we're
both kind of into this the PlayStation

up they're doing this PlayStation
experience that's allowing but it seems
like the biggest fans of PlayStation to
come and just have like enjoy everything
about playstation can play some new
games and even have some of the devs
come out and do panels you can ask them
questions stuff like that that's like a
PlayStation cut Plake on my desk I
station convention i I really from what
it seems like from watching the video
and I may just be easily influenced but
it seems just kind of like a celebration
doesn't really like there there you know
too many of their products are being I
mean I'm sure maybe absolutely
unreleased stuff that they're gonna have
on the floor like I know Grim Fandango
remastered is gonna be even at full I'm
sorry to bring it up twice but I know
that will be there cuz I saw tim schafer
tweeting about like that's gonna be one
of the things that's playable Oh
surround stuff that's unreleased yeah so
it's almost like III but for the public
you're gonna be able to go and make no
mistake they didn't pick this date for
no reason yeah good be game awards
remember i just mentioned that is the
day before this thing started night for
so a lot of you in Las Vegas for the
PlayStation experience who are also one

another great weekend for video games so
the 2015 nope 2014 brother sorry uh so
my thing that I'm into is actually
attached to the PlayStation experience
but it's in item specific to the
PlayStation experience and also you're
going to be able to buy it if you're
online this is the 20th anniversary
edition ps4 which looks ridiculously
awesome and I but I want it just shut up
and take my money tells me really not

event to get them no okay no no so
there's okay let's just take a look at
this it's actually great it's a grey ps4
just like the eyes and days of the
original PlayStation the first
PlayStation they take this unboxing is
like ridiculous it's my favorite this
box that it comes in you get a
playstation camera get the camera for
the ps4 you the eye you also get a
controller that's gray it's just it's
really really pretty you guys I want it
it's really pretty yeah it reminds me of
just laying final fantasy 7 this is so
just for us like mega ultra gamers
everybody else is like it's just great
it's just great guy she's just spray
painting spray ranges layoffs um it is
going to be limited to twelve thousand
three hundred units translation you're

is it where's it gonna be again okay so
you're gonna be able to buy it you will
actually be able to buy it first at the
PlayStation experience and do we know
how many of their selling man I don't
know but it might just be that you're
able to preorder it there like first and
then actual online pre-orders are going
to open on the sony playstation store on
the sixth did they say it's gonna be any
more so on saturday so well it'll be the
same day so it'll be the same day as
opening on playstation 4 you might be
able to actually take one from the
playstation store they maybe i'll have
them there i'm not sure that i can I
please I can't corroborate that that's
gross that's speculation pure
speculation yeah um but yeah so there
it's gonna be 500 bucks for 99 um which
limited edition yeah she's gonna be
worth okay salutes yeah a little more um
and yeah you get you get all the stuff
and if you and you'll be able to
pre-order it from what does it store
sony com on december six relievers
playstation or sony was sending us to
this event
Oh be that would be cool that would be
cool guys we'd like that next next year
next year we go to e3 it's we go to you
three yeah but I mean I get locked out
of stuff a lot in and in III it's like
even when your preso like actually
you'll be the president of company do so
I'm hoping with PlayStation experience
this actually helps minimize the people
trying to like sneak into III like maybe
that'll help like I wish like the other
two gaming companies would do these
things too like Nintendo Direct I really
like that they're able to do these like
demo stations like Best Buy and stuff
were you able to go play smash brothers
before it came out and all that I like
that and I think we should do more of
that I think the gaming industry should
do more of that I think about it's a lot
of fun why not why not give gamers more
places to like check out things that are
coming up like it will get gets people
excited cause we were really excited
about everything do you remember that
give that Nintendo thing at the end of
the Wiz yes just a wizard sorry it
wasn't the wizard the wizard was a movie
that I watched as a kid and I was like I
want to go to the video game
championship so bad and play Super Mario
Brothers 3 in the championship and he
found the flute for some reason sorry
and Lucas had the power glove on the way
and like you boy man what a great Fred
Savage film that's just fine in this
really I definitely if you haven't seen
the Wizard track it down I think it you
can probably see a we need to reboot the
wizard not with the wii u let's go Holly
and reboots a wizard with with the adult
versions of everybody that's what we
should do would be amazing no would be
pretty heavy engage on his arm like what
does it'll be oculus rift oh man be so
good okay you're to hear first all right
so uh we this is where we would normally
do user feedback so let's run a graphic
I know we said we were gonna read your
Suicide Squad tweets today but maybe we
lied maybe we fit it wasn't really a lie
it's more like an untruth I don't know
last minute change what you want to call
