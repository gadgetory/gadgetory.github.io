in lines double use and more now engines
are arranged and CNET's top-five best
cars of the last 12 months it's time to
check the 10 PC cars differently I love
them on the road and under the hood but
also check the tech and are known for
telling it like it is ugly is included
at no extra cost the good the bad the
bottom line this is CNN on cars welcome
to CNN on cars the show all about
high-tech cars and modern driving I'm
Brian Cooley you may have noticed the
latest thing in supercars is hybrid cars
look at portions 918 Ferraris laferrari
and of course the Batmobile MacLaren's
p1 perhaps the most audacious in many
ways among this rarefied breed what they
all have in common is combining a high
output gas engine with an electric motor
or motors to make sure they've got the
best blend of power and response no
matter what the performance situation
let's see how the marriage is going as
we drive the McLaren p1 and check the
tech
a mom look I got a hybrid no it's not a
Prius but a nice nice
whoa sports car this is let's go for a
ride in the 2014 Eclair and p1 enough
said
first of all what is a p1 it's a lot of
things a mid-engine rear-wheel drive
carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid active
everything supercar and when I say
carbon-fiber I mean carbon-fiber
everywhere the tub the superstructure of
the roof all your body panels in fact
there is no engine cover to speak of not
one that you lift use tools to take it
off when it's time for service otherwise
stay out of there
and McLaren tells me if you remove even
the largest carbon fiber panel on this
car the rear clamshell you can still
pick it up easily with thumb and
forefinger it's all about lightweight
super stiffness and high strength
you're gonna think I'm nuts but the most
revealing thing I did is not drive this
car but wash it when you get your hands
all over this body structure it is so
foreign I kept thinking of marine
structures and and fish now inside the
Batmobile I'll go looking for a bunch of
seat controls you have one fore-and-aft
that's it directly ahead of me is an all
LCD instrument panel not that novel
today but I'm surprised how unbusy this
one is it doesn't choke you with a whole
lot of information and unusual for
supercars this one's got a pretty
up-to-date comprehensive head unit it's
kind of like a baby Tesla in its
orientation it is a touchscreen as you
can see media choices are pretty
comprehensive navigation is pretty
digestible and this is very forward
looking for a car like this you got a
decent app suite including a web browser
also rather Tesla ask and tune in for
radio station streaming and podcasts so
unlike some super high-dollar
high-performance cars you're not gonna
be sitting there in the 1990s in terms
of cabin tech but now one of the stuff
it really matters in this car let's get
to our power train control starting back
at the wheel you've got your paddle
shifters on the wheel or two buttons
you'll find in no other car unless you
drive a Formula One car DRS is the drag
reduction system it's going to feather
out the rear wing to reduce drag down
the straight when you really want to
halt and then you let up on it it plants
you down again we'll try that later and
I pass is their acronym for electric
boost you can do it on demand or let it
happen automatically now to get this car
to really come alive you have to first
put it in active mode now you're digging
into the performance on the left is your
handling control normal sport or track
on the right is your power train control
with the same three settings manual
button here puts you in manual shift
mode of course the arrow button over
here puts it in full aerodynamic mode
race puts you in the most aggressive
mode entirely in fact you have to go
through two confirmation screens that
tell you you're on your own
it gets the car super low it puts the
wings super high it sharpens up all your
responses and it takes off all of your
stability control and finally the boost
button down here is interesting when you
hit that you now take the electric mode
out of the equation and it only comes on
on-demand and that's when you get back
to the iPass button this mo does as you
might imagine puts the car in
electric-only mode it can go about six
or seven miles battery only and of
course the plug-in hybrid you can hit
this button here to put it in charge
mode you've got a door overhead where
the charging port is takes about two
hours do a full charge offshore power
but of course the car will reach in its
own battery along the way the way it
does that's interesting it does not have
brake regeneration
it has coasting regeneration McLaren
does that so that the brake field is
always the same and never polluted by
having a regen apparatus getting in
between you and the pads
and back here under glass is the secret
sauce to our powertrain with the
emphasis on power
it is a 3.8 liter twin turbo v8 the
engine is 727 horsepower the electric
motor adds 176 the v8 engine has 531
pound-feet of torque
the electric motor adds 190 to totaled
up in engine math you've got 903
horsepower 722 pound-feet of torque and
all of that goes out through a 7-speed
dual-clutch transmission to the rear
wheels only interestingly not all wheel
drive your results are stunning 0 to 60
in 2.8 seconds the p1 weighs just over
3,000 pounds its mpg is 17 or a slightly
better 18 mpg II but who cares let's go
on the track so the new territory that
works boring here is this idea of
electric torque the kicks in while the
turbos are still getting down to
business it's a different kind of power
more than you've ever known before
because of that
electric motors have
and what McLaren tells you it's actually
quite interesting is don't worry about
running this car all the way out take it
up to the redline every single time
between the gear change you actually run
it in the mid-range to mid high of your
rpms and it's all there
wide open on the back straight just get
on it next thing you notice is this
incredibly intelligent suspension which
is anything about damping
as well as handling an active sleeve our
role of course leaves with a turn 11
hairpin there's no about awful anymore
than going through every mole turn okay
now to get the full barrel tasting the
p1 I'm gonna set it in a race mode I've
done that
now basically on my own a little
unnerving
why boy
I am a very good friend of seen it on
cars a little over a million dollars
what I want to try in particular is to
hit the DRS on the fastback straight we
get a feel for what it's like to have
that thing slipstream the car and you
get into a complicated thing here I got
a ship with right
the RS with the left bump holy God
what did that come from
four hours to my previous best machspeed
and I'm not even good at this p1 like
most MacLaren's reserves its last
surprise for the ride home we're
dropping in an auto mode and settling
back gives you an amazingly liveable
street car that wouldn't really be
fatiguing to commute it if you wish to
turn your office colleagues a particular
shade of green okay let's say I'm
convinced you want to buy a p1 here
comes the heartbreak they're all long
sold they only made three hundred and
seventy five of these guys this is
number 106 for example but the p1 really
demonstrates extremely well is the
existing knowledge of carbon fibre
technology that we've known about but
merge that lightness and strength with
this stout torque of hybridization and
the extreme active Aero management and
this is an amazing package it also
proves were on the cusp of an amazing
era special thanks by the way to one of
our CNET on cars viewers who loaned us
his p1 drowsiness behind the wheel
hasn't received the headlines or the
stigma afforded drunk driving or
distracted driving but maybe it should
we'll find out why when see net on cars
continues
new methodology from the triple-a
foundation for traffic safety shows 21
percent of fatal car crashes have
drowsiness as a Fault in their
estimation a full 33 percent of drivers
aged 19 to 24 admit driving drowsy at
least in the last month
that's the highest demographic and 28%
of American drivers overall admit to
drowsy driver alert systems who use a
variety of sensors and cameras to
monitor your driving behavior drowsiness
detection tech force arrived in model
year 2008 with Volvo's driver alert
control it monitors the car operators
input to deduce when the drivers
browsing Mercedes Ford and others
followed with similar systems that are
now the most popular type of drowsy
detection technology Toyota and Lexus
use a less common eye detection system
with infrared cameras mounted on the
steering column aimed toward the
driver's face the cameras recognize your
face by measuring where your eyelids are
seeing machines is developing a full
face tracking technology for passenger
cars that would build on systems it
already makes for truck train and mining
equipment Fujitsu is starting production
on what they call the feel of them
device that combines a band around the
drivers neck and a sensor clip to the
drivers earlobe for its senses pulse and
through that can predict drowsiness and
then you sound or vibration to wake you
up at the biometrics Institute of
Valencia in Spain they're developing the
hearkens system that uses sensors in the
seat cover and seat belt to monitor
pulse and respiration which is then
computed into an indicator of drowsiness
and going forward there's even
development of drowsy detection and
alert in future smart watch it pays to
double check how you feel when you're
driving and if the answer is drowsy you
don't need a cup of coffee you need some
rest
welcome back to CNN on cars coming to
you from our home at the Marin Clubhouse
of the Mount Tam Motor Club just north
of the Golden Gate Bridge you may have
noticed watching this show that engines
come in a lot of flavors the most
essential of which is its configuration
how the cylinders live next to each
other whether it's a v8 a flat 612
cylinder rotary in-line this is a key
part of the engines essential
personality makes for a good car tech
101
now I would need a miniseries to cover
all the pros and cons of the different
engine configurations but each is good
at or bad at and even then no two engine
geeks on earth really agree with each
other let alone me so we're not going to
go super deep into that instead I'm
going to lay out and visualize for you
how each major engine layout is done and
give you some conventional wisdom on
what its benefits are okay the inline
engine is perhaps the simplest most
basic and most common this is an inline
four one of the Ford EcoBoost motors and
this gets its name because the cylinders
are arranged in a line if you look down
from the top inline four is are very
common inline sixes are very common
these engines are known for being very
compact lightweight simple inexpensive
to build relatively and because these
engines are so compact and they're
almost square if you do up from the top
you can mount them either way
longitudinally running the length of the
car or transversely running across the
car and many different cars use one or
the other now the V engine you know
mostly has V sixes and v8s these days
although you can go all the way down to
V twins and motorcycles v4 Saab launched
afford have all made those back in the
day but the conventional v8 looks like
this here's your ford shelby v8 for
example and there's your V right there
in the front you've got one set of four
Pistons and cylinders that are laying
over this way another set laying over
this way it's kind of like it took two
in-line fours married them to one
crankshaft and just tilted them apart so
they could live in one space the key
here is that you're fitting a lot of
cylinders into a relatively compact
space especially when you get to higher
cylinder counts like six or eight or ten
this v8 if you made it into an inline
eight would be like this long it
wouldn't fit in just about any car out
there but by nesting it in a V
configuration you gain some width but
you lose a lot of length
the other key nuance around the engines
this varies by maker is the angle of
this V are those cylinders almost
touching are they laid out much further
apart the angle of
d is one of the secret sauce items for
engine designers v8s and v6s are also
known as being inherently pretty well
balanced and of course because they pack
a lot of cylinders into a smaller space
they do get a lot of power they're known
as high-performance engines in most
cases the W is in many ways a derivation
of the V the most common example these
days is the VW Group design that
includes a w8 in some Audi r8 a w12 and
some Bentley's and a W 16 in the Bugatti
Veyron now visualize this w as a pair of
V engines that are mated together to
drive a single crankshaft and in this VW
design each of those V sets of cylinders
are nested so they overlap a bit if you
run an imaginary line sort of down the
set of them this W has the V engines
benefits of putting a lot of cylinders
in a short space but also its own
benefits of putting a lot of cylinders
in a narrower nested space
now the rotary engine in the car world
this really means the Wankel rotary
engine that has been used in Mazdas for
several decades inside an egg-shaped
combustion chamber there's a
triangle-shaped rotor that turns or
rotates with the combustion in the
spaces that it creates as it spins and
geared down the middle of that rotor is
the shaft that turns and feeds the
transmission now because Wankel rotary
don't have a bunch of pistons and other
parts that are jerking up and down
violently changing direction every
split-second they can spin at higher
rpms and do so smoothly without
self-destructing on the downside they've
long struggled with high-ish fuel
consumption and emissions and a struggle
for a lot of power largely due to the
trickiness of sealing those three tips
of the rotor as it sweeps around the
inside of the engine and it's terrain of
spark plug ports and intake and exhaust
openings now let's talk about a flat
engine also there's a boxer or a
horizontally opposed engine this is one
of the most famous right here in a
Ferrari Testarossa it's a flat 12 you've
got six cylinders on each side as you
can kind of see there and on the other
side are six more and they are exactly
flatly opposed to each other 180 degrees
apart the point here is you've got a
very low engine because nothing sticks
up it can be a low motor that sits low
in the car giving you a lower center of
gravity great for performance and
cornering it's also an engine that is
good if you're trying to package the
body low for a low sleek design take a
look at let's say a Subaru BRZ they were
able to get a low center of gravity and
low nose because they've got a flat
engine in there these are called boxers
because they have pairs of cylinders
Pistons in them that are punching
together at one time in any given
direction flight engines are also known
for being very balanced because their
pistons and connecting rods are
literally in exact opposition things
tend to just work themselves out and not
have a lot of weird vibration or moments
that have to be counteracted with other
apparatus like counterweights
these are engines that are known very
well from Subarus they have fours and
sixes that are their famous boxers and
of course the Porsche 911
is a flat six to build on this basic
understanding of engine layouts make
sure you check out our car tech 101 on
turbos and superchargers that was back
in episode 15 and our car tech 101 on
horsepower versus torque that was in
episode 12 in a moment CNET's top five
rated cars of the last year when CNET on
cars continues
it's time to take a look back over 2014
and remember some of the awesome classic
cars the ex car team have been lucky
enough to get their mitts on before
crowning one car our best classic drive
of 2014 buy more from the ex car team of
CNET UK @c Netcom / r welcome back to
CNET on cars i'm brian coolie this is
the point in the show we grab one of
your emails this one coming in from
Steven M who writes a quick comment
about your recent review of Auto
Technologies at CES the first thing I
noticed was the gesture control
demonstration and the swipe left and
swipe right gestures that move the
cursor one category over what seemed to
be the homepage of a navigation unit
does that seem a bit too little or is it
just me he says if I had to make a big
old swiping motion every time I wanted
to go between nav and radio I'd look
like a dog
pawing at a t-bone steak yes maybe you
can do something a little more kind of
like the way Macintosh OS 10 spaces
works well Steven I'm with you in many
of your concerns about gesture
controlling cars now it's prototype
stuff right now but we've seen several
examples like the one you saw from CES
and I just have a concern that it's
different than using a knob a button or
a touchscreen but not necessarily better
now it's early days for this technology
but the developers of gesturing cars to
get several things right
first of all make it very easy for the
gesture control to know when you're
gesturing for a control versus gesturing
while you talk that's got to be teased
apart secondly it's got to be dead-on
positive the first time if I make a
gesture and have to constantly look and
see if it took and maybe do it again now
you've just doubled my mental load for
gesture as well as my distraction
looking away from the road and that's
going wrong this of course is our first
regular show of 2015 so it's that time
of year we always look back to the past
year at 2014's highest rated cars
according to scenic here are the top 5
out of the nearly 100 can we check the
tech on in the last 12 months
you know it's a sign of the times that
this I believe is the most diverse list
of top rated cars we've ever had
it's kind of like Noah's car carrier
we've got a diesel and a battery and a
hybrid and a gas engine car and mixes of
all those all making the list so let's
go number 5 the 2014 BMW 535 d this is
the car that proved to us here that a
diesel makes for a great sports sedan
fantastic torque
great handling average mpg in the low
30s real world and the diesel options
only about 1,500 bucks more so you might
actually earn it back and beyond in the
time you have the car
of course it's BMW so they make up for
it by insulting you with an extra charge
for a rear camera number for the 2014
Tesla Model S nobody does battery range
like Tesla so it's a car you can really
live with and go fast in and look good
in now like all EVs it still suffers
from charge time that is a huge multiple
of gas time even at one of their
superchargers but if you want to crash a
meeting of Silicon Valley VCS this is
your best cover number three the 2015
Kia Soul evie no Tesla but it's not a
hundred grand either for around 27,000
after federal tax credit you get 93
miles of range snappily delivered with
good performance and that Kia Soul
design that has made it the king of its
segment this is one of the few cars out
there that really feels like it was
meant to be electric number two is a
2015 BMW i8 show up in this and people
will think you just held up an Auto Show
the i8 is this traffic stopping ball of
carbon fibre battery electrification and
sensuous concept car lines unusual for
the Germans it's a plug-in hybrid that
can put that tech to work toward
efficiency or toward really remarkable
performance so in a sense you get to
gullwing cars for your hundred and forty
grand but it's still the priciest car in
our list
before I take you to our darling of 2014
here are three cars that were marked by
remarkable suckage each earning a
middling OK rating with just two and a
half stars the 2015 Infiniti q70
formance and bad ride quality there's a
twofer the 2014 Fiat 500l roomy for a
Fiat and a great sunroof but otherwise a
great argument for a Kia Soul and the
2014 Ford Fiesta se EcoBoost you better
like shifting a gutless car without
Navarrete modern interface to fall in
love with this one
our number1 CNET rated car of 2014 was
the 2014 Audi rs7 Quattro I shot the
video for this guy back in March of 14
and I could have told you then it would
likely a cyst it doesn't do too much
well just engine transmission
connectivity interface efficiency
styling and utility it does have a
problem one hundred and five thousand of
them actually but aside from price this
is a car that does the art of automotive
engineering proud
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
this episode keep those emails coming
it's on cars at cnet.com I read everyone
respond to as many as I can and of
course a lot of them make it into the
show as email replies or segment
suggestions as I'm sure you've noticed
and of course wherever you look for
video look for us we're probably there
I'll see you next time we check the tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
