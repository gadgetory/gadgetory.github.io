on April 28th it's one of the first
games that you can actually
realistically do local multiplayer so
we've got two switches set up the four
of us we're going to enter the first
mode and tell you what the experience is
like gasps gasps hop I'm gonna do great
there you go oh okay what here we go oh
we're not teams everyone for those yes
everyone every man from so seriously
sure Ally these controllers are not the
best these are rough how do I really
might want to wear the grip you want to
wear the the grip for extra top to
bottom in penis yeah
extra top button idea those little
buttons on top
oh those away if to tap it in to make a
to make yourself that left bumper is
that tiny little button no are you
serious it's not really yeah I look
right at it Perlas oh well this side of
the table wasn't very good at that game
was that wow so you really feel like
second claw your fingers in there to get
those uncomfortable if to like do that
yeah like I didn't even work out we do
with your right hand button you guys cry
that's your hot button right now is out
okay you could hold and drift and get
extra power
okay now we're going to try out for
player local multiplayer for grown
adults playing around a single switch
tablet you can do this
Nintendo really like to advertise the
fact that a group of four people crowd
around a tablet and we'll play it once
so this is what that actually looks like
with four grown adults it's an amazingly
put four person split-screen
all on on the switch I'm surprised
considering the way I currently feel
it's choppier then it's definitely chomp
here so I'm on the bottom right I've
discovered that no no that would be
happen no no I'm the bottom right you're
sure yeah cuz look the way you guys
don't even know what I'm blue blue haird
thing let me try oh wow on the fourth
place we did pick a very dimly lit
course it is horrible
how do you guys like these controllers
kairu terrible awful ideas are great
last resort but if you're trapped on
where else you gonna do I feel you're
separate air rollers I guess you're not
gonna carry around four separate now pro
controller if you I keep saying about
the rares you gotta line the grim
setting me i right now did it I'm in
first place
I can't even celebrate him now a night
in Lehane my whole body heard is not the
best one thing that we're player
I agree the one thing that you we
haven't done with this that would make
this better would be if you dock it if
you put this on a large screen TV no but
just that's why you have four players
for screen we're at the park right now
yeah those house is not as good there if
there's no TV here this is what we have
to do if you're all lying on two on top
of each other or right next to each
other I feel like if we're sitting on
each other's laps he might have been a
little better yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
