welcome to the Apple Viper all the good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
get to it and we start with more iPhone
news but not iPhone 7 stuff we're
talking i phone eight or whatever they
call the 10th anniversary edition phone
now the verge reports that Apple is
staffing up on wireless charging experts
including a couple from wireless
charging start-up you beam and has hired
more than a dozen overall in the last
two years earlier reports from Bloomberg
claimed Apple was looking to finally add
wireless charging to its phones in 2017
I repeat in 2017 now with a more
advanced technology that would allow you
to really walk around a room and have
the phone charging the entire time
that's a type of tech you being was
working on now Apple filed patents
around this concept back in 2010 with
the idea that your PC could be the main
charging station using near field
magnetic residents so we'll see how this
plays out plus the bezel free iPhone we
talked about last week might be even a
closer reality after patently Apple
discovered a third Apple published
patent filed back in March that
describes three different types of
fingerprint sensors one of them would
allow the reader to be embedded into the
display but would be even more accurate
than the current touch ID sensor used
today it would use ultrasonic imaging
that's the least common fingerprint
scanning tech but the most accurate by
sending ultrasound waves through the X
and y-axis of a plate of glass now a
finger impeding those waves would then
measure the alteration in the wave
pattern so just two more reasons to
maybe hold off for the 10th anniversary
iPhone we don't really know anything yet
but it feels like it's going to be a big
deal
alright WWDC is just a month away we've
always seen new things added to Mac OS
10 and there's still the long-standing
rumor that they'll shrink the name down
to buckle now we've heard about Siri
integration and Mac rumor sources
reveals a colorful waveform icon for the
dock on the menu bar it will look like
the word Siri which looks really stupid
to me if this is final and it just can't
be that and we also know the
hey Siri voice activation command will
work yes I deliberately paused to see
how many of your phones and devices went
off WWDC takes place from June 13 to the
17th with the keynote on that Monday the
13th there's also been an ongoing issue
affecting a small amount of users where
the combination of Apple music and
iTunes is potentially deleting entire
music collections for some people like
James pink stone who lost is entire 122
gig music collection tear now Apple
recently confirmed the music deletion
glitch to the loop with the fix coming
in the next week but we don't really
know what's gonna happen to those files
uh can you say bad apple now iTunes 12.4
was released this week with an updated
interface and navigation it's still not
a major overhaul to the output there's
no word if it actually fixes the glitch
so if you want to get more in depth
about this you can always check out our
weekly Apple byte extra crunchy audio
podcast that expands on everything from
this show and more so check it out it's
good like five stars good
shameless plug I know alright in iOS 9.3
point two update released in the first
week of May brought back the ability for
night shift mode and low-power mode to
work together again but it's been
plaguing nine point seven inch iPad pro
customers with crashing issues and some
of them are even being bricked after the
update oh that's a bad apple now Apple
again has acknowledged this and says
it's looking into a small number of
reports so this is another update that
will most likely require another update
see now I'm actually not so mad about
the nine point seven inch iPad pro I
love my twelve point nine inches plus
Apple just released OS 10 ten point
eleven point five two months after the
release of ten point eleven point four
that also had widespread reports of
system freezes that appear to be
affecting early 2015 13 inch MacBook
Pros and mid-2015 15-inch MacBook Pros
yes this is getting ugly see these bugs
are getting bad with Apple and I'm not
making this up but it just feels like
quality control is getting a lot worse
when it comes to software overall with
Apple specifically these days maybe it's
because there's so many more devices
is a weaker team and a lack of resources
but this is no bueno
okay let's lighten things up with this
awesome video from my first Apple biter
of the week Mr Franco fresh he sent me
this video of this special trick he can
do with his MacBook what
that's a MacBook Sun but then he took it
to a whole nother level with his iMac
dad Franco a freaking iMac you so
cray-cray
and you are my Apple biter of the week
now I'm openness emissions from all of
you to tell me why you should be the
Apple buyer of the week so just email me
at the Apple bite at cnet.com or between
me at Brian Tong maybe you have a talent
or no talent or just a crazy Apple
collection whatever it is if it's good
enough I'll feature you also cute
children and pets might get a temporary
advantage unless you're spinning IMAX
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show I have to save the Mortal
Kombat movie titles giveaway for next
week so keep sending me your ideas if
you want to be a part of it thanks so
much for watching we'll catch you all
