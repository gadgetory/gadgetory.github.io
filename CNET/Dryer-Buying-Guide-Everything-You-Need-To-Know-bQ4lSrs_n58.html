it tastes to consider all your options
before you spend your money whether you
live in a big house with large family
are a single apartment dweller or fall
somewhere in between here are a few
critical items to think about when
you're shopping for a brand new dryer
first figure out how much you intend to
spend at minimum a basic dryer costs
about $600 but they tend to be Spartan
machines with manual controls no fancy
steam features or stainless steel
exteriors here luxury models can set you
back close to $2,000 they also ship with
sleek designs and all the modern bells
and whistles should you get gas or
electric depending on your situation and
how your home is set up a gas-powered
dryer might suit your needs better than
a model running on electricity gas
dryers however need a more careful
insulation best left to a professional
but be forewarned gas dryers are
typically not as energy efficient as
electric models size matters usually
designed to tackle two washer loads of
once dryer machines range in drum size
from about 7 cubic feet to as much as 9
cubic feet make sure you pick a dryer
with a capacity that matches your
laundry needs choose the features you
want these days you can buy a basic
machine with absolutely no frills save
automatic operation or get everything
from steam modes to sanitize fabric or D
wrinkle creases plus a myriad of
specialty cycles figure out what
abilities you like need or have no use
for at all
think about the controls chances are
you'll be spending a lot of quality time
with your new dryer for years to come
decide now if you have any hang-ups
about using a touch screen capacitive
buttons or hate mechanical knobs and lab
buzzers many chopped air dryer models
come with smart connected technology
they link to your home Wi-Fi network and
let you see cycle status download new
cycles and control your appliance or
movie some models can even water
supplies like dryer sheets over the
internet by themselves so as you can see
buying a dryer takes a little thought
planning ahead of time but if you do
your homework you'll definitely find a
dryer that'll match your specific
laundry needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
