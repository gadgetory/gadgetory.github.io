that clips together from replaceable
modular parts here's what you need to
know about project ara with ara you
build a phone out of modules those
modules could be a camera a processor or
a battery or even more niche hardware
like medical diagnostic tools that you'd
never find in a mainstream mobile these
modules are swapped in and out of a
basic endoskeleton which contains
circuitry to link all those modules
together Google is pioneering ara but
the modules themselves could be made by
just about anyone google says it will
eventually let you buy modules to add to
your phone from its own store a bit like
an app store for bits of hardware
because those modules are replaceable
you could in theory swap out your
phone's processor for a new one if it
slowed down replace a broken screen or
buy a better camera unit and in fact not
having to buy a whole new device next
time your phone goes wrong could have
another advantage in the past Google's
mentioned selling its modular phone for
just fifty dollars but even if that
doesn't happen ara could give you much
more choice over how much you spend for
instance buying a basic phone to start
with then splashing out on fancy modules
over time as recently as last summer
project ara was still quite shaky but
google says it's modular phone will
actually be going on sale in Puerto Rico
later this year using the data it
gathers to plot a global launch with
smartphone evilution having slowed over
the last few years project ara has the
potential to really shake things up
again we should know more soon so stay
tuned
