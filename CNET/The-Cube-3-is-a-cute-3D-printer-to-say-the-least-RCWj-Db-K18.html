form 3d system q3 because is a third
generation of the printer that looked
like a cube now this one here is a dual
extruder it means it can print from two
sources of filaments at the same time do
you see them exactly this one has a
great design so that the filament when
loaded still make it very compact on the
side here there is a catch with that
whole filament inside and it fit in this
holder perfectly the same for the other
side and on top you can also very easily
install the filament on to the printhead
yeah that's how a 3d printer works
the printhead pulls the plastic string
melted and extrude that onto the
platform underneath here to form the 3d
object now the platform here is
removable and that's mean is it very
easy for you to clean it after a print
or lace it with glue before you print on
the front here the printer has a small
touch screen for you to manage its
function including printing and on this
side here it has a USB port for you to
print directly from a thumb drive a 2
gigabyte thumb drive is included but you
can also use any thumb drive you want
now the thing I like the most about this
picture is the fact that it can
calibrate itself basically you can make
sure that the print platform is at the
perfect distance from the pre head above
and also perfectly level
the second cool thing that the print
platform here can move up and down also
backward and forward allowing the
printhead about to move only side way
and that mechanism allows the printer to
be small in physical size but can still
bring pretty large object and speaking
of object the printer worked really well
printing small object like this lovely
Toro right here but when it comes to
bigger object like this vase it was a
hit or miss for example I try to bring
another vase this one right here now
this one is a 15 hour job so I left the
printer working overnight when I get
back in the morning
well we've made this
at first and then it made all this not
what I wanted
now the thing is that it actually made
all this much perfectly and then it's
mess up the rest and that mean I have no
idea what happened it worked then didn't
work
one thing for sure though this is a lot
of filmin being wasted and that's not
cool because each of the capture is
costing $50 and only has enough material
to bring about Phi of this large object
so I'm holding here is about $10 worth
of material and that's of course after
the cost of the printer itself which is
$1,000 now that's not cheap but it's
also not too expensive for a dual
extruder so you know the q3 here is
quite a good picture to have it's fun
and very easy to use even though it's a
bit noisy but remember it might cost you
a lot Dowdle i choose for the material
alone from all the printer here check
out my full review cnet.com personally I
liked it because at least if we might
add me of my lovely hair or the like of
which and that's because I'm dumb low
and this has been the first look at the
q3 3d printer form 3d systems I don't
look at wig out of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
