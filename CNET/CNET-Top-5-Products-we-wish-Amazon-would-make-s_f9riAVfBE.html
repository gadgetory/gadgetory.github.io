America's online store for everything
they also have the audacity to make
their own stuff whether it's the kindle
or the Kindle Fire or the fire TV or the
Amazon dash amazon is increasingly
making their own stuff so that you can
get it and buy more stuff from them it's
brilliant and I'm sure it's just the
beginning I'm Donald Bell and in this
top 5 i'm counting down my own list of
products and services i predict amazon
will someday make starting off at number
five a laptop what Google does with the
Chromebook Amazon could do just as well
just slap on Amazon silk browser support
for their app store and Amazon Cloud
Storage it'd be great for students you
could tie into the whole Kindle textbook
thing you can package it with a student
amazon prime account and a month of
amazon fresh pizza delivery and this
would be the hottest laptop on campus at
number for a taxi service just as lyft
and uber are killing the taxi industry
Amazon could take the next step you take
Amazon's ever-present delivery fleet and
you put them to work as a rideshare
service in their down time or maybe
Amazon could buy lift and then turn
their drivers into an inexpensive
delivery network you could hitch a ride
across town on a diaper delivery or get
a ride home from the bar face down in a
box of absorbent amazon packing material
it's win-win coming in at number three a
robot Butler the hell was Syrian Google
now the Jetsons promised us a robot
housekeeper and Amazon is poised to make
that dream come true they already own a
robotics company called Kiva and you
know they would jump at the chance to be
inside your house and be the first to
know when you run out of toothpaste and
the best part you'd always have someone
there to answer the door for your Amazon
deliveries or how about number two a 3d
printer an Amazon 3d printer could
eliminate the shipping costs completely
you just order your iphone case and it
prints out in just a few hours kids
could print out their legos grandpa
could print out his model train pieces
and you could print out an engagement
ring for your robot made
but my number one pick for an amazon
products will see sooner than later a
phone and I'm not even saying a
smartphone maybe it's a low-cost burner
phone maybe it's a small version of the
kindle fire in a phone form either way
amazonas is everything in place they
already have the carrier relationships
they sell a ton of phones already they
have the services in the app store and I
know they know how to make good cheap
mobile hardware is proven with the
kindle fire seriously what are you
waiting for amazon so there you go five
products or services that i would not be
surprised to see from our benevolent
overlord Jeff Bezos if you disagree or
would like to nominate your own idea you
can tweet me at Donald or leave a
comment over at top five cnet com i'm
