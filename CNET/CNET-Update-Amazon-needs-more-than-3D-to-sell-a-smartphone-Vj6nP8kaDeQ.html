smartphone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update in two weeks amazon
will reveal a new product and all signs
point to a smartphone now Amazon is
insane it's a smartphone instead it just
released this teaser video of people
moving their head reacting to it I don't
think I've ever seen anything like that
oh my gosh that's crazy that's super
awesome I don't know how you guys do it
amazon you don't have to play coy with
us we know this is your smartphone and
we know those people in the video are
reacting to some sort of 3d effect on
the screen the Amazon smartphone has
been rumored for three years and reports
say that Amazon was going to release it
soon so yeah it's a smartphone now as
for those 3d screen tricks it likely has
something to do with the eye tracking
camera sensors on all four corners
here's one leaked picture of a prototype
with the sensors on the corners
published by BGR it could track the
user's face and eyes and change the
on-screen image in relation to where
you're looking but let's be honest about
something here it's going to take more
than the 3d trick to sell a phone the
smartphone market is so crowded right
now that it needs to be competitive on
price maybe I tracking could be used for
other cool things like scrolling text as
your eye travels down a page or pausing
a video when you look away or some
magical shopping wand scanner thingy
whatever the features amazon is going to
catch your attention with the 3d but the
price will need to seal the deal and all
will be revealed on jun 18th in amazon's
hometown of Seattle and in other
bookstore technology news Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
is no longer making nook tablets instead
Samsung will make nook spin-offs of
galaxy tablets the companies announced a
new co-branded tablet with a long name
the samsung galaxy tab for nook it'll be
like a typical galaxy tablet it'll have
a smaller 7-inch screen and customized
nuke software from barnes &amp;amp; noble sales
