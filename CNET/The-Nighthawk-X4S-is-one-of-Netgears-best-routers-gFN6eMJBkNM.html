router from Netgear not to be confused
with the x4 that came out two years ago
this one is much better this is a quad
stream of 4x4 Wi-Fi router meaning it
has a top speed of up to 733 megabit per
second but don't bother remembering that
because in real world you will never
have at that speed nonetheless in my
testing this one here was very fast with
a sustained speed of up to 800 megabit
per second which is likely the fastest
I've seen so far very impressive now the
speed vary depending on the distance of
the range and this one here does indeed
offer quite long range in my testing
through three wounds I could still
connect to it from up to 200 feet away
that is very impressive now the more
obstacle or walls you have in the middle
the shorter the range on a B but in open
space you can expect longer range
now the X 4s has a lot of peripheral
ports two USB 3.0 and one eSATA you can
use this port to host a printer or
storage devices and in that case the
router will also work as a storage
server as such the performer with the
best I've seen but it get a job done for
light local file sharing or media
streaming now the thing I don't like the
most about the x4s is the web interface
which is similar to that of most Netgear
routers is bloated and confusing with
many menu items
why not giving you in app configuration
for the Wi-Fi networks however all thing
consider the router here is totally
worth the current price of $230
basically if you have a large home with
10 or less AB concurrently active Wi-Fi
clients it will deliver with Wi-Fi
signal likely at every corner of the
house if not well maybe it's time to
move or get a second one which I did
anyway
and I don't even need the first one to
begin with and that's only because well
I'm down low</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
