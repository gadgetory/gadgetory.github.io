the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and yeah
you know I'm kind of on the hype train
pouring life baby all right
the wait is finally over ladies and
gentlemen the Amazon Prime video app is
here on Apple TV hallelujah now it's
probably the number one thing Apple byte
nation has been asking about right now
the TV OS version of the app supports 4k
HDR it will also support Universal
Search and prime content will show up in
Apple's TV app unlike Netflix you know
the one that's on Apple TV where you can
watch TV shows and movies but it's still
called the TV app now getting this in
time for the holidays come on that
deserves a good Apple TV os also
received an update to 11.2 which brings
new HDR and frame rate options but still
no dolby atmos switches coming soon and
come on how long should coming soon
really mean because three months is not
coming soon to me now you can match the
frame rate and the dynamic range of
video content this is great because it
won't force non HDR content to look
blown up anymore
it also finally brings the long-awaited
sports feature where you can pick your
favorite teams now watch their games
when they're happening in connected apps
overall I'm happy with these updates
that makes the Apple TV feel almost like
just almost complete two and a half
months later alright and more updates
the flip was finally switched on for
Apple pay cash in the United States
after Apple released the iOS 11.2 update
before without Apple pay cash over the
weekend and why weren't they released at
the same time well that's because iOS
had another bug related to a crashing
loop on iPhones when December the second
hits so they pushed out iOS 11 - le to
address that bug yeah
now you're going to definitely use Apple
pay cash but it's only available in the
US right now and it's iOS only right now
this is no venmo killer because that
works on both Android and iOS and if
you'd like to try out Apple pay cash you
can send some cash my way I just want to
make sure it's working properly for you
I'll write a new statistics shared by
we'll say iOS 11 is now installed on 59%
of iOS devices iOS 11 adoption has been
slower than iOS 10 and would honestly be
less if users could revert back to iOS
10 easily on their earlier phones but
come on iOS 11 has been the buggiest and
least polish release we've ever seen
from apple with bug after bug getting
updates you know week after week
it wasn't bad it was just pathetic you
know going from the eye bug then after
that fix there was the it and is bug and
then after that the looping crash on
December 2nd bug back-to-back-to-back
now one of the good things from Iowa's
11.2 I've heard some of Apple by nation
telling me that their battery
performance has finally improved on
earlier iPhones like the 6s so let me
know if that's the case with you too and
we're still waiting to get messages in
iCloud syncing that existed in the
original iOS 11 beta but was taken out
back in August after its announcement at
WWDC this year all right if you've been
waiting patiently for the iPhone 10 you
know what its gonna pay off for you
Apple is finally selling an unlocked SIM
free version of the iPhone 10 not tied
to any specific carrier with the same
one-week delivery time in the United
States there were ways to technically
get an unlocked version of the phone
before but you would have to have a
Verizon or Sprint account and what's the
big advantage in all this getting an
iPhone 10 with the better performing
Qualcomm modem it's been tested and
proven once again by cellular insights
that the Qualcomm base modem performs
better than the Intel based modem found
in AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile versions of the
phone now you'll feel the performance
difference the most in weaker cell
signal areas this isn't just a made-up
stuff like I felt this before I even
knew there were different modems inside
the iPhone 7 now that same trend has
continued for the 10 and you can read
the nitty gritty of it all in this PC
Mag article and no I'm not trying to
make you feel bad about your iPhone but
this has been true since the 7 ok
fashionistas alert Apple's released new
color options for the Apple watch sports
bands in flash which is really a canary
yellow a dark teal there's also a soft
white which isn't as white as white
because someone needed that and spicy
orange Apple iPhone 10 silicone cases
get
these colors as well and you know what
we can't leave the show without talking
about emojis this is important the
Unicode consortium announced the beta
version of 2018 emoji lineup including
things like a softball this party face
emoji a bagel and yes representation for
gingers okay I'm sorry
redheads we've got to be PC about
everything these days
users also might be given the option to
changed the direction of an emoji like
the gun or train or runners which can
really change the context of what you're
typing and I'm sorry to tell you the
frowny poo poo emoji has been removed
from the list of 2018 along with these
other crappy emoji faces all right
before we go we have an awesome giveaway
and deal from our friends at Mophie
we're doing a giveaway for two Mophie
wireless charging bases that work with
the iPhone 10 8 and plus all you have to
do is tell me what did I think was the
worst offense of the iPad ad in last
week's show and you'll get one of these
two bad boys and they're also hooking up
Apple by nation with a 15% off on their
entire website you know except for these
hot bad boys just use the code Apple
byte and it's good through December the
14th all right that's gonna do it for
this week's show you can email me at the
Alpha white at cnet.com or to me at
Brian Tom thanks watch your watch it
will catch all next time another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
