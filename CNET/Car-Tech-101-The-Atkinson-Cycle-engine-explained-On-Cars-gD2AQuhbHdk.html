cycle engines you just wouldn't know it
I guess lean-burn doesn't make for a
sexy a badge as turbo or 5.0 and notice
most cars with an atkinson are hybrids
as the technologies dovetail with a
mission of efficiency above sheer power
here's how it all works an Ekans an
engine basically one takes in a little
less fuel and two brings the most out of
it but three at a sacrifice of raw
horsepower when a given piston in an a
constant engine has completed its intake
stroke and begins to compress the charge
of air and fuel it leaves the intake
valve open for a bit creating a sort of
leak and thereby reducing the amount of
air fuel charged in the cylinder
unchanged is the duration of the
combustion or power stroke thereby
giving the engine all the time it needs
to fully burn the smaller charge it
ignited the downside is less air and
fuel going in means less power coming
out when you ignite it all but you spend
proportionally less fuel on your overall
power since most Atkinson cars are
hybrids so what the engine lacks in oh
the electric motor more than makes up
now why is it called an Atkins in cycle
that's because it was invented by a guy
named Atkinson the late 1800s a British
engineer back then there was no variable
valve timing as we've discussed so he
literally had to vary the travel length
of each piston cycle with a combination
of wonky linkages you should be pretty
glad we're not dealing with today more
