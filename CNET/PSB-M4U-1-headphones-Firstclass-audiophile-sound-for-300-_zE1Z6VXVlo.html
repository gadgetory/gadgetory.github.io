cnet.com and I'm here to give you a tour
of another headphone this one a
higher-end
over-the-ear model that delivers
first-class sound the English company
PSP is primarily known for its speakers
but last year it introduced its first
ever headphone the active
noise-cancelling m4 u2 which was hailed
by many critics including CNET as one of
the world's best noise cancelling models
now PSPs put out the m4 u1 a less
expensive non noise cancelling version
of the same headphone as another winner
particularly if you like very accurate
clean sounding headphones
that don't over accentuate the bass in
fact I'm calling these the beats for
audiophiles because well they look a
little like Beats headphones but they
have a neutral sound profile yes they
have a more oval shape and the red
finish is more of a burgundy but they do
share the same shiny polycarbonate
plastic folding headband at 12 ounces
they're not light but they do seem
fairly durable and fold up into a
protective travel case as part of the
package you get 2 5 foot long cables
ones plain and the other has an inline
remote with microphone for making cell
phone calls while we tend to prefer
shorter 4 foot cables one of the pluses
of this headphones design is that you
can plug either cable into the left or
right ear cup you can also plug another
set of headphones into the open jack and
have two people listen to the same music
or movie at the same time and props to
PSP for throwing in a spare set of ear
pads
that's an extra we'd like to see more
headphone manufacturers include
especially at this $300 price point as
for performance this is a remarkably
clear sounding headphone the clarity
isn't the result of boosted treble or
mid-range frequencies no the m4 u1 just
sounds neutral and doesn't over
emphasize bass while we like this
headphones clarity it's worth noting
that if you listen to a lot of low
bitrate mp3s or streaming audio the n4u
ones clear presentation might not be
desirable that said with better
recordings to appreciate just how good
these headphones are as noted this is
first and foremost an audio
phile headphone it was designed to be as
neutral sounding as possible so bass
lovers might not be satisfied with its
low-end prowess it's also fairly
comfortable to wear for hours at a time
but other competitors such as the Sony
mdr-1r are more comfortable you're
trying to decide between this model and
the active noise-cancelling m4u - it
really comes down to where you listen to
your music and if it's important for you
to have noise cancelling headphones to
muffle ambient noise most active
noise-cancelling headphones don't sound
as good as their passive counterparts
and that's the case here - the m4 u1
sounds slightly better than the - and
around $300 audiophiles who value sound
quality over everything else it's hard
to beat for the price I'm David Carr
know and that's the PSB m for you one
headphone thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
