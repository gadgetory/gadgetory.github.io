any other time in human history Facebook
alone handles over 250 million photo
uploads each day over 6 billion photo
uploads per month that's a lot of
kittens and while we're fortunate in
this wonderful digital era that we no
longer have to worry about physically
storing all of our photos and empty
shoeboxes you still need to be choosy
about where you're uploading your
precious memories I'm Donnell Bell and
in this top five I'll be counting down
the five best sites for storing and
organizing your digital photos selected
by CNET's Sharon Vaknin starting off at
number five Shutterfly here's a name
that's been around since 1999 completely
free unlimited storage and they have
apps for iOS and Roku and you can even
order prints for pickup at Walgreens and
Target so what's the catch well
Shutterfly makes their real money by
selling your photos back to you you've
got a winner you want to print out you
go through them you can't even read
download your photos at full resolution
instead you have to pay to have an
archived CD sent to you still it's a
great option for parents and
grandparents who tend to print and share
a lot of photos anyway but the
limitation still put this on the bottom
of our list for something a little less
rigid try number 4 photo bucket now as a
rule I generally don't trust businesses
named after buckets but I guess is
better than picture trough or maybe
image feed bag for better or worse this
is a site that's become the preferred
dumping ground for every photo and meme
and animated gifs on the web there are
nearly 10 billion images hosted on photo
bucket and their free account makes it
easy to get started great social
integration with sites like Facebook and
there are paid accounts for people who
want to store large collections the bad
news is that there are file size limits
even for paid accounts so really not a
place for the pros also if animated gifs
and cutesy photo fluff drive you a
little nuts this is not the place for
you for the more discerning photographer
there's number 3 SmugMug the youngest of
all the sites on this list SmugMug is a
paid only service that starts at $5 a
month
for the money you get zero ads unlimited
photo uploads and portfolio quality
photo galleries needless to say it's a
big one with the professional
photographers out there partly because
it does a great job presenting your
photos but also because it allows you to
redownload your original images with no
hassle my only problem with SmugMug is
that is still a relatively young service
it's not yet in the too-big-to-fail zone
maybe I'm too pessimistic but if my
photo service goes broke or gets bought
up and put on the Shelf I want to know
that there's an army of users out there
like me who are ready to raise hell it's
great as SmugMug is it would die a
relatively quiet death so how about
number two Picasa seems fitting that a
company like Google obsessed with
organizing the world's information would
also be great at organizing your photos
it's a free service though you can pay a
small amount for extra storage
it works with a huge variety of image
formats including raw and there's a
desktop app that works on Mac and PC
it's not all roses though first there's
the awkward transition of Picasa Web
Albums to Google Plus photo albums as
Google slowly lumps all of their
services under the Google+ umbrella then
there's the issue of privacy I know I'm
a little paranoid but Google already
knows every email I send in every web
search I make do I really want them
having all of my photos - what's all the
geotag location data and everything it's
a bit too far for me but at least I know
they'll look after my photos as they
mine them for information that they can
use to sell me things I suspect I have
canadian pharmacy written all over me
so that brings us to the number one
recommended site for storing your photos
Flickr free but with plenty of features
way too big to fail without riots in the
street and it's owned by Yahoo a humble
tech company with something to prove
unlike Google Yahoo is more than happy
to let you share your photo uploads on
Facebook or Twitter or WordPress heck
they're just happy to have you around
Flickr is - Yahoo with Xboxes to
Microsoft it's like the only
successfully cool product they've ever
pulled off and they're not going to risk
screwing it up you get excellent privacy
controls a huge community that's been
growing since 2004 and
free account that entitles you to a
terabyte of space now you can upload
short videos you can redownload your
original photos and the mobile app is
actually pretty great so there you go

your digital photos for more in-depth
