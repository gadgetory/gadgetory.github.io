season is continuing in fact we've got
one of Google's biggest products right
here ready to unbox the Google pixel
slate this was unveiled at Google's
pixel 3 event and it is a laptop /
tablet aiming to go against the iPad pro
Microsoft Surface and it's kind of a
revision to the pixel book last year so
this is the Google pixel slate I also
have some accessories the Google pixel
book pen which you'll probably want also
the pixel slate keyboard also does not
income included and you'd want that and
an alternative to the keyboard won by
bridge to make a lot of great iPad
keyboards and other accessories they
have a g-type Google pixel slate
accessory as well so let's start with
the pixel slate this thing goes from
price goes from price from $5.99 all the
way to $15.99 so you can get really
expensive this particular version I have
has a Core i5 processor 8 gigs of ram
128 gig solid-state drive for $1000
let's open this up and pretty clean
Google product packaging if you have a
pixel or something like that let's try
to take this out without how do you
remove that there you go that's the
slate right there very clean dense kind
of like a iPad pro territory connector
right there
feels heavier than you'd expect here is
a USBC cable that is included here is a
pretty large charge brick adapter let's
open that up
that is a was a wall work right there
that's gonna sit right in at least not
take up other outlets like the iPad pro
one which is wider but that they're also
included thankfully a USBC headphone
adapter which is not included with the
iPad pro and that is it unless you want
to get to know your pixel slate the OS
in here is kind of similar to Google
it's cruel Chrome so it's a Google
Chrome environment but it's aiming to be
a little more tablet II a little more
keyboard friendly while being a tablet
so a cleaner look to it we'll do a full
review of that soon let's put that aside
and let's turn this on let's move that
over it there here's one USB C port and
there's another USB C port and that's it
also keep in mind that that power button
doubles is a fingerprint sensor turn
that on there we go and you can just go
into your your basic google set up from
there we're to come with this but let's
take a look at some of the accessories
let's package this up here but this box
on and let's start with the let's turn
with a pen if you had a pixel book pen
from last year well then you're in luck
if not you will have to buy one of these
if you want to use the tablet stylus
functions is $100 so not cheap
but falls in line with what Microsoft
and Apple are charging inside here is
the stylus pretty pretty clear cut a
little button on the side there as well
and if you want to keep a charged
triple-a battery so it doesn't charge
through the side or it doesn't have any
recharge ability whether you like this
or not up to you so you put that inside
the pixel book and we're to the stylus
and they'll be good to go so let's take
that out here put over the side let's
check out the keyboard now the Google
pixel slight keyboard feels like an
accessory that should have come in the
box much like the iPad pro you're
probably going to want to use it to do a
lot of things now the nice thing about
the pixel Slate keyboard is it has a
trackpad it also is powered from the
side connector so you can use it easily
fold it up kind of like origami and have
it protect your pixel book or just
pixels slate $200 though is pricey so
let's open it up tells you about your
different modes you're folding you're
connecting you're sliding it to
different angles if you have a Microsoft
Surface pro keyboard kind of a similar
proposition to the way this feels
let me take this out without damaging
that that slides right off it and inside
here is
is there anything just a little just a
little instructional booklet okay that's
just packaging so here we go
pretty pretty clean-cut folio there and
nice trackpad and when you connect it
here snaps right on works just like that
pretty cool and I mean I use this at the
event so I've typed on it not yet since
I've had it but the keys feel really
nice the trackpad feels really nice but
you have to have a lot of table space
you can also adjust the angle on this to
any variety of angles which is a nice
touch and it's pretty sturdy but maybe
you don't want to do that too many times
so that's the keyboard that Google makes
but there is another option there may be
other options beyond that Bridge has its
own so let's put this aside let's put
this together here minimize that
and look at the g-type now the other one
was a table type tablet experience G
type by bridge is meant to go on your
lap so it's really a a laptop type you
have much better lap support it doesn't
look like it connects via the side
connector on the pixel slate which is
kind of funny this is battery powered so
let's see if I can get this out of here
there we go
comes with a comes with a cleaning cloth
comes the two cleaning cloths there you
go all the cleaning cloths you need for
the year instructions on inserting and
removing powering this has backlighting
as well as the trackpad and does it come
with a charge cable is there a charge
capable USB C so you just use the one
that came with the pixel slate there you
go pretty straightforward
and this has little attaching brackets I
don't want to I don't want to damage it
okay put it in right side up and just
kind of slide it into the rubber feet
there and you have your little pixel
slate laptop so it looks like there's a
good hold standing position and it
should Bend nope maybe not you don't
bend all the way back around I think you
have to then remove it and flip it to
the other side and then you can use it
in that mode but it's meant to be sturdy
enough that you could use it in your lap
I don't know how it has as far as being
top-heavy versus bottom heavy but more
to come on that looks like it's looks
like it's holding its own but again $160
for that so you're dealing with $200
accessory or $160 accessory if that was
another tablet a $99 stylus is a lot of
money to spend in the Google product
universe more to come when we do a full
review of this but that's the Google
pixel slate and its accessories
I'm Scott Stein talk to you soon
