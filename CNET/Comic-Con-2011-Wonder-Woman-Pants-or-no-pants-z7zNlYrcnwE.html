Wonder Woman costume what is that all
about so the debate is a year ago DC
changed her costume to have pants the
kind of a room the last II bolero jacket
nobody liked it all that's been going on
for the past year is complaints because
they changed it last June now we're
going into the second year of the change
DC is actually kind of resetting the
universe and this is when the fans
decided to make the hard push for let's
get rid of those pants you know if you
look at the Internet there have been two
conflicting images on the phone October
1 with shorts what a long hands so it
looks like short pants are back but no
one should point 100% sure just yet
there is a strong hope that's how it's
gonna end up otherwise it's gonna be on
fire again as a fan yourself what do you
prefer short pants that's the classic
what do you as wonder women feel about
the whole Wonder Woman costume
controversy um they wanted to give her
an updated look but the pleather
jeggings I don't see very many women
wearing those so I don't think they did
or justice with that I honestly hate it
I feel like they're like it just seems
like an average woman now she's wearing
pants like but when her original costume
it's like such like a big show and it's
so interesting and then they just
changed it to something boring all right
David Wonder Woman leggings were classic
no leggings
now growing up in as a kid you find
Wonder Woman to be pretty sexy like what
were your thoughts on her nice looking
lady
I really like the new design with the
leggings it's it's I really like it but
I just didn't like the whole eagle I
like am I like a fusion within the two
kasam would be really good
so Wonder Woman please give us your
arguments of why your costume is the
best I know it's a big debate and I know
people are afraid of change but um it's
very user friendly it's very there's
lots of room to breathe there's there's
not much to hide which is always
appreciated
I'm sure and I still feel sexy and
feminine and strong and I don't know
tell me what you think what do you think
I'm liking every answer this costume I'm
not gonna lie now classic Wonder Woman
please state your arguments for why your
costume is the best well I think Wonder
Woman is a beautiful example of strength
and a woman but I think the pants make
her a little too masculine and I really
love the femininity of the you know
showing some thighs showing some legs I
don't think we should be afraid of
having Wonder Woman be strong and
feminine at the same time and of course
we have the stripes the stars the
American patriotic and I don't think we
should lose that we should be afraid of
our roots we should stick to our
patriotic Wonder Woman roots these were
both excellent debates and if I had my
choice ladies I would take both you so I
know I like Wonder women</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
