product category for nests moving on
from smart thermostats and cameras the
new hello doorbell will send a
notification to your phone when someone
walks up and presses the button it can
also store video it will store three
hours of still images for free in a
coastal storm about a week of video for
a $10 monthly fee with its person
detection technology it can
differentiate a person from say a car or
a dog in case somebody comes up to your
door you want to know if somebody's
there it also has a familiar faces
feature that if you subscribe to the
video service it can also tell from
different people around your house that
show up at your door regularly so the
doorbell communicates over Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi so you should be able to access it
remotely from pretty much anywhere and
because it's a wired connection you
don't need to worry about battery life
running out in the future the doorbell
will also communicate with a Yale smart
lock we don't quite exactly know how
that interactions gonna work yet neces
they're still working on it
but you can imagine some sort of thing
where somebody comes up to the doorbell
and then you get a notification in the
app that will let you unlock the door
remotely so just seeing it here in the
demo room the camera actually looks
pretty good in the app it takes a nice
high resolution image and even if you're
standing off to the side of the door the
camera can still pick up your whole body
in front of it your face does look
pretty clear like a lot of other
doggerel cameras of course it also has
two-way audio one neat feature here
though is that has some pre-recorded
voice messages so say you're somewhere
where you can't necessarily have that
live remote conversation with somebody
through the app you can hit a button to
send a pre-recorded message to tell
somebody to say leave a package for
example Nessa isn't talking about the
price of the doorbell yet but it does
say will release in q1 or 2018 so we'll
look for more information then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
