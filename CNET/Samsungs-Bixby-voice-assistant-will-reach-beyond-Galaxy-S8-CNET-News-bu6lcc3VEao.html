town owners of the upcoming Galaxy s8
smartphone are so I'm going to be
talking to Bixby Samsung's brand-new
digital voice assistant Samsung
announced that there's going to be a
dedicated button on the side of the s8
phone that you would press to summon
Bixby before you make your request but
big speed is not just for Samsung's
newest phones you could be talking to
Bixby and Samsung appliances because the
future is all about talking to your
washing machine actually the company's
grand plan is that you may be enticed to
buy all Samsung appliances if they all
sync up with your phone with Bix feed
now we've heard about big speed reports
for some time now but Samsung has made
the news official yet this is not
Samsung's first attempt at a voice
assistant remember s voice it was
unreliable and a flop
since then Samsung has invested in new
technology to step up its game now until
we use it ourselves it's going to be
hard to say how big speed will match up
to Apple Siri Microsoft's Cortana
Amazon's Alexa or the Google assistant
we will get some answers when Bixby
makes its debut at a New York event on
March 29th during the big reveal for the
galaxy s 8 you can catch the live stream
on CNET with a pre-show starting at
10:30 a.m. Eastern Time I'll be
co-hosting with Aya's Akhtar and Ben Fox
Rubin and we'll also be giving a
post-game analysis of Samsung's big
rebound phone I'm Bridget Carey you can
read up on more of Bixby's backstory and
other samsung news at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
