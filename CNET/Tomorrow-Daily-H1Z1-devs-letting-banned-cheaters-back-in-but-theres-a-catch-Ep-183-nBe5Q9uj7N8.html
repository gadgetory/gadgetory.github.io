through its mistakes cockroach robots
they can run faster than we can and
cheaters at video games begging for
forgiveness nothing tastes better
delicious tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the vesti talk
show in the known universe we are back
I'm ashley's gether we were on another
temporal plane Jeremy's always kill
anonymous we home of them if you're in
the u.s. we hope you enjoyed your
holiday we did he's relaxed we enjoyed
your holiday we enjoyed your holiday for
you if he didn't I play guacamelee all
weekend that's what I did and it was
cool yeah it was amazing it's up its
your PlayStation Plus game if you have
ps4 it's free so trust me guys just if
you like platforming uh-huh or lucha
doors go get that guy who doesn't love
lucha doors but yeah good times good
times good weekend it's really good yeah
but back ready for some action yes are
you let's hit those headlines okay
sometimes I worry that you've run out of
batteries you stopped mid-sentence and
then I'm like oh no I have to wind up
you're so used to like a format of a
show that I'm just like I'm like not
about that I know I'm like throw it
throwing rowlett we're the Internet
we're the open forum show with a lot of
wiggle room there's no edits watch see
that was awkward now let's see if we
couldn't edit that out so so let's get
started this one is a lot of fun this
one is sure to tap into everyone's the
gamer inside of them because we've all
experienced a gamer that has been
cheating online whether it be wall hacks
or aimbots or any more like some sort of
money exploit or just something like
that well h1n1 is a zombie game that's
kind of in like what is it like clopin
beta yeah and you can like pay to get
early access girl well they've actually
been banning people they've banned
30,000 accounts of people that have been
cheating in the game okay that's not
what the story that's not what the story
is the story is that they've decided
that they'll allow those cheaters back
into the game if they make a video
pleading as to why they should be let
back into the game this is a decision by
the president of the game's development
company John Smedley who decided to take
bannings as an opportunity to raise
awareness about cheating he's like
cheaters I want your face on the screen
saying that you made a mistake and so
there's been video
that people have made because they put a
lot of hours into this and it banks that
they don't want to lose all of that work
so I mean they could just make another
account but they don't want you so if
you check out his Twitter account he's
um retweeted a few people that have made
videos they're really put their people
are so lame cuz look they try to excuse
themselves to like look a lot of people
were doing that exploit and I just
didn't want to be left out yeah and
they're like I'm over two minutes long
of them and it sounds like they like ran
over your dog and they're like I
samurais dad but anyway only five people
have been allowed back into the game and
I think he's cutting it off there john
is a John said a feisty little dude that
give the guy that a company he is very
serious about well I like this I like
this though this isn't good just ate let
me give you a little bit more
information about the cheat real quick
so the cheat that they were using is
called ESP so this basically if you
don't know h1n1 it's a big open world
game there's nice a whole lot of like if
you get killed in this games it you lose
everything so there's a lot of reason to
cheat so I mean there's a lot of reason
to like make sure you're okay stay alive
they are we using the app kaim sorry
they've been using the exploit or the
hack this health ESP which lets people
know where you are on the map and lets
you see through walls basically a big
hack it sounds like huge it's making it
vulnerable but it's it is a hack and
that is a superpower and it came like
h1z1 so there you go that's that's what
we're looking at here so the question is
how excited are you like I mean like how
how cool is this is this is this a cool
thing listen I really like this I mean
of course I would like it better if he
would have been like oh give your
apology videos and maybe we'll let you
back in and then a month later after
these third like third let's say half
15,000 people make these videos he's
like I'm just kidding no you're getting
back in like holy my video course but
I'm probably meaner than John Smedley
which is why I don't run a game company
that's why I host a show but I like that
he's doing this because it gets these
people to sort of a pot just apologize
like it's so hard for people to admit
that they were wrong and they did
something dumb and to just say listen I
messed up like I should not have done
this I would like my account back
this is the exploit that I used and I
like that he's using this as an
opportunity to raise awareness about
cheating in that game because it is
really prevalent like I know I have a
few friends who play the early access
and they hate cheaters there's like it's
a nightmare like having to deal with
this and I think this argument that's
like crazy you know nonsensical argument
of all everyone else was doing it like
so okay I'm going to go ahead and play
slight devils em okay I hate cheaters as
well okay um I actually used to play a
wolf inside enemy territory on a in bot
server on purpose it was fun okay so a
lot of fun but what makes sense if
you've ever played any of these games
where it just was it was snowballing
more and more and more and more people
cheating to the plinth was almost not a
fun game for you anymore right you in
your mind are like well I've got to
balance this out I'm not going to be
invincible which that one guy was like I
didn't turn that on cuz I didn't feel
like that was fair yeah so like and
that's just devil's advocate I totally
don't agree with cheating right taking
the fun away from the people that are
playing the game fair right so it's
great I think this is a great way it's a
like-kind of like stir up the community
and show expose these people and its
really great but different does to the
question of the day yes our hashtag
ledee our hashtag of the day teeny
cheats RT did she uh we would like to
know from you what should gamers if
they're cheating what should they have
to do to make up for cheating so you
catch somebody cheating and they want to
be allowed back in the game what should
they have to do to make up for that
cheating it to be allowed back in like
five hundred push-ups or should they
have to let go to three rosaries should
they have to go to like you know town
hall and let go up there and sing i'm a
little teapot like what should they have
to do should they have to go it and like
you know tell their parents they don't
love them i mean like what should they
have to do so with the parents saying
this is what i was thinking you're going
straight appearances I'm going straight
to parents is you you should have to go
to your parent record yourself you know
Jimmy Kimmel does that I told my kids i
ate all their halloween candy thing okay
so you should have to go if you're
cheater and your account gets banned you
want back in you should have to go to
you're the parent who's the
disciplinarian in your life whether
that's your mom or your dad or your
grandpa whoever it is the person who's
the dist
Flammarion in your life person who would
be most disappointed in you for cheating
and you should have to tell them on
camera what you did and why you did it
and you should ask them to forgive you
and if they forgive you then maybe you
get a chance at coming back into the
game I think my parents just be like
well my actually my mom's a gamer my dad
would you feel like I don't care right
the person who would understand like
that you cheat like it's not about
gaming but just saying like I cheated
and I'm really sorry and I apologize and
I'll never do it again and this is why I
did it and then you say like but I need
your forgiveness so are you willing
would you be willing to forgive me for
doing something like that and then you
see what they say I think they should
have to show I think they should have to
publicly share their browser history for
the last two days oh that's good so yeah
they got it's a little bit of an it
exposes you a little bit yeah you
screwed up a lot of people's time they
have to expose your time a little bit
and it's kind of both the digital medium
kind of punishment attiki Halen on there
you go take that cheaters oh and Claire
tor browser history before Easter like I
kind of just want to make one of those
h1n1 like apology videos just to make
I'm not like I haven't I sure put it on
time in it hey guys like no like they'll
have like sweet headsets like their
lives are okay won't matter but anyway
okay so good so let's talk about
velocities nope um I don't want to kale
doesn't like spiders as much as I don't
like cockroaches like I hate coverage
yeah they're gonna survive the
apocalypse they will um and and these
these robots that are like cockroaches
might also survived the apocalypse this
is kind of crazy so these are two robots
that look similar but act differently
and they have similar names so there's
the veloci and then there's that one
which that was at real time that's
real-time playback that slowed down five
times this is the 2x veloci wrote and
the 2x veloci road can run at 11 miles
per hour that is 17.6 km/h for those of
you who don't for those of you use the
metric system which is pretty much
everywhere else in the in the world yeah
so they slow it down so that you can get
a good look at it both these robots are
from UC Berkeley and it's really
interesting because they talk about they
said we scaled up this
basically the motion of the legs to
speed him up and the only thing that
kept him from not going any faster than
love of miles per hour is the legs start
it's the structure of the little robot
started flying off like legs started to
like pieces of robot started like
falling off of it because it was going
too fast too fast too furious and and so
this this little cockroach bot they're
saying now they want to work on stronger
structural integrity so that they can
just see how far exactly they can like
scale this thing up and how fast they
can make a go slightly creepy and then
there's the velocerator veloci road
which is this one and it's acting as
kind of like an aircraft carrier for
this other robot that's about to take
off I love this video so much um so this
one is launching a micro aerial vehicle
looks like a little bird but why why why
well why so I think parts of this our
scale so scalability so over time if you
can imagine this on a much larger scale
like that's something that's really cool
what do you mean like larger roaches
know like like a bunch of these things
whoa or actual plane okay you know yeah
scalability always one thing to consider
they didn't really specifically mention
like a goal they were like oh we're
gonna make it do this in the future like
there wasn't that but um there are a lot
of we've seen a lot of robots that have
sort of insect like capabilities and I
think a big part of these are just sort
of like how can we push these little
robots to their limits and how can we
apply that knowledge to other robotics
that we are working on so I think this
is really I think it's so cool and
really just to watch that little
cockroach robots Wyatt yeah I'm very
interesting how they scale it up
considering that if they go too fast it
all parts are yeah yeah I think that was
really that's just right where you
imagine like I'd like a utopian /
dystopian world where the cops like use
that they're like we got our we got this
guy running from us and they just send a
horde of these little cockroach isn'ta
guys like know it gets like overtaken
just like and then they it's like the
locusts and the mummy it's like and then
all of a sudden they all go by and it's
just like a little pile of skeleton and
they're just like well peace that's it
and all he did was steal like a candy
bar yeah no I'm serious John that's
robot justice
chakra cockroach robot justice yeah good
khakhra I don't think that's really
coming this fall on CBS now I do think
it's key it is like petritsky okay so
and then there's another thing from UC
Berkeley that's our third story and this
is actually from the robotics people
over at this as a team working on this
robot called brett over at UC berkeley
real name that's bad yeah yeah so
usually you teach a robot to do
something by programming a very specific
line of code in it so you say like this
is how they do a thing I mean you give
it all of its instructions and then it
does it so this team at UC Berkeley is
showing off Brett which learns via trial
and error so you can see he's trying
things out and he's like okay well maybe
this is right maybe this is right kind
of a big step in the field of AI like a
big step forward because this robot was
given a series of algorithms to learn a
series of tasks like a couple things are
putting together this toy plane that
we're looking at right now and then also
screwing on a water bottle cap but
without knowledge of its surroundings so
they would put pieces on the on the
table in front of it and he would
autonomously figure out exactly how to
kind of put these things together so
there were two different two different
ways of doing this the team gave Brent
information about what the objects
surrounding him looked like and where
they were and when they did that he was
able to complete these tasks in about
ten minutes so pretty quickly but if
they didn't if they said you need Brett
you the robot needs to figure out what
the objects are around you and locate
them so and also figure out where they
are the process took about three hours
from what I had seen they they had done
this test a bunch of times but you have
for testing purposes it looked like
they'd like kind of reset it every time
to sort of say like we want to make sure
that we're seeing what we're actually
what we think we're seeing good so a
pretty interesting stuff and I would be
really curious to see how this robot
Brett develops with better processing
power which is the thing they were
saying is really holding them back from
faster times of him like figuring out
exactly what's in front of him where
it's located and like putting it all
together mm-hmm pretty cool cool yeah
just saying really awesome and also
again another thing to add to the
checklist of this
been a scary year and advancements of
robotics very true very true there's a
lot of crazy good robotic stuff going on
right now yep which is they're learning
which is cool but here ya next year very
scary learn our lesson alright guys
we're gonna take a quick break we will
be back with new releases because it's
Tuesday but before we go of course we
have to show you guys Mario Kart fury
road so check this out we'll be right
back
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a Tuesday which means it's time for
us to tell you all the things that will
be draining our wallet this week it is
time for new releases
now I have to preface all this with
kayla is getting a brand new fancy fancy
McBan kaming rig this week it just ships
it Jay I just got the email just at 20
minutes ago okay it's just shifts so
it's on its way oh yeah winging its way
here hopefully be a drone and which
means kale will be completely he'll be
off the grid you will be an all be on
the gear he'll be inside his computer
but like the matrix pages okay so why
what do you got for me but so for any of
you out there who's not kale and will
not be obsessing over their new amazing
pc this weak-ass platoon is coming out
for wii u this friday which i know a lot
of people are excited about those of us
who have we use and love them i'm really
excited about it because it's a really
fun game I've been playing the global
test fires I didn't play the one this
last weekend but I played the tuba for
that and it was a blast and I like it
and it's a fun game and I've got my
amiibos pre-ordered they're coming in
sometime this week I should be getting
them there's been a lot of people that
have converted towards being really
excited about this it's a brand new IP
yeah and it may not look like it's it's
you know appealing to everybody but
apparently the game plays incredibly
solid and it's very it's very unique but
it's very addicting yeah and very
competitive and there's so many
different unique modes and characters
and there's been I forgot boogie for
whatever his name is played this and
loved it a lot of gamer a lot of like
live streamers and stuff like that'd be
like oh my god this is gonna be the next
thing that I'm going to play so I like
that the matches are all three minutes
each like that's that basically when you
go online and you play these online
matches it doesn't matter how big the
map is or how small it is it's three
minutes like there's no like oh captions
I like matches are always over in three
minutes like it does so there's always a
chance to come back okay there's always
a chance to come back you can always
rally if there's enough to you know
there's it always feels like you have
enough time even if you start off a
little slow you there's time to come
back producer Logan's excited about this
right yeah Logan and I are gonna be
playing slow tune this weekend um I am
NOT going to knowing that this weekend I
would I'd love to I heard that everybody
is gonna be playing this really
it'll just be me and on twitch and you
guys completely yeah yeah everyone will
be anybody who wants alternate
programming tune in to kales cello
playing The Witcher grandpa Lorenzo and
then also in theaters this week the rock
returns to the silver screen with San
Andreas yeah which is a movie I can't
see because it freaks me out too much
because I actually use their to the rock
next to San Andreas and I'm also
terrified the Rock will somehow be
involved in my untimely demise he's just
gonna do it Ashley joke please this
movie's probably gonna rock get out
files your joke file it and also I love
it um but yeah I like a Djinni i did did
art how are you like i don't really i
love disaster movie visuals huh but i
don't really like disaster movies except
for if there's like an alien invasion of
some sort yeah producer Logan you're
excite you like movies with widespread
destruction to write yeah loves a
disaster movie so I mean I think there's
a lot of I would call it disaster porn
there's a lot of that in this movie and
but for me i hate the like this is
obviously the greatest fear of my life
being a lifelong southern californian is
the big one like that's the thing
everyone is always like it's always
looming the back of our minds like we
don't necessarily we I don't change my
life or go about my days any differently
because I'm scared of a giant earthquake
but I'm also you know it's it's a thing
that is a real fear I'd be bigger on
these movies if they were like Game of
Thrones and you didn't know who's gonna
die but you always know the main
character is gonna make it just right
guys out of the Senate dress balls and
stuff like that so that's why I like
these are just kind of CG porn yeah they
are so that's why there's got to be an
alien invasion for me because you never
know you just never know it's true it's
true um did you see that video by the
way where he the rock I don't know if
you guys see anything yeah he married
and he was the officiant I'd like this
guy this journalists wedding who it was
a surprise of the journalists but they
set up this whole secret thing with a
rock like officiated his way it was
Chris check it out it's on screen
junkies just look up san andreas uh the
rock mayor marriage yeah on screen
generous it's great it's so touching
these guys have had like this on running
like history so it's great just great
bromance
junket bromance that they've had like
over the years and then finally as a
producer how hard would that have been
to set up that whole so scary but so
good uh yeah you guys should definitely
watch that and then lastly um oh yeah oh
yeah look at how it uses a have been so
many I'm sure yeah yeah and he's I'm so
happy for this guy and has been his new
wife who is she's so pretty and she
looks so excited to be marrying him and
like and he looks the same and I just
love a good wedding where everyone just
is so happy and thrilled and he I love
that he was like can I have a comb
please like when they're like are you
ready and he's like and I please I would
go hahaha so yeah it was great it really
really great i highly recommend it is it
make it made you feel good well make you
forget plus i mean what a nice guy too
for the rock to do that oh yeah even put
his name in the vows of like a bunch
yeah he plugged san andreas too for what
it's worth it um and then lastly out
right now if you have an android phone
you've been waiting to get your live
stream on periscope is out for android
finally tiny it only took a couple
months um but i know a lot of people who
have android phones are really excited
so prolly super wonky right welford it's
not bad i've heard it's pretty good um
and if ya so and everybody i like on
Twitter this morning a whole bunch of
people are talking about it and there
you know making jokes about here's how
to periscope on android and like all
this stuff so if you are have any
interest in this periscope is pretty fun
and I i like it and i actually just like
it for watching other peoples live
streams like i don't necessarily use it
all the time but i love watching other
peoples live streams of interesting
things in my life is fairly get out of
here luke westaway I London is as
periscope like really caught up cuz I
feel like he's like a it was like big
and then I never hear and then people
you did the people periscope for like a
minute boy think he never touched like a
half hour I mean you can't it's hard
it's hard to then why are your periscope
English make people don't realize how
hard it is to do something alive for an
hour I do well we do every day for a
living for half hour but it's like it's
tough to keep talking it's like live
streaming so when you're live streaming
and you do live streaming the first time
you're like oh my gosh I didn't realize
how hard it would be to play a game and
talk about it to people and check
comments out all at the same time and so
I think live streaming is kind of like
that
little bit of a learning curve there but
once you get it it's really really fun
if you have something interesting you
want to show people Sano try it out I
think it's cool yeah I want to I haven't
I haven't tried it yet you guys I would
love your periscope I like what I do
seem like the guy to periscope I just I
makes me feel like I'd be so
self-involved she's been I look my life
guys watching let's talk I haven't just
I haven't taken that I not find the
right there yeah well the problem is the
right thing is like I look I'm at a
convention too bad you don't get
internet server no internet service I
tried it's our celebration and the
internet was just like no I made do it
at disneyland on Sunday thank you should
totally do that a pair of skillful 80th
anniversary on a periscope like the
whole world of color show or is that
like illegal I think that no I don't
think so cuz I'm sure people have their
phones they record world of color you
and me we're going to disneyland
together excellent so keep an eye on me
on twitter follow him on twitter are you
babes poonam on periscope super easy but
that's it for new releases which means
it's time to get to your user feedback
so last week we asked everybody to use
the hashtag TD message to talk about
what message they would want to send up
into space for the new horizons yeah
yeah they what what message would give
to any intelligent life out there
discovered new her and people for some
reason we're mad about that opportunity
people did not like this like I people
some people wrote to me and we're just
like we should not send anything out
like uh the firt dustin rogers research
dustin wrote in and said nothing to see
here move along move along hashtag
protects planet yeah ok so he's scared
that the aliens will kill us hold on i'm
pulling up everyone's i just i'm gonna
read him real quick ok good no no go
ahead makenga norman wrote in and said i
would send a video of her earthlings
live together uh though are we are from
different continents and races TV
message which i thought that was a very
nice sentiment and well done on that
real nice uh Neil wrote in and said I'd
send a keep away message because not
because I'm xenophobic but because
there's still too many idiots here sadly
but here's the thing Neil what if the
ale what if this intelligent life is
they're not they're intelligent what if
they're not idiots what if they are
idiots I mean that's I think that's a
great for you what it quickly and show
up and they're dumber than we are I'd be
what if swarthy only beings on in the
universe that understand that violence
is even a thing that you should do like
that's so like if the one of the top
comments which had three up votes on
YouTube is is this is stupid can you
people just you stop for a second and
use your brain send a massage to aliens
is like yelling where you are when
you're hiding from serial killers for
God's sake so he is assuming that like
aliens are sitting with sniper rifles on
their way no there's just smoking
cigarettes of putting them out in their
cells just going it someday but kill you
as soon as I hear one as soon as I hear
that message I'm gonna go I'm gonna take
him out but the correct answer was lol
if I sent a message off it would be a
LMAO which is a which is a meme which is
it was a dank memes in life so good job
Brutus Bongo we also got an email from
James who said I think the message this
is a good this is a good email Oh God a
message could include a sample of the
arts and culture throughout Earth's
history artists such as Monet Picasso
van Gogh composers like Mozart Bach and
Beethoven there are many artists in the
last several decades that could be
placed alongside these greats it would
help convey the message of our
passionate human side loss are showing
our creative and intelligent side to
help ensure that these works of our
indoor in some form we could use
Google's mind-boggling capacity to
archive data we could have google set up
a cultural database that could be
accessed from beyond our stars what the
house it grads a really good answer by
the way Logan this is this is a LMAO
it's the alien it's the alien from
Independence yeah this is a this is it
isn't me so this was what they've said
uh yeah but that's a great idea so he
wants like a never-ending cultural
database that's continually we can
update with things I would love it if we
had a cultural database that maybe like
five major tech companies in the world
at any given time they can change they
don't have to be the same one would hold
that information so that we had copies
of it and basically every year we would
kind of have like a global sort of
suggestion box where people could like
write into some website and say like
well this is what should be included
this year or maybe they give us like a
short list of things we pick like what
we put in the time capsule I don't know
it could be cool but anyway you guys had
really good answers to that yeah and
then of course we were
last piece of user feedback which is
always our photographer the day serial
killer aliens did stay away from our
planet get off my lawn and get away um

billboards all around Los Angeles of
like cool Pantera like panoramic views

perfect that would have been a really
good shot yeah that would have totally
been a billboard shot and I just I love

he described it but I picked that one
particularly but he was saying there's
another picture that has the Blue Cross
Blue Shield building lit up just they'll
