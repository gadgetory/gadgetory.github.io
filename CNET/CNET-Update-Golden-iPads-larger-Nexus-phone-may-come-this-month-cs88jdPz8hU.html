smartphones that come with dumb phones
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update when iPhone mania ends iPad hype
begins it's expected that Apple will
unveil new iPads sometime this month
there have been reports that the next
iPad will come in gold Bloomberg says we
can expect a gold 10 inch iPad but it
didn't mention gold for the ipad mini
for some time now we've also heard that
Apple is working on a larger 13 inch
iPad but that may not come out until
next year with the screen the size of a
laptop a larger iPad and keyboard
accessory could challenge Microsoft
Surface as some sort of hybrid portable
device this month we're also expecting a
new Nexus phone from google just like
how the iPhone went larger so may the
Nexus because android police reports
that the Nexus 6 will have a 6 inch
screen and be made by motorola this is
an image created by android police of
what it could look like with this phone
google will also likely launch its next
operating system called android l
PowerPoint presentations may be a thing
of the past Microsoft has created a new
program to present ideas in an
interactive way it's called sway it
pulls together different types of
content video text graphs and it puts it
into a website that can be used for
business or school projects there's a
preview of sway available now and
presentations can be viewed from your
web browser eventually there'll be a
preview available for iOS this will be
part of the office suite of programs
Microsoft may hope schools use sway in
classrooms but google also has something
new to sway students google is offering
free unlimited data storage into
students the goal is to get future
generations hooked on using google apps
and as smartphone screens get larger and
start to creep into tablet territory it
may seem annoying to hold a phablet up
to your ear to talk well here's one
solution to that problem the alcatel one
touch pop mega LTE is a budget
entry-level smartphone that
comes with a small dumb phone called a
buddy I guess this is good for that
special stubborn person in your life who
likes simple phones but you still want
to try to get them to use a smartphone
so you get both for the price of one
you'll find it next month at walmart for
under two hundred and fifty dollars that
