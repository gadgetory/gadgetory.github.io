computer scientist Alan Turing comes up
a lot in sci-fi culture and discussions
about intelligent robots but what
exactly is the Turing test and what does
it mean if a computer passes it Alan
cheering first described what we call
the Turing test in a 1950 paper
cheering wanted to answer the question
can machines think to get to the bottom
of this he devised a hypothetical test
imagine a game with three players one
player the interrogator is isolated from
the other two players one of whom is
human and one of whom is a computer the
interrogators job is to try and figure
out which is the human and which is the
computer by asking questions of both to
make things harder the computer is
trying to make the interrogator guess
wrongly in other words it's trying to be
as indistinguishable from a human as
possible if more often than not the
interrogator is unable to determine
computer from human then hey maybe we're
dealing with a thinking computer
attempts to build computers that can
fool humans have revealed some
fascinating challenges for instance it's
hard to make a computer that's good at
telling jokes the Turing test isn't a
perfect test of robot intelligence for
example it encourages trickery one
recent attempt involved a program
pretending to be a young boy for whom
English wasn't a first language
conveniently covering up any linguistic
slips the Turing test also doesn't
account for non-human intelligence some
of the smartest computers around today
have no chance of pretending to be a
person but that doesn't make the
advances in AI that they represent any
less impressive so just because a
computer looks like his pass the Turing
test doesn't mean we have to bow down to
our robot overlords just yet but
nevertheless cheering's experiment gives
us plenty to think about in terms of how
we define intelligent behavior and what
we would want from an intelligent robot
and after all who doesn't like thinking
about robots
