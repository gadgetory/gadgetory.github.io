the Google home do a lot more than claim
music and control your connected gadgets
they can also help you work up a sweat
without ever stepping foot in a gym
let's take a look at the current state
of smart speakers as personal trainers
the google home has just two main
workout integrations five-minute plank
and fitstar
Amazon's Alexa speakers on the other
hand have more than 30 while there are
time more options through Amazon the
vast majority of the integrations aren't
helpful what I'm looking for during a
guided workout is an explanation of the
various moves as well as at least five
minutes worth of continuous content
here's one of Amazon's more
disappointing fitness skills fitness
helper Alexa open fitness helper here's
your exercise do squats for 30 seconds
as you can see fitness helper tells you
one thing to do doesn't explain how to
do it and then immediately turns off
which really isn't helpful both of the
Google homes workouts give you actual
guidance welcome to 5-minute plank
workout take a push-up position and stay
ready to start a five-minute plank for
example will guide you through the
entire 5 minute workout and give you
instructions along the way my one gripe
with fitstar though is that I had to
repeat myself way more than you usually
do with the speaker for it to understand
ok Google start fit star sure here's fit
star let's start the seven-minute
workout
up next jumping jacks 1 instructions or
ready to begin ready to begin
let's start the seven-minute workout
up next okay Google stop see what I mean
unless you say one instructions it'll
just keep going in a continuous loop so
while most of Amazon's integrations
aren't useful and Google's fitstar
integration doesn't always understand
commands you can still find options
among them that help you get a solid
workout in just a few minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
