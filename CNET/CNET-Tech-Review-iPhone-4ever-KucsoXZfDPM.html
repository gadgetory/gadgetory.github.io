all about the iPhone 4 mostly we've got
Steve's big announcement and Brian tongs
hands-on first look from the WWDC Plus
Safari 5 is released into the wild and
Porsches four-door sports car fails to
make the grade it's all coming up right
now
hey everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review the show where
we run down the hottest videos of the
week and tell you which are good which
are bad and offer some saves bottom line
advice let's start with the good
on Monday Apple's Worldwide Developers
Conference opened in San Francisco who
am I kidding you just want to see the
new iPhone well here you go for 2010
we're going to take the biggest leap
since the original
iPhone iPhone
now this is really hot and there are
there are well over a hundred new
features and we don't have time to cover
all of them today so I get to cover
eight of them with you eight new
features of the iPhone 4 the first one
an all-new design now stop me if you've
already seen this
believe me you ain't seeing it you've
got to see this thing in person it is
one of the most beautiful designs you've
ever seen
this is beyond the doubt the most
precise thing one of the most beautiful
things we've ever made
glass on the front in the rear and
stainless steel running around and the
precision of which this is made is is
beyond any consumer product we've ever
seen its closest kin is like a beautiful
old Leica camera it's unheard of in
consumer products today just gorgeous
and it's really thin this is the new
iPhone 4
it is just 9.3 millimeters thick that is
24% thinner than the iPhone GS again a
quarter thinner in something you didn't
think could get any thinner as a matter
of fact it is the thinnest smartphone on
the planet let me point out a few things
a few of the external things on it here
are the volume controls volume up volume
down and mute on the front we have a
front-facing camera we have the receiver
you have a home button people have asked
what's this
some have even said this doesn't seem
like Apple what are these lines in this
beautiful stainless steel band well it
turns out there's not just one of them
there's three of them and they are part
of the entire structure of this phone
that stainless steel band that runs
around is the primary structural element
of the phone and there are these three
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some brilliant engineering which
actually uses the stainless steel band
as part of the antenna system so it's
got these integrated antennas right in
the structure of the phone it's never
been done before
three and a half inches the same size as
the iphone 3gs yet with 960 by 640
pixels that's four times more pixels
than the iPhone gia iPhone 3GS 326
pixels per inch on 800 to 1 contrast
ratio which is again four times better
than the 3GS we're using IPS technology
this is a very advanced LCD technology
which is quite a bit in our opinion
quite a bit better than the OLED
technology for these types of products
and provides much more accurate color
and much higher resolution you can't
make an OLED display with this type of
resolution right now and so we think the
IPS technology is really quite superior
and it results in incredibly sharp text
images and video
and there you have it a lot of people
bummed there wasn't any iPhone on
Verizon announcement including me but I
gotta say that new design quite nice
speaking of which it's one thing to see
Steve Jobs demo the new iPhone but it's
a whole different world when you can
hold it in your hand and see for
yourself
luckily Brian Tong was able to do just
that so he could bring you this first
look 2010 and here I have two of my new
friends is the first look at the iPhone
4 we got it in black we got in white
let's just check out some of the killer
features of this guy if you look really
closely we have the front-facing camera
this is what it was all about FaceTime
the first phone fully integrated with a
seamless video chat what makes it great
it does work over Wi-Fi only right now
in 2010 they're gonna work with the
carriers to make that happen in the
future hopefully over 3G we'll probably
see it over 4G networks but what you
also have here is the ability to use the
camera on the back side so that they can
see what you're seeing and this phone
here was all about the camera it's a
five megapixel still camera with an LED
flash
it also takes HD video at 720p 30 frames
per second and then when you add all
that together you have the ability to
get their application iMovie for the
iPhone instantly enables you to edit
video with themes transitions take
picture assets music assets as well as
transitions and make a polished video
all on this little device now we also
know it's a really slim form factor this
is nine point three millimeters the
slimmest smartphone to date and some
unique features here is its stainless
steel frame of this frame what makes the
difference is that they've actually
built technology into it that allow to
serve as the antenna so it's not only is
it the structure for the phone but you
get signals to your 3G or Bluetooth and
your Wi-Fi this is the antenna now
another feature you guys may not really
be able to see is its Retina display so
if you compare it to the original iPhone
with the iPhone 3GS the pixels on here
are four times the amount in a one inch
square
you'll get super sharp images and text
here looks super clean but this is one
of those things that you really just
have to hold in your hand hold it up
next to another iPhone and see to
believe one thing I really didn't expect
to see and it wasn't on this iPhone is
4G compatibility this is still a 3G
that will be operated on a tMT's network
and for all you AT&amp;amp;T current iPhone
users if your contract expires in 2010
you have the ability to upgrade to this
phone without paying any early
termination fees so here's the breakdown
these come in black and white cool sexy
colors the 16 kick models are $1.99 the
32 gig models are $2.99 they'll be
available in five countries us included
on June 24 and then worldwide sometime
in September there you have it a first
look se new iPhone 4 I'm Brian Champa
cnet.com that's right June 24th and
pre-orders June 15th coming soon and of
course once the iPhone 4 hits the
streets our crack team of editors will
put it through its paces until then you
can head to seen at tv.com to see more
highlights from Steve Jobs WWDC keynote
and all of our iPhone 4 coverage in
other Apple news the new iPhone isn't
the only thing the company showed us
this week the latest version of the
Safari Browser was rolled out - and
Jason Parker has a first look for you
alongside all the news this week about
the iPhone 4 Apple released a major
upgrade to their flagship web browser
Safari 5 is now available for download
and Apple has added a lot of feature
enhancements to be excited about
I'm Jason Parker from scenic downloads
this is a first look at Apple's Safari 5
web browser though there is a laundry
list of changes and fixes in Safari in
this first look we'll be focusing on
some of the more major enhancements to
the browser most features we'll talk
about are available across both the Mac
and Windows versions of Safari 5 to
start off Safari reader lets you view
articles on the web without distraction
letting you get to the heart of a story
without a lot of added noise when
surfing the web a safari automatically
detects if you're reading an article and
displays a reader icon in the smart
address field by clicking on the reader
icon you'll be able to look at an
article in one continuous
distraction-free view graying out
annoying ads on-screen controls let you
email print and zoom and your zoom
preferences will be remembered for the
next article possibly as part of Apple's
Drive to make html5 the standard across
all web browsers Safari 5 comes with a
slew of tweaks to provide even more
support for interactive content
and media experiences that don't require
3rd party plugins with this latest
update you'll now be able to view html5
video in full screen and view closed
captions we're available with the click
of a button
another new feature in Safari 5 is the
addition of Microsoft's Bing search to
the list of search engines you can
access from the Safari search bar for a
search specific to Bing simply click on
the magnifying glass icon in the search
field and select Bing from the list from
there just type in your search term for
results from Bain one of the
long-awaited capabilities of Safari 5 is
not very first look video friendly but
it's certainly worth talking about Apple
has finally introduced Safari extensions
a way for developers to create plugins
that will enhance your browsing
experience
this means that third-party developers
will be able to use html5 css3 and
JavaScript to create enhancements like
toolbars and custom buttons in your
browser Apple says their extension
builder will make it easy for developers
to create packages of their extensions
for easy distribution and installation
judging from the success of Firefox
extensions we look forward to what
developers will come up with overall
with the big feature changes we've
talked about here along with the
dramatic performance boost enhancements
to the smart search field tab settings
improvements hardware acceleration for
the Windows version and much more Safari
5 is easy to recommend for fans and
worthy of checking out if you haven't
used so bright before
I'm Jason Parker from scene of downloads
and this has been a first look at
Apple's Safari 5 thanks for watching
dammit even when I tried to change the
subject Jason's demo still flips and
stuff about the iPhone and look who
wrote it Jason Parker sneaky alright
let's take a break while I figure out
how to avoid mentioning the iPhone 4
anymore but don't go anywhere there's
lots of bad stuff still to come
you
welcome back to the CNET tech review
your weekly digest of all things good
and bad from Cena TV and on that note
guess what it's time for the bad you
think when a Porsche showed up in the
scenic garage the car tech guys would be
tripping over each other to get the
chance to drive it well if you're Brian
coolly and the Porsche is the new
Panamera think again it's the other car
they said Porsche would never build a
four-door hatchback the Panamera so
while we wait for Ferrari to launch a
minivan let's jump in this guy and check
the tech
you know everyone told me Panamera looks
better in person and everyone lied this
is not a pretty car I'm sorry now the
color schemes not doing any favours a
candy apple green over infant barf bays
hmm
but even silver over black this thing
would still look like Portia gave George
Barris the 911 and said go make a kooky
custom that looks pregnant and he did
let's get inside
now I got to tell you I love what
portions done with the interior layout
this is some really fresh thinking
that's kind of rising center console
here we have a little bit stylized and a
lot of but very useful buttons and look
around the cabinet this is a big deal
with this car for full sporting buckets
this is part of Porsches thing saying
this is truly a sports car with four
seats which we'll have to figure out
let's get out of the technology now the
car comes standard with a hard drive
based navigation system and you can look
at different views we have the 3d
bird's-eye there I can also switch that
to your standard plan view and the map
can also be echoed into this very
double-oh-seven ish round display to the
right of the tachometer we have an
optional media interface you're gonna
hear me say optional a lot on this car
they've gives us a standard aux a USB
jack and a proprietary connector for
this pigtail that goes to in this case
an iPod and another male USB for other
devices now let's say you want better
audio go for the Bose 5.1 surround we
have that in this car that pumps the
power to 585 watts gives you fourteen
speakers nine discrete channels of
amplification if you want to really go
nuts
get the Burmaster audio system for about
six thousand dollars I hadn't heard of
these guys before I'm probably
butchering their name but it's German
high-end audio
now put this guy in reverse and let's
see our rear view camera oh that's right
we forgot to get that option added yes
it's a 94 thousand dollar car and you
have to add the rear view camera hmm
we do have sensors those were optional
too now all these 4s Panamera's come
with a sport mode right here if you bump
it up to a little more aggressive level
optionally you get Sport Plus as part of
the chrono package there's the chrono up
there on the dash this button here's
interesting a little nod to efficiency
this is the auto off thing that a lot of
Europeans are doing now if you want the
engine to stop when you come to a red
light or a stop sign you leave this
thing engaged in other words turn that
off and this thing will turn off when
you stop then you lift off the brake
pedal it'll restart the engine you know
it's kind of hybrid greeny weenie stuff
and of course there's the chronograph as
part of the Sport Chrono Package because
you know you're gonna take your
four-door hatchback to the track a lot
give me a break
what we're talking about silly check out
the key shaped like a little Panamera
with a great big hood emblem
now back the thing you got to deal with
is the oh sweet Jesus has got a
hatchback moments yeah it sure does
but behind there not bad it'll hold a
lot like you can probably Park a 911
back there or enough cash to gas up your
Cayenne once now being an S car we've
got a 4.8 liter v8 in this guy naturally
aspirated this one's got 400 horsepower
369 foot-pounds of torque which even in
this day and age are pretty stout
numbers 0 to 60 happens in 4.8 seconds
pretty good for a big boy 4.6 if you get
that Sport Chrono Package because that
adds some launch control you can really
hammer it off the line mpg is pretty
good 1624 and the emissions numbers are
all right to 5 and 5 for a greenhouse
gas and co2 on a scale of 10 okay so 4.8
liters and 400 horsepower and 4 driven
wheels and two clutches later what does
the Panamera Drive like well this 4s
drives real well you got to remember
you're in a long ish four-door sedan
that doesn't feel like it's got as much
wheelbase as it appears from the outside
I'm not forgiving it for being ugly but
when you're sitting up here in the front
yeah oh and look at the stuff behind you
or outside and it feels like you're
driving a 911 you can pick up folks in
that's pretty cool power comes on for
days and this PDK when you're pressing
the car is great it's a round town where
things get a little annoying it has a
habit of being a little janky when
you're you know in downtown traffic
coming to start some stops and it kind
of goes good joke when it disengages
sometimes it's not a problem it's just
an elegant where it is a problem is on
some of the hills here in San Francisco
trying to start from a stop on a steep
upward grade and for some reason this
thing sometimes forgets it has ears and
up
first reviewer who's had that problem so
they got something to iron out in that
situation a Panamera 4s starts at almost
95 grand then to get it seen that style
you'll be optioning for days USB aux
ipod is 440 keyless access 1100 parking
sensors 600 rear view camera 650 on top
of them the Bose audio is 1440 but the
Burmaster audio system is 5700 and
that's just a small slice of the options
available unfortunately one of them is
not different sheet metal well I guess
the good news is that once you get on
the road this Porsche drives like a
Porsche but let's be honest
isn't the whole point of driving one of
those to look good doing it
I mean personally I don't think it looks
that bad except for the green yeah no
that's pretty bad
in other bad news many of us spend much
more time staring at little screens on
our desks than big screens on our walls
Erik Franklin is our resident computer
monitor expert and this week he's got a
first look at a new sync master from
Samsung and a bit of a complex
hey guys this is Eric Franklin from
sitcom and today I'm taking a first look
at the very affirmative sounding Samsung
sync master P 2450 H I think it's the P
that really gives it it's manly oof
actually it's kind of intimidating with
that p in front of it for the purposes
of this video and so I don't feel like
less of a man more than I already do
I'll simply refer to it SD 2450 with the
2450 sampson for those had adjustment
pivot and swivel options however you can
tilt the monitor back 15 degrees the
display is moderately wobbly when you
knock it from the sides and you can
easily knock it over when the panel is
tilted however when the panel is at 90
degrees we don't believe it's a much
danger of toppling the display has VGA
DVI and HDMI connection options however
they're nestled into this alcove making
it frustrating when connecting or
disconnecting cables foregoing buttons
Samsung includes touch areas and denotes
each with a small white dot the actual
button labels appear as if they're
floating 3d like within the glass the
on-screen display or OSD includes seven
presets and typical brightness contrast
and sharpness controls in movies we
notice a definite green push in the
display resulting in character faces
looking greenish and sickly this issue
also makes the daytime environments look
less natural than they did on the
Samsung px 2370 for example the 2450
also crushes dark gray so that certain
details in movies can't be seen whereas
on the PX 2370 the details are clearly
noticeable games don't look as vibrant
or as graphically impressive as on the
PX 2370 thanks once again to that green
push if you're debating whether to buy
the $260 24 50 or the more expensive px
23 70 we suggest you pay the extra money
for the latter and save yourself some
buyers remorse induce headaches Samsung
shows some flair with the displays on
screen display button array however
overall the display is neither as sexy
as a px 2370 nor can it compete with
this
performance we recommend that you skip
the p20 450h more information check out
my full review at cnet.com once again
this is art Franklin this has been a
first look at the Samsung sync master P
24:58 yeah I mean this monitor looks a
little wobbly but with Eric punching him
like that what do you expect he punched
me once and I didn't get up again for
like three days no I'm totally kidding
I'm kidding
also I can't wait to see that new Scott
Pilgrim movie let's turn our attention
to happier thoughts shall we like this
week's bottom-line I guess there's no
point in avoiding it we've got to take
one more look at Steve Jobs iPhone 4
announcement now at events like the WWDC
Steve's demos frequently elicits cheers
applause even audible gasps but let's
see what happens when things don't go
quite as planned
all right we're going to switch over
some backups here I have a feeling we
might have the same problem
there we go yes I know that they don't
want it so well geez I don't like this
alright let's go baby the primaries I
I'm afraid they have a problem and I'm
not gonna be able to show you much here
today try one more time here why I'm
sorry guys I I don't know what's going
on
Scot suggestions
we're actually done we're actually on
Wi-Fi here so
now before I begin number six I am
our guys are running around like crazy
backstage as you might imagine my demo
crashed because there are 570 Wi-Fi base
stations operating in this room okay we
can't deal with that more didn't really
great that I'd like to show me so we
either turn off all the stuff and see
the demos or we give up and I don't show
you the demo would you see let's turn up
all these MiFi things to my leg turn off
your Wi-Fi every no I'd like them to put
them down on the floor and all of you
look around I'd like you to police each
other shut all the laptops turn off all
these Wi-Fi base stations and put them
on the floor please the bottom line this
week hands off Steve Jobs Wi-Fi you
don't when he asked everyone to put
their laptops down I felt like I was in
elementary school and the whole class
got in trouble and had to put their
heads down on their desks and just for
the record I was using 3G on my phone
not my fault Steve and that's our show
for this week everyone tune in next week
when we will have our complete coverage
from the e3 video game show and a whole
lot more and in the meantime get more
great scene at video at Cena tv.com
see you next time and thank you for
