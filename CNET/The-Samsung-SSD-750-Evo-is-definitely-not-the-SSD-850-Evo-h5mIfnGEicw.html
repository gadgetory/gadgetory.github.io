drive from Samsung how do I know well it
says right here on the back but you're
right on the front it looked just like
the other 850 Evo that came out two
years ago on the inside of the two
drives are completely different
for example the 750 Evo here uses two
the flash memory whereas the 850 Evo
uses 3d flash memory for this reason the
new DRI has a Mac capacity of just 500
gig and the other one up to 2 TB
so what the point of the 750 Evo while
it cheaper it is about 5 to 10 dollars
less than the 850 Evo depending on the
capacity for example this 500 gig drive
right here has a suggested price of just
150 dollar and it's totally worth
between my testing was very fast and
like all other SSD from Samsung that
came out in the last three years it
comes with the Samsung magician software
that help deliver a very nice set of
customisation one of those is rapid with
a further boost is performing by using
the host computers system memory as
cache now it's important note that the
750 Evo here is not the most affordable
drive in the market it is actually more
expensive than most other budget drive
from other vendors but considering the
customization and also the performance
this one here is still a great Buy
but obviously if you want something
larger than 500 gigabyte you have to
offer the 850 Evo which I did and I got
the tutor by because that's the largest
and that's because I'm down low and I
also going to keep this one too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
