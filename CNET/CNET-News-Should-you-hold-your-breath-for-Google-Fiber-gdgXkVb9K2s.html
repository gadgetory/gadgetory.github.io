and immediate as a conversation on a
cellphone or street view images loaded
this quickly this blazing fast
connection as a result of Google Fiber
Google Fiber starts with internet speeds
up to a gigabit a second its internet
100 times faster than what most
Americans have today
three months ago Google Fiber launched
in Kansas City Missouri and Kansas City
Kansas things are so fast and it's so
instantaneous and your workflow is so
seamless fiber is satisfying tech
entrepreneurs need for speed and
physicians are excited about the
potential it holds for telemedicine but
home users shouldn't start dreaming
about uploading hours of cute cat videos
just yet home Wi-Fi routers can't even
transmit this speed and so until some of
the other technology catches up with it
the average resident isn't going to be
able to take real advantage of it Google
provides Wi-Fi devices designed to
optimize the bigger pipe but there are
other bottlenecks current tablets and
laptops weren't designed for gigabit
networks so how many people have signed
up for fiber in Kansas City Google won't
say it's only announced plans to expand
in neighboring areas but nowhere beyond
that's likely because of the cost Google
competitively charges $70 a month for
the speedy pipe but it's reportedly
paying much more some analysts are
estimating that it was costing Google
between six and eight thousand dollars
per home to bring Google Fiber to those
houses
unless Google decides that it's going to
to truly take this effort a nationwide
or other companies come in and figure
out a way to do it maybe at a lower cost
I don't think it's something that you're
gonna see happen overnight
even if three to five years from now it
might not happen but the search giant
has the finances and incentive to
continue offering it it's discovered
that the faster the connection the more
people use you guessed it Google for CBS
