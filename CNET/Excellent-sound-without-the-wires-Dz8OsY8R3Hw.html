cnet.com and I'm here with the Harman
Kardon BT headphones B T stands for
Bluetooth and these are wireless
headphones Harman also makes an NC model
that's the noise canceling model that
looks almost identical to this model but
that model is not Wireless what's
important to note about these headphones
is that they are very comfortable they
are over the ear headphones I wouldn't
say they be the greatest for outdoor use
particularly during warmer weather
because they will make your ear steamy
but as over the year headphones that are
very comfortable they have memory foam
in the ear cups and you could adjust the
headband it comes with two different
size metal head fans these are very
sturdily built headphones a little bit
heavy you can also use them in Wired
mode they come with a cord they also
come with a nice carrying case and they
fold flat they don't exactly fold up but
they do fold flat and when you do have
them in the carrying case they are
fairly compact they fit easily enough
into a laptop bag or a backpack a couple
of other things worth noting these do
support the apt Xcode Act if your
smartphone or a computer or other device
also supports apdex that can improve the
sound quality of Bluetooth but not all
devices feature apdex at this point what
I also liked about it is there's a
remote built-in to the left ear cup it
has three buttons volume up and down as
well as a call answer and button yes you
can make calls this is a Bluetooth
stereo headset as well but those buttons
can be operated by feel you can just
reach up and know which buttons you're
pushing which is nice one thing I didn't
like so much is that the charging cable
plugs into the headphone jack it's a USB
charging cable it's not the standard
microUSB charging cable however so if
you lose it you will have to find
another one instead of just using your
standard microUSB charging cable the
final thing we're talking about of
course is the sound quality and the bt
does have some of the best sound quality
i have heard in a bluetooth headphone
the key thing about bluetooth is it has
a tendency to sound a little bit muddy
since bluetooth is a compressed audio
format and these headphones really sound
not like a bluetooth headphone which is
a big compliment these do list for
around $250 but
can find them now for a little bit
closer to 200 and there are pretty
decent value at that price maybe not the
best mobile bluetooth headphone but for
all-around listening and great sound the
Harman Kardon BT is hard to beat I'm
David karna a and those the HK et
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
