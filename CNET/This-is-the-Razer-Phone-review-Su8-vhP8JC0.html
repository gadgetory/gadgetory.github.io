black slab and it's also the fastest
phone I've ever used because this is the
first handset with the screen that
refreshes 120 times per second let me
tell you it's been hard to go back to
other phones with this phone you can
scroll through websites and read text
that be blurry on practically any other
device games feel more responsive I beat
my high score and smash hit the first
time I tried and razors twin stereo
speakers get mind-boggling Liao for
phone while staying crispy where they're
better than most laptops I've used to be
honest they're not quite as good as the
best Bluetooth speakers but they're
great for sharing movies and tunes and
this is a rock-solid aluminum handset
that feels great to touch even those
corners and his squared off design will
definitely turn heads so those are the
reasons to buy the razor phone but there
are also reasons to maybe steer clear
these giant speaker filled bezels make
the phone as big and bulky as an iPhone
8 plus it's a huge pocket bulge and if
you're looking for wireless charging or
a headphone jack you won't find them
here if you thought the razor phones
huge four thousand milliamp hour battery
would give you days of battery life
think again I made it to bedtime most
days that's about it and the camera well
the best I can say is it's not terrible
photos a good light are pretty decent in
photos at low-light can get ugly fast
it's actually pretty cool to have a
second telephoto lens but razor made it
super difficult to tell when you're
actually zoomed in an iPhone 8 plus zoom
is too
way better also trust me when I say you
should keep HDR mode turned off razor
says it's working on updates for the
camera but for 700 u.s. dollars razors
first phone just as in competitive with
the latest iPhone Google pixel or
Samsung Galaxy phones at camera quality
battery life features or design still
razors 120 Hertz screen and speakers are
pretty awesome and in every other way
the razor phone will get the job done if
you buy phones for bragging rights this
is definitely one to show off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
