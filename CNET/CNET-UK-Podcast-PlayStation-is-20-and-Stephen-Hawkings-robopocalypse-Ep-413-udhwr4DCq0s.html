scene at UK podcast in this episode 413
for friday the 5th of december 2014 the
playstation is 20 years old yotaphone is
back and Stephen Hawking has voiced his
fear of a robot apocalypse with less
than 20 shopping days to Christmas let
I'm rich run home and joining me a
high-tech London studio this week is and
the oil hello hello it's just me just
you yours gonna do you were going to say
another another name I was I wasn't yeah
we had to bring you in because that no
one else would do it but Sir yeah Lou
top doing his Christmas shopping I guess
with Jason as well yes he's is in Mexico
getting getting us presents anyway kids
have you back as always we are filming
the podcast so you can see this and all
our videos on cnet or youtube.com slash
seen it so look out for that but for now
let's start with the news
I'm gonna start by talking to you about
professor Stephen Hawking risk the
renowned theoretical physicist legend
you do know all about his work in depth
as do I'm sure our listeners and I won't
go into detail on that but he has been
working with intel on a new a new
communication system and that is called
a cat or assistive context-aware toolkit
because apparently twice as fast as his
old system which would be as that is the
basis of how he communicates our people
arts sure speeding up by by by twice is
quite a that's that's a lot yeah yeah
yeah yeah imagine if you could talk
twice as good they've done even a this
podcast would be half the length which
I'm sure everybody would appreciate but
yes well they're coughing about this is
that it's actually going to be an open
source platform for researchers and
developers to use the idea is it's not
just being built for stephen hawking to
use but can also be used for other
people who are step from the same
condition that's motor neurone disease
as ALS from american yes pls like the
ice bucket challenge drooling if people
actually knew what that ice bucket thing
was for ya so yeah and other people who
have similar conditions where they can't
communicate nonlin so when so that's
pretty cool yes absolutely a good system
and what's also quite cool is that it
uses am swiftkey which is the same it's
the same that keyboard that you're
building use for android phones mmm
which is a pretty popular absolutely
that i use that also british company so
something to be proud of yeah yes it is
protected I likely i do as well they'll
see stephen hawking for we were on the
smartest men in the world i was going to
have the same auto correct problems as
us so he'll be like do you fancy nipping
out for a riot yeah and that kind of
thing yeah use of suit exactly that kind
of thing yet it's that not all great
news though is it no it's not all good
news in fact because Stephen Hawking has
also predicted the end of humanity and
courtesy of the computers that were all
those using pest lands he says a I would
take off on its own and redesign itself
at an ever-increasing rate right bad
news humans who are limited by slow
biological evolution couldn't compete
and would be superseded Robopocalypse
this is this
terrifying is quite the singularity yeah
I mean well they do they quite easily
finished off good they already well they
could ya becomes poison the food when
the robots basically make most of our
mass produced food they'll build the car
so that the wheels just fall off as
you're driving along yeah kinda
particularly with our automated cars
Google Google Drive stuff yeah yeah they
could just stop working I mean ready
yeah precisely and I'll just Ness can
stop making your house warm in the
winter smart ovens and it's no longer
gonna cook your food everything we
already using technology we just stop
then human race would crumble we're
we're at the mercy of our of our robot
overlords bren stir 21 on one of our
commenters says isn't this while we have
the three laws that's azimuth famous
three laws of robotics and he says
seriously those laws become as important
as the Ten Commandments when the time
comes yeah wise alive also says he has a
bit more measured approach wiser lives
he or she says or possibly a robot we
don't know they say AI will continue to
improve and cost-effective ways that
will threaten have a more human jobs but
it will ultimately be humans calling the
shots if we destroy the planet through
climate change meanwhile then robots
might be the only ones after you can
live here any robot revolution could be
the least of our worries so if it's not
the robots it's the ozone layers it's
the polar bears yeah yeah I've got it
coming from all directions really as the
human race when I want trouble on me but
is that any way maybe the robots for the
most direct for a particular if you've
seen the the big dog walking robot by
Boston Dynamics who have been bought by
google so yeah that is that is terrible
to that this is there any any cool stuff
we can just any trinkets we can distract
us also in doing this in the meantime
whilst we're waiting for our inevitable
demise yeah why don't I tell you about
the yotaphone 20 this is yes right here
for one thing in my hand so yeah viewers
of our of our video podcast scale is
evolving it for listeners we this is the
kind of gold that you get when you watch
the video right and is currently holding
a phone it is no man tacular yeah we're
both pretty handsome yeah now this phone
55 inch android phone you ever ignore
all that nonsense yet all the usual
Android circuits on the back well as an
e-ink display that's the same flip the
survey technology as it has gripped
Tyndall's is pretty cool so super and
good battery life if you
use the earring screen all the time
sounds really cool sounds nice idea
there is a problem there is a problem
there is a problem there's always a
catch 550 pounds which is all
ludicrously expensive for a completely
unknown brand where and admittedly good
but it's a gimmick is what it is and
people need to really know what this and
selling at 550 pounds no one's got a
reason to buy that particularly when you
can get phones like the LG g3 is a sale
right now on amazon for only 300 pounds
i found that today actually 300-pound
embrace yeah like a top-end flagship
with a laser in its camera and a 2k
screen and here's a hitter yotaphone
this is 550 verena and as an aside we've
also got another a new manufacturer that
we just popped into the office and
exhaustion this has last time we've seen
this as premier today in fact so good
that we can take off the everyone loves
taking off the screen protector in the
first but if i do it and close enough to
the mic you can hear that oh oh oh
that's a good sound podcast gold that is
brilliant again when you if you if
you're viewing you be able to see how
thin this is because is astonishing it's
only five millimeters thin a 5.1 i think
i'm chiseled which is called the chasm
something over I put the Box down it
literally has just arrived hey the fact
is the jiffy bag that it has literally
just arrived in so and it's called snow
profession because I'm tornado 348 and
that only costs about 250 pounds so look
forward to the review of that one for an
alternative from a European new
manufacturer absolutely okay cool enter
so speaking of phones but this time
landlines fixed lines yes bad news bears
for BT customers and in fact actually
lots of landline people because landline
prices are not going to be one pound
more expensive Wow I know that horehound
that's 100 fewer penny suites you can
buy every month now I don't even know if
any sweets up any idiot anymore because
it's not all but they were the first
casualty with a bit like sure because
they've doubled immediately yeah if not
more so when you guys get freddos for
tempe anymore
no and Joe how much 10 pence crisps
costs now is it 30 i don't know but then
it's not 10 parents bit that way I'm its
face Raiders for dirt cheap but he's
terribly so Russell's yeah anyway yes
it's BTW talk talk sky and next year
will be virgin as well putting up their
line rental fees everyone's doing this
and just to remind us what we pay for
BTW this week has had a bit of an outage
where people who are on bt broadband
couldn't access the web including me i
was trying to watch the wire on on now
TV in the day I couldn't and I was very
angry maybe it was it way of saying you
should watch something better yes that's
the worst thing in the world like men in
black because really why wouldn't you
always watch funny bike well moving on
from that bad news and to some good news
nostalgia button ostalgie yes so it's
it's the 20th anniversary of the
PlayStation the sony playstation the
first PlayStation and celebrate sony has
released a classic grey version of the
ps4 as in the same classic great colors
of the original model well thats super
ugly grey they got rid of yes master oh
yeah there's almost a throwback of like
the beige IBM pcs again in the nineties
i knows why they made it grey that's so
strange baby i want one because it's
super-limited Edition rich so limited
yeah are in fact only twelve thousand
three hundred units being made is that
all is that yeah that is so you know act
now if you want to get your hands on any
of those two and a half thousand that
without that to be fair thats that's in
reference to the date because yes it was
so low it was launched on the third of
december 1984 so 12-3 brilliant yeah i
mean they could have done 3 12 no they
couldn't anyway you know i mean and if i
hit 3120 so yeah and and that's gonna be
a 400 pounds for the pound if you want
one so yeah there you go and did you
have them one of these i haven't one of
these but i did have the original
playstation test it Oscar I I was I've
always been a PlayStation boy right up
until the xbox 360 okay I'm which one
had both of course good as them um a bit
of a nerd um yeah the PlayStation 1 was
fantastic and I had my favorites of
course cool boarders which every year
still me and my brother we play through
the entirety of cool voice at Christmas
time and we'll be doing so this
Christmas
so you got to get all the special
attractors special there's extra you can
get the Snowman you can get the Alpine
Boyd freestyle board brilliant game that
was good fan 27 of course crash
bandicoot tomb raider these were all the
PSone classics yep I mean I wasn't a
huge game I did own one I won mine in a
pub quiz as she would say it was a pub
cause that was sponsored by Sony so we
won a Playstation each and we also won a
woolly hat each with PlayStation logos
on it and a bag with the PlayStation
name on it and a bottle of vodka that's
I'm gonna say you so you were in a
you're in a pub when you got this so
yeah howdy I was eighteen 18 yeah this
isn't it's a couple years after it came
out with no offense when I got mine I
was six when it came well your northern
so you were probably already in the pub
then anyways bothering my yeah I had
that and we didn't play many classic
games I've used from like driver a lot
remember I used to play a die hard
trilogy and then we'd go out to at the
pub to the pub in the evening and then
are nocturnal flatmate would come out
and play Resident Evil in the dark all
night which was terrifying when you went
downstairs to get glass of water in the
night but there you go I also the ps2
which my girlfriend bought for me which
made up for the Christmas where I bought
her a set of hair straighteners really
expensive ones and she found them before
Christmas and having not bought me
anything she ran out to the shop and got
me a DVD an apple and that's her BD and
a nap a deviant enough for ya but then
therefore my birthday's you got my ps2 I
think she wrote a little bit guilty the
transporter it was ones interested in
why the abbey walls that was just all
they had in the shop there was actually
that's rubbish they had this DVDs and
apples it shop is she going to
themselves both these things Jed's the
quarter shop they say the place there's
opened just before Christmas did anyway
me that week he's trying to guess I
should you either play I'm sorry to
interrupt and you to play a die-hard
with the light gun yes I did I had time
crisis to with the lion crisis yes I
used to rent them from Apollo video in
name wickersley no i didn't i was in
buxton by then I from wherever it was
good as amazing as I couldn't ever
afford to buy a Lycan but I did rent
them from the sharpen oh yeah I know I
did time crisis to as immortalized in
the zombie episode 4 is it zombie ups
it's one of the episodes of spaced
anyway I've pretty sure they play time
Christ in that so there you go anyway
maybe not more memory search shoe yay 35
one of our commented says I remember
using that original PlayStation 1 play
Resident Evil with my dad that's very
nice memory that was in like nineteen
ninety-seven such a memorable experience
Mark Jackson talking about the new
limited edition grey ps4 says I keep
throwing my wallet at the screen but
nothing is happening which is talking
about Tracy too fast for you oh aight
says for a collectors were pretty neat i
like my white on too much to trade in
tho long and Navi HC 78 says four
hundred ninety nine dollars thanks but
no thanks I like mr Jackson's commentary
pro my wallet at the screen but
nothing's happening is that we are we
laughed at that sounds ridiculous but
really if you've got contactless payment
on your in your chest then you could
just do that and just hurl your money at
it and it'll like set the pay for the
future of online shopping and just get
you all it out and just bang fit on the
screen and done Bulls Matthew TV some as
well buy a new one too well speaking of
retro competing in retro gaming yes the
sinclair ZX spectrum is back and well in
a in a form anyway it's called the
spectrum vega and it's actually
currently being crowdfunded on indiegogo
now it's looking for a hundred thousand
pounds yeah of a target which has two
lofty amounts of money you guys think
but it's already reached it and it has
59 days left to go Wow so who knows what
sorts of amazing heights of money they
are going to be rolling in can you
actually get one then how much did it
cost no well so it did cost a hundred
pounds for the full of air for the
consult service like a little micro
console kind of imagined by the
originals that expect to him or more
recently if you imagine like a Raspberry
Pi in a case that sort of thing okay and
and it comes with a thousand games built
in and they're going to be about 14,000
more available to download so without
the original spectrum games are
available and made for it it cost us
alone the games cost a hundred pounds
which in very much but sadly they have
all sold out there are various other
ways you can contribute to web to their
campaign but the original the thousand
consoles have all gone and as far as
I've seen there's no word on whether
going to be doing more runs of these
yeah they're certainly well if it's that
popular it seems the demands they're
absolutely I mean I ascetic spectrum i
had a Commodore 64 did ye yeah it was
beige okay what else is the same
happened to Beijing computer hey that
was that was that was the color to blue
alkali flashing blue lights ice
computing yeah okay yes I'm gonna move
on to some Star Wars news that's right
I'm gonna hand it's over to you rich
mean cars as we all know I am not very
good on films well this did kind of
happen last week with so we thought we'd
mention anyway because we're all very
excited about it I mean obviously you
don't think it's as good as you know a
classic well yeah so if any Star Wars
trailer i did watch it it looks really
cool and i have i have to be fair seen
the original style I've seen all the
Star Wars but obviously even I know that
the original ones are better we don't
have Jar Jar Binks in yeah well that's a
bonus but Sam it's no men in black is no
man in violet shit well we're very
excited bout see I mean I imagine you've
probably seen them by now a foam all 6
20 says Wow one incredible teaser
trailer I can't wait hopefully we'll be
as good as the prequels in terms of
visual impact and as good as the
originals in terms of quality directing
so for a second there we thought foam ol
was was making up some nonsense but
pulled out the bag their phone while 620
and gadget 70 is also said fantastic
trade which recapture the conferral
original trilogy love the x-wings
Millennium Falcon and the soccer ball
droid the new lightsaber however with
the laser guards is utterly useless if
it's meant as a hand guard and other
lightsaber would simply slide down your
blade cut off the guards from the handle
and continue to slice off your arm now
this is a bizarrely enough is a debate
that's been raging online extensively
about how useful via the the made-up
space sword might actually be in a fight
and how safe it might be so if you've
got any thoughts on that then that let
us know gee whiz two cases watching this
made me feel like a giddy ten-year-old
again awesome had to watch it seven
times in a row can't wait a whole year
to see it so they go so that Star Wars
isn't going to be out until next
December so a year from now we're going
to see other trainers in the meantime
probably around may the fourth on the
star wars day star wars day possibly
with the Avengers age of Ultron sequel
because they're both made by disney but
we'll see I'm not trying to think about
how a crossover of Star Wars men in
black would go the only thing I can
think is a man came in here earlier a
dead man
that's not the dead man you're looking
for that's I like you I like if I could
remember anything from any but that
would be they'll be amazing I can take
you through the entire script will
forward rings if you like possibly we'll
do that next week battalion here's a
film that you don't have to wait to see
and this is the hobbits the new Hobbit
film yes I have just taken over the
reins of talking about this before
passing it immediately back to you
because you were at the world premiere
yesterday I was yes I want the green
carpet with Benedict Cumberbatch and
people yeah they'd never read copper
that a green carpet I guess it meant it
was meant to be like middle earth or
something it's just cheaper so that's
the UCAN you can tumble dry a green card
I think that they put it in with
something green and it came out the red
car became a great he's going to bounce
so this is the the hobbit the Battle of
the five armies which is the final film
in the trilogy of what's final film in
the trilogy of prequels blitz also the
final film in the Peter Jackson lord the
rings series unless he gets given a load
of money to make some more it's a pretty
much more the same if you like Lord of
the Rings you will like this if you
don't and all of the Rings there's
nothing particularly new the gas I load
more just songs for no reason yeah
there's three musical numbers yeah
there's a rap battle between Gandalf and
Saruman which is which is it's pretty
fun yeah yeah there's no but I mean
basically it is it's alright i'll
totally deadly yeah ceremony gandalf
layer laying down some rhymes great
great middle-earth flow there's not
enough Bilbo and no decent villains but
apart from that it's pretty good Gandalf
speared one of our reader says I wish
Peter Jackson could do more work based
in middle-earth I hate to see it end can
thus be it sounds like an exclamation
Gandalf gay that's all he also sounds a
little bit like you know Gandalf wife
who has to go along to party to pretend
the Gandalf anyway so yeah reader in
Houston says so glad it's over Jackson
did such a great job on the lord of the
rings the hobbit was a flop didn't like
at all it should have been no more than
two movies which i think is a fairly
fairly popular sentiment but you know if
you like Lord of the Rings then the same
as the only no one really shouldn't have
to be anyway if any I mean you didn't
have to be a film at all right let's be
honest that's true that's true anyway so
yeah we check it out that's out very
soon in the UK and then it's out the
week after very soon in the US so we've
already seen it because you're cool yeah
yes anyway cool let's cert move on and
here we go to be saying in this week's
feedback
feedback time so what you guys were
saying on facebook and the like PS
Khokar I hope I'm saying that right
apologies for not is it the right time
to buy a laptop or should i wait for
processor m's this is intel core m
processor yeah i can wait if it's if
it's going to be a major change so well
yeah there will be some changes it's
more about the size so I'm going to have
like really thin tablets ops ii is
designed for mobile not for like desktop
pcs so really really skinny tablets and
as with all new Intel processors it's
all about more power and taking up less
battery so potentially less than nine
millimeters thick heard the thickness of
pcs from 2010 so if you do have a bitter
but pieces bit older you can get a new
on a tablets like a third of the
failures but you would have to like to
wait because it's it's out it's
available now for manufacturers and
we're going to be seeing laptops and
tablets in the first few months of 2015
so yeah but too long to wait to find out
but if lightness bothers you if you want
to really like that top then I would say
it's very worth and keeping your eye on
the january sales for computing there
because obviously they have sales anyway
but knowing that they're going to get a
whole load of new pcs coming in show a
gun want to shift this stock that's a
good time to do it and that some
bargains on my pc with some great deals
good tip money saving andy the only
saving an today's Christmas yet again so
Martin Leo David Robertson says I've had
the runs for three days should i go see
a doctor also burns when i pee that
can't be good can it's now this isn't so
much a tech question but we feel that
you know as a public service we should
probably answer it the answer that is
yes yeah i mean we obviously we're not
medical professional so don't take that
i would not know we just play one TV but
yes so there you go Matthew Dawson Jones
has sent in a review of the 2013 google
nexus 7 which was written by his
daughter i presume his daughter Martha
who is nine months old and she says it
tastes nice and it sounds great when you
hit it with a small plastic giraffe
which sounds like a four-star review to
me well sounds like exactly what I wrote
in my review that's it that's up on your
new benchmark at the giraffe test tick
camel more sense good question what's
going to be the hot new tech of 2015 and
why well same big trends we've been
saving for while we're going to see a
lot more wearables obviously we got the
apple watch coming yes see more Android
wear stuff we'll probably see new stuff
Google glass whether you should be
excited about wearables yet I mean I'm
not yeah I'm so waiting fest that that
big product can I think this i think
this Christmas might be a big big thing
because I heard some people talking some
analysts and some retail analyst talking
about how we're wearables might be big
this Christmas with smart bands and then
smart which is being bought as present
to people yeah lots of sales but I still
don't think there's a particular reason
to be excited about what they do they
aren't the revolution that smartphones
were to feature phones they're not
bringing in this whole knee thing yet
yes yes rich another one that might come
back I think become big this this year
is smart home so we might see things
like the nest thermostat becoming a lot
more mainstream quietly mainstream I
think it's not really thing that a
flashy thing really quite let me come
along I have not no I rent my places
yeah let's problem I think just like
Russell Brand yeah yeah he rents yeah
yeah how much he is I don't know what
unites actually and the other thing I
think might be a big thing I actually
tried this out the other day I tried
knocking some oculus virtual reality
stuff at the hobbit premiere they've
made a sort of virtual reality movie in
midler they've gone to New Zealand and
they've done this thing where you saw
you look around in middle-earth you
you're into a bag end in Hobbiton you
look around and you can kind of see
Gandalf walks past you and fireworks go
off and you look up in the sky and you
can see the fireworks so occupied may
actually release a project but they set
their product but there's Sony Morpheus
the Samsung gear VR so there's all this
when we over there did you look down and
we're terrified by your huge hairy feet
my name is had gone down which you
haven't put it on yet that is that is a
manned every single morning that's true
all right thank you very much for the
feedback please keep feedback coming it
by emailing us at cnet UK podcast at CBS
i.com that's it for this week thank you
Andy thank you rich it's been a pleasure
thanks to our producer Mark who you will
never see right we're off to play
resident evil in the dark see you next
