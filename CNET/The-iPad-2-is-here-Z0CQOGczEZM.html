the Apple bite and this week it's all
about the iPad 2 Steve Jobs made a
surprise appearance to a standing
ovation to announce Apple's latest
tablet morning
Wow that was emotional so let's just
show you the goodies with Donnell
Belle's hands-on with the iPad part Jews
hey i'm donald bell for cnet.com we're
here at Apple's iPad to launch event and
I'm holding the iPad 2 in fact I'm
holding the white version of the iPad 2
there's now two colors a white version
and a black version all the same prices
all the same capacities as last year's
but you're now getting much thinner
design a lighter design and also getting
a faster processors there's there's a
dual-core a5 processor in here it's
promising nine times the graphics
performance of the original iPad you
also get any few new features you're
getting a FaceTime feature for video
calling you get HD cameras on the back
and a VGA camera on the front Apple is
also announcing two new applications for
the iPad their own applications ones
iMovie for the iPad which was available
before on the iPhone and the iPod Touch
it's now coming to the iPad is the most
sophisticated version at least the most
sophisticated mobile version of iMovie
we've seen yet you have the application
the Apple announced today for the iPad
is GarageBand this is going to be a
pretty cool application out there for
you musical types does multitrack
recording virtual instruments a lot of
fun we're gonna see this thing March
11th so having played around the iPad 2
the little bit that I've had to hear I
have to say the thing I like about it
the most is how thin and light apples
been able to get the design having seen
a lot of their competitors this past
year I haven't seen anything that's
gotten this small and I think be able to
preserve that ten-hour battery life is a
big deal
it's gonna be hard to be able to keep up
with that so for cnet.com I'm Donnell
Bell showing off the Apple iPad 2
amazing now let's be real there are
plenty of things that many of you aren't
happy about it still has no flash
support the screen is the same
resolution
there's no SD card slot the cameras are
for video and not stills and you have to
pay for an adapter to get HDMI out it's
a dual-core tablet with ten hours of
battery life and it's thinner than the
iPhone 4 so yeah I'm getting one now it
will be available in the US on March
11th there are no pre-orders so expect
lions and also expect that same guy who
sleeps overnight to be the first in line
at every launch to be there too but
forget about the iPad 2 the coolest
announcement by far was Apple Smart
Cover this thing offers no protection
whatsoever except for a thin piece of
material that covers your screen and it
automatically aligns itself with magnets
it wakes the iPad when you remove it and
puts it to sleep when you put it on it
folds and rolls into a stand both
horizontally and vertically this thing
does more than my last girlfriend and I
want one the red leather one because you
know how we like leather alright let's
take a little break for our iPhone app
of the week this week's iPhone app of
the week is tiny wings it's 99 cents and
no this isn't an Angry Birds ripoff even
if you know the birds look exactly the
same but all you have to do is touch the
screen to fold your wings to make
yourself heavy and gain speed going
downhill let go to fly and it's the
classic simple cute and addictive game
just like Arielle all right to the quick
bytes iOS 4.3 was briefly featured and
you've seen it on our show it will be
released to the public on March the 11th
with support for the iPhone 4 GSM model
the 3GS and the third and 4 gen iPod
touches but not the Verizon iPhone 4 at
the moment also iMovie and GarageBand
where two apps that I'm genuinely
excited about and they make the iPad now
a device that's not only for content
consumption but content creation
they'll be $4.99 for each app the
universal version of iMovie for iOS
devices will work on the iPad 2 iPhone 4
and the 4 gen touch but not the original
iPad while GarageBand will work on both
iPads now I know there's some of you
that aren't impressed by this iPad
update but for those of you looking for
a sweet deal check out the refurbished
section of Apple's online store where
you can now get the original
oh gee 16-gig iPad that's good as new
with the same warranty for 349 so yeah
you might want to get on that
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show now we want to hear how you
the Apple biters feel about the iPad to
read your emails the next week's show so
send us your thoughts to the Apple bite
at cnet.com i'm brian tom thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
week for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
