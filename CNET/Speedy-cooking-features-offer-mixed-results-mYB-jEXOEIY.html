is trying to do with this oven the lde
44:15 st i would say that that word is
speed so this LG model is a 30 inch wide
electric double oven there are two oven
cavities that add up to a total of seven
point three cubic feet of space which is
pretty roomy especially for a double
oven now with the double ovens LG has
equipped different features for
allegedly faster cooking one of those
was the roast and speed roast features
now in the bottom oven cavity at roasted
chicken with my normal testing routine
and recipes and that chicken cooked in
about an hour which was pretty fast for
that recipe but when I used to speed
roast test you don't need to preheat the
oven and that chicken was finished in 50
minutes
now the other fast features were a
little bit of a mixed bag there is a
speed royal feature that's only
available in the upper oven and it was
actually slower than the traditional
broil feature in the lower oven now this
oven retails for 1799 dollars which is
on the upper end of mid-range models
like this LG however with the spacious
double ovens plus some really fast
roasting and boiling times I think this
is a worthwhile investment for your
kitchen to read more about this LG oven
