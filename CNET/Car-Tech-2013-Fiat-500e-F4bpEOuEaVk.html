electric vehicles others seem that they
wanted to be from the day they were born
I've got a hunch this is one of those
let's drive the 2013 Fiat 500e efore
electric and check the tap now see
that's positioning this 500 e not
entirely as a green car but also as a
sporty car they're trying to split the
difference here it might be a little bit
semantics but you know there are
different ways of tuning electric
vehicles I hope this one is as sprightly
as it is miserly spot one in the wild
pretty easily you got 500 e badges
around it different and I think kind of
ugly wheels a unique sort of diffuser in
the back and a low deep chin in the
front that only the e has also no rag
top is available on the electric like on
the Cabriolet
but you can get an optional glass
sunroof the first thing you notice in
this 500 different from the others is
there's no speedometer that's kind of a
trademark thing on this car but in this
one they've got an LCD panel a round one
with key zones on the Left that's
percentage of charge of the battery down
at the bottom estimated miles remaining
it's a constantly moving target always
being calculated based on how you drive
and how you've driven and then on the
right you're either into the power on
the top you're kind of driving easily on
the middle or on the bottom there you're
putting some regen back in the battery
that's what's going on there plus your
speed now that brings us to the other
screen these clip-on tom toms are
nothing new for Fiat this one gets a few
new tricks as you might imagine see that
little button right there that will show
an overlay of charging stations for
example this units also got the
intelligence to plot a route that is
within your range or tell you it's not
we also have here a slide from the
navigation stuff is a car menu with some
interesting integrated features between
this pnd and the vehicle but over here
this actually adds kind of three more
gauges to this minimalist panel so
you've got how much drag is coming off
your climate control it might prompt you
to turn down or off the heater of the
a/c and this will tell you how much your
actual drive motor is taking at the time
well speaking of charge since the
up there that's actually a giant charge
indicating when you plug your smart
phone in it's got the little indicator
saying is charging about how much that's
what this does for you and the whole
world to see at a glance now the other
big change in this cabin is since the
engine goes away the shifter goes away
instead you've got a very simple
push-button drive control there's no
transmission there's just a reduction
gear so there are no paddles there's no
sport mode there's no faux shipping now
on to the audio system for sources
pretty simple you got am/fm and
satellite radio no HD radio by the way
under media it's whatever you can ran
into an aux jack or a USB over there in
the glovebox if you don't want to rely
on those new screens you've got a third
with the Fiat access app you can put on
your smart phone it duplicates a lot of
what's on this screen in that screen but
it's also got the ability to locate your
car look at some information on the
vehicles energy history if you're that
kind of geek you can also check and
initiate charge blow the horn
preheat or pre cool the car while it's
still plugged in and lock or unlock the
doors the reason you want to preheat or
pre cool the car is because you do that
while it's still plugged in allowing it
to do that off of shore power and not
take out of the drive battery it's an
interesting technique to use for most
Dedes now under the ease diminutive hood
about the size of a clipboard you'll
find a special engine cover that covers
no engine at all of course electric
motor and here's the guts yes you can't
see the motor what you see first is the
inverter this is a key part that turns
the DC in the battery into that AC the
motor wants and the motor is down in
there Down Yonder this is your service
battery like all cars have electronic
control unit basically nothing
serviceable up here although you do see
a lot of elaborate cooling reservoirs up
here because this vehicle's key
technology is the battery and that has a
thermal management system so it in hot
weather or very cold weather they say
the rain stays pretty much spot-on that
battery has 97 lithium-ion cells and it
not unlike the technology in your phone
or tablet total capacity of 24 kilowatt
hours that's how they measure battery
capacity in cars that delivers a 111
horsepower that's a few more than a
standard 500 and 147 foot-pounds of
torque
that's a lot more than a standard 500 it
gets
is car up to 16 about nine point one
seconds a few tenths faster than any non
turbo gas engine 500 much slower than a
turbo or in Abarth now the key here is
600 pounds extra weight that's how much
those batteries way and that means this
car could be a lot quicker if its own
power that wasn't making it so quick
wasn't so heavy you see how you kind of
chase your tail and electric cars
sometimes the efficiency numbers are
good in fact class-leading says Fiat 108
MPGe that's the equivalent mpg as the
EPA defines it which is an average of
some city and highway put together same
thing for range blend those two together
you get 87 miles EPA stated now getting
juice into that apparatus can be a Tale
of Two Cities
once this connectors plugged in and
hooked up to the wall somewhere it may
stay there 24 hours or four hours 24
would be charging from almost dead flat
on a household connection a 110 120
outlet if you can find a 240 or a
level-two like your dryer runs on this
guy will charge from flat in under 4
hours a huge difference and you can have
the Fiat 240 volt charger installed and
wired up to your 240 circuit for about
2,000 bucks at your house little pricey
or you can find a public charging
station with level 2 and that's findable
on your app or on the TomTom or you go
to a Fiat dealer they're supposed to all
have at least four high current charging
outlets doesn't mean that I'll be
waiting available but more than likely
I'll check this out when you buy a 500
you also get 36 rental days at
Enterprise rental car on the house from
Chrysler Fiat for those longer trips
those one or two week vacations where
you don't want to be charging all the
time they'll pick those up and stick you
with a gas-powered chrysler you get 36
of those spread across three years so
you've got roughly two weeks per year of
gas engine driving on their nickel
now first off you can't really tell but
as I was coming out of that stop sign
creep is built into the software so as
you come off the breaks this car starts
to creep like a car with an automatic
transmission but it gives up almost
nothing in terms of ride quality in a
comparison to the Nissan Leaf and that
has so far been my high-water mark my
benchmark for really good ride quality
in an electric car that doesn't cost
near six figures but it's way more power
than a standard 500 it's way more
interesting power in a sense than a 500
turbo it's arguably the go to 500
configuration if you're into an electric
car now let's talk about the way the
thing handles corner zips around an
angle it definitely sticks down to the
ground much better than any of the other
five hundreds that I can recall the
handling of you can go around a corner
better and it can either feel sporty or
it can feel just heavier this one feels
more heavy not in a bad way but it's not
quite the same as getting a corner done
better with a sports suspension it's
getting a corner done better with 600
pounds of stuff and by the way the
battery pack runs pretty much from the
front of the pan back to about the rear
axle line so that mass is nicely
distributed in fact this car has a
vastly better four to aft balance than a
stock 500 which is really lopsided this
car is not it's a fun little car to
drive but the problem with a TV is at
least unless you live with one a lot
you're always worried about range you're
always wondering well I shouldn't really
dip into it too much because I might
need those miles and as a result you may
not have as much fun with those bolts as
you'd like
unless price of 500 e it goes bass 4:30
to 5:00 a lot for a 500 I know but it's
no ordinary 500 here come the discounts
and credits $7,500 federal tax credit as
of this point in time $2,500 off on
California tax now that's the only place
this car is sold right now sorry I just
tuned out 49 states worth of you and I
hear there's up to $2,000 of cash on the
hood at the Fiat dealer put all those
into play and you're like 20 to 1 out
the door and this guy load it up as much
as you want to that's a hell of a deal
so here is the point in the video where
I normally tell you how long it'll take
to earn back the penalty of a hybrid or
an electric MSRP but there really isn't
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
