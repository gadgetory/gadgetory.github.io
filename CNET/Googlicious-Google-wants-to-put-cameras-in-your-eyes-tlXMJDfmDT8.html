Google Isha's for all the Google that we
can pack inside of a show each week
let's get to the show in we start off
with a little bit of moonshine moonshine
what it's not that moonshine
but according to Android police Google
is working on new icons for its Android
apps that more closely resemble the
icons used for its web apps now
internally the goom's is calling it
moonshine and it's expected to bring a
flatter icons with harsher shadows for
apps like play music books and movies
and core apps like mail YouTube and the
Play Store and more that you can see
here now these may not be the final
icons yet but there's strong evidence
that they are indeed real after three of
them recently appeared on the Google
partners page but it's an indication
that androids new look will be getting
even simpler and flatter than it already
is and also for one day and one day only
woohoo glass will be on sale for anyone
in the US on Tuesday and sure it might
be too late by the time you're watching
this finishing up your taxes and
realizing you might have a tax refund
that covers the Google glass price tag
of $1,500 plus tax
but if you missed out don't worry you'll
be just fine after a website patent bolt
found that Google has filed a patent
application for a micro camera component
that will complement its recently
announced smart contact lenses now
Google's smart contacts are still in the
prototype phase and will have the
ability to monitor glucose levels in the
tiers of diabetic users now this patent
application would allow the user wearing
the contacts to take pictures of
something by simply looking at it and
also notes that it could use multiple
cameras and even help scan raw image
data of oncoming obstacles let's say
somewhere like a crosswalk and send an
audio alert to the user if they are
someone with impaired vision this just
sounds crazy awesome it's only a patent
application and it's not a real product
just yet so really maybe you should just
buy a Google glass with your refund and
since we're on the topic of glass sports
teams like the Golden State Warriors are
bringing technology to
fan experience so we got a chance to go
to a game and hang out with Kevin Cote
their senior director of digital and
find out what the Warriors are doing
with class and that my friends is the
perfect segue alright guys now we're
here at the mecca of technology here in
the Silicon Valley you know what this is
Google glass and the Warriors are
jumping on this and you guys are
developing your own of Google glass
application correct correct
yeah glass wearin and really it's an
extension of our mobile app again being
in the Bay Area we probably have more
adopters of Google glass than most
markets so we want to make sure we're
ahead of the curve again and bring that
experience to to this platform and the
thing about this is this is not going to
be just isolated at any section you want
any fan that it comes to a game then is
wearing a pair of these bad boys $1,500
right now to be able to jump into your
app what type of information and things
will they be able to see so it's
actually built on the same Android
platform as our Android mobile app so
anything from play-by-play shot charts
to game flow information about the
players and then someday also live
camera angles different different camera
angles altering throughout the arena
anything that really enhances that
experience so that you don't even have
to look down you can be watching the
game but then they're actually looking
up up into the right and seeing stats
and anything that's going to make the
game even more enjoyable we know in the
ad D information all day every day age
that's gonna be important you know I
really think that reporter is very very
good and more Google News The Wall
Street Journal reports that the big G is
considering giving higher search
rankings to websites that use secure
encryption if true it could force more
websites to adopt a more secure set up
making it harder for cyber criminals to
spy on users even if they'll find
another way to do it now it's just under
consideration and I get the idea behind
this but changing rankings for sites
that are actually providing better data
and more relevant data but then pushing
them lower if they aren't secure enough
come on Google don't be evil
and in another Wall Street Journal
report they say the goom's is purchasing
Titan aerospace makers of high altitude
solar-powered drone aircrafts that are
intended to fly non-stop for years well
they were really cool until that point
because that doesn't sound scary at all
now it's believed Google will use the
drones to collect more aerial imagery
for maps but even more intriguing is
Google and Titan will work closely on
Project loon now that's the plan to
build large high-altitude balloons that
can send Internet signals to areas of
the world that are currently not online
Titan may also work with another Google
project called Makani to develop an
airborne wind turbine that generates
more energy at a lower cost than
conventional wind systems see guys they
really do everything and one quick note
before we go HCC officially announced
that they will push out a sense 6.0
update out to original HTC one owners by
the end of May it's unclear which new
features will actually make it from the
m8 version to the previous m7 but it's
good news either way all right that's
gonna do for this week's show email us
at Google issues at cnn.com or tweet me
at brian tong thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you guys next
week for some more of that Google issues
