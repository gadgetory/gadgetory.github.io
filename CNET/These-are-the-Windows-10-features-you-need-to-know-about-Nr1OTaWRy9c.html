windows and there's a lot to check out
hey animate we've seen it today we're
taking a look at all the new and revamp
features in Windows 10 first up is the
Start menu which has been completely
redesigned to make a little more sense
on devices with a keyboard and mouse
without ruling out touch users you can
drive on the edges to resize it if you
want a little more room or you think it
takes up too much space
windows snap has also been souped up
drag one of the windows you're working
with over to a side or corner of the
screen and it'll snap into place and the
other apps that are currently opened
will show up as little thumbnails click
them and the shift to fit the rest of
the screen here's one of my favorite
features press the task view icon on the
taskbar and you get a bird's-eye view of
everything you're working on see that
new desktop button in the corner there
click on it to create a new virtual
desktop you can also just drag an app on
to it to move it over these virtual
desktops behave just like a normal
desktop but to keep all of your stuff
separated a new feature called the
Action Center works as a sort of
information out for your PC click the
icon on the taskbar to bring it out all
the notification you receive will sit
right here just like the Notification
Center on your smart phone
you'll also find easy access to a lot of
important controls for your PC so I've
barely scratched the surface here but
this should give you a pretty good
overview of what you can expect in
Windows 10 I'm Nate

coverage on SEANET thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
