we have a first look here at Microsoft
smart glass technology now what makes
this really unique this is taking
tablets and phones whether you're from
Android Windows Phone Windows 8 or iOS
and being able to use them as a second
screen to control and also interact with
different content on your TV through the
xbox so what we have here an example for
is something like an app from HBO go and
what we've shown here is the fact that
you can watch the content from HBO let's
talk about something like Game of
Thrones and in the intro you'll see this
map how they go across the land that
information will be displayed on a
tablet at the same time leveraging the
second screen technology now they've
also shown other examples of how you can
use this with a paramount app this is
where you're watching a movie like
school broth and you can find out more
information about the characters about
the scenes within the second screens
scroll through them and then select that
scene to play on your TV set another
example of how smart glass works is with
Internet Explorer now this is really
unique because you can use your phone
device to control the browser you can
use your finger to move the cursor
around to select specific links and that
all is also displayed on the on the
television screen as well now if you
want to know when smart glass will be
available there's going to be a fall
update rolling out to xbox live then
platforms like Windows 8 iOS and others

their platform you'll be able to control
content through your xbox and see it on
your TV screen so there you have it
