holding in my hand the fujitsu stylistic
s01 an Android smartphone designed
specially for seniors now unlike some
phones designed for the older generation
it doesn't have big clunky patronising
plastic buttons instead it's designed to
have the full smartphone experience so
you get a big colorful touchscreen and
all the Android apps you could want so
the first thing you notice is that such
screening designed to be easy to use and
avoid accidental presses so instead of
just tapping on it as you would with a
normal phone what you have to do is you
have to sort of press a little bit
harder because it's a pressure-sensitive
screen which means you avoid accidental
presses and with the big icons it means
it's much easier if you press on the
thing that you wanted to press on
another way of keeping it simpler is
that everything is all on one home
screen there's no swiping left or right
for a grid of apps or anything like that
so you start off with your basic
functions at the top like calling text
messaging email your contacts and also
these big friendly speed dial shortcut
buttons that you can assign to your your
friends and family or your loved ones
these big orange one two three numbers
and then as you scroll down you get
things like headlines Google search
internet search maps camera video access
to the Google Play Store and so on as
you keep going down many but your
settings this is quite cool as well you
also have a big button that says my
number on it so you can press that at
any time to get your number so you don't
have to remember your own number if it's
if it's a new phone and then as you go
further down then you get more
complicated stuff more advanced features
you've got a bunch of apps including
tripadvisor amazon YouTube that kind of
thing built in until you get to the
bottom and you can download even more
apps one of the great things about these
the big icons on the home screen is that
their color coding that you can see that
they're all different colors and those
colors correspond to pages in the manual
to make it really simple to look up how
to use them and when you do open up an
appt with one of those long presses
every app has this ? in the top which
has access to help so that you can
always find the the Help button in the
same place and once you're done using an
app we're going to do is press D at the
physical home button and it that kills
the app so you don't have loads of apps
running and using at the battery it
takes you straight back to the home
screen and there's also a couple of
features to make it easier for seniors
to make phone calls so for example there
is
Mike in the front to pick up your voice
and a mic in the back which picks up
ambient noise and cancels it out so it's
easier for you to hear there's also a
very clever feature that allows you to
input your age and then the phone will
adjust the ste the frequency of the
voice on the other end of the phone
which allows you to hear better so
that's the software also in terms of the
hardware it's a waterproof case so it
can survive being dropped in the
bathroom sink or in a drink and you can
also wash it afterwards and wash it
clean it has the little charging points
here so you don't need to plug it in to
charge it you just drop it into a dock
just like you do with a normal landline
phone a cordless phone another feature
that's really useful for seniors is you
have this button here which is an alarm
so when you slide that out a little
buzzer will go off to alert people in
the vicinity and it also dials out to
your specified contacts and and tries to
get hold of someone to raise the alarm
that you that the person owning the
phone has fallen or is in trouble and
cleverly if it reaches a voicemail it
will simply try the next person on the
contact list so it always is trying to
get hold of someone speak to someone to
make sure they can let you know that
you're in trouble so that's the fujitsu
stylistic s01 it's coming to france in
june on orange and it's packed with
features that make it simple to use for
seniors and I've got to admit there's a
few things I wouldn't mind on my phone
