receiver which offers excellent sound
quality and a decent selection of
features for the money it sounds better
than the equivalent down on a VRS 730
for example but the trade-off is it
doesn't have as many features if you
want Dolby Atmos or even a host of HDMI
ports the amaha is not for you otherwise
this receiver is everything you'd expect
from the company
it offers five channels of amplification
at 80 watts a channel and it includes
Yamahas music path a multi-room system
used for streaming music from your phone
or Pandora / wife
it also offers Bluetooth in and out the
only thing this doesn't have is a lot of
HDMI inputs only ball not great if you
have a lot of different sources most
competitors offer six or more but in its
defense at least these ports are
compatible with 4k and the numerous
flavors of HDR including Dolby vision
and hig sound quality is where the
Yamaha R is at and the rxv 483 has a
very lively sound that makes movie
soundtracks exciting we tried it with a
number of different speakers both bright
and hard to drive and warm and it did a
good job with them all the amaha also
makes music a lot more involving than
the 10 on competition while paying even
more for a Sony ST RDM 1080 receiver
will rip even further benefits this
Yamaha is one of the best options for
under 500 us if you do favour
performance over features the rxv 483 is
a very good option for home cinema fans
on a budget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
