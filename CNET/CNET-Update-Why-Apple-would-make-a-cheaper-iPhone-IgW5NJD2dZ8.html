gadget I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update for some people summer
vacation could mean standing in line for
the next iPhone more reports are
swirling that Apple's planning to launch
the next iPhone sometime in the summer
but it's more than just that the wall
street journal's latest report also
backs the rumor that apple is working on
a cheaper version of the iphone and it
could be made of plastic if you're
wondering why Apple would ever make a
cheap version of its iconic high quality
status symbol phone it could be to
target the growing prepaid market or
people just want to pay for the phone
without getting into a two-year contract
it also could be for emerging markets in
other countries that are demanding more
affordable phones the streaming music
service rdio is getting into the video
business with video it's a store for
buying renting and Sharon movies and TV
shows with friends at first only
subscribers to our do can try out this
video version and it has thousands of
titles if you're unfamiliar with our do
it's similar to Spotify and that there's
a free ad-supported version for
listening to music on demand or paying
ten dollars a month get you the ability
to listen without ads on a smartphone
good news for hipsters if you ever
bought a vinyl record on Amazon you can
now get the digital copy for free stored
in your amazon cloud player library it's
part of Amazon's new Auto rip service
amazon first offered auto rip for people
who bought CDs and now it also applies
for vinyl records here's a bit of trivia
to end today's roundup the first cell
phone call was made 40 years ago on a
2-pound phone in New York but the first
commercial text message was sent 20
years ago and two-way video chatting
became a feature on cell phones in
Europe 10 years ago believe it or not of
course the tech is much more reliable
now with Skype and FaceTime so what's
the next advancement for communication
expect to hear more about HD voice if HD
on your TV makes for a sharper picture
than HD voice is sharper sound people
will sound more like their natural voice
and they'll be less interference it's
already used in Europe but it's just
coming out now in the US
t-mobile says its iPhone 5 will have HD
Voice 18t and sprint plan to come out
with HD voice sometime this year but
don't expect all your calls to suddenly
sound better when it launches you first
have to have one of the newest phones
that can handle HD voice and then it
will only work if you're on the same
network that means if you're on 18t you
have to be talking to someone else with
an HD voice phone on AT&amp;amp;T but there is
good news if you want to get out of a
call it's still totally believable to
say hold on a seem to be breaking up
that's your tech news update you can
