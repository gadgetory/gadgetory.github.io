getting into the laptop business take at
least one product in your lineup and
call it the pro model Apple's Gotham
MacBook Pro and Hector's the iPad pro
Microsoft has the surface pro and
Samsung has a higher-end version of its
excellent notebook 9 series called the
notebook 9 pro what makes it a pro well
it's got a dark slate light color which
makes it seem more serious and
professional but more importantly it
includes extras like a stylus and a
graphics card that other midsize laptops
blackness the stylus has great
implementation mostly because it slots
right into the body of the laptop pull
it out and it launches a little pop-up
window for pinout this is the same
passive stylus found in other Samsung
devices like phones and tablets it's not
as advanced as the Apple pencil or
Microsoft pen but for note-taking and
sketching I liked it and you never have
to worry about whether it's charged up
or has batteries of course using a
stylus on a laptop screen is a bit hit
or miss so I'm pleased that this has a
full 360 degree hinge folding back into
a tablet shape the basic AMD graphics
aren't gonna make this a gaming machine
but it can be useful for artists and
photographers and video editors and it
doesn't seem to add a lot to the very
reasonable overall price my two biggest
complaints the speakers fired downward
causing the audio to get kind of lost
and the power button is on the side
which means you guessed it whenever I
try to flip it in tablet mode I'd
accidentally hit the power button and
put the whole system to sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
