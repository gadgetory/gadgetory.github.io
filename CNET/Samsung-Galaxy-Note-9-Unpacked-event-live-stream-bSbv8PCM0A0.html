coverage of Samsung unpacked event today
we're expecting the note 9 and maybe
some other things on my as act are
alongside pretty carry and Jeff Bakalar
will be talking about all the rumors on
the note 9 before we head on over to
Samsung's live stream you guys have any
questions or comments about what's
coming up from Samsung let us know tweet
us with the hashtag seen that live
alright guys there have been tons and
tons of reports that have poured out
everywhere about the Galaxy Note 9 which
it can kind of break it down as to what
we think we know at this point I can do
that but it feels like yeah there is so
much it was it's just know I'm wondering
what will be surprised about about this
phone because we have colors already
leaked with images you got a phone that
with all the leaked images looks pretty
much the same as the know date but you
have blue with a yellow stylus mmm and
you have a copper color and a black
color and also this stylus has a button
on it
that if you look at documents filed but
with the FCC this button has bluetooth
so we're talking about a stylus that
maybe can be a Bluetooth controller for
something if it's got bluetooth you know
why would you need the button maybe
you'll control things like taking a
photo or changing music I don't know and
then you also have fortnight fortnight
everyone's talking about that as being
something that's tied in I'm sorry for
fortnight there's a game from the youth
of America I've heard there's this
battle royale game or something yes it's
called player unknowns battlegrounds
yeah there was a rumor that fortnight
will launch with the notes or some kind
of because that's gonna be coming out
soon for Android and that's gonna be
working through Epic Games his own thing
that's a whole separate aside as how's
that games gonna be distributed which is
but the what the buzz is that this is
gonna be something if you preorder you
can come with it and some special
package maybe you can it like in-game
money to spend this is is it enough to
make you go oh I need it right now
before tonight fan I'm gonna switch my
phone you know and that'd be interesting
yeah yeah that would be interesting if
someone was like this games only on that
phone I'm gonna switch my phone because
of a video game
I've been amazing COO like that's it
it's for Android this one and don't try
to sign though to anywhere else it'll
know yeah any of these rumors get you
excited Jeff because they're talking
about the note I could hold up my note
eight and people would go oh that's that
nine right now just this is the eighth
just from all the rumors there
apparently looked almost exactly the
same
well the fingerprint scanner supposed to
be a little different shift it yeah
slightly over from the rumors that's a
big deal form factors a big deal right
didn't people hate the placement of the
one on the eight yeah the thing is
though you learn how to do that after a
while and if and when you want to move
back it seems like that'd be weird
wouldn't it you know what's weird
not having any fingerprint scanner and
having to pay with your face doing this
hold on a second don't condone this I
have to figure out my face speaking
though since I brought that up with the
whole new form factor of oh my gosh I'm
already bringing up Apple and a Samsung
event I'm sorry I'm sorry but minus 200
points I'm sorry but we're talking about
the reason I bring it up is because of
price there's a lot of rumors that this
note 9 is gonna be really expensive
maybe hitting that thousand dollar mark
because you know the iPhone 10 hit that
mark as a consumer obviously it didn't
really dissuade people from jumping on
the iPhone 10 because it looks so
different there's so much that there's a
face scanner you lost the button I'm
wondering if they hit that price as the
rumor suggests with this next note 9 if
you're if you don't have a big whiz-bang
difference you know does it matter to
pay more and that that's my big question
I mean I think for most people they've
kind of made they've kind of chosen
loyalty at this point I don't think
until we see something that's radically
different I don't think people really
kind of jump ship one way or the other
notch or no notch fortnight or no
fortnight so to me you know I don't use
the note I use the pixel and I think
that for maybe this is more of a litmus
test for people within the Android kind
of ecosystem if they would like go from
another Android brand to and to Samsung
for me what we know now which we know
every last thing there is to know about
the
phone this this event is pointless you
know for me it's a it's almost like I
said a carbon copy of the eight so I
don't really think there's much kind of
wiggle room for people who are like oh I
need to you know jump ship for my
current Android device so I think that's
where it's gonna shake out the craziest
thing is we've seen leaks from all kinds
of different sources but also including
Samsung itself they posted a video
teaser video first and then like we
looked to be a full commercial and it
looks like there's gonna be the capacity
to hold a terabyte of storage there's a
okay 512 gigabyte version and it
actually if you pause on the video on
YouTube it actually says it on the
bottom if you buy the 512 12 gigabyte
model you can expand it to a terabyte so
that would be a big deal a lot of want
more storage I guess but I feel like
there are very few indications that
storage on a phone is important in our
ever increasing streaming landscape like
I just don't know what the hell I would
do with a terabyte on a phone like I
have I think I have 128 gigs on my pixel
and I've used like 30 of it because I
scream everything I've Spotify even like
even Google podcasts the new their new
podcasts that they don't download
podcasts they assume you're just gonna
stream everything you have to like dig
if I like find a buried setting where it
says like you want to download this are
you ever offline what do you do with the
phone is offline
exactly so yeah terabyte of storage
great doesn't really do anything for
anyone in the world in the current
Dreaming landscape so this spen rumored
like you were talking before bluetooth
is that it's a remote control no we're
at this point because we were filed
something with the FCC it's kind of like
yeah I'm pretty much expect that yes you
could do that preemptively though it
doesn't always mean it's gonna yeah but
but right you talked about the button so
if it does have bluetooth right could it
be remote control for something could
could that be an extra I mean that's a
little dude ah really simple I mean you
could do that right now with Bluetooth
headphones when you can use it as a
shutter button on your Android phones or
iPhones the cool look that's do you
really need up to be able to remove this
and go okay let's put this dirty feet
away and then go I guess they're
grasping at straws I don't know
stuff is why people kind of look for
when they're upgrading phones and that's
a photo feature do us but you use your
stylus Ilana I do because I had a pixel
three not three guys who had the three
I'm in the future pixel two for sure and
I was writing notes of mind mapping on
cocktail napkins and looked at my phone
like why don't I just get something that
can write on right that's just the way
my mind works I I like what writing this
all over the screen constantly okay cool
I didn't because I I feel like I never
see a lot of people doing that you're
like the only one I see do that no it's
fine that's great
just the way I remember stuff so far
sure everything nice to have that but I
don't really see a lot of people have
this in the wild though when I see
another note users like it's like when I
spot a blackberry user is like holy
mackerel
dude what do you do do you give like a
real subtle nod then you guys both know
what's up Billy yeah we're in this
stylist buddies yeah yeah that's right
that's cool you know so let's talk a
little bit about the amount of leaks we
talked about Samsung doing their own
video you guys hit that photo of one of
the executives holding what appears to
be a note 9 and they claimed hey look
this wasn't a public event so we're not
commenting whether or not it's the note
9 it's like yeah all the leaks it seems
like there's a secrecy yeah are they
really like trying is this like
purposeful leaks I feel like has he I
mean if you really I don't know you know
arguably like like I really think some
of this stuff is done impervious ly it
could be at this point because every
time a new phone comes out from any
company stocks take a dive because like
oh it's not as exciting as we thought
would be at this point we seem to know
everything about this phone and it looks
like the future really where this is
going with s 10 will be coming out next
year possible flexible phone so maybe
that's why they're like let's just calm
down
this year's kind of dull next year's all
our cool stuff so let's just get it out
as much as we can I don't know is next
you're really the bendable flexible
phone because I felt like I've said that
that phrase for the past three years
next year next year is the hub spin
today it's gonna happen you could say
this is the year the flexible phone and
one one day timeline they have confirm
that they're working on it from what but
we and we have different kind of patents
we've seen on like how
could fold and what it will be bendable
or just of lying down the middle and
flat but yeah maybe that's the time
people will drop a lot more money to be
different I mean there's a there's a lot
of buzz about what people are excited
about phones anymore they all look the
same
what can you do to be exciting anymore
and accept completely change everything
Toph it's been like that for years I
mean Apple reduce themselves to making
talking poop emojis so like you have to
you know you really have to scrape the
bottom of the barrel to I mean that's
what they did like they've led off their
last press conference with like talking
crap and everyone's like oh my god this
is the future I have no way to segue out
of that so so we have sharra tip can
live from bartha's right now she's at
the event sharukh get a better look at
what's going on what's the atmosphere
right now yeah it's a Barclays Center so
it's very crowded there just started
being some clapping I'm not really sure
what's going on we're gonna be starting
in about 20 minutes or so I don't know
if you guys can kind of see what it's
like in here very blue and a little
yellow to color obviously the lighting
wonderful you know there's kind of this
like big stage area and down there we're
not really sure what's gonna happen I'm
assuming this is also kind of a big
screen back there you know Samsung
really likes to kind of make a more
immersive stage experience so we'll have
to see what they actually do but yeah
this is what it looks like doesn't that
venue hold like 13,000 people how many
people are there um I uh I have no idea
I can tell you it's not full and they're
also not using the full arena so it's
you know it's all kind of pressed down
here you know other CNET people sitting
over there we've got some desks I'm not
sure I'm a bad estimator on numbers of
people so I can't really tell you
Samsung usually has several thousand
people at their events you know I think
Apple their developer conference they've
been having around 6000
you know I'm assuming that you know
there's there's several thousand people
who are at this you know and it's not
just press its partners it's you know
various people that Samsung invited as
well so assuming all the leaks we've
covered this note nine for what seems to
be an eternity if all the leaks are true
how do you think that note nine would
have actually fare in the market it's
gonna be really interesting to see what
happens you know when the s8 came out
last year noting came out last year they
they kind of played it a little safer
with the note eight but the SA have some
really great changes and I think that
phone sold really well so then this year
when they came out with the s9 earlier
this year it ended up not doing very
well because it basically costs the same
price or if you got it from carriers it
cost a little more but they didn't
really make any huge noticeable changes
like the cameras were better there were
some tweaks but it wasn't kind of like a
huge overhaul like what we saw with the
sa in or what we saw the iPhone 10 I
think based on the rumors we're gonna
kind of see the same thing where they
add some nice new features but it's not
going to be any huge leaps forward this
isn't going to be that foldable phone
that we've been waiting for for you know
years I guess you know it kind of it
kind of sounds like the really exciting
stuff from Samsung is what we can see
next year but you know note users are
very loyal they love those devices I
think you know based on some of the
rumors if you have like a note 5 you
know people people would probably find
this new device really great if you have
a note 8 you're probably not gonna be
buying the note 9 it definitely seems
like there's going to be some paralysis
by the the buyers of phones because
we've got an iPhone coming up they've
got a pixel coming up you possibly asked
10 coming up as early as January the
note 9 seems like this okay look we have
to upgrade it every year here's a new
one shut up yeah well Shara in your in
your recent piece you were writing at
how sorry they may say that for a little
bit it's fine
you were saying how the note line
usually is is the one that Samsung takes
the risks to have some sort of different
element to it
but why why not this year I'm wondering
what why the reason that you know we're
all talking about it looking kind of the
same you know I think it's funny like a
couple of the big things or like I guess
maybe three of the big things that
people are really looking for is 5g you
know this like foldable phone and then
yeah I mean I guess those are you know
two of their really big things the
problem is the tech for those isn't
really ready yet
you know like Qualcomm has 5g chips that
they've been working on but I don't
think they're really you know ready to
be you know mass rolled out in a device
also you know there aren't any networks
you could actually use that on you know
that would be something that we would
normally see in something like a notes
I'm also the under screen fingerprint
reader you know that's something that's
been being worked on and I think it's
just you know kind of the timing for
this launch I don't think it really
aligned with when some of that other
stuff was really ready to be rolled out
in big devices you know major mainstream
devices you know so I think you know I
don't think it was like Samsung made
this conscious decision to you know kind
of make a boring phone I think it was
more than what they had available is you
know what we're gonna see it's you know
and then next year could be some of this
other really cool stuff so everyone's
buzzing about this phone having a more
expensive price point like how can they
justify that if we don't have some
whiz-bang new feature you know yeah yeah
I mean that's a huge question that I
have to we you know when the knife 110
came out I was absolutely shocked at the
pricing I never thought it would be that
high but clearly it's selling well like
every every ever since that's gone on
sale that's been Apple's best selling
device and they've seen their the
average selling price of their phone go
up like $100 which is just crazy
at the same time Samsung the s9 costs
the same if you bought it from Samsung
as the same but if you bought it from
carriers
it's more expensive and I think that
that's something that has hurt sales of
that device when you look at it it's
okay I can I can pay you know more for
this this phone or I can by last year's
phone which is pretty great you know I
think that that's something Samsung is
really gonna have to think about is a
lot of our a lot of people are gonna opt
instead for the note eight and you know
we've already seen them lower note eight
pricing so online you could buy it I
think from them it's like 750 maybe
something around that so it's already a
couple hundred bucks cheaper Samsung
phones are also usually discounted
pretty often and pretty pretty early so
you know even if this phone even if the
note nine cost more right away holiday
time it can be discounted you know they
could do some sort of bundle stuff they
really like doing that where you know by
this you get this other thing you know
they'll do what they can to make it more
attractive but I do think pricing could
be something that can be really tough
sure there's been these reports that
Samsung has been considering taking the
note and the S line and actually merging
them we've got a question from Twitter
from checkmate saying do you think this
will be the last phone in the note line
what do you think about that I
personally think they should kill off
their plus phones so the like past nine
plus I see absolutely no purpose for
that phone honestly you know it's just
kind of launches at a different time
people love the stylus I do not think
they're gonna be getting rid of the
stylus one of the big rumors for this is
that the stylus is actually going to be
able to do more and you know that's
something that really sets them apart
from a lot of the other phone makers you
know even especially iPhones that
there's not a stylus that works with
these so you know I don't I don't think
they're gonna kill the note line I can
see the note and the Plus maybe merging
in some way you know it just kind of
depends like I think they like having
you know a major phone early in the year
and then another major phone later in
the year it kind of like helps them you
know get ready for holiday but then they
have something early you know who knows
I don't I can't see them killing the
notes like you know the note users when
the note seven
have battery issues and was recalled
there were so many note users who were
so upset they wanted to hold on to their
devices they they you know they loved
that phone those are such loyal loyal
loyal customers and a lot of the things
you get in the note you really can't get
in any other phone so I don't you know I
just don't see them killing it but you
know maybe that kind of plus device goes
away but then there's also you know talk
about that foldable phone so we'll have
to see how that actually fits in if if
that kind of takes over as their Note
high-end device or if it's you know kind
of just an in-between something else you
know you would you know five phone but
then also by this foldable other great
thanks a lot Sheriff enjoyed the show
thanks guys all right bye lots of stuff
there and and I let some blue as usual
from like every seems like a baby blue
in that little yellow line I thought
more symbolism very nice kind of like
our background here which invite showing
off that I'm gonna see from Twitter uh
you know not so much I'm seeing right
now but one thing I did want to point
out we didn't talk about was this
rumored wireless charging pad oh yeah
you know this is something that was
leaked the the box for it was leaked the
wireless charger duo if you look on the
details in the box it kind of says it
doesn't just wirelessly charge the two
phones but it could also charge a galaxy
watch actually says that on the box yeah
actually says on the box so you know
more talk obviously besides the phone
today it could be you know think what
this galaxy watch could be the renaming
is it a new end a whole new model you
know that's the kind of thing that i i'm
curious about su and it's funny to see a
charging mat that could come out before
apple's charging mat which they've been
talking about we haven't seen yet well
everybody's gonna say you guys copied
apple the wireless door isn't happening
that's been around of course but i'm
talking about like the fact that there
actually is maybe a mat coming out you
know after Apple teased it but still
hasn't released it yet right right right
I'm seeing something here on Twitter
from user at geek man Greg yes they'd
like to know our opinions on how fragile
the phone might be because that's a
decent concern I mean have you have you
had a problem with fragility and you're
not and you're eight fragility it's a
great word what's but that was a very
very unusual occurrence well you you
keep it naked right now just take it off
take it out of its case right got it
only I have a case that has a little
thing I can hold it with okay because I
do find this difficult to hold it yeah
it's large it's very large it's shiny
and it's a it just kind of easily
dropped long yeah so and to get it in
one hand is kind of a pain sure but
that's not why I have this phone
essentially like I've replaced my tablet
with this as well but I can I'm drop
this a good couple of times with a very
thin case and it survived quite well I
think use Gorilla Glass 5 just coming
out later I don't know if the note 9
will have 6 or if the 6 will come next
year that's supposed to withstand drops
like much better than this there's also
there's rumor that the note 9 was
delayed because one of the execs wanted
to remove like half a millimeter of the
glass that we're not a lot which makes
it less strong so I hate when they do
that like well we have a new Gorilla
Glass we made it thinner so there's no
difference well Greg and his tweet is
saying that notes have been considered
among the easiest to break I don't know
is that a true statement
I found that true with the I think the
s7 and s1 you have this infinity display
hitting the corner could cause a lot of
issues because you have the glass
everywhere sure but I haven't really
found that to be a much of an issue with
the note but I'm also extremely cautious
with it because I know it's fragile
right and that's one of the reasons why
Samsung showed off
they had this flexible OLED that they
showed in a video and they were hitting
with a hammer
constantly and it will stay at no damage
whatsoever instead of using glass
they've moved to plastic so maybe in the
future we'll have that but I don't know
how fragile this one would be I'm
thinking next year like again that's
what we'll see all these movements in
two different materials and different
looks but right now in this like
holding period you know yeah why not
have a couple different versions I'd be
down with that like your high-end model
with the glass and then for those of you
with the kids you know a little like
more tougher version you have the active
line yeah that's right that's wine and
those things that would stand withstood
a lot of abuse I've seen it at the
office I've seen flying s8 and s8
actives that is and they survive just
fine about 15 feet well into a wall okay
I don't know how that's a real world
kind of like situation to work sometimes
Stefan goes flying I've seen it I don't
have the age I can recommend the s8
active though very much though I I think
going back to the talk about merging the
two product lines I think at some point
something some sort of consolidation has
to happen because you have you're
starting to see a problem with other
brands that have too many SKUs out there
it helps create sort of customer
confusion and you're right like there
are a couple phones that Samsung makes
where like I can't tell the difference
it's a plus and it's just like no let's
streamline this down a little bit I
can't imagine it being you know
effective for them to do that where
they're essentially selling less phones
and having to make more and make you
know that many different kind of models
like I'm not an economics major but at
some point it seems like that would cost
too much than what it's worth but the
old Samsung basically was throwing
spaghetti at a wall remember that every
form factor possible every size possible
when they come up with the original note
everyone's like a new belt every week
this is ridiculous he's not going to use
a stylus this is why would you want this
this phone is huge
mm-hmm there was like wait a second we
want bigger screens and this started to
trend so I'm thinking you're right
they're gonna consolidate and they did
after a while because like these things
are working and as these bezels get
smaller and this infinity display thing
is working and possible future
iterations of the phone have like
cutouts there's a perfect phone in there
somewhere you're getting there yeah and
so between the S line being for everyone
and the note being for like hardcore
almost like the pro if they wanted to
rebrand it like this or just gives the
stylus to the plus and just call it the
same thing sure
because I've held a plus in my head and
this thing there essentially I think
there's a point zero one inch different
stats okay yeah the curves are different
though it's totally different it's like
the radius on the corner sorry I don't
get it like why are you making so many
different folks that are essentially the
same I don't know I think just to keep
it keep the buzz going throughout the
year and once that the es10 comes out it
has to have a new design next year
because we've seen the same design of
this 8s 9 the note 7 and note 8 almost
identical - one big issue and then the
note and I will probably be the student
that's the only been the real biggest
things I'm one of them explodes and
that's it everything else has kind of
been the same yeah I guess that was
thing no eight was damage control
honestly yeah and I said look we have a
phone that's safe and let's take the
phone that doesn't explode yeah and yeah
that's why I guess maybe it's for the
note 5 users that knows 9 they're like
ok we're not I'm not jumping on board
with this just yet
right well speaking of things that are
the same in different watch okay Oh what
yeah so some of this has been leaked by
you know Samsung itself it seems by
having something on its page temporarily
on the Samsung US website it was pulled
down there was a list e for a galaxy
watch although you know the look of it
you know was quickly taken down don't
know if it how exactly to look but it
was it's interesting to see that we're
gonna have a watch it I you know it by
every you know clue here and once again
did they accidentally put it on the
website you know like or you know I
don't know they're gonna work on their
security then and then what would it
need to be different to be exciting in
the SmartWatch world right now
I don't think smartwatches are exciting
ever but for those of you wanting galaxy
watch sound like is already a thing it's
not a thing
they call their stuff in gear right
we're galaxy gear s2 whatever yeah and
we thought it if you're if you're onto
the gear name it would be gear for by
now right
you know and now it's like okay good I'm
actually glad to get rid of these number
names cuz they're getting ridiculous you
know like if I just call it galaxy I
have not found a single killer
application for a SmartWatch other than
when I'm on the subway and I get a
notification and I wonder I don't want
to reach for my phone and that's
literally me doing this
that I mean that's why I have a cheap
SmartWatch called the amaze fit dip and
it does what I needed to do I just want
to know who's calling text messaging and
stuff like that it's got an always-on
display which I don't think this is
gonna have yeah so until they you know
do something like that or the battery
will last two to three weeks which is
what I get on this thing I don't care
so the stylist needs to be like a snap
bracelet with a display and that's what
it needs yeah button we need to do this
I need the stylus on me all the time I
can see who's calling me right here on a
flexible OLED to that I would have that
okay make it happen
first ones free I'm gonna break this
stylus it one day or my wrist but yeah I
think that's the way to go because
otherwise it doesn't add anything people
do like the give me especially if you're
into fitness it adds that to your I'm
not I'm not running so I'm not finding
the the draw for any SmartWatch in that
case yeah but with Samsung they've been
using their own operating system Tizen
yeah seems to work better than where OS
has in the past we also have a really
cool navigation with the apple bezel
turning around so you try to find ways
to make the interesting can it be
something that everybody wants I don't
know with that we should throw it to
Samsung because they're about to start
we're gonna have a post show right after
this so guys if you get any questions
use the hashtag seen it live and we'll
get back to you so let's throw to
Samsung into Barclays Center
and Samsung is making headlines with the
new Samsung Galaxy Note bottom line
you're gonna look really dumb holding
this up to your face I need to show you
my new phone new phone that is
ridiculous
Samsung has no idea what they are doing
this is like talking to a piece of toast
people are actually calling this thing a
phablet skip over the Samsung Galaxy
Note completely
big phones are a big deal big phones
have become the standard the s-pen alone
seals the deal
sound of winning all of these on the
phones gotta fall back the Galaxy Note
is the best phone out right now who's
laughing

Samsung Mobile in 2016
I've talked about our vision for a
future of a seamlessly connected devices
and a world of endless possibilities I
will share my commitment to meaningful
innovation that delivers value
convenient and joy to our customers and
spoken over my belief that it will take
open systems and open partnerships to
unleash the power of technology so that
you can reimagine how you connect create
work play and live I said then that no
company is in a better position to
achieve this vision then Samsung and I
say now with confidence that this is
even more true today than it was then so
much has changed since I took the stage
two and a half years ago artificial
intelligence the Internet of Things
augmented reality these were
extraordinary concept in 2016 now they
are the building blocks for a new year
of continuous personalized and
intelligent digital experiences that
will reflect who we are anticipate what
we need and deliver what do you want
with no limits no barriers and no
interruptions
but that's not the world we live in
right now while our lives flow
seamlessly across the home work and play
our technology doesn't we still live in
a world of digital devices and disrupted
experiences there are too many gaps too
many blind spots too many services are
confined by the limits of a device brand
or prefer too many experiences are
interrupted when we leave a room or go
from office to car or switch between
devices too often our devices fail when
we need them the most as Samsung we
believe is time to transcend narrow
digital experiences that have never
reflected how we live our lives it's
time for a new generation of experiences
that are intelligent enough to
anticipate your needs
opening up to give you full control of

gentlemen it is my great pleasure to
present the all-new galaxy note 9
thank you now but to tell you more about
the world's most advanced smartphone
freezer welcome through Blackheart
thanks DJ I'm so excited to be here at
Barclays Center to introduce the galaxy
note 9 Galaxy Note has always been a
smart phone for people who want the best
of the best and this year we've updated
it for a new generation generation of
creators achievers and entrepreneurs who
are remaking the world and relying on
technology to do it
recently we spoke with note users all
over the world about what they want for
their phones and one thing became
crystal clear note users expect more and
it's Samsung we've always tried not just
to meet expectations but to exceed them
now we already use our phones for so
much but what if they are even more
powerful
what if our batteries actually lasted
all day and we didn't have to worry
about how much storage yeah what if we
could stream and download the things we
want when we want them what if our
phones met our highest expectations and
study it forcing us to work around their
shortcomings since the beginning the
note series has always been at the
cutting edge of new technology and today
we're redefining expectations all over
again with the most powerful phone we've
ever made the Galaxy Note 9
you know back when we launched the first
note a 5.3 inch display sounded huge
today it actually sounds small but it
paved the way for the big screen
smartphone category and note users were
the first to see the incredible
potential of a large screen for people
who pack a ton into every moment note
lets you do more that's why we made the
screen six point four inches the largest
ever on a note and of course note nine
features an end-to-end display which
means you get a larger canvas for
writing with your S Pen or watching
YouTube video in fact YouTube recently
named the note 9 a signature device
because it delivers a best-in-class
YouTube experience we've refined the
design with a beautiful balanced razor
straight lines elegant curves using a
specialized diamond cutting technique to
give the frame a clean modern look on
the back of the device we centered the
fingerprint scanner below the camera so
it's easier to reach and now all of
these features blend seamlessly into the
design of the phone when it comes to
color this year we went big and bold you
can choose from four cool new colors
ocean blue with a yellow s pin which is
my favorite lavender purple metallic
copper and midnight black each designed
to reflect the for looking style that
note users are looking for we also added
a flash of color to want to note users
favorite features and one that I use all
the time
screen off memos now no matter what
color you choose one thing remains the
same note users rely on their phones to
explore their passions and to get things
done so with note 9 we didn't just
design a super powerful phone we
designed a phone that can keep up with
you now we all know the feeling of panic
when your phone gets below 5 percent
you're waiting for your ride watching
your battery drain away just praying
that the car comes before you're
stranded well you shouldn't
to plan your day around your phone's
battery life that's why we created an
all-day battery the largest ever on a
note no more worrying that your GPS will
die right when you need it most
no more begging co-workers to borrow a
charger instead you can power through
your entire day with just the phone in
your pocket
great fact is we need our phones to last
all day and we're storing more on them
than ever before so note 9 starts at a
minimum of 128 gigabytes that's twice as
much space before so you don't have to
pick and choose which photos videos and
apps you can live without with that
amount of storage you could download
close to 670 hours of movies and TV
shows that's enough to get you through
30 round-trip flights from New York to
Madrid and that's just to start with you
can also get a 512 gig person that's the
one that I want just like its
predecessors note 9 also comes with
expandable storage and get this soon
with Samsung's upcoming 512 gig microSD
card you'll be able to get as much as
one terabyte of memory one terabyte has
more than most laptops but what good's
all that storage if you're always
waiting for things to load we wanted to
make sure note users could maximize
performance even when running power
intensive apps so we gave note 9 a
cutting edge 10 nanometer processor and
it also supports superfast network
speeds up to a staggering 1 point 2
gigabits per second so you can stream
smoother and download faster but the
ultimate test of all this power and
speed is gaming to get a truly great
gaming experience on a smart phone you
need a device that packs a serious punch
but don't take it from me let's hear
from someone who created one of the most
popular games on the market today ladies
and gentlemen please welcome the
founder and CEO of Epic Games Tim
Sweeney
well thanks drew it's great to be back
at unpacked you know the last time I was
an unpacked stage was for the launch of
the Vulcan graphics API back in 2016
it's crazy to think how much has changed
it epic games since then and we've been
thrilled to be partners with the C at
Samsung for the entire time
for starters Epic Games launched our
most successful game yet fortnight so
today there are over a hundred twenty
five million people around the world
building bases gathering weapons and
getting ready for the next storm and the
judging by the tweets just about every
gamer wants to know the same thing when
is fortnight coming to Android so uh
about that we're going to be launching
the fortnight beta on Android this week
and players with Samsung Galaxy devices
are the first to be invited starting
right now
it's also gamers who play gal fortnight
on a note 9 or tab s4 will also get
access to a special skin galaxy yeah
what really excites us about this
partnership is that Samsung makes the
best performing Android devices in the
world and the note 9 represents a real
revolution for mobile gaming that brings
a console quality 100 player fortnight
experience to Android now Epic Games has
always been on the cutting edge of
mobile gaming and together with Samsung
we're ushering mobile gaming into a new
era of high-end games for gamers and we
can't wait to see how players around the
world to enjoy it thank you very much
it's so much Jim we are really excited
about this partnership when game worlds
are bigger Kombat is faster and a moment
of lag could mean the difference between
victory or defeat performance is crucial
with a super-fast processor amazing
graphics powerful battery and more
storage than ever note 9 delivers the
kind of performance that gamers need and
when it comes to games we know that
people want to be able to see and hear
every single detail so note 9 comes with
AKG tuned stereo speakers the loudest
ever on a note for serious gamers speed
is everything when your processor heats
up your gameplay slows down well note 9
comes with our industry-leading water
carbon cooling system and a smart
performance adjust your algorithm really
that just means that everything's going
to run smoothly even in the most intense
gaming sessions with note 9 whatever
you're doing your phone works for you
giving you the performance that you need
and nowhere is that more true than
weather though it's powerful intelligent
camera back in February we reimagined
what a camera could do with an
incredible duel app at your smartphone
camera because when it comes to
capturing a great photo there's almost
nothing more important than light just
like your eye
Nine's camera adapts to your environment
if you're out at night the aperture
widens to let in more light and if it's
a bright sunny day the aperture
contracts to let in less light so you
can get a great shot anytime anywhere
and thanks to its super speed dual pixel
image sensor note 9 comes with super
slo-mo which lets you make everyday
moments epic by slowing them down to a
fraction of a second so we started with
one of the most powerful smartphone
cameras in the world and now we're
building on that foundation with note
nines brand new intelligent camera now
we all know when it comes to taking
great pictures some things are always
going to be out of our control maybe
your friend blinked maybe you didn't see
the smudge on the lens until it was too
late
seriously there's nothing worse than
asking someone to take a photo of you
and your friends I'll need to get your
phone back and realize that the photo
looks terrible well now when Evernote 9s
camera detects a flaw like closed eyes
or image blur it'll automatically notify
you so you can take another shot before
the moments gone
note 9s camera also uses scene
recognition to identify different
subjects like flowers food and a variety
of landscapes and then based on the
scene it optimizes the color tones so
that every shot you take is Instagram
ready now no matter how powerful your
camera is one thing it can't do is take
a picture for you my wife and I love to
travel in fact we just got back from
Mexico City a couple weeks ago but there
we go no matter what we did and where we
went whenever we were taking a selfie
they all ended up looking pretty much
the same right we tried to squeeze in
get in the same shot but it was hard to
lose the scenery behind us but what if
you could take a better photo without
all that hassle here let me show you
what I'm talking about we're gonna take
unpacked group shot make my way over to
the camera
and you know this is just too cool of a
moment I don't think I want to take this
one alone I need to Matt you want to
join me
alright here we go let's get in here
alright one two three
I need my good side let's try this okay
one two three figure album cover alright
looking good let's see perfect yeah
there we go
well you might have noticed that I took
those photos without even touching the
phone I used this tell you all about
note nines powerful new s Finn please
welcome my good friend and tab s4 video
sensation John Wong
what's up New York City I am pumped to
be back and unpacked especially because
this time it's in my own backyard like
true I've taken a lot of selfies and it
would have been super handy to have that
s-pen since the very first note the
s-pen has been an essential tool for
power users who want to do more with
their smartphones and as you just saw
the new S Pen has some pretty cool new
functions that's because now it supports
Bluetooth Low Energy to turn it into the
ultimate remote control with some help
from our partners we've beefed up the S
Pen now you can use it to play and pause
YouTube videos so don't smudge the
screen with my greasy pizza hands to
capture snaps and snapchat and take your
selfie game to the next level or flip
through some slides in Microsoft
PowerPoint well working the room
speaking of work in the room you can
even use it to control something much
much bigger in fact I've been
controlling this presentation with my
s-pen I know pretty cool like check it
out I can go backwards I can go forward
all with a simple click of the s-pen
and that's not all
right now we're working with a handful
of partners soon we'll open up the SDK
to everyone so that you all can come up
with your own creative ways of using the
S Pen to charge yes fen just put it back
in your phone a full charge takes less
than a minute and lasts a whole
half-hour even better you don't have to
charge it to use all the other S Pen
features you already know and love
yes pen began as a simple way to jot
down notes and over the years we made it
better we increase the pressure
sensitivity we made the tip finer so
that it feels like a natural writing
tool and with these refinements note
users saw something else the potential
for the S Pen to be a creative tool a
new way to express themselves and create
amazing art this inspired us so to
nurture this creativity we developed a
digital community for s-pen artists to
come together and share their work
pen.up currently has over 4 million
subscribers artists are using the S Pen
to create new masterpieces every day in
fact we have an artist here today a
sensation from across the pond please
give a warm welcome to our special
guests mr. doodle

that's just the start let me show you
something really special it sounds great

thing alright thanks the S Pen is core
to the node experience you can use it to
navigate the device translate languages
and send live messages and now with
Bluetooth connectivity you can take
pictures lead presentations and control
your content all with the s-pen the
words are so many note users the s10 is
what makes a note a note of course yes
pen isn't the only way to get things
done with the note 9 which brings me to
my favorite thing Samsung decks these
days yeah
these days your phone is basically like
a supercomputer that fits in your pocket
so why not extend that computing power
to a bigger screen Samsung Dex is a PC
like experience powered entirely by your
Galaxy smartphone with Dex built into
the note 9 all the computing power I
need is in my pocket Dex is designed for
the work anywhere generation and now
it's simpler and more convenient than
ever because the only thing needs to
start Dex
is this that's right all you need is a
single HDMI adapter just like the one
you'd use to connect your phone to a TV
let me show you all I need to do the
connect is this
it's as simple as that
I just plug in my note 9 and I'm in
jacks
I already store my entire life on my
phone with Dex I can access it anywhere
with an external display to get work
done or just kick back and watch a video
here's a tab s4 video we released last
week that's a familiar face can't get
enough of this guy
now even while watching myself on the
big screen using Dex I can still use my
note 9 screen to do everything I
normally would for example I could send
a text message to some friends to browse
the web I can even use my s-pen take
notes on my performance nailed it
Thanks
with the news X multitasking is easier
than ever and remember it's all powered
by my note 9 and X doesn't just work
with your phone you can also use it with
the device we just saw the tab s4 to
turn it into a true Productivity machine
combined with the s-pen gives you an
even larger canvas for your notes or
your doodles speaking of which let's
check it in with mr. doodle to see how
it's going
hey mr. doodle hm
I switch Davis at the top I spoke with a
larger screen that's awesome and I
actually see that you're using it with
Dex how do you like that yeah it's
brilliant forgetting those smaller
details you know that's great mr. doodle
is using what we call the dual canvas
experience on Dex we created it with the
Adobe Photoshop sketch team now it's
easy to add the fine details as you can
draw on the tab s4 screen while seeing
the bigger picture on the big screen
how's it going there yeah just a few
more details and then it will be
finished awesome ok why don't we go on
stage and check it out listen
nice uh-huh Wow absolutely incredible
thanks so much let's hear it one more
time for mr. doodle
wasn't that amazing and everything you
just saw works on both the tab s4 and
the note 9 from the all-day battery to
the intelligent camera to the s-pen and
of course Dex our goal has always been
to help you work smarter and do what you
love that's why we created this super
powerful note 9 and now it's my pleasure
to introduce another device to the
Samsung ecosystem one that brings power
style and connectivity right to your
wrist our all-new Samsung Smart Watch
ladies and gentlemen please welcome a
senior director of marketing alina Vives
we heard you you want your SmartWatch to
be connected without always relying on
your phone or even your charger
well the Galaxy watch is here and it
gives you the freedom to break away and
still stay connected longer people love
that the galaxy watch looks like a real
watch with our signature circular bezel
and rotating design it's more than an
aesthetic it's an intuitive way to
control your watch you can choose
between two different sizes any number
of straps and over 60,000 watch faces
from the galaxy app store the galaxy
watch has a high-res AMOLED display with
an integrated touch function it has
military-grade durability and Corning
Gorilla DX plus glass for added strength
and scratch resistance and it's water
resistant which means it's swim ready
the Galaxy watch is designed so you want
to wear it all day and it's built so you
can it works perfectly with the new note
9 or you can use it by itself with
standalone LTE connectivity so you can
take off for a run without missing an
important call or text we're working
with carriers around the world so you
can stay connected no matter where you
go and now the Galaxy watch also has the
battery life to keep up we built
low-power architecture
next generation panel level package
technology into the processor created
specifically for smartwatches simply put
you can use the galaxy watch for several
days on a single charge
you can even charge it at the same time
as the note 9 with our new wireless
charger duo with the Galaxy watch you're
not tethered you're connected now one of
the most significant things our watch
connects you to is your health the
philosophy behind connected health is
that all the devices in your life should
work together to help make you the best
version of yourself that means three
things first managing stress it's
important to take a break from your busy
life whether those breaks are physical
or mental the Galaxy watch can monitor
your heart rate and establish a personal
baseline and when it senses a big change
like presenting it unpacked it can offer
you a breathing God to calm you down
second staying fit because sometimes we
want our heart rates to be high like
when we're at the gym the watch is
designed to make our workouts productive
and easy to track you can choose from 39
different exercises and it even detects
six of the most common exercises
automatically whether you're in a studio
or in your own living room you can make
the most out of your workout it's like
having a personal trainer that tracks
your progress right there on your wrist
the galaxy watch supports you while
you're working and working out third
getting good rest the watch keeps track
of your sleep patterns it can tell you
how long you were asleep and how much
quality rest you got with the galaxy
watch the note nine and the Samsung
health app all working together you get
a full picture of your health and the
power to monitor and manage it the
Galaxy watch is designed to be useful
it's smart and it helps you manage your
busy day every morning I check my watch
actually first coffee then I pull up the
weather report my schedule my to-do list
so I know what to expect and here's my
favorite part
with the new my day watch face the watch
things with my calendar so I can see
when I'm free or busy with just a glance
the galaxy watch helps you stay
connected to your work your life and
your health no matter where you are or
what you're doing being connected is
also the underlying theme of Bixby the
groundbreaking AI platform we built into
note 9 and to tell you more please
welcome
jisu Yee
thanks so much Alena
I'm third to veer from the very
beginning Bixby was designed with a
simple purpose to help you get things
done we are continuously refining Bixby
so now on note nine it is more
conversational or personal and useful so
when two people have a conversation we
build upon each other so now can big
city also can have a conversation with
you two so let me show you so this is
the newbie tsunami on screen so I need
concerts in Brooklyn over Labor Day
weekend oh it's live a demo
you shouldn't I need a concert in
Brooklyn over Labor Day weekend I found
these concerts in Brooklyn New York
during the Friday August 31st weekend
big city already knows that Labor Day
weekend begins August 31st so that he
shows some concert in that pure time
that's good let's try another date how
about the first weekend in October found
these concerts in Brooklyn New York
during the Friday October 5th weekend
mm-hmm thank you
so peacefully remember that we are
talking about concerts in Brooklyn that
means that I don't need to repeat myself
this is what I mean by more
conversational being conversation is
good but that's not enough when you talk
to your close friends they already know
who you are what you like because we
won't replace your best friend I hope
but it is designed to do similar things
for example I need good restaurants in
New York there are some restaurants in
New York New York
voila because we know that I like French
food so it listed a French restaurant at
the top let's check it out it looks
great yes wine and cheese and also some
Belgian food as well I want to make a
reservation so let me press the button
at the bottom should I make the
reservation as you can see the city has
already filled in the number of people
in my party and the reservation time
based on my previous bookings all I have
to do is a chapter reserve table button
the patient details sent to email that's
it this is what I mean by more personal
by the way I also want to know how to
get there so let's first navigate button
here so 23 minutes not too far from here
great so I can do that now some of you
might have noticed that even though I
look for concert tickets or a reserved
table I never actually said the words
ticking nest or Yelp in fact I haven't
installed those yes yet because it is
his brand new note 9 this it just worked
this is what I mean by more useful you
can give him a pause cut so we are
working with many partners to build a
seamless integration into victory this
means that user can access many of their
favorite services in a snap for our
partners they can reach out many more
potential users you may have also
noticed that these three walks with the
Google Maps that's right we are working
with Google to make sure Bixby works
well with the some of their key services
and of course if you say hey Google to
your note 9 Google assistant will be
there for you but this is unpacked event
so let me try one more example of how
Bixby works I need a ride to JFK
therefore this ride will be $49 11 cents
ready to request ride
you can't clap it with just six words
and a lube account I can order a car to
the airport I never have to open an app
explain myself or fill in the details
this is power of conversational personal
and useful be speed so all the
experiences you've seen here today are
only possible because of our amazing
partner thank you with their services
and our innovative air technologies we
are making better
bixby better than ever so far you've
seen what peace we can do on node 9 but
what if everything I just showed you
also brought inside of your home well
today for the first time we are
unveiling a brand-new product that
brings together
Pixley amazing sound and elegant design

these 160 Galaxy homes so when we
designed this speaker we set out to
deliver high quality sound

as well and with the Hartman's natural
sound processing you get a realistic
surround sound experience that feels
like you are right in the middle of the
live concert we've also integrated
Harman sounds tear technologies which it
detects your location and optimize sound
based on where you are in the room just
say hi Bigsby sounds deer and the music
is directed right at you as I mentioned
before the galaxy home had also has big
V and them smart things have built right
in so it gives you instant access to
their largest open ecosystem of smart
devices using only your voice so it is
as easy saying hi Bixby the galaxy home
also has a or gate microphones for
far-field
for circulation they'll pick up that
voice command from clear across room
this is just first look at this amazing
speaker we are excited to share more
details about it soon
so galaxy home is perfect example of how
is how we are expanding our ecosystem of
intelligent devices we are also
expanding services as you I showed you
earlier these expansions are only
possible with a scaleable AAI
problem which is fixed fee and we will
be sharing a lot more about our vision
and a detailed technology beyond it at
the Samsung developer compass I really
really hope to see you all there
thank you and now please welcome back to
the stage
drew blacker
thank you sue as you just heard seamless
connection is a key part of our vision
to integrate all of our devices into a
unified open ecosystem there are a lot
of smart devices in our lives these days
and we at Samsung have always believed
that all your devices whether you carry
them in your pocket wear them on your
wrist or install them in your home
should work together effortlessly to
bring you one continuous experience as
you heard from DJ at the beginning of
the show that's the promise of the
Samsung ecosystem and we work every day
to deliver on that promise how are we
making this all happen by infusing our
ecosystem in all the devices within it
with intelligence take the Galaxy home
for example as you just heard from GCU
it's a powerful speaker with bixby built
right in but even the best speaker isn't
worth much if you don't have access to
great music more than any other art form
music touches every moment of our lives
it's a huge part of my life I have a
playlist for my morning run my evening
commute and just about everything in
between
of course the days of listening to music
on just one device are long over today
half of all Millennials are listening to
music on as many as 3 different devices
and too often those devices they don't
work so well together that's why we're
dedicated to making make music available
wherever you are whatever you're doing
at home and on the go it's a big goal
and we knew we couldn't do it alone
so we started searching for a new music
partner to join us on this mission a
partner who's committed like us to
helping you access just about any song
you want to keep track of the artists
you love and to discover new music
tailored perfectly to your tastes we had
to make sure that they share our values
and are committed long-term to helping
people enjoy music in new ways
lucky for us and more importantly lucky
for you we found the
perfect fit we are so excited to
introduce our go to music partner for
our multi device ecosystem a meaningful
long-term commitment to help consumers
discover and enjoy music in ways that
have never before been possible ladies
and gentlemen please welcome CEO of
Spotify Daniel
all right thank you everyone it's really
great to be here at compact when we
created Spotify we had a simple goal it
was to make music accessible to everyone
while supporting the artists who created
it and since then we changed how the
industry works we made it easier than
ever for people to discover new music
and for artists to find and connect
directly with their fans while also
getting compensated for their work we
examined how people use Spotify and we
know that listeners stream different
kinds of music at different times in
different places and most importantly on
different devices and we think music
should be easy to access on all of your
devices and we want it to be a seamless
to switch from one device to another
so the partnership we're announcing with
Samsung today is a true cross-platform
listening experience you know Samsung
makes devices for every aspects of our
lives it's really everything from
smartphones and TVs to tablet speakers
watches and even refrigerators and we
have designed Spotify to deliver
personalized music to consumers around
the world wherever they are and on as
many devices as possible it's a really
great fit and to show us how it all
works together let's let's bring back
through extension as we were just
talking about I'm always listening to
music on the way home from work it's
usually a Spotify playlist last week on
my Discover Weekly this song came on
it's good one
so I'm driving home when I get home
usually go into the living room watch
some TV so a prompt will come up
automatically when I get into the living
room and all I have to do is hit one
button push that right into the living
room TV sounds great didn't miss a beat
but when I get home from work usually
I'm pretty hungry maybe I want to go to
the kitchen cook up some dinner good
thing I've got a galaxy home in the
kitchen so all I have to do is hit play
on the galaxy home so the music follows
me wherever I go
it's one seamless interaction yeah thank
you drew so today
Spotify becomes part of the setup
experience on a Samsung device from the
very beginning so for example when sama
buys a phone the user can easily
discover the Spotify app on samsung
Smart Switch and soon Samsung Smart TV
users will be able to link their Spotify
and Samsung accounts through the smart
things app it's a really a new level of
integration that will allow Spotify to
be easily accessible and discoverable on
samsung devices but this isn't just for
phones Spotify is also on Samsung TVs
and launching on Galaxy home speakers
and soon you'll be able to control
Spotify through BIG's feet and will also
be integrated in Samsung music so this
will really allow listeners to receive
recommendations from Spotify discover
new playlists and create new musical
experiences and our partnership will
make discovering new music feel easier
than ever before
fans can quickly access music on Spotify
and then move their music seamlessly
between devices and as we move forward
with this partnership
we believe this out-of-the-box
experience will only become more
frictionless and in the future we
envision deeply integrated Spotify
experiences on samsung devices and we're
talking about hundreds of millions of
devices so at Spotify we're really
excited about what we're launching now
and what we'll be able to develop with
Samsung in the future thank you we're
very excited of course thank you thank
you thank you we this fortify Samsung
Galaxy users will now be able to enjoy
seamless music experiences across all
our devices we are super excited about
today's announcement is it just the
start of things to come as I said
earlier we love create the new note and
I want to express my heartfelt
appreciation to the Samsung team here in
the US and all the Samsung teams around
the world who helped make this great new
product possible thank you
the opportunity to make the world's most
advanced smartphone even more powerful
even more innovative I can't wait to see
how use it in ways we never imagined to
achieve more than we ever thought
possible so I'm excited to announce that
the Galaxy Note 9 will be available
beginning on August 24th but our
commitment goes beyond the most advanced
and powerful smartphone we believe the
future of connected devices and seamless
experiences begins here and begins now
from the speakers for your home to the
watch on your wrist to the music you
listen and the phone that powers your
life everything you've seen here today
is a step forward into an open and
connected world of experiences powerful
enough to keep up with you you is Paris
to push through barriers and make the
note better every year is not easy every
year frankly speaking
so let me end by saying thank you
there is a new one like you and there's
a nothing like the note thank you
welcome back to see Nets live coverage
of Samsung's unpacked event you can
applause now clap you can clap clap you
can clap for those of you just joining
us Sam is with me he's Bridgette and
Geoff hey that was something something
different something happen unexpected so
a quick recap what we saw the note 9 is
official and surprises anywhere
no no sort of yes what was the surprise
that that um home big speech oh yeah so
yeah look let's go to the would you took
all the pics box the bricks box the
Vic's box the we're gonna talk about the
Galaxy home which is their new smart
speaker which Samsung introduced today
and it's there's no pricing or
availability about it it's supposed to
have a partnership where Samsung has a
partnership with Spotify and what else
didn't knew about it well know more
about it and Samsung's developer
conference whenever that happens okay
you guys have a lot to say about the
speaker so have at it
I Brigid bridges gonna pull up my tweet
I just made speaker looks like a witch's
culture is what you're gonna get hope
you're gonna get your ass hope is pocus
a nice shout out to Morgan little for
his quick analysis showing with the home
if they're brewing like VIX me to be
better
I've also seen on Twitter people compare
it to be like like a grill Oh like the
egg like the big green egg because it's
a grill that's a girl yeah yeah yeah I
it's big it's it's a big it's a big mix
the best is uh I wish we could pull up
the still where like they actually show
what the thing is next to the guy yeah
and I'm thinking like oh it's just the
size of like a Google home or something
like that it's like I thought it was an
end table side because I couldn't tell
what's going on there's no sense of
scale for the longest time until you see
what appears to be like maybe like a
fifteen inch
like this laptop size thing that's kind
of an enormous device it's gonna take
off like to another planet and go
somewhere and the thing is it's powered
by bixby and there was a demo of that's
what I want to hear that's how you sell
me this thing works on pigs okay
we don't want it we're not trying to
11th place digital assistant I don't
even know what four through ten are
there's Cortana sure that also exists
look I don't want to hate on Samsung's
admissions to have a smart speaker or
smart assistant because competitions
always good sure but that being said
it's gotta work yeah yeah it's kind of
like the 6p in Syria or like neck and
neck for like useless so I just don't
think it is a you create a compelling
argument for your digital voice
assistant by showing me stuff I've seen
ten years ago I mean the dude just said
like woods for what's for dinner
and it's gonna do that week okay come on
like what like directions and something
my crazy is anyone else it's okay to
agree that that was underwhelming he's
like we're restaurants no he's an
applause but they were doing the whole
Bixby announcement there's planning this
these new contextual awareness things if
you have just joining us and you didn't
catch that entire amazing show from
Barclays the person giving that part of
the the presentation did tell the
audience directly it's okay you can
applause he stopped and it says clap he
commanded me he didn't again - you can
clap now that's the thing though like
you're saying Jeff there was nothing so
amazing there's like oh wait you can do
that it's not like the duplex moment
when you're seeing that in IO and
Google's got this robot that can call
people and so like um you know this is a
chance to impress like this is the first
impression that you can't get back and
well they tried by putting a hundred and
sixty of them in that was a stadium like
to be like okay that whole little
segment was was you know all the audio
came from a hundred and sixty devices
but they are quite thick and that's
exciting I think when I think you know
all playing in sync let's learn like a
room you know room sharing whatever
you can link 160 of pool yeah I mean
that's what I would do first thing I do
for my entire apartment floor is just my
ceiling talk to you hi
why not I need to bump my head a lot
more those things look enormous we'll
find out more about that in the future
we've got the Galaxy watch that was
rumored for a while and they did show a
rose gold version of it which is the
thing that we saw on the Samsung is
impressed with the look of it I mean I
want to see it in person for myself
because obviously looking at something
that is a you know a rendering is always
a little different than like on the
screen than in person but yeah I was
impressed with that says a couple
different exercise modes like six
exercises it can auto detects yeah and
and yeah the look of it look pretty
snazzy battery life sounds cool they
claimed several days now that's as
little as three I guess when you say
you're not doing much on it though I
imagine and this is all supposed to have
LTE connectivity which is interesting so
it could work on its own it didn't look
like it was running Android wear or
sorry wear OS it looked like something
different I couldn't tell if that was
where OS because the notifications was a
little different and then we're talking
about getting all these 60,000 watch
faces from the galaxy store but you can
get that on Android as well so it's kind
of a murky situation yeah it looks
really nice still though haven't found a
compelling reason to have a SmartWatch
well its carriers around the word with
30 carriers around the world so yeah I
mean I water-resistant for swimming
that's that's positive oh wait the thing
about smartwatches that they never they
always look a little too big and a
little awkward and I don't know I kind
of like the look I don't mind you know
big chunky watches I like a chunky watch
but well for the for the chicks out
there we we don't always you know I
don't have a very large wrist so I'm
yeah particularly when it comes to
watches as well I just wanted to do the
thing it's supposed to do and this thing
dies on me I'm very frustrated and
that's yeah watch this yes be a watch
and that's why I wear a watch you don't
want have to worry about another thing
to charge and then not have your watch
right speaking of charging they did
introduce officially the wireless
charger 2 duo
mmm-hmm which looks exactly like what
was leaked mm-hmm and it was there there
you go yeah okay
it's the thing it's I I'll care more
about wireless charging when we finally
enter that world where I can walk into
the Starbucks in any other place and
just slap my phone down anyway I'm
talking about that wireless technology
that works like Wi-Fi oh you're just
like in the zone just charging they're
all just kind of stick mulling around an
area not getting that right next like
long-range dangerous but I don't care it
just sounds like you know me then in
theory you would never need to charge
your device because you're always being
charged totally which is weird to say
out loud I'm not always being charged so
we've got off those get back to the note
9 we've got pricing on this device it's
starting at $1,000 yes
$1,000 the 128 gigabyte version and the
massive 512 gigabyte version is $17,000
[Laughter]
can you hear us we I think that's your
first look so there's two desiccated to
try out the note nine recently and she
got to test out how this device works it
did have these snazzy yellow stylus and
those you want to know the yellow stylus
is exclusive to the blue version you
have to buy the blue one and that one
has a contrasting styles so none of the
other style they'll match they all match
probably there is the purple color
the lavender excuse me and their ocean
blue those are the ones that were
showing off right now the new stylus is
rechargeable because it's got bluetooth
and it gets charged by that massive four
thousand milliamp hour battery and that
phone
so Samsung claims a one minute charge
gives you 30 minutes of writing I don't
know why you would write for 30 minutes
or usage actually and if the stylus is
dead and it has no charge you can still
do all the things you would normally do
with the stylus which is writing and
draw
that's pretty cool pretty cool so like
the remote functions would die in 30
minutes which is fine I'll live yeah and
for those I heard a comment earlier that
people are gonna lose their style I a
lot more you're gonna lose your S Pen
because you're walking away from it the
note does have an alarm so if you do go
further away from it it'll beep and tell
you hey you left your your pen so I have
that thanks for gone and I just I did
that at the office it was like get back
go to the copy room you know it does
regenerate - oh yes that's right how do
we forget about that the note 9
manufacturers s pens on the go it's it's
a gross process that didn't happen if
that happened we would have we were to
let off with this this auto-generated
printer built-in I was just thinking
that like just like look new pen will be
ready in two point eight days like
organic and gooey
after the cauldron well okay since your
brain one can put let's talk fortnight
obviously though that came out true so
what are the details here I think it's
not just for this this note obviously
because the note doesn't come out until
the 24th right yeah it actually has
nothing to do with it at the the events
they said or the CEO of Epic mentioned
that galaxy users can get it right now
and I think the exclusives for a few
days it's only a couple days and you can
get galaxy man though with yeah that's
the thing a special galaxy man type of
character is that does that intrigue you
Geoff because I don't play this game
honestly so I don't like it either I
don't I've played like maybe 20 matches
and I was like well this is 20 more than
me so like do people really get into the
skins
oh yeah the level of customization I
think is like important to people I
don't know if you know look like if
you're incentivized by a skin I mean
that's how like a lot of pre-orders work
with video games people pre-order stuff
from different retailers because they
exclusive you know kind of bonus stuff
it's a nice little add-on I don't think
there will be much more of it beyond
that think of it as like a bonus and
then maybe not the total Easter egg for
you I'm just wondering like is that is
that a pea cake and I'm show up
somewhere else apk for non nerds is an
Android package so like these apps can
be side loaded so once that that's yes
so it's gonna show up within the next
hour whether but whether or not like you
know it's somehow coded to not go online
if it doesn't you know handshake with
the device it's on I could see that
being a thing but someone will figure it
out yeah I think so cuz it's gonna be
like you just have to trick it no it's a
galaxy if it'll run on that at all yeah
but then it'll be out for everybody in a
couple of days anyway so this exclusive
is tiny and it starts today the
exclusive for galaxies I'm trying to see
if we have any data on the watch pricing
or anything like that right now because
I haven't I don't recall seeing that
during the other day they really did not
lay out where like how much these things
were gonna cost which was the watch and
availability I think what the wireless
charger yeah yeah that that was just
like we have it and go look it up later
I mean same thing with the you know with
the cauldron out of the home what is it
galaxy home galaxy home got some nice
legs got some real nice voice nice
little nubbins motors but yeah I mean
that's that was just sort of like a
product announcement let alone when in
and how much we got a tweet using the
hashtag seen that live mr. dodo Joe you
know what's s that you can't play for
tonight if your device is rooted even
though it's hidden so that's interesting
so say that again you can't play for
tonight if your device is rooted okay so
if you actually are somebody who's being
a little hackery with your phone you
won't be able to do that so I didn't I'm
right there did you try it out already
how do you know this high feel like
people have been I don't want to like a
hundred percent say that I know people
have been playing for tonight Android
but I'm pretty sure people have already
been playing it some have because it's
out there yeah it's out there that's out
there I want to believe it's out there
life finds a way yeah
sorry it's true when you go Jeff
Goldblum
I get lost there this is just Goldblum
out little phone I mean lots of talk
about the camera features having some AI
on it oh right that was the thing I ran
out of the room during this today this
it was like able to like detect you know
how you're taking a photo I guess and
adjust the lighting so oh the photos it
seems cool but the photo features didn't
make me run out of room it was totally
separate but yeah I think it's supposed
to be able to detect up to like 20
different scenes and if you can frame
the item it's like oh it's a person so
we're gonna change the white balance
exposure to other settings or like
that's some food over there it's
supposed to be able to change the
settings for you on the fly
as far as I know you can't turn that
feature like you can't tweak it do the
on or off and you can't just take a
photo and then say hey I want to see
what that photo looks like without the
feature it's like no so it's smart but
you might not want to use it we don't
know yeah well test it out once we get
it I mean I would like to see how we're
how smart it is yeah cuz otherwise then
I just want to turn it off and do it
myself I've got another tweet there said
they sent us an image of Jeb Bush where
he famously or infamously said to the
audience please clap now remember I
forgot about that was oh that was weird
there's no two ways about it but it was
kind of funny whatever mr. doodle was
there okay I got you excited mr. do I
have to stand like this when you
mentioned if you want to mr. doodle is a
really impressive like doodle artist and
I'm glad they were able to pay him
enough money for him to come over there
so that's cool so they had like he's the
thickest like mark are you kind of
saying what's fun about mr. doodle if
you don't know because mr. doodle is
very prolific artist he is like a big
marker on pen guy a marker on paper guy
and crane up to like just like a band
and that his trademark tool for that I
mean all I'm saying is way to cash in
mr. doodle some more intricate work with
a note because it's like suppose we
super-sensitive 4,096 points of pressure
or whatever else he's drawing like a
stickman and I'm like that's what he
does what a powerful
that's the way I'm gonna spend $1,200 so
I can draw stickman stickman no I love
mr. doodle there he is he's the best
there he goes he's got one outfit he's
actually he's drawing at one of the
prototype notes the cool thing about he
was like.he it's always stream it
appears to be stream of consciousness he
doesn't I mean I'm sure he has somewhat
of a plan but he just kind of like
hypnotically goes and goes and goes I
like mr. doodle I love the fact that the
most exciting things about this event
even though there's an amazingly
powerful phone at this screen the screen
the the you know the runway other reason
taken they always kind of go I was
impressed by yeah yeah we're looking at
it like a perfect angle for the effect
to work but I thought that was pretty
and also the people in attendance
apparently had light-up bracelets that
would change color when this modified
guy Spotify a guy came out heck what is
this first name I forget his first input
yes when he came out all the wristbands
turned green I don't know if you guys
saw that oh yeah and I saw the flashing
yellow and going back to blue whenever
the stylist came out on the screen so he
was like trying to get this whole effect
moving it's a heck of a show but because
of the amount of leaks of the note 9
it's exactly what we thought it would be
the only thing we've got confirmed as of
the pricing and that it's got more
colors I want to say yeah there's a
black of copper purple and blue so I
think I see I've seen other photos there
was a gray one I didn't see that during
this presentation it was straight
forward it's gonna get the job done and
it comes in a cool yellow color it was
straightforward and I kind of appreciate
that I mean I think he's got a little
wackadoodle I guess I was giggling a bit
when when that you know Bixby home or
Galaxy home came out but for the phone
at least they were really
straightforward about it I'm actually
excited about the watch if that thing is
any good mm-hmm I will be thrilled to
actually have a SmartWatch that works
for days if I can somehow get over the
idea of this is the usage oh I can see I
can see on the subway that's the thing I
gotta get over they didn't mention the
pricing if it's like $1.99 I think would
be good if they have a package deal or
something I mean neat what about you
Jeff are you gonna go pick up a or
preorder a home nope I'm not gonna
do that but I mostly because the whole
bixby thing you might sound really good
but I don't want to use that that
platform do we have room for this in our
New York apartment but I you know I just
don't I don't think I need that I think
like I like the fact that there are a
lot of smart speakers out there that
have like chromecast built in now so it
doesn't matter what you have you can you
can mesh them all together and have
multi room play and maybe this will have
that too if you notice when they were
trying to talk up bixby our buddy who
kept telling everyone to clap finish
saying like oh but don't worry you can
also use Google home on this we didn't
completely neuter this thing what's that
on this I don't know if the speaker will
have it I don't think we're gonna get a
choice I think that's one of the reasons
why people are shy away from the home
pod as well because you're stuck with
Siri I blow Apple music and you can't
choose it cynjohn that's insane and so
they all want to have their own on their
write stamps I'm smart enough not to try
to recreate Samsung milk at least they
partnered up with Spotify for that it
was gonna be their media streaming thing
the leg the leg of the home does look a
bit like another cool got a nice little
note bit on this that's it I think
that's gonna do it for us and I said if
he's got any parting words no I you know
I mean I I thought this was you know
obviously what we expected
I think Samsung has a lot of like
consolidation to do a lot of
housekeeping to do but for the most part
you know they delivered on what was
leaked and you can't really ask any more
than that I mean it'd be cool if they
like totally shocked everyone with the
last minute you know announcement but
that's really not how these things work
I think they put some pressure on Apple
to do better with their memory on the
phone because surely because when they
really started the beginning with a dig
at how we're deleting everything and we
don't if you just don't want cloud
services if you're just tired of all
those nagging things about you know my
memory they did a really good job with
with with bringing that
home and starting with with a bigger
memory so I really like that in fact you
could get to a terabyte yeah if you
needed to they are good at poking Apple
and I and I respect that I think like it
should there should be a little bit of
like this playful kind of competition
but but again like I think 128 gigs on
your phone is it's pretty good and like
I said earlier in this age of streaming
but you're right like the fact that the
option is there it's good to be able to
offer people that know I like shooting
at 4k as much as I can with my phone
because eventually I'll be looking back
at these videos and I'm like why a
record in 1080p they take up a lot of
space totally so if this camera this
phone is capable of shooting that way I
want to shoot it in 4k as high as I can
high res that is and I think that
storage would be very useful for that
especially we're gonna talk to cameras
such a big deal it's gonna be able to
record that way take giant images why
not have the storage there and yeah
you're not worried about did it back up
to the cloud did it back up it's it it's
right here right fine so plus you're
downloading fortnight on your phone I
don't know how big that apk is it's
gonna be pretty big lots and lots that's
anything more more apps yeah they have
larger apps all right that's gonna do
for us at Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
