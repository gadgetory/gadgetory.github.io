my hand this is the iPad and I've got to
tell you that it does feel pretty sturdy
it has a nice weight to it it's one and
a half pounds and it's half an inch
thick and when you look at it you might
think well it looks like a really big
iPod Touch and it does have a lot of
features very similar but what they've
done is actually rebuilt a lot of the
core apps specifically for this device
so if we look at something like mail and
you can see the layout of your emails
but you can actually view them here in
the right-hand column and you'll see
this in a lot of the other applications
you also find a redesign to iTunes Store
and what also makes this unique is the
store itself is laid out differently
it's really taken advantage of the
larger screen space so you have a really
a better user experience you also have
access to your photos there's kind of a
cool photo frame feature where your
docket and you press a button and it'll
actually turn into this kind of digital
photo frame they also have access to
movie content as well and all of your
applications now some of the unique
innovative features of this device is
the iBooks and the iBooks bookstore so
what this is this is a bookshelf and
much like iTunes you can get access to
books and instantly download them to the
device and then one of the main things
that I think that makes this unique is
sure it's not a Inc but this is a
full-color screen also you have the
touch capability to turn pages you can
even take it nice and slow if you want
to now a lot of the apps most of the
apps that are currently on the App Store
will work with the iPad they do have
this feature that's basically a doubler
that fills out the game to the screen I
can just click right here and it doubles
the pixels so you're still gonna get a
full screen experience there will be
apps that are customized specifically
for the iPad so you can wait and see
that when the actual device releases
another feature they're really pushing
is being able to use some of their
desktop apps from the iWork suite
directly on the device they have also
been redesigned just for multi-touch so
all you do is use your fingers so you
have an application that you're familiar
with like keynote which is a PowerPoint
application and this will allow you to
interact with your slideshow and use it
with your hands now the iPad what's the
price I'm gonna start at well there's
two flavors really there's a Wi-Fi
version and then Wi-Fi with 3G if you
want the entry-level Wi-Fi model that's
gonna start at $4.99 and go up to $6.99
then if you want a Wi-Fi and 3G version
that's going to start at 629 dollars and
go
the way up to 829 dollars for this 64
gig version now the iPad overall it is a
unique innovative device I don't feel
really super compelled to buy one at the
moment but I really think that will
change as more media content that you
can interact with that makes a unity
unique experience comes out but overall
there's your first look at the iPad I'm
