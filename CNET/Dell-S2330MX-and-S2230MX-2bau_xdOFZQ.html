hdmi cord fell hitting a thin led-based
monitor these days and believe you me i
throw my fair share of hdmi cords around
here usually at my producers head I mean
how else am I going to keep her in line
right I may only hit her about sixty
percent at a time anyway look the point
is she's usually fine oh hey Jamie oh
yeah I was just like practicing you know
send up there some shots and stuff yeah
yeah hey have I told you that you're the
best producer really you're the best
anyway i'm eric franklin and today we're
taking a first look at yet another thin
LED base monitor the dell s 2 330 MX +
del s 2 230 MX they're pretty much the
same monitor aside from the 1 inch
screen size difference the Dells are
typical led-based monitors with thin
profiles unlike most LED monitors though
they don't include hdmi ports but
luckily come with DVI to hdmi adapters
the foot stand is this narrow halo light
circle that doesn't do a good job of
keeping the monitor stable for herbal
support we get a 10 degree back till but
no other organ AMA options the osa
includes most options you normally see
in a dell OSD including several presets
and red green and blue color options
navigation through isn't as smooth as
usual with dell's thanks mostly to the
somewhat awkward button placement which
is on the bottom instead of the side
where it is a most el monitors we've not
had a chance yet to run it through its
full paces but upon initial viewing we
notice a definite green push and movies
which also carried over to its
performance in games the 22 inch version
is available for about two hundred and
twenty dollars with a 23 inch version
coming in at two hundred and fifty
dollars these prices are a lot cheaper
than most monitors of this style they'll
definitely say but not including hdmi
and while the performance isn't
world-beating it's nice to see a
mainstream vendor like Dell supporting
budget monitor markets with monitors of
this size check out my full review for
more details once again i'm eric
franklin and this has been
first look at the del s 2 3 30 m x and s
2 230 connection that was like the
perfect take I was really good I heard
about what you said well that's it about
what I regret nothing Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
