Google licious for everything inside the
world of Google we've been away for a
couple weeks but we're back so let's
jump into it now we know apple's iphone
7 released with pretty much everything
we expected but there's still one more
phone that we're waiting to see it's the
new Nexus phones and here's your first
peek of what it's believed to look like
thanks to a 3d render and collaboration
with steve hammer stopper and android
authority now this is the smaller 5 inch
version of the phone codenamed sailfish
HTC is the OEM that was tasked for the
design in partnership with Google but
this phone could be the first that
Google touts as their own after reports
of their efforts to be more like Apple
by tying the hardware and software more
closely together but don't call the
Nexus phone after a report from Android
Police claims the new google phones will
be called the pixel and the larger
screen phone will be the pixel XL it
won't be long until the official
announcement after android police
reports the next Google event will take
place on October the fort now it will be
a fully loaded event with the pixel and
the pixel XL but cost and availability
have not been pinned down yet but again
this could arguably be Google's biggest
announcement to date touting google's
phone as the android phone to get
instead of Android Beam on multiple
phones with many options it's really a
different narrative for them now well we
can also expect to see a new chromecast
that will support 4k content and will be
called either the chromecast plus or
chromecast ultra according to the report
we also expect to hear full details for
Google's air freshener well you know I
mean Google home which I'm genuinely
curious about after being an Amazon echo
owner and really I love that thing plus
the in-house design for Google's
daydream virtual reality headset which
reportedly might be called the daydream
view now like I said this event looks to
be jam-packed with Google goodies also
people that have decided to give
Google's Project 5 phone carrier a spin
I've also been using its Wi-Fi assistant
feature but it's now being rolled out to
all Nexus devices running lollipop 5.1
or higher now the Wi-Fi assistant lets
users automatically connect to public
Wi-Fi networks that Google has
determined are fast and secure and on
top of that google adds another layer of
security through a VPN so
to update the google connectivity
services app to get it and you can
enable the Wi-Fi assistant feature in
the app and no we didn't forget about
the note 7 but this story just keeps
getting worse and worse for samsung now
we know about the exploding no sevens
you know about the official recall but
unfortunately there's still plenty of
people that don't know about it for
example an exploding phone that set a
jeep on fire come on son or an exploding
phone that set a garage on fire come on
son and just recently a six-year-old boy
suffered burns to his hands and body
after the note 7 exploded while he was
watching videos come on son now this has
really gone from bad to really bad to
just straight horrible carriers haven't
received enough replacement units and
consumers that try to get them are left
without any answers the US Consumer
Product Safety Commission is urging
customers to power down there note 7 not
to charge it and stop using the device
entirely even the Federal Aviation
Administration is strongly advising
against using the note 7 on airplanes
and several airlines have told travelers
to power them down and stow them away
before their planes take off yes people
the Galaxy Note seven in 2016 has
officially become the hoverboard of 2015
you know what it's a damn shame now the
timing of this couldn't be any worse for
Sami they had all the momentum they had
the most technically impressive phone of
the year and its features and specs
destroy any other phone on the market
including the iphone 7 but yeah there's
a problem note sevens are still
legitimately exploding now Samsung plans
to identify safe notes Evans from the
original batch and you'll be able to
check your phones imei numbers through
an online database September 13th to see
if your phone is affected or not which
happens to be the same day all new
iPhones go on sale wah womp alright
that's going to do for this show you can
always email me at Google licious at
cnet com or tweet me at Brian Tom thanks
so much for watching we'll catch y'all
next time for some more of that google
it
