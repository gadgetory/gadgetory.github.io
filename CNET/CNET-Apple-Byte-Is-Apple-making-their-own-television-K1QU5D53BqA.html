welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get things started with new rumors
that apple will finally be bringing
their own branded television set to
consumers by the end of the year now
daily tech is reporting that a former
apple executive says apple plans to blow
Netflix and others away by bundling
Apple TV and iTunes inside physical TV
sets that would be manufactured by
someone like Samsung and rebranded as an
apple product the source said a fall
launch with the target but it could be
pushed to next year the question for all
of you is do you need or one in apple
branded TV if you already own an Apple
TV that does netflix and streams your
iTunes probably not plus a new feature
in iOS 5 will allow you to wirelessly
send content from your iPad to your TV
as well now patently Apple also just
showed off a patent application from the
Cupertino kids for a live widget system
that could display content on the fly
over programming you watch for example
we could vote for our favorite singer on
American Idol lovers revenge you and me
good or not or trivia and other
information could be displayed and
constantly changing while watching a
sports game
Oh ridiculous now the patent application
also proposes that an Apple TV box would
be used with traditional cable TV
providers to access stations and the
system could connect to services like
iTunes and YouTube now all this is
exciting but right now it's still rumors
and speculation with the new details and
patent applications point to something
real coming together now we want to know
what you guys think about this so send
us your emails to the Apple by to cnet
com and we'll throw them up next week
but the apple TV rumor is not to be
outdone by this report during the week
from Boy jeans report that claims from
their own sources that the iphone 5 will
be a major update after all they report
the next-gen iphone will support a new
radical case design maybe something like
this didja Times reports that a dual LED
flash is coming according to part
suppliers and boy genius also says Apple
may hold a special announcement in the
beginning or middle of August with
availability to follow in the last week
of August now we'll see about that but
it might conflict with the exclusive
Intel I've received for my own sources
that tell me a desktop refresh for the
next gen mac pro's and Mac minis will
happen on the last week of July or the
first week of August with my source of
leaning towards August now the new
desktop line will come pre-loaded with
mac OS 10 lion and feature thunderbolt
and Sandy Bridge processors these are
the same sources that were right on the
money with our imac launch dates though
I'm sticking with them but bottom line
do not buy these products and wait until
August all right let's take a break and
get to a couple of your emails are more
82 rights and with yo B yo what are the
odds the new macbook air will be black
in color now looks like slim to none at
least this time around after a black
macbook air rumor kind of set the
internet on fire according to MacRumors
our reader who claims to be an apple
employee told them that apple tried to
powdercoat the macbook airs in black as
a test run but it soaked up too many
body oils and jobs killed the idea
because come on it made the computer
look like crap so it looks like we won't
be seen them anytime soon but personally
I don't have a problem with body oil
oh yeah now this one comes from Welsh
dog hey skunk head next time you do
lunch with jobs ask them what the hell
they did to Final Cut Pro now you're not
alone here and the message boards and
forums have been anything but stellar
for the hardcore Final Cut crowd Apple's
latest releases changing directions with
FCPX people have described it as I movie
pro there's no multicam editing support
at the moment and users are even
complaining about incompatibility with
earlier Final Cut project files Apple's
told users they will be releasing
updates to some of these issues but why
even roll this out when they had to know
users would be unhappy with FCP X in its
current form they didn't have to do this
and we're thrown out the bad apple to
Apple for this one especially after
there was a lot of genuine excitement
for the product the current app store
review two and a half stars now Final
Cut Pro is 299 you can only download it
from the mac app store and motion 5 and
compressor for our 4999 as well in other
new products Apple rolled out quietly
this past week where new time capsules
increasing it soars to two terabytes and
3 terabyte options starting at 299 and a
new airport extreme with very little
difference from the previous version
that we can tell is available for 179
I'll write to the quick bites people if
you're curious how people are using the
iPad compared to other competitors on
the market right now a study by comscore
says in the US the iPad represents
ninety-seven percent of all tablet
traffic and eighty-nine percent across
all markets that means a lot now
t-mobile spokesperson told 9to5 mac that
the carrier potentially soon to be
merged with AT&amp;amp;T is home to over a
million iPhones even though they don't
even sell them here in the US now some
people are using unlocked phones while
others are trimming their sim cards by
hand to fit the micro sim card slot and
the summer season is here make sure you
guys get your bikini line waxed guys and
gals but the adventure house marketing
firm is promoting their I towel with
