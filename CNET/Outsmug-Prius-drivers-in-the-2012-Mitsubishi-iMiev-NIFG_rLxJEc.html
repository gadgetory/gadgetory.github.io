2012 Mitsubishi I - mie V Mitsubishi's
electric car let's take a look and check
the tech I - yeah my Eevee is based on a
car that Mitsubishi sells in Japan
originally it's a gas engine car with a
very small 660 CC gas engine in back now
it's been converted to electricity for
the mi - Evi version but it's part of
japan's classes they call it the kei car
class which means it's very small it's
really just designed for cities you can
see like these wheels they're only 15
inches and they're tiny they do have low
rolling resistance which will work well
for an electric car they'll get make it
get better range you also have four
doors - which in this case it's really
just intended for four people you put
too much weight and it's gonna put a lot
of stress on the electric motor
now as the I - mie V is rear-wheel drive
the electric motor is back under here we
can actually lift up this compartment
and lift up this panel here and take a
look at what they call the motor room
well we don't really see an electric
motor here the 49 kilowatt electric
motor is buried under these control
electronics buried further back in there
is the lithium-ion battery pack 16
kilowatt hours supposed to get you 63
miles according to the EPA estimates now
this is the port where you recharge the
I - mie V just pop open the hatch open
the plug port and plug in the adapter
that Mitsubishi provides for you and you
can leave it charging overnight on a 110
it'll take about twenty two and a half
hours to give this car a full charge
from a dead battery now you can also
recharge it off a 240 volt outlet
that'll only take seven and a half hours
so that's more like an overnight charge
right there
now in our version of the I - mi TV
we've got the three thousand dollar
premium package which includes this head
unit here
now this head unit is pretty standard
aftermarket stuff and you see this in
some other Mitsubishi cards but the
funny thing is this isn't really
tailored for an electric car for example
I've got the navigation system here if
the menu hit the points of interest and
there's my list of gas stations not very
useful for this car and there's no list
of electric charging stations either
which would be helpful the maps are
pretty good looking on this system
they're actually stored on a hard drive
which also means you get space for music
on the system as well and there's iPod
integration you also have phone
integration here and this navigation
system also shows traffic now this head
unit also has a CD player but you won't
see a slot anywhere along here you have
to push that button and we get this
great kind of thing where the whole
panel opens up and there's a slot back
here to get your range and things like
that
you've got to go to the instrument
cluster now this is a pretty cool
looking instrument cluster and you know
you've got a digital readout for the
speed right in the middle here you also
have just the one gauge which flips over
and shows you when you're using power
and when you're recharging but to see
your range and how many miles you've
driven and all that good trip
information this one little gauge over
here on the right now Mitsubishi put the
tweeters on the dashboard here both one
on the left one on the right facing back
into the cars cabin lot of cars will
have them on the a-pillars here facing
across which isn't a great placement for
creating a good sound field putting them
in front of the cabin is much better now
of course here we have our old friend
the shifter but a being electric car
doesn't go to any kind of transmission
and of course we can put it in reverse
neutral Drive then we have an eco mode
and then B mode to be of course engine
braking which will maximize the
regeneration
we'll try that out on the road later one
of the key things about this car the
different drive modes so right now I got
it Indy which is just standard Drive and
you get pretty good acceleration then if
you put it in the Eco mode
it really takes a lot of the edge off
that throttle and it's really hard to
get speed built up quickly that'll save
you a lot of juice in the battery and it
also instigates a lot more braking
regeneration too so as soon as I let off
it really starts to slow drastically and
the needle on the gauge here goes right
into the blue zone which indicates that
the recharging the battery now the other
mode the last mode we have here is the
be braking mode and that is best for if
you're going downhill that'll maximize
the regeneration from the brakes to the
battery and it actually doesn't be tuned
the throttle at all which is nice
especially if you're on hills or going
in hill situations but as soon as I lift
off it just immediately goes to maximum
recharge it's pulling as much
electricity as possible from the wheels
into the battery this car looks kind of
like a golf cart on the outside and it
drives kind of like a golf cart - it's
got the electric drivetrain so it's an
immediate it's a very linear
acceleration very quiet driving
experience but with the small tires and
the really city design car doesn't feel
particularly stable when you get the
high speeds on the freeway it really
feels a little scary especially if you
have wind and things like that they're
gonna pull it all over the place at
speeds below 40 miles per hour it's fine
so it'll work great and you know a city
or a suburban environment
with its range of 63 miles the 2012
Mitsubishi I - mi Evy is really only
good as a city car for the suburbs it
goes on sale later this year for a base
price of thirty one thousand one hundred
and twenty five dollars our car here is
optioned up to thirty four thousand two
hundred fifteen dollars and with a
federal tax credit of $7,500 various
state credits you can probably find
depending on where you live you can get
this car into the low 20s which is a
pretty good price for a modern electric
car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
