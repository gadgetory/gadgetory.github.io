and right now we have got our hands on
the brand new BlackBerry z30 now this
device hasn't actually shipped it but it
should be available for the holiday
season it's going to be shipping
probably in a few weeks in the UK and
the Middle East so what's really
interesting about the z30 is that it has
a very large 5 inch Super AMOLED at 720p
HD resolution screen here and that's a
very big screen for a blackberry right
now most Android devices support that or
have this kind of screen but blackberry
is now taking steps into that big screen
market what's really cool is the z30 has
a blackberry 10.2 the latest version of
the BlackBerry 10 OS and what's really
important on here is the BlackBerry hub
which has been retweet and enhance it's
now called the priority hub and so what
it does is it'll put your messages from
across all different social media
platforms or email your texts bbm all
that stuff and we'll kind of see what
you're looking at who you're talking to
and raise all your messages that are
more important up on the front so you
can see you know exactly who you want to
talk to you first and you don't have to
no waste time just you know looking at
spam and all that kind of stuff so right
now we're looking at this blackberry z30
which actually has this case here which
is an add-on accessory it's not gonna
actually ship with this so it looks a
little thicker but as you can see it's
it's relatively thin and it has such a
massive display and it's very responsive
very quick I believe it has a dual-core
s4 pro processor Snapdragon that's what
I'm thinking and
it's very responsive as most of the apps
you're looking for though unfortunately
BlackBerry 10 has been devoid of a lot
of major apps that you know people can
enjoy on Android or iOS but they're
trying to change that by bringing in
support for Android officially and some
of their apps to port over to the device
so there you have it folks we just took
a first look at the BlackBerry z30 now
this device does not have a price
officially announced yet but hopefully
it'll be around maybe 199 or 250
somewhere in there and it's going to be
shipping within the next few weeks in
the UK and the Middle East first and
hopefully it'll be brought over to other
additional markets like the US I'm Brian
