Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded more than 1.5 million visa
and mastercard credit and debit card
accounts may have had their information
stolen the third-party payments
processor to Visa and MasterCard a
company called global payments held a
press conference Monday to say the data
breach to its system has been contained
and it doesn't believe any fraudulent
charges have been made using those
stolen numbers and aside from the card
numbers the company reports no other
personal data like names addresses or
social security numbers have been
accessed the payment processor also
isn't given any details about how it
could have happened because it says the
investigation is ongoing visa has
dropped global payments but said it
would work with the company in the
future once the issues are resolved the
app HBO Go is now available on more
entertainment devices like the xbox 360
and Roku problem is not every cable
provider is allowing customers to use
the app HBO Go is a way for HBO
subscribers to watch shows and movies on
demand on different devices it's already
been on iPhones iPads and Android
devices and to access the app users have
to prove they pay for HBO through a
cable provider mobile devices aren't a
problem but comcast and time warner are
not allowing HBO subscribers to use the
app on the xbox 360 Roku or even a
samsung smart TV seems like Comcast and
Time Warner see viewing HBO on demand on
another home theater device is a threat
to its own on-demand offerings just when
he thought the angry birds game couldn't
possibly get any bigger now there's a
cartoon series on the way and a movie
the wildly popular game will become a
weekly animated series of shorts this
fall with 52 episodes each lasting about
three minutes and available on a variety
of devices the movie though won't be
ready for a couple of years you might
have heard about an app called girls
around me it used public Foursquare and
Facebook data to automatically pinpoint
the location of women on a map and these
women were not signed up for this app
service there was a public outcry over
privacy and last week 4 squared blocked
the app from using its location
data now the russian-made app says it's
being targeted on fairly as a scapegoat
for privacy issues does girls around me
have a valid point after all it was just
showing women who already publicly
published a location for anyone to see
but naturally people get weirded out
when information is used in a way they
didn't expect like an app that
encouraged people to find them and hit
on them just another lesson and being
careful about the information you share
online those are your headlines for
today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet.com and
you just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
