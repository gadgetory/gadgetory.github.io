welcome to google issues for all the
Google that we can pack inside of a show
we've talked about Google X and they're
out there projects and if you weren't
already impressed with our smart contact
lenses that can measure glucose levels
we'll try this the googs is designing
magnetic nanoparticles about one
thousandth of width of a red blood cell
to patrol the human body and look for
signs of cancer or other diseases now
the effort is led by Andrew Conrad the
head of the life sciences team at Google
X and the goal is to get an early heads
up on cancer and other diseases and
hopefully gain some insight for more
effective treatment as well it's more
than five years off and faces major
challenges technically there's privacy
issues with the data they can collect
because come on it's google they collect
everything but there's also regulatory
issues if the delivery method is by
swallowing a pill but this is just some
of the mind-blowing amazing stuff that
Google is working on right now now in
semi health related news as well google
recently released their google fit app
for android to track your fitness
activities like walking and running it's
compatible with smartphones and tablets
running android 4.0 and higher with it's
nifty material design looking charts and
graphs it also pulls info from a
third-party app so if you want to get
your fitness on you can check it out
right now alright lots of gadgets have
been announced recently including the
official unveiling of the motorola droid
turbo by verizon now i could go down the
list of specs but what makes this phone
special is its 48 hour battery life
based on usage time this is not just
being idle in your pocket that's 48
hours of usage and it's turbo charging
how about an additional eight hours of
juice in just 15 minutes now that's
something that no one is delivering in
smartphones right now also the surprise
of the week came from Amazon with their
$39 fire TV video streaming stick that
competes directly with the chromecast
and Roku stick it brings eight gigs of
storage and a dual-core processor for
faster and more fluid navigation
according to the Amazonians and for
thirty dollars you can upgrade the
remote to take advantage of their voice
search which is really one of the best
I've tried for a set-top box and Prime
members also had a limited time to get
one for just 19 bucks all right jumping
over the wearables AT&amp;amp;T recently
announced they will be one of the first
US carriers to sell LG's recently
announced g-watch are really the hottest
looking Android wear watch to date now
and I'm sorry moto 360 it will start
rolling out in the beginning of november
in select markets like France Italy and
Spain Asia and North America will get it
sometime after that and Android where's
latest update has begun rolling out for
select devices some of the new features
include offline music support that you
can store on your device and listen to
it via bluetooth headphones and speakers
gps support is now here as well as long
as the hardware supports it and at this
time it's really only Sony SmartWatch 3
that can be pre-ordered from verizon's
website and finally I'm sorry to bring a
bit of bad news if you're a twitter
addict and you own google glass so this
is for you and yeah that might be four
or five people well according to glass
support twitter is no longer developing
the app and it no longer shows up in the
my glass app hub so sure someone can
step in to fill the void but for now no
more tweets all right that's going to do
it for this week's show you can always
email us at google issues at cnet com or
tweet me directly at brian Tong thanks
so much for watching and we'll see you
all next time for some more of that
Google issues
