but at the same time I am very much
aware that it has problems it faces
challenges it is somewhat of a toxic
environment so what can Twitter do to
sort of just make it a little better
right so Twitter has been working for
the past couple years to provide all
these apologies and maiya culpas and say
we're gonna do better we're gonna do
better but it never really actually
changes Jack Dorsey very recently said
look what we're gonna do is we're going
to open up verifications they're gonna
open it up they say to just about
everybody so the idea is is that the
bots the trolls a lot of these other
folks that cause a lot of problems on
Twitter maybe they wouldn't be verified
and it's a little bit more of a buyer
beware you wouldn't you wouldn't have to
worry as much or maybe those folks would
fall back a little bit more into the
into the ether they wouldn't be as
persuasive or as powerful as they are
now if more people have verification but
don't they also face the problem of
people conflating that badge with some
sort of endorsement yeah right it's a
big so it's good that you mentioned that
so there's this guy Jason Kessler he was
he's a white supremacist and he was
behind the Charlottesville March last
year Twitter gave him a verification
badge right and people flipped out they
really didn't like it because they
thought that this was Twitter basically
endorsing a white supremacist and they
go and they say no that's not what we're
doing we're just confirming the fact
that Jason Jason Gesser like that piece
of is that piece of basically
right maybe it helps out with
accountability I mean that's got to be
some of the you know focus is to sort of
pin these things remove the anonymity to
some degree and have people be more
responsible for what the right yeah the
only problem is is that as I started
with Twitter has been trying to clear
out the toxic behavior the negativity
the scamming all this other nonsense on
its site for years is this something
that's really going to solve the problem
I don't know maybe the verification is
there there are people that are gonna
scam that and figure out ways to game
that too and then that little checkmark
that little badge price so why did it
take so long I mean I know like you said
they've been fighting this over and over
it seems like they can do no good every
time there's some sort of controversy
they have an immediate response and it
seems like they just dropped the ball
over and over again and I'm not saying
this is something that should have a
defined playbook but why is it only now
that they decided to do more widespread
verification okay so first of all they
had to come up with the idea yeah a lot
of these different social media
platforms they have like the check mark
it's not just Twitter it's Facebook its
Instagram and they're all basically like
for celebrities for your Kim
Kardashian's and your Donald Trump's and
everything to verify that but I a lot of
it is also like a cat-and-mouse game
where once you pivot to something else
once you switch this this policy or
whatever folks that are gonna troll
they're gonna figure out ways to troll
things or they're gonna create new
accounts I mean like at this point you
still don't need to like give your
driver's license to Twitter to open up
an account and I don't think you should
but that would be a way of verifying
your identity but look it makes sense
it's like what's the point of it being a
vanity right if you could make
verification a little bit broader and
make it so that people actually know who
they're talking to a little bit more
sure I mean then then let's let's top it
with the whole thing that like I'm just
burnishing my reputation with this
little checkmark yeah I mean we're
getting to a point where Twitter has
become the sort of it's like the
stenographer of life right and we're
sort of documenting every last thing why
not get to the point where everyone is
sort of identified as who they say they
are on Twitter if anything because it
has become the world sort of like press
release machine and why not be verified
on something like yeah it was for a time
it seemed as though Twitter might just
basically die and you know get crushed
by its own weight yeah and it wasn't
gonna solve those problems I think
Donald Trump has obviously reinvigorated
the platform and proven that Twitter is
gonna last a very long time because it's
too important as this marketplace of
ideas is this place where everybody goes
or a lot of people go just
express themselves and to express what's
going on in this very breaking news
fashion so the more the Twitter can do
something whether it's these
verification check marks or something
else to try to keep things going and
make it less crappy that could I hope
benefit everybody right all right
awfully Twitter on itself
