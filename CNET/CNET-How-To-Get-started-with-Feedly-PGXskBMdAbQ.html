you are probably looking for a new RSS
reader right about now in this how-to
I'm gonna show you how to get started
with one of the most popular google
reader alternatives out there feedly
first things first in order to access
feedly you'll need to head over to
feedly.com to pick up a browser
extension it's available on Chrome
Firefox and Safari and there are apps
available for Android and iOS next
simply login with your Google account
nice thing is if you're already a Google
reader user then feedly will
automatically sync all of your
subscriptions and worry not because when
Google Reader officially bites the dust
all of your subscriptions will remain
according with folks at feedly once
you're logged in I recommend first
expanding your browser window otherwise
feed Lee's navigation will stay hidden
in this little hover menu which can get
annoying if you like to quickly jump
between new sources like I do now to
start adding subscriptions from the
Explorer bar on the right you can search
for specific sites you want to subscribe
to or browse through feed Lee's curated
list of recommendations from the list
you can subscribe to sites individually
or to entire categories at once which is
really convenient there's also this
nifty starter kit for those who need it
to start reading you could use the today
tab which matches up some of the latest
posts across all of your subscriptions
but I prefer sifting through content by
category source by source
the thing about feedly is that it's a
lot more visual than Google Reader
almost like an online magazine and some
people may not like that if that's you
then you can easily change the layout to
your liking when you click a post it
expands inline share tools are here up
top and this bookmark is just like the
star in Google Reader you can also save
items to pocket or Instapaper
and for the power users out there who
love Google Reader shortcut keys feedly
has a set of its own just like in Google
Reader you can type a question mark to
bring up the list finally be sure to
check out feed Lee's different themes as
well as the big preference
scream if you're looking for a more
customized experience so that's feedly
for google reader users it might take a
little getting used to but hey it looks
great it's got a lot of features and
it'll get the job done
for more tips and tricks head over to
