welcome to the Apple buy for everything
inside the world of Apple plus my killer
Black Friday deals worth paying
attention to so let's get to it now a
new job posting by Apple reveals that
they're looking for engineers
experienced with 3d graphics virtual
reality and augmented reality and Apple
is specifically looking for developers
to help build high performance apps that
integrate with virtual reality systems
for prototyping and user testing
according to the job post now we can all
pretty much guess the new platform will
end up being a VR or Ivar Ivar get it
okay now now this isn't the first
mention of the big a dabbling with
virtual reality a patent was filed by
the big a about a year ago showcasing
their own head mounted display system
for viewing entertainment or playing
video games and even mentioned the idea
of a fingerprint or retina scan and
voiceprint analysis to identify users
now they were just awarded the patent
for the headset in September of this
year
and is there any coincidence with the
timing of everything maybe we've also
seen three DUI patents in the past for
iPhone and a few weeks ago we talked
about a report claiming that Apple was
developing their own glassless 3d tech
for the next upcoming iPhone VR still
has a long ways to go but there's
clearly momentum around it for multiple
companies including the oculus rift team
and Sony so we'll continue to track this
story all right if we fast forward to
the future maybe we could eventually see
that virtual reality tech for a 4k movie
experience well the hardware is all
there after the developers of the
walther app discovered the current
iPhone 6 with its AAA processor is
capable of playing 4k video without any
problem now the feature hasn't been
unlocked in and there's really no
advantage for users right now because
the iPhone doesn't have a 4k screen but
bottom line the iPhone 6 and 6 plus are
capable of playing 4k video even if the
file sizes are pretty big and it's a
sign we might see future mobile hardware
support sooner rather than later ok I'm
still waiting for my iPad pro something
anything again I know I'm not in the
majority Apple will need some
really help invigorate its tablet sales
according to the latest report from IDC
worldwide tablet growth is expected to
have significantly declined with just a
7.2 percent year-over-year growth in
2014 compared to a 50 2.5 percent in
2013
we know there's cheaper alternatives
that continue to hurt Apple's worldwide
market share that dropped under 23
percent this year compared to 29 percent
last year and people really just aren't
upgrading their tablet every year or two
it's more like three or four all right
Black Friday might already be here
depending on when you're watching this
and a lot of Black Friday sales are
already going on right now but if you're
looking for some great deals this year
my advice is you do not go to an Apple
Store for those deals see Apple is
offering $50 iTunes gift cards when you
buy most iPhones and iPads and $100
iTunes gift cards for Macs but no actual
cash off the retail price just iTunes
cards so don't fall for that and here's
my top Black Friday deals for you guys
to check out all right so if you're
looking for iPad deals targets doing a
140 dollar Target gift card when you buy
a 16 gig iPad air 2 that's regularly
$4.99 and 100 dollars with the Target
Gift Card with an original iPad air horn
I pad Mini 2 that's basically like cash
that can be used to buy anything in yes
the tarjay alright sam's club is doing a
$99 iphone 6 16 gig with a two-year
contract that beats out anyone out there
but you have to be a member and there
will only be 15 units per store but
still a pretty killer deal and quite
possibly the best deal of all Best Buy's
MacBook Air it's a core i5 1.4 gigahertz
11 inch laptop will be selling for 780
dollars it's really the best deal we've
seen on an 11 inch anywhere and also
they're selling the 13-inch model for
just 1050 and my personal sleeper deal
for you is an Apple TV just go to the
actual Apple online store go to the
refurbished section and get one for $75
it's free shipping it has the same
warranty as a brand new one out of the
box so there's just a few things to help
you save some cash this Black Friday
alright another short and sweet show
that's going to do it for this week
email me
anytime at the Apple bite se Netcom
we're tweet me and Brian Tong we're
collecting another viewer feedback show
and we want to hear everything from you
good and bad and come on I could take it
and remember to enjoy the holidays with
your friends and family and really
there's something that all of us can be
thankful for I know it sounds corny but
it's true so thanks so much for watching
and we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
