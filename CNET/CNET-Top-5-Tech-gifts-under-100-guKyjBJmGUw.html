holiday tech gifts was the newly
pc-compatible
touch wheel Apple iPod it costs $400 we
take it for granted but these days there
are so many amazing gadgets that can be
had for so little so to remind you today
I'm counting down the five slam dunk
tech gifts that can be had for under a
hundred dollars all pulled from CNET's
Holiday Gift Guide starting off at
number five headphones
I love these as a gift idea as a
cheapskate I know how hard it is to
spend more than thirty or forty dollars
on headphones for yourself that's what
makes this such a great treat to get a
pair from someone else for style you can
try the v-moda remix remote for sound
there's the clips image s4i to or for
comfort
try the audio technica ath m30 at number
four a universal remote bring some order
to the chaotic orgy of remotes in your
living room the Logitech Harmony 650 has
been our favorite for years now it's
easy to program easy to use and the
color screen will inspire tech envy for
anyone who comes over I'm number three
fitness trackers now in full disclosure
I also put these on my infamous list of
the top 5 worst holiday tech gifts it's
a Forney product category it's a great
choice for someone who's already
athletic a jogger biker competitive
miniature golfer but if my wife gave you
one of these I would just take it as an
expensive insult that said there are
some exceptionally cool products out
there like the Fitbit flex or the why
things pulse for the right person these
are a slam dunk for the more sedentary
intellectual try number two eBook
readers there is a reason that tablet
sales haven't killed off the traditional
e-ink ebook reader
they're awesome they have outstanding
battery life they're practically
indestructible the screens have no glare
and they weigh almost nothing they've
also never been better or less expensive
the lowest tier Kindle is just $69 for
$10 more could go with a nook simple
touch and unlike the Fitbit no one gets
insulted when you assume that they enjoy
reading
but if you want the real homerun gift
for under $100 here you go
at number one a media streamer that's
the boring way of saying an Apple TV or
a Roku 3 both will bring you right up to
that 100 dollar limit but it's a lot of
bang for your buck the Roku arguably has
the best set of features but if your
house is already filled up with iPhones
and iPads Apple is clearly the way to go
either way
it's never been easier to rent movies
stream Netflix or call up some great
music from the comfort of your couch and
because let's be honest you're not going
to Blockbuster any more so there you go
five great tech gifts for under $100
