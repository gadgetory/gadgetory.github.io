and this is a blockbuster battle between
two of the thinnest 13-inch laptops
it's a prize fight throwdown showdown
between samsung's 9 Series and Apple's
MacBook Air our judges for this fight
are senior editor Dan I think I can
Ackerman senior associate editor Scott
the bottom line Stein and Brian can't go
wrong Tom now we'll take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system this is going to be a
classic so who's in it to win it
round one is designed Samsung's nine
Series looks like a piece of modern art
with its gorgeous rap sheet metal design
its plastic bezel is a fingerprint
magnet but its thinnest point is point
zero two inches thinner than the airs
thickest point for those of you that
Karen come on we know who you are now
there's still nothing on this planet
that can match the superior design of
Apple's unibody MacBook Air its blade
design is super thin lightweight and
sturdy this is just another iconic stud
in Apple stable both laptops are amazing
and should be praised for raising the
bar in ultra-thin design but Apple is
still a cut above the rest it gets a
perfect 5 and the 9 Series gets a 4.3
next round is features Samsung's 9
Series just brings it when it comes to
features with a Core i5 processor double
the RAM at 4 gigs and a backlit keyboard
yes it maxes out with a 128 gig solid
state drive and there's flip-out ports
for an Ethernet dongle HDMI out 2 USBS
audio out and a micro SD card slot now
the MacBook Air improves from its
predecessor with two USB ports and an SD
card slot there's also a mini
DisplayPort for video out and audio out
on the other side but it's Ethernet
dongle takes up a USB port when used a
differentiator is its multi-touch
trackpad with gestures but you'll have
no backlit keyboard the biggest option
is the
building double the storage to 256 gigs
but that's more of an option and not a
feature the 9 series takes this round
with the 4 and the macbook air gets a 3
so after averaging 2 rounds
Samsung leads by 2 tenths of a point
with plenty of fight left round 3 is
performance these two laptops are
surprisingly evenly matched you might
think Samsung's 1.4 gigahertz core i5
would destroy the air but it's low
voltage processor has similar
performance with the airs 1.8 or 2 duo
now here's some of our benchmark tests
where Apple did score faster in two of
the three tests but neither of these
thinnies were able to separate
themselves in graphic performance apples
wake up from sleep is almost an instant
on but this one is too close to call and
we're calling this round even at 4
points apiece next round is battery life
with ultra portables the amount of juice
you have to go the distance is key
Samsung was able to squeeze out 5 hours
and 22 minutes of life from our battery
drain tests while Apple's MacBook Air
was just under 5 at 4 hours and 58
minutes
the 9 Series was almost 30 minutes
better and that's top of the class for
this laptop category it takes this round
with the 4.3 and Apple gets a 4 so after
averaging 4 rounds Samsung still holds
on to its two tenths of a point lead but
anything can happen here
the final round that decides it all is
value
these are Ultra portables not netbooks
but a premium class of laptops using
solid-state drives with a premium price
to match Samsung's nine series will cost
you get ready for this one one thousand
six hundred and forty nine dollars which
makes Apple's pricey look like a bargain
it'll scare consumers initially but
there's more to it now I purchase the
coverage plan for all my laptops and the
Samsung price includes three years of
warranty now Apple's MacBook Air at
$1,299 isn't the cheapest for a 13-inch
but again that's not why you're paying
attention to this you can double the
hard drive to 256 gigs and you'll still
be cheaper than the 9 series at $15.99
but the air only comes with a one-year
warranty and it's $249 to get
applicators three-year coverage that
puts these two in the same ballpark but
16:49 still scares people Apple takes
this final round with the four and
Samsung gets a three so let's average
out all five rounds and enterprise fight
that was neck-and-neck without any room
to budge Apple takes the final round
pushing it just over the top four point
zero to three point nine and is your
prize fight winner this is a price ride
where you really can't go wrong but in
the end the MacBook Air prevails
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time on
another prize fight
