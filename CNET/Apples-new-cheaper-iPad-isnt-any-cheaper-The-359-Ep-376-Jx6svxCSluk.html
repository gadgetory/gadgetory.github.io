Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
dang Apple held this big event yesterday
and well it's a bit of a letdown
everyone was expecting a cheaper iPad
yet the price remained the same at $329
now the education discount did get a
little bit cheaper it's now $2.99 309
but that's only a $10 difference yeah
you're gonna have a big event for
something like $10 difference right so
everyone expecting that I mean the big
announcement was that this new cheaper
sorry this new iPad that's not cheaper
now supports the pencil stylus which is
which had been a feature really for the
iPad pro line you know they talked a lot
about all the education apps different
services and programs that teachers will
be able to use but what do you guys
think well the general market do you
care so like the big update for this one
is that one it has a much more powerful
chip right and that it's now compatible
with the Apple pencil that was like
their whole reason why they did it
within the school and all this stuff but
the thing is is that pencil cost an
extra hundred dollars yeah so it really
does not help in their case of you know
we're trying to get back in at schools
because the big reason why they've
turned away from them is because it's so
expensive right I crumble is you can get
one for like 200 250 bucks so the fact
that this is still $300 for schools plus
the $100 pencil and there is no keyboard
attachment for this so that those are
real stumbling blocks for Apple who
wants to get back into schools I also
got an email from one Apple customer
that bought the 2017 model of this 329
iPad and he asked me hey does this now
is this now gonna have pencil support
because it sounded like he was more than
willing to pay you know the hundreds to
get a pencil and I had to tell him no
it's not gonna you know reverse or
they're not gonna say it's not so
unfortunately for folks and this does
happen with Apple sometimes is that
you're just gonna have to buy it an
all-new device if you want these
additional services or these additional
capabilities rights ok next up we've got
Facebook revamping its privacy settings
timing obviously this is the wake of the
Cambridge analytical scandal the new
settings were found in the mobile app
allow you to better manage your data and
who you're sharing to but Alfred UN you
check this out right yeah I used it this
morning it are you private
are you more private now email well to
be fair I was already really private on
Facebook but I liked the settings on
there aren't really like that extreme on
it I mean you're you're much more able
to like manage who sees your post and
like manage the apps that you use but
you can only do it through the mobile
app like if like that's where they made
it easier that's where they fixed all
these like feet should be keep it clear
you can manage these settings on the
desktop versus browser version but it's
the same old interface yeah yeah they
didn't really change it there but like
it had been there for a while too but
like this is like they just made it
easier to access these aren't exactly
new settings right I tried it out too
and I noticed in the settings menu you
had to scroll through a long list of
items before you even got to this
privacy shortcut like if it was really a
priority it probably should have put it
right at the top your settings menu
it's they've they've made these types of
announcements before and it's still
completely Byzantine and confusing
privacy settings situations so I don't
think that that fixes it that well
alright lastly we already know the
Chromebook is a hit in schools it's why
Apple made such a big deal iPad
yesterday but did you know it was also a
hit is a hit with security experts too
yes so I had been noticing a lot of
Chromebooks any time I went to a
security conference granted I've only
been to three of them but not any more
than me
I had always expected this kind of like
tricked-out laptop with like these crazy
like VPN settings and things like that
or like two-factor authentication keys
for their USB but no it's just like a
simple Chromebook and the big reason why
is because they're so cheap and like
they're pretty much like burner laptops
at this point and that it's built-in
with all these like really useful when
easy security settings that like you
don't have to set anything up like it's
extremely secure by default that's there
you go it's all about simplicity really
when you want security to be effective
for more on these stories check us on
CNET I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm alfred Aang thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody that's a wrap
on the recording of the audio podcast
I'm gonna go ahead and start fishing
through the old chat see if we got any
good comments and questions to keep the
conversation going
Alfred I'd loved your comment I'll burn
in your lap no that's really a thing
makes sense it actually is yeah there's
a quote in my story where he talks about
a security researcher ken white who
mentions you know yeah I always carry
this when I travel for a conference or
something like that because if I get
malware I'm like my personal $2,000
laptop or something I'm based I'm gonna
be like freaking out but if it's on like
$150 like Chromebook I don't really care
about it that much you don't have any of
your sensitive data or informational
there I mean you could basically you're
willing to lose that laptop yeah I
actually bring a Chromebook every time I
go to these conferences and you wipe it
before and after yeah so it has this
feature called power washing which so if
you want to check change like your
windows like laptop backs like default
settings like you usually have to have
like the copy of like the wind yeah
rather difficult it's like a real pain
in the ass
so with Chromebook you can just go under
like your settings and it's like right
there like power watch and it sets like
everything back to like yeah so I always
do that before I go to a conference and
like when I like after I leave one yeah
just to make sure like there's nothing
like on it when I return it right I know
we were kind of making light of Apple or
at least basically saying that it was a
bit of a letdown yesterday with apples
event but just as just as like a side
note or two be sure to to that I think
that it was definitely important and for
a long-run situation it was good that
they did do an education event maybe it
wasn't nearly as much as it could have
been but at the same time I I think that
they're targeting the right eye area I
mean I look I think it's gonna be a big
challenge for Apple to get back in
schools this is an area they dominated a
couple of years ago but you know they
had a big pilot program with the LAUSD
Los Angeles Unified School District in
which they they wanted to buy iPads for
every single student that turned out to
be a
failure you know kids would have broken
the security features to kind of use the
iPads the way they wanted load up their
own games iPads were stolen the that
curriculums didn't it was also a really
expensive is really right plus was
really expensive in fact LAUSD ended up
getting a settlement from Apple back
because the program was such a failure I
just don't know if you know adding more
apps and adding more features and tools
for teachers which are all grade is
gonna solve the problem that things are
crazy expensive and it was just
disappointing even even if they didn't
lower the price for consumers if they
had increased the education discount you
know made it cheaper for schools to buy
them or students buy them or threw in
the pencil for free cuz they made such a
big deal of how useful the pencil was
for their homework right so why not have
like a bigger incentive so getting
schools and students actually using
directed specifically to that logitech
did come out with the crayon which is
forty nine dollars instead of ninety
nine dollars and I think it's only
education specific so consumers aren't
actually allowed to buy that so yeah I
realized that fifty dollars is not zero
but at the same time I'm looking at it
from the perspective that Apple had a
lot of failures and screw-ups in the
education market but I think they
clearly identified the fact I think
Alfred had this in his story that
businesses and the education market are
an area where they could actually
increase iPad sales so they're they're
targeting that and maybe it's not gonna
be perfect this year maybe it's not all
going to work maybe it's still expensive
but they're not giving up on it and I
think that is something to pay attention
to know for sure I think again beyond
the the challenges of price and it's
$350 versus a two hundred two hundred
there was a research note I forget from
who that was issued last night I
basically looked at how younger students
you know like grade school or below
iPads are really effective cuz it's more
visual it's all touchscreen but when you
get to older kids you need to have a
keyboard right that's where the lacks
where you're you can't do like a book or
report exactly you can report on your
iPad because well one there's no there's
no keyboard accessory for the
I pad i minister you can do a Bluetooth
connection but there isn't one like the
iPad pro right and so I think with a
Chromebook you get that that full
package with a keyboard that makes such
a big difference for older students you
know what they should do is come out
with a cheaper like dirt cheap MacBook
Air 200 bucks there are persistent
rumors that Apple is a cheaper MacBook
Air oh my god Davida breath yeah I mean
that would make a lot of sense I mean if
they're really serious about the
education market problem is cheaper for
Apple for a macbook air would be one
like 700 not only that but like let's
caveat that that that rumor about an
upgraded MacBook Air has existed for a
long towards their ear pods a hundred
and fifty dollars you think they're
gonna miss hell a whole laptop no of
course not no just I was throwing it out
there as you know point of complete
ridiculousness let's go ahead and jump
into the chat we'll start right off with
one from Matthew dacher - for someone
who purchased a 20-17 low price iPad is
there any reason I'm gonna want this one
no the pencil no the pencil but like
that's what stinks about being an Apple
customers here you're not gonna you
really really like using a stylus which
my favorite part during while covering
this was um so earlier they had
mentioned this is our most affordable
iPad yes ok so cool there's gonna be a
discount and starting at three hundred
and twenty nine dollars like that's the
exact same price well you know what at
least Amazon when they say that this is
the cheapest the echo dot has ever been
they at least have a reasonable enough
to drop the price by a penny or two
because that's what they do usually
during the holidays Apple didn't even
bother doing that I would just want to
take a minute to shout out and
appreciate Michael Brown who is
extremely passionate about this project
I'm with you Michael he's talking about
things like underpaid teachers
under-equipped students and how Apple is
only taking advantage of this to lock
further generations into their ecosystem
and I 100 percent of
with that that is another issues if
you're if you're going all in on iPad
you're going all in on Apple ecosystem
the Chromebook or with Windows I mean
they are a little bit more open maybe
not Chromebooks but you know Windows
definitely more open you have your
choice between different vendors in
terms of programs or whatever you with
that boy you kind of have to like work
with Apple and whoever works with Apple
who ever person right no beats music
class brought to you by being yeah we've
you know we handle this stuff like the
teacher from Arizona like who who
disclosed her like meager paycheck was
like I can't I can't make a living on
this there's all these issues about
teacher pay there's their teachers who
are striking because of that and then
and on the other side of the equation
you've got apples charging right which
which means that it might work better
for private schools potentially but at
the same time after all those problems
that you would previously mentioned it's
pretty clear that Apple has a pretty
high mountain to climb if they are
hoping to beat out Chromebooks yeah
I'm looking forward to these stories
that are going to crop up around
suddenly iPads go missing teacher buys
new car maybe that happened at LAUSD
they're worth FL what they're by a new
car was 322 holders I'm saying rooms
worth of iPads could probably get you a
car well the good news too is if chara
had this in her story and it's this is
this is interesting is that Chromebooks
have hardly any resale value whereas the
iPads do yes so that is at least one
benefit that if you do spend 329 dollars
on an iPad someone can just steal it
somebody you're at least gonna get some
of that money back even if it's three or
four years old whereas with a Chromebook
as you said before you buy it for $150
that's it
yeah yeah I just don't think that Apple
really has a competitive leg to stand on
in this one going on more from Michael
Brown packages for 500 bucks why didn't
Apple just start bundling it all
together with the keyboard and pencil
and put that all in the same box
probably the firewalls I mean I know
that yet though but they but this was
at a school and that was a perfect place
it was a perfect I still the sites like
get the separate pencil it's 99 bucks
but it seems like such a no-brainer of
all the things that come out of this
like that should be the doy right I feel
like there would be much less criticism
about like this iPad on unveil if it
were not done like in a school related
thing like they had just done like a
normal like Apple event where it's a
normal myth we've got a new iPad I
disagree I think that frankly this
should have been a press release like I
don't know if they if they held a
separate just right under the bed for
like here's a new iPad it's essentially
the same thing except for pencil support
we'd be like why are we all here why did
we all fly out here and so the school
thing at least gives us some extra I
think the screven I think the school
thing gave it a lot more hype with the
idea of like oh it's gonna be cheaper
Bryant schools and that's like their
biggest like issue of like getting like
into schools like they're too expensive
right and then like for them to not like
really talk about that I mean from their
perspective they be held in school
because they wanted to make a bigger
deal yeah they want to remind people
about the value of this thing in the
classroom setting
look I don't dispute the fact that those
tools and all that stuff that'll look
awesome and that that would for a
student that's great it's just I don't
know if schools can afford that
I'm Nasri iPad for every night I love
that there's this one point where they
were saying like oh we can help you save
money on field trips you don't need to
go on field trips anymore check out this
a our gallery they're like what so I
can't ever leave school they're there
finds me Ackerman was saying on the live
broadcast yesterday that kids could
telecommute into class of their sick at
home as a parent that's no that's not
gonna happen work stay home and watch
prices right and that's the Cheerios
like that yes yes price is right
absolutely not just talking for CBS I
love prices right but wait a minute was
that did I accidentally just do synergy
books you did let's be honest price is
right supersedes any kind of network
that could be a network in itself that
could be yeah that is kind of it's
really yeah it's just like it's the
morning show you watch I remember when
they were gonna unveil the new iPad I
like wanted to quickly make a meme about
like what the price is like coming
guessing what the price is for that
thing turns out it's the exact same
price everybody one dollar one dollar
undercut that and the cherry on top that
all of this is not only are we going to
lose all the best parts of school from
field trips to sick days they're going
to say no more recess you got apps to
play now they are playground I feel like
kids would be fine with that though yeah
and I think you an extent yeah they'd be
like oh wait so I can play for recess
hell yeah they already do yeah well they
played in class alright so shoehorn
agrees to Michael Brown they should at
least include the pen for students
here's one from six Lewis who I think is
a first-time commenter welcome to the
show prop 6 iPad pro 9.7 is obsolete
because this one supports the Apple
pencil so what is the point of the pro
naming market that's a really good
question I think you're probably gonna
get more answers to this layer this year
I don't know but the 9.7 Pro that I feel
like that is to your point that's like
kind of relevant now I mean for the
larger one I think we're gonna see
things like the face ID feature that was
on the iPhone 10 last year it carried
over to the the higher end pro the pro
line this year I think there's still the
keyboard attachment the keyboard cover
that is still a accessory that is you
know that's still part of Pro so there
are some things and imagine they'll
introduce you know new bells and
whistles for the Pro Line to keep it
elevated of this is right but to that
point the iPad Mini 4 I think is more
expensive and as less features now so
that is probably going to die off I was
surprisingly neither surprised it's
still there I think it's just they're
probably burning off inventory at this
point yeah
it's then probably it's cheap to make
like the margins oh that must be great
though it's more expensive and people
are buying it I guess then that's like
it that's a huge windfall for yeah oh by
the way it's a $99 pencil but it's $89
for schools I don't think the discount
that's a whole day's lunch right there
come on mm-hmm
let's take one from Romy Panda wants us
to expand on the augmented reality
oh you saw some actually decent
demonstrations
that was like a very realistic or
somewhat bright they showed some of the
crafting options and talks about how
that can be used a different diorama
layouts and in a similar vein to AR yeah
everybody hated making diary like sided
cardboard but it's just three iPads now
I did I do want to point out one comment
from Mike Shaw
he says dissecting a frog without the
smell of formaldehyde is just wrong and
you know I'm gonna give him that one
yeah I still remember that a lot of
things there was a crayfish frog worm
yeah the worm as we started off how the
worst because it was just mush so I
really other worms I never dissected
like a live
let not lives are just like any animal
we did owl pellets instead oh yeah it's
okay yeah I don't think anybody's gonna
report us also it's the Internet
let's talk to Matthew dancer one more
time do the school's get iCloud services
for free I believe they include a
certain percentage of storage yes so the
storage is higher it's now it's 200 gigs
instead of five gigs that correct
yes yeah yeah they bumped it up from big
buckets so that's actually that's pretty
good
that'll hold a decent amount of papers
like you're not gonna be storing
presentations and and much well no the
thing you can store photos I guess you
can but not so much like the videos if
you small 500 gigs of homework
assignments you I'm sorry you're
probably the most over works but now way
is that our student is that per student
less per student per classroom
remember the whole deal with this iPad
with these teacher programs or you can
you could have like eggs for the teacher
then no I assumed it was five
gigs perk that makes a lot more sense
because it's my cloud leg enough yeah
was it five hundred or two hundred do we
know Oh two hundred five sorry but I
believe it's I think it's per profile I
hope its profile because that would that
would be kids we all have these hard
drive now yeah alright let's move on to
Facebook Michael Brown says does this
make trusting Facebook easier does
anyone even care about the scandal are
people even leaving Facebook
no I'm those are good questions I think
they're very different answers why I
wonder if this was a different platform
if this was a less and ubiquitous I
utopian social network if people are
like oh you screwed up like a like a
snapchat like screw it I'm not invested
Facebook's got a track record yeah I
think the trust question is a bit
subjective I feel like it depends on how
much information you're comfortable with
giving up to it like in the sense of oh
who cares the Facebook knows like my
birthday I want people to know my
birthday but like that's why I mean like
it's different for like every person I
don't think the settings really do
because I I still have a major complaint
that like you this literally only
affects people that have the app on it
in the first place and it's not like a
major shift so much as it is we made it
easier for you to find your privacy
settings which like and they weren't
that much easier yeah which really
really shouldn't have been that hard to
find in the first place
they have a ways to go I think the
privacy settings is probably only a very
early first step the problem is is that
it's been proven that Facebook is too
easily games yeah by you know Russian
trolls Cambridge analytic all the like
ads all that stuff it is kind of they
have a lot of work to do to just clean
up all that garbage it is kind of the
perfect storm for Facebook right now
between the security problems and the
fact that it's completely overridden by
trolls it's just like poisonous cesspool
right but we knew that get out of but we
knew that to be the case with Twitter
from the get-go and now I guess people
are just waking up to the fact that
Facebook is probably just as bad well I
think to Brian
it's not the social networks it's us
surprise original point though I think
with Twitter I think it's a lot more too
easy to give it's easier to give that up
right Twitter is it's like a certain
segment of people of humans really use
Twitter in relevant way right so it's I
feel like it's a lot easier
Facebook it as you said so much more
ubiquitous everyone's on it it's for a
lot of people their primary way of
keeping in touch with family and friends
and they have power if you're in yeah
and they have more it's harder so as
much as like this delete hash a delete
Facebook movement is going on and there
are a number of high profile companies
and celebrities that have dropped off of
Facebook I think for most people they're
not gonna care as much now these are
celebrities who have like their own fan
pages and like screw it I'm not gonna
engage with what about private accounts
and there are plenty of them that
account I don't know if yeah I don't
know are they still utilizing the drop
why not that is Facebook is a more of a
communication tool not a social network
right well if you look at Elon Musk is a
great example because you know he
dropped he deleted SpaceX and Tesla
Facebook pages but I believe Elon Musk
his own page is still up no he doesn't
know if that's his though like it is I
looked it up and there's like a lot of
there's a lot of like no he said the
spate the Tesla one was confirmed but on
the right the one on the right looks
like a phony that's that's because I
looked it up there's a lot of like fake
Elon Musk page accounts though okay
maybe not and yeah so on this whole like
idea like that you're talking right you
don't think that like normal people are
going to delete facebook because it's so
like ingrained and like their everyday
lives
The Washington Post that's a really
great column about it essentially
talking about yeah you should you don't
have to delete facebook because there's
so many aspects of it but you should
change how you use it and how you gotta
write that string like the number one
step is like deleting the app I still
use Facebook and like if I want to go on
it from my phone I'll go like the
Washington Post suggest you delete the
yeah yeah the idea being that you know
you're much less inclined to check in on
you don't get all the notifications and
stuff so if I want to go on Facebook now
it's like a three-step thing now we're
like I have to go to face like open up
like Safari then go to facebook.com and
then log in and it just like makes me
much less inclined to check on it like
all the time
yeah let's come back full circle one
more time before we do wrap it up for
because we are just about out of time
one question that kind of came in here
at the eleventh hour from Lully that I
thought was interesting now we saw
Facebook or not Facebook excuse me Apple
presenting these iPads for use in an
elementary classroom type situation
right and that is a unique situation as
compared to higher education Lalit says
even for students 299 plus 50 plus 50
equals $400 for a textbook in US in
essence plus tools you know oh yeah
school supplies aren't cheap and that's
one of the things that a lot of teachers
are suffering with these days what about
iPads in higher education as a regulated
thing because buying textbooks in
college sucks yeah no that was a low
point of their education of that back in
2012 was they were trying to make it
easier for I think textbooks to be
converted into digital format to be used
I would have loved to not have to carry
around textbooks in college that I did
that when I was in college where I like
downloaded PDFs of my textbook but you
had to do the initiative and on your own
prior that wasn't yeah I wasn't like a
program that everyone acted like you
that was extra hoops that's the thing
though like they did offer II like
textbooks and stuff but they were still
just as expensive as like the physical
textbooks like why well that's asinine
yeah well not only that but you can't
sell them back got to it so it was just
like why would anybody like want to do
this and I think it's more of a call on
the college textbook industry yeah for
Windham there's a price is cheaper than
it is on like Apple or like Google like
these like tech companies that are
trying to make it easier for you to
access textbooks it's like it's still
just as expensive and yes why would you
even do it yeah I'm saying that program
needs to be refined is selling back
textbooks is hardly lucrative you buy it
for three hundred ten bucks back no no
but the point of that was at least with
the physical textbook you could sell if
you had it if you just bought digital
one there's no way to sell that yeah I
know but I much rather spend like 30 to
50 bucks on a rented textbook that I
could keep around maybe later on that's
a good idea
much space if you just rented as weight
as a physical there are book there are
digital book rental opportunities now a
lot of libraries do that when yeah but I
don't know if textbooks fall under that
they should they should I don't just
don't know technically rentals were also
a massive ripoff the one again because
you couldn't like sell it and by the
time you were done with it by the
semester you could have paid for the
actual textbook itself that's very true
that is very true so really there's
something wrong yes yeah there's the
next broken black market we should be
writing textbooks
we gotta get in on this it's the whole
lucrative market is about how to I never
bought them I really like I would borrow
them from my friends or I would go to
the library and borrow it I new friends
it would photocopy em yeah really just
photocopy the patterns allow ins you had
for school printers it'd be like if
you're if you're if you're a professor
we're saying like you need to read like
this page through this page like this we
go to the book store find those specific
pages or like have a friend who has a
textbook and like ask them to send it to
you yeah colossal real pain for your
friend who's guys scam like it's not a
pain for your wallet
true true just putting that out there
yeah I remember I bought the textbook
sold the back yeah you'd always you know
is lose money obviously but yeah it
wasn't as big of a financial hit it's
like just buying a book out right oh I
had this jackass of a teacher the toss
taught Business Administration I hate
the guy I'm not gonna name him here cuz
I think he's dead but wow we got dark so
quick this jerk wrote his own textbook
every year and by rote I mean he would
photocopy copy written materials into an
assembled book that you would then have
to purchase no outdated because he
refreshed it every single semester I
mean I would put like crappy handwritten
notes in it so he's still called his own
but you still got this like complete
crap I wish I could - was it like a nut
binder like with like though no he
actually got it and stuff no he got he
he got it legit printed Oh getting that
way so he took other people's material
put it in the book yeah he's like these
are essential reads and this is my Cliff
Notes version of it oh my god and then
you'd have to buy that that he win he
Hawk it updated every you had to become
a professor geez this is I give her
three tenure and
pushy your books understand it that's
evil genius at its bow that's rough
yeah so anyway that's my story about
textbooks and why I think digital
textbooks are a good way to go because
he's gonna pull that no they're good
they're cheaper that's the problem
yeah a bunch of jerks any last questions
before we cast got punchy I think we're
just about out of time but thanks

discussion and very good discussion
