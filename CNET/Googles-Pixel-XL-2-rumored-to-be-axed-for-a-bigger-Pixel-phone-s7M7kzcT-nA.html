welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you can think of and the big
story this week is the Google pixel XL
dead now a while back we talked about
how there were potentially three new
pixel phones in the works with walleye
and muskie code names representing the
second gen pixel phones but there was a
third one codenamed Timon that was
believed to be an even larger phone than
the pixel XL now according to Android
police the second next-gen pixel XL
phone codenamed muskie has been
cancelled and it will be replaced by the
rumored Timon device that is expected to
have an even larger screen but will
still most likely be marketed as the
second gen pixel XL now Android police
is confident there will be only 2 pixel
phones this year and having only two
models keeps their lineup simpler so
it's not necessarily dead but it will be
a different pixel XL after doing some
digging in androids issue tracker logs 9
to 5 Google believes the larger taemin
phone will be manufactured by LG and not
HTC now HTC built the original pixel
phones and we're believed to do the same
for this year but it looks like LG will
be taking over duties for this next
pixel XL
all right Google continues to get even
more serious about their phones variety
reports they have now hired a lead
systems on chip architect Manu Gulati
most recently led apple's chip
development for the past eight years
this is a big move for Google and his
role will be specifically focused on
building chips for the pixel phone line
he was an instrumental part in
development of Apple's a line processors
and is credited as an inventor in 15
paths for Apple relating to Apple pay
storing fingerprints and fundamental
chip architecture we were also excited
about the prospects of Andy Rubens
essential phone there was a lot of buzz
around it but that buzz might have been
killed after a USA Today report says
that the essential phone will be sold
through Sprint as the exclusive US
carrier then spread confirmed the
exclusive launch for later this summer
and it will also be available in the
u.s. Best Buy stores and Best Buy online
essentials website is offering an
unlocked version of the phone for $6.99
directly but starting on Sprint could be
a part of the big picture you know to
get the phone out there and then work on
a wider release for
nextgen but no doubt its killed some of
the mojo since a majority of users are
either on a tee or verizon here in the
US and LG fans the investor reports LG
is planning an august launch for its
large screen LG v 30 phone a month
earlier than the v20 from last year
now it's expected to be their first
flagship device with an OLED display the
V 30 is also rumored to offer a second
display that slides out from under the
main one to offer functions like a
keyboard the report also says LG is
planning to launch the next g7 phone a
couple months earlier as well targeting
January and will launch with a
snapdragon 845 chip now the earlier
timetable is to try and give it an
advantage over Samsung which tends to
release our products around the same
time as LG alright that's going to do it
for this week you can email me at Google
issues at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tong thanks so much for watching and
we'll catch you next time for some more
of that google ishes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
