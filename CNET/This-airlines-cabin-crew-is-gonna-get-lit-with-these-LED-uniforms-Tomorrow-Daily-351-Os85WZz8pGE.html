in the known universe I'm Ashley
together and i'm jeff cannata hold your
hats it's time for headlines if you're
flying with easyjet later this year you
might get to glimpse of some futuristic
flight attendant fashion the airline is
collaborating with london fashion house
cute circuit to create uniforms that
feature LED lights and microphones the
LEDs will be placed on shoulders and
hemlines and we'll deliver visual
information to passengers and
microphones will let the cabin crew
communicate more easily with everyone on
board ground crews aren't left out
either with a kind of hooded jacket that
will help pilots better see them during
takeoff and landing in dangerous weather
conditions these look so cool I want to
just fly on that airline just to see it
this is how they'll tell you where the
exits are you know they don't have to go
like this exact exactly what they're
gonna do we're gonna do my dance with
this is exactly right which is so
awesome I love it yeah I if you are
interested in those wacky little 3-d
pens 3d printing pens this robotic arm
might help you be a better artist
Neela's karadjias thesis project is
called guided touch a robotic arm that
gives haptic feedback to artists and
creators making objects with a 3d
printing pen the arm knows where it is
in space so you can program it to
understand where you should start and
stop while you prototype she wanted to
create a system where a designer could
enjoy the tactile feel and artistic
freedom of creating models while
retaining the accuracy and control
needed in more professional design
environments super impressive that she
built this as a thesis project not as
impressive as you pronouncing her name
uh you know what might not be impressive
could be wrong baby wrong i think it was
