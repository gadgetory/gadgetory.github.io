asteroid attack because for the fourth
time this year a space rock is zipping
right by earth and getting closer to us
than the moon it's only the first week
of February and we've dodged disaster
four times life on Earth these days is
stressful enough without worrying about
space doom asteroid BS 32 pays earth to
visit Thursday coming in at a distance
of roughly a hundred and sixty one
thousand kilometers or about a hundred
thousand miles that's 60 percent closer
than the moon or about 12 and a half
earths away but the one before was even
closer the distance of about five
Earth's are all of these flybys
coincidence or something more
astronomers have looked to see if these
clusters of smaller asteroids or
fragments from something larger that had
broken up but nope there's no
correlation between the orbits it's just
random but what if we're just noticing
more of these rocks because the weather
is different and it makes it easier to
spot more of them and that doesn't seem
to be the case either science tells us
not to worry it's rare for one of these
to make it to earth but considering the
frequency maybe it wouldn't hurt to keep
your eyes open I'm Bridget Carey and
