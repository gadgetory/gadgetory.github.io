astrophysicist and a planetary scientist
who is at the forefront of the effort to
answer one of the biggest mysteries of
science is there life beyond our planet
and beyond our solar system
and now finally she has a new tool to
help her and other scientists around the
world in that quest it's called the
transiting exoplanet survey satellite or
Tess and it's set to launch aboard a
SpaceX rocket this month
professor Sara Seager of MIT is part of
the science leadership team for Tess and
she's here with us now via Skype thanks
for taking the time to talk with me
professor thanks for having me
so tests must be an exciting upgrade for
you a we've learned so much about
exoplanets in recent years and it's been
thanks in large part to the Kepler space
telescope as well as Hubble and Spitzer
and others but it's been it's been
decades now since those telescopes were
conceived and and now you finally get to
work with a tool that has you know
designed for this current era of
exoplanets well there's always new
technology so yes it's it's a big deal
you know and the most powerful tools and
telescopes we have today they weren't
really made for studying exoplanets in
the way that test was as I understand it
that's right well I was just gonna say
that only Kepler was actually
specifically designed for exoplanets
pretty much everything else you're right
was just like a general-purpose
observatory that we got lucky that could
work for exoplanets well Tess is like
the next step and surprisingly enough
it's actually not really big it has four
identical cameras and each camera the
diameter of the aperture it's only 10
centimeters so they're like this and
it's amazing to think that just even
cameras they're very specialized though
at that size can do the job but Tess is
going to essentially provide the catalog
like the phonebook if you will of all
the best planets for following up for
looking at their atmospheres and
studying more about them Tess is going
to be primarily focused on planets that
are relatively nearby though right yeah
planets around stars that are very
nearby
although NIR is also a relative term
right so
you know why is is that why was that
decision made is a technical choice why
focus
I think it's within about three hundred
light years right yeah within about
three hundred light years that's right
because those nearest stars are brighter
and the photons I always say like
photons are like our currency like if
you wanted money more is always better
and so in astronomy more photons more
light it's always better and to do
follow-up measurements of what we find
is planets or planet candidates we want
to measure the mass of the planet we
want to look at the atmosphere of the
planet and all of those things to
require more photons so that's why the
search is for nearby planets and I
gather it's particularly you know
exciting to people like me and of
interest to you to be able to see more
learn more about the atmosphere in
particular right that's right
that gives us a look at something called
bio signatures yeah well eventually bio
signatures but one thing to think about
is Venus sometimes called our sister
planet because Venus is about the same
size and same mass as Earth is actually
well I like to think about was like if
there were intelligent aliens building
the kind of telescopes we're hoping to
build and they can look at our earth and
Venus they would think it's like they
wouldn't really know the difference
actually unless they can look at the
atmosphere because the Earth's
atmosphere has water vapor and carbon
dioxide and other gases whereas Venus
its atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide
and its surface is hot enough to melt
lead
so we really need the atmosphere to
understand like the greenhouse gases and
just everything more about the planet to
know its temperature and other things
and so tell me a little bit about the
the timeline how long until you know you
start to get some data and kind of make
sense of what you're getting down from
the telescope right well the launch is
no it's actually an ASUS beak no earlier
then
that's our first launch window and once
test launches it has what's called a 2
month of commissioning phase I always
like in a spacecraft waking it up like
waking up a person from a coma you know
you don't wake them up and go hey go run
this Boston Marathon
you know first you'll wake them up and
you wake your spacecraft up and say hi
are you there yes I'm here
put it back to sleep you know wake it up
let it kind of move around a little so
checking out the spacecraft and waking
up if you will each subsystem that takes
a while just to make sure it's all
working properly and working together I
want to say something like about 10 days
after launch it might take its first
images of the sky have the night sky and
we'll get some real data that up from
the cameras so that will be the first
for me personally big milestone that
actually will take test two months two
months to finish this checkout phase and
after two months the science mission of
data taking will begin and you know can
you tell me what the most exciting thing
is for you about this this exploration
you know that you've devoted yourself to
and and how tests will empower it to go
even further what what what is most
exciting to you about this particular
phase of your work
I think the most exciting thing about
tests is that it really is going to it
really has a chance and I just want to
save chance because we don't know how
our luck will pan out but it really has
a chance to find a rocky planet that's
the right temperature the right distance
from its star on the right temperature
to have life on its surface and tests
will find a pool of planets like that
that we're going to use a more
sophisticated telescope the James Webb
Space Telescope to look at the
atmosphere and look for signs of life on
it so the meet s represents the very
first opportunity to really truly make
progress in this area of trying to find
signs of life on other worlds test
itself in all space missions they really
have a focused goal and these so called
earth sized planets that test is gonna
find believe it or not they're not like
our own earth actually because Tess is
most sensitive to red stars red dwarf
stars that are like half the size of our
Sun or even down to 10 or 20% the size
of our Sun and these planets orbiting
these small stars we're not really sure
what they're gonna be like if you want
to know the honest truth because the
planets that orbit the small stars
they're very close to the star for the
planets that are the right temperature
for life because these small stars have
a very low energy output and what's so
interesting is when the planet is that
close tides from the planet from the
star have affected the planet some orbit
in its rotation rate and the the planet
actually orbits one time for every time
it orbits what this means for the planet
itself is that one side is permanently
bathed in daylight one side is
permanently night
and the other thing about these small
stars is they tend to be very active
like they have flares like giant flares
that will create Northern Lights and
send all kinds of unfortunately
dangerous particles towards these
planets so one of the more exciting
things about tests is being able to
explore like armchair Explorer with
telescopes these kind of planets that
would be so different from our earth
even if they're about the same size and
made of the same material yeah and you
know we're really heading into a new era
of astronomy it seems where we're gonna
be able to think about those things a
lot more deeply and with data more than
we've ever had before and test seems to
kind of be kicking that off and then you
have the James Webb Space Telescope the
European Space Agency is also going to
be launching some planet-hunting
satellites soon I mean care to speculate
about what or when we might find it next
I mean what can say that two things one
is that we'll have the capability to
find signs of life by gases in the
atmosphere that don't belong that might
be attributed to life so we'll have the
capability to do it but like nature has
to cooperate right I mean there have to
be lots of planets that are the right
temperature that have the right
ingredients and life has to not only be
there but generate gases and so if
Nature cooperates we have a great shot
at it that's one thing the second thing
is as you just said not just tests but
these European missions like the number
of people going into the field and the
kind of number of small but growing
amount of resources funneling here we'll
definitely be trying hard so there will
be it won't so people try and having the
capability it's just a matter of nature
cooperating I've read that you've made
it somewhat of a mission of yours to
help to find another earth which is kind
of what you're describing and within
your lifetime what is it about that goal
that appeals to you and drives you well
I just always think that there you know
everyone has their own sort of desire
for more like on earth we go to our job
we do our daily thing and
oftentimes I just find a lot of people
you know even children will sometimes
say like is that it uh-huh and so for me
the earth kind of represents wanting to
know more like how did we form how did
we come to be how did our earth form and
evolve why are we here is there anything
out there and for me just the thought of
finding another earth or Earth's will
help put all that into context I don't
have a great answer behind Hawaii I mean
I wish I had like a we have to do this
we're gonna move there next year we're
gonna do something but it's not it's
just I can't even explain why I'm just
so compelled to do it but part of it is
just that hope that there's something
bigger out there than we are
is there anything we're leaving out
anything you want to add about the test
mission or anything else that you're
working on yeah I do I guess they will
add something so one thing that
sometimes is really interesting to think
about is just how our whole world is
going towards big data I mean sometimes
it's bad big data analytics where people
are stealing your data to make you know
find patterns sometimes it's good big
data like for health or other things and
so tests actually and Kepler and
Kepler and tests it's actually just a
new version of that so we actually
borrow from and build upon what the rest
of the world is doing and artificial
intelligence and things like that so you
do think about tests of finding planets
a step towards finding life but what I
just wanted to share is that underlying
all that is just the same big data that
a lot of other fields are doing in
computer science and related right it's
not just about staying up all night
looking through a lens right hasn't been
about that for a while it's more like
setting your computer on a task and then
checking the next day to see what it
found right real real quick any updates
on some of the other projects I know
you've been working on like starshade
yeah okay I do have something to say
well even though test is so exciting and
it's launching like imminently it's just
the first part in a much longer journey
because tests will really nail the
problem for these red m-dwarf stars but
ultimately we really need to search
sun-like stars true Sun twin it's a much
harder problem actually find an
earth-sized planet in front of that twin
so I do want to show this to you I
actually can't see myself that you
Malaysia you see this dark shade what
I'm showing you is a star shade it's
actually 1% scale
so the actual star shadows design would
be a hundred times bigger than mess and
these petals here they're very sharp and
they come to these sharp tips the star
shape would be attached shoots on the
spacecraft and that spacecraft would be
formation flying with the telescope so
the star shape would block out the
Starlight so the telescope can see the
planet directly and star shade is
emission under development
you heard like some of these missions
like Hubble and the James Webb Space
Telescope and Kepler they can be 30
years from concept to launch sure the
source shade actually you know it was
first thought of actually in the 1960s
and it's been revisited every decade
because it's nearly impossible to build
that recently huge amounts of progress
are being made so it's in good shape
but it still needs more money glad to
hear well I look forward to the launch
we're gonna be watching the launch from
well I'm going out to Cape Canaveral and
I'm gonna be with probably a couple
thousand people who got invited to the
launch I'll be with some of the other
test team members I'm bringing my
husband and two kids and it turned out
to be April school break here so one of
them is actually on break the other one
we're pulling out of school we've
invited a bunch of friends and hopefully
it'll be a breathtaking experience
perfect well travel safe and keep up the
work and we will definitely be watching
thanks a lot Eric</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
