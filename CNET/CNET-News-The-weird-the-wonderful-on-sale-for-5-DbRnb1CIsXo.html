but to pay the bill she's had to tap
into her other skill of writing press
releases I love writing and I love words
and it comes easy for me so she turned a
fiver a micro services website where
goods and services can be exchanged in
five dollar increments I offer 150 words
for five dollars and if they want more
words for instance 300 they can pay to
fibers that's no chump change in two
years of selling on Fiverr petterson has
made over seven thousand dollars that
fun money might go towards you know
something important but fiber isn't just
a marketplace for professional skills
from unusual happy birthday messages
happy they do you two cute kids toys to
the weird and wonderful there seems to
be a seller and presumably a buyer for
just about everything we saw a huge
opportunity in this new services economy
I think that people in today's economy
are are starting to think outside the
925 box and are looking for ways to
monetize their skills listing on Fiverr
is free but the company takes twenty
percent of the sellers profit fifteen
percent were sellers already few fiber
as their primary source of income in
less than three years of operation
fibers seen more than 1 million goods
and services go on sale for more than
200 countries and according to CEO Micah
Kaufman it's the global digital nature
of the site that sets it apart from
taskrabbit alanson other competition hey
