editor had seen it in here at Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona want to show
you new he has asha phones now these are
a trio of low-end devices for emerging
markets and Nokia's introduced unlikely
we'll see these fourth carriers in the
United States you never know but they're
really meant for places like India
places like Africa where they want where
people need starting to buy cell phones
and they want to get cell phones and a
whole world people that don't have them
yet so this is the Nokia Asha 202 now
the most interesting about this phone it
is dual SIM so we don't see a lot of
those in the u.s. that allows you to put
two SIM cards in the phone you can be
frumply different carriers both sim both
summary needs are up here you can see
you can see how Robards brief sim and
there's actually a cool feature that if
you just press that you can see which
none carrier and then if you even press
the carrier you can select what firm of
stuff you want to come through that say
you're traveling overseas Levante you'll
get text messages from the US but you
don't get calls because they're
expensive but then you're traveling in
Spain you have a Spanish friend who's
gonna call you on in Spanish phone then
you can call up again so that's pretty
cool
otherwise it's a very simple design 2
megapixel camera some pretty low in
features this a simple keypad feels nice
and light in the hand I like really big
story about this room is that dual SIM
card
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
