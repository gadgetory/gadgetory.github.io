ten terabyte drive may be coming sooner
than you think I'm Jeff Bakalar in once
again for Bridget Carey this is your
seen it up there amazon has just blown
out its cloud storage solution for its
customers by offering new super cheap
plans to new unlimited data packages
have just rolled out 14 photos and one
for any kind of data the new unlimited
photos plan will go for twelve dollars a
year and let users store an unlimited
amount of image files in their cloud
though you do get five gigs for anything
you want as well and for sixty dollars a
year there's the unlimited everything
plan which you guessed it will let users
upload and store anything they want now
if you're already an Amazon Prime
subscriber you have the unlimited photos
plan baked in but there's no discount on
the unlimited plan for anyone the
crowd-sourced ride-hailing service lift
will soon let passengers and drivers
share more about themselves through the
introduction of user profiles lift has
been built around the notion of a
friendly warm and fuzzy sociable
attitude and now you'll be able to learn
a little more about your driver and or
passenger before the actual ride these
profiles will share our users hometown
their musical tastes and a brief bio and
it'll also highlight any Facebook
connections between the two parties
there's some pretty impressive tech
coming to the world of solid-state
storage intel along with micron and
toshiba announced plans to start
producing flash chips that could mean
3.5 terabyte drives the size of a stick
of gum now imagine that in your laptop
your tablet or even your phone so the
technology is called 3d NAND and it's a
vertical spin on traditional NAND
architecture basically memory cells are
now being stacked on top of each other
kind of like floors in a skyscraper to
fit more data in the same form factor as
the technology progresses it's only
going to become more cheaper and more
efficient and it won't be long until we
see something maybe the size of 10
terabytes in a laptop that's a lot of
gifts you guys and finally Apple
CEO and now good guy Tim Cook seen here
half smiling is joining the growing list
of tech movers and shakers who are
generously donating to charity which is
a charge led by Bill and Melinda Gates
cook plans to give away most of his
estimated seven hundred and eighty five
million dollar fortune after he pays for
his nephews college this seems to
contradict cooks predecessor Steve Jobs
when it comes to public giving though
there are reports that job secretly gave
away millions during his lifetime okay
