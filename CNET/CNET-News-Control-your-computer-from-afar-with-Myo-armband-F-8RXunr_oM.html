PowerPoint presentation maybe the
clicker and this video game is being
played without a controller the tech
that makes that possible
Myo an arm BAM that understands how your
arm hand and fingers move thanks to a
built in processor and eight muscle
sensors we pick up these tiny signals
that come from your muscles you know
when I'm gonna make a fist my brain is
sending these impulses down my nerves
made by filmic Labs the one hundred and
fifty dollar Mayo lets you control
computers and devices with your motions
and then all those signals are sent into
a little processor on here that's been
trained using machine learning to
recognize which different muscles
correspond to different gestures gesture
recognition technology isn't new there's
the popular Kinect from Microsoft and
the leap motion controller precisely
tracks all fingers but unlike those
devices
Myo doesn't use cameras so users aren't
limited to a specific area there's this
like old problem with gesture control
they call it the gorilla arm syndrome
and that's because the camera has to see
me I have to be out like this to do it
and so with this technology you know I
can be sitting here armed my side and go
ahead and take control over the device
the armband connects to devices via
low-energy bluetooth and has a range of
50 feet so you could turn up your
favorite track streaming on your laptop
from across the room the model thalmic
labs expects to sell to the public later
this year will be thinner and lighter
than this developers version but our
consumers willing to wear an arm bit
maybe not while they're replying to
email but you might be able to tempt
them with a drone in San Francisco I'm
