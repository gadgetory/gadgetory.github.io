has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week a sous hint
set a 5-inch something amazon might be
working on a game console and get the
last of your iphone rumors polished
because there might be an apple event
next month first up a quickie a sous
recently presented its smartphone
strategy to its investors and engadget
obtained a leak slide from the
presentation that talked about something
called the MIMO phone hd5 and that was
it there were no other details on the
slide like a release date or what the
thing actually is a sous is the company
behind the phone pad which is a tablet
that can be used as a smartphone and the
PadFone which is a smartphone that docks
to become a tablet so maybe the MIMO
phone is just a single device
run-of-the-mill smartphone that turns
into something people might actually buy
next according to game informer amazon
might be working on an android based
game console that could be released by
black friday the console would come with
its own dedicated controller and it
would serve as a platform for the
android games that are already offered
by amazon that are often played on like
it's Kindles there are other rumors that
support this kotoko tweeted recently
that amazon has been hiring gaming
developers and a job recruiting event
hosted by amazon in May teased a
revolutionary new product of course
these observations don't necessarily
lead to a game console it could be
related to the long-rumored kindle phone
or even a set-top box who knows but
either way amazon would have a leg up on
the competition such as oya seeing as
how it already has a huge consumer base
and finally oh my god citing sources our
friends at all things d are reporting
that apple will hold its iphone event on
September 10th September 10th is a
Tuesday which is when Apple has held
events in the past and going on
tradition it'll probably be a Moscone
Center in San Francisco I think that
they're going to announce the five
yes possibly a cheaper colorful version
of the iPhone like the iPhone 5c that
we've been talking about and more
details on iOS 7 I definitely don't
think that there'll be a gold iPhone
with sapphire buttons but who knows
stranger things have happened what do
you guys think if September 10th is
really the day what do you think apple
will unveil don't forget to vote and
leave a comment and I'll ask the cnet
council what it thinks the cnet Council
is composed of five editors who cast
their votes anonymously their opinions
are not an endorsement by Cena or CBS
Interactive obviously because these are
rumors folk and the cnet council's
verdict is yes all five editors think
that September 10th will be the big
reveal of the next iPhone I also ask
them what they think will be unveiled at
the event most of them think that both
the 5s and a 5c will be revealed but one
lonely editor also thinks that they'll
announce the long-rumoured iwatch whoa
that's our show everybody please share
your rumours that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and
tweet us and tune in next week for more
tech rumors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
