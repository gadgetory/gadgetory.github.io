get a little bit cheaper in the future a
stroller that is gonna follow you around
with your baby in it and a bunch of
Disney news it's gonna just millions of
Disney movies it's unbelievable let's
get started yeah daily
pretty citizens of the internet welcome
to tomorrow daily and the best week talk
show in the known universe so I'm
actually scatta joining me and always
Kalin out of it well that's as much as I
can do forget you soon as I mean no
traffic my name's playing like during
our theme songs maybe the algorithm will
pick it up oh okay cool it's a remix

doing anything else that's exactly right
but there was a lot of great stuff too
so they had some announcements for
things like Shanghai Disney which we've
talked about on the show before they
talked about a few of the more yeah like
the truant roller coaster and stuff like
that they also announced there wasn't
gonna be any huge Star Wars
announcements as when they said but they
did have some huge towers and yeah
including the fact that they're going to
be adding us extent expanded Star Wars
themed areas to Disneyland and Disney
World they're gonna have a Toy Story
land which you just saw I don't know
what that pros never after thing is that

whatever it's laura agreeance all right
let it go but so they're also gonna have

but that's that's um that's some shop
Talk they're also gonna have signature
attractions quote-unquote the ability to
pilot a han Solo storied Millennium
Falcon spaceship I'll see
mission an epic Star Wars adventure I
like it so that's that's pretty cool the
Iron Man experience basically they're
making experience for every single
property that they have smart that's
popular so then and then on to movies
they talk they announced that Colin
Trevorrow who directed Jurassic world is
going to be doing Star Wars Episode 7 no
9 yeah episode 7 is already almost done
Star Wars Episode nine yes 08 was done
by ryan ryan johnson who did looper yeah
and then JJ Abrams did that I thought JJ
Abrams gonna be in this in the mix again
but I guess new director every time he's
gonna direct the Star Wars Justice
League no i don't know i don't know
that's gonna work like there's JJ Abrams
rushing with his hands he's pretty good
at that they also and they also showed
off the Cask forecast for rogue one if
you don't remember there's going to be
Star Wars movie every year with an
episode title being every other year
okay so one of the the new Star Wars
series they're gonna start is wrote one
they brought they brought Felicity Jones
Forest Whitaker Mads nut mekin mechlin
there oh the guy plays handle Mads mmm
Matt Matt Nicholson see ya there you go
and Allen titik hey who's gonna be
playing a mocap character apparently
people are really excited about Alan
Tudyk who isn't excited about allocating
space again yeah needs to be in space
he's awesome so yeah lots of lots of
great stuff more Doctor Strange info but
no like actual visuals because they
haven't started filming it yet but yeah
there you go here's some good time chat
by the way no no timetable on when any
of those lands or anything are gonna
Park Zoo's yeah so you went I did I went
yesterday I was at d23 i went to the
disney interactive panel i got see the
game stuff so I got to see kingdom
hearts 3 they announced there would be a
big hero 6 land which was really
exciting and in Kingdom Hearts 3 like
therapy a world that was a San fransokyo
like that would be one of the levels
that Sora gets to go and use the
keyblade in and everything and then saw
saw some bait they had a full-size like
person Akash Nemo's baymax come out on
stage but it was like a really good
baymax costume that had like the head
that popped up and down and it blinked
and stuff and it was adorable like I
couldn't believe my own eyes it felt
like I was really seeing the movie that
was awesome and then
I saw battlefront they have battlefront
they showed off some footage they showed
off the new limited or not limit edition
this the Darth Vader ps4 rule so cool
they gave two away to people in the
audience there's like a kid that 11 and
then they're like check under your seats
it was like being on Oprah was weird and
we're really under the seat yeah they
had like what the two people I just walk
in and start checking under seats of
places now I'm gonna walk in and just
like a whole bunch of people like rip
the tags off from the actual chair like
the the fire hazard like warning or
whatever people thought they had
something another chair was hilarious
and then so we showed that off they
showed Disney infinity 3.0 they gave up
everybody in the in the room a Mickey
Disney infinity figure which is really
cute and then they talked about the Star
Wars battle pod the new arcade
experience they're gonna make some that
you can buy to put in your house hi so
just a lot of stuff it was just a lot of
stuff so deep I guess the best your best
bet would be to watch that part you just
watched of this of this episode and then
remember what you wanted and then just
Google search no fine cuz there's I mean
there were panels for just about
everything the pixar panel is really
cool uh and then on top of that like d23
it for a feeling of like scope d23 used
to be every other year it used to be
over the year and there wasn't a whole
lot it was like Maura force really big
Disney superfans to go and like the door
yeah giant Disney artists signings
things like that and now it has become
such a machine with the addition of
marbling and star wars that big
advertising they're doing it every year
now they're gonna do it every year so
every year there'll be a d23 expo it'll
be around august and and I mean I don't
see why not it's such a huge thing now
and there were costumes and they had
bb-8 and stars rebels and I mean just
the pic servers they had a whole John
Lasseter a Hawaiian shirt exhibit like
you could see all the different Hawaiian
shirts that were custom made for each of
the Pixar movies that they were all
incredible they're all like specifically
made for that movie and they had all the
characters on there so so fun like it
was really great it was really really
cool and I really enjoyed it goes it um
I don't remember to take a star excited
I had a press badge so I don't remember
how much they are but they're not
terribly expensive like comic-con like
any comic con like probably like 60 70
bucks to go for one day okay so and then
I'm sure the three day pass is
discounted so okay we gotta talk
hi today its TD 23 hashtag TD 23 and I
want to know no I want to know because
it's my article it's your article okay
fine mamas I want to know how you doing
girl no I want to know what's the
craziest announcement Disney should have
made at their Expo the craziest I think
I would have liked to have the craziest
thing that is never gonna happen I'm
gonna go with crossover star wars and
Marvel movie they're like we're gonna go
sober yeah like crazy crossover where
everything just starts bleeding together
I've uh I've had this whole idea that
they should create a villain section of
the park and like have like a like more
adult roller coaster type stuff and they
have like the villains walking around
and like Maleficent you little drinks
and maybe they have alcohol I don't know
i just added that part listen no no no
perfect for california venture that was
the villains land but anyway enough
enough dorking around about Disney and
stuff like that all right all right so
we'll really briefly touch on to other
things so I want to talk a little bit
about surgery robotic surgery to be
specific there is a company called
visual incision corporation they are
seeking funding on studying how feasible
using this surgery cool robot would be
for hospital so here it is it's not all
that big you'll see it holding a quarter
here so it's very precise and surgeons
can control it got light on it and
everything and what it does is so up
until that blue sort of line they can
actually insert that into a person via a
one single incision and then it can go
in and do things like laparoscopic
surgery which is a really big deal 14
again a healing time which we talked a
lot about with like robot surgery and
things like that like if you the smaller
and less amount of incisions you can
make the easier it is for somebody to
heal from something as important and as
kind of you know really tough on the
body as abdominal cavity surgery like
any kind so they want to check out this
how this robot work in a hospital if it
would save them money and one of the big
reasons why is that they think it would
save money as
it would it's very lightweight it's very
portable it doesn't require being hooked
up to like a big machine and meaning the
surgeons can take it from 10 r to the
next they can just pick it up and carry
it so it's really lightweight is super
easy it's portable you can take it from
10 r to the next without meeting like
either some big machine to help control
it it's very simple to use and they
think that that would actually you know
lower the cost of robotic surgery which
right now is pretty expensive because
you need a lot of equipment to go with
the actual robotic arm so they think
this might help kind of lesson the cost
make it a little easier for hospitals to
sort of either get access that kind of
technology and start using it or and
then maybe pass that on to patients
which would be pretty great it's
adorable it's super great and then the
last thing I wanted to tell you guys
about is this ridiculous auto stroller
this made me laugh this video is
hilarious i highly recommend you go
watch out the sound i guess is pretty
funny it's in it's in german because
it's from volkswagen but they talk about
this one worker at volkswagen who like
says on facebook why don't we have
strollers that break automatically like
why don't we have that and so they made
this great video and it's a concept is a
futuristic stroller that they claim that
has watch it stops like before his oh
god so built-in sense if they claim it
has built-in sensors for an for auto
following people and also get so it
keeps a distance with you and the baby
and then also I avoid collisions by
slowing it down it has brakes but like
proximity sensors that will say oh I'm
close to something I better slow down
and stop this looks crazy yeah what's
insane it's the video is hilarious like
him walking people are like staring I
gonna know I look your strollers moving
and like they can't figure it out
hilarious um so they're saying it has
the same sensors as their golf car does
like the same types of cruise control
like adaptive cruise control sensors I
love this one where the guy's like
playing soccer kicking around the
strollers just following him its
hilarious and now I gotta put a little
copy out on this because obviously this
video came from Volkswagen and we have
seen some pretty fun and impress
of but also very gimmicky publicity
stunts from people like Lexus who did
the hoverboard so I have to kind of take
this with a grain of salt unless we
actually hear that there's enough demand
alike that they're putting it into
production but I also really love the
idea that that is a real thing and
people would go crazy for that people go
nuts for it look at that swing back and
forth it's hilarious like I absolutely
love this video it's a crack up at like
the video it just made me laugh so much
as I like it very cool um so yeah it was
really really fun either way whether
it's a publicity stunt or not regardless
nice work VW on making something that
was entertaining and also just future
minded even if it doesn't ever go into
production which honestly I actually
hope it does because I think a lot of
parents would love that yeah absolutely
gotta be some sort of app feature built
into of course yeah you got your little
app going you do all that stuff would be
great send your baby home beep get out
of here takes off said your baby oh my
love that all right guys we're gonna
take a quick break we'll be right back
with back at our hackett we're gonna
head head up to the International Space
Station for a back under Hackett and
then we will also have your user
feedback your robo-pals while you're
robo-pals from last week and and are
your phone card for the day so don't
click way it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we return my
name is Ashley askia de that's pretty
close to somebody's name that I know
weird uh will explain later but I won't
be here tomorrow um so let's talk about
though right now some crowdfunding stuff
this is becca racket we just got
speakers working in the studio so that
was really intense for us that's what
people here when we say back in our
hackett I'm horrified guys you probably
think you're getting sliced up I'm sorry
alright uh we've talked about space V
are you member space V are they wanted
to make these experiences for cardboard
and oculus rift and they were like oh we
want to show people what it's like like
on an asteroid or like I here and there
in space and stuff yeah well they're
back now so now instead of wanting to
make these experiences they actually
want to send a VR excuse me a VR camera
up to the International Space Station
they want to send a camera have an
astronaut put it together they have the
astronaut would actually have to 3d
print the case nice which is pretty
awesome and then assemble it and and
then they would put it inside this
kitted by the way is called the overview
one they're calling it the overview one
it's this like little cube camera and
thanks to you have to see some VR stuff
this is their Kickstarter video and they
basically are saying that their
Kickstarter this is what they're hoping
you'll see is like you'll be able to see
this sort of view of Earth and all this
great stuff and they want to stick the
camera in the couple of module which has
a very very nice view of Earth and also
the space station itself so you'd be
able to get a really good idea what it's
like to be up in space which is pretty
awesome so this isn't like a
live-streamed type thing you're not like
oh this is what's having a space in now
not right that second but what they want
to do is they want to get that footage
have it sent back and then they would
take that footage stitch it together and
create a VR experience that would be
updated constantly that's so you could
do like once a month I think they were
hoping to have like so you can have like
one month of access to three months of
access things like that so that's what
they want to do that's the module right
there that's the one they want to put
the camera in that same thing with the
little windows so the big panorama
windows there so that's that's it that's
what
that's where they want to put it how big
is that uh the module that little
cameras hello camera um it's not
terribly big it's probably probably
about like six to eight inches like it's
a good size cube but not huge not huge
I'm so names like a very hefty task
seems expensive right seems a little bit
pricey while they're asking for half a
million dollars because obviously it is
very expensive to send anything up to
the ISS I people gear equipment and you
also have the terrible and unfortunate
fear of the rocket exploding like
SpaceX's did so with your stuff on board
you know tell me on this Ashley but they
said this was 500,000 would cover
sending it up there and their operating
costs for one year so and then after
that like obviously they would like
charge for access to the camera so um so
here's how they want to do it the
astronaut with 3d printer case put it
together put the cam in the couple of
module space BR then stitches together
footage and releases it on most VR
devices so the vibe the rift cardboard
all this stuff they like I said want
five hundred thousand dollars they have
22 days left in the campaign they only
have raised about 38,000 yep so it's not
taking off like crazy haha that's our
little hashtag there be an astronaut and
if okay so if you want to back it you
can start at the low levels just like
five bucks ten bucks whatever and you
get their gratitude and maybe a t-shirt
or whatever but if you want access to
the VR content it starts at $75 to back
with three months of access the first
three months of access of footage like
once it the cameras up there and
transmitting so you get three months of
access and that's it then you gotta pay
after that so basically let's say
twenty-five dollars a month for access
no you're not into it okay honey wash me
a long time ago and it's becoming less
and less enticing but it's like a rich
person's like oh I can see space feel
like I know I can't i'm not that
invested it seems educational but the
thing is is it's also again i think
people can create fake versions
of it and we're just really like just as
realistic and you can actually travel
through space that's fair i mean i'll
give you that i think that that's a
really good point you could make a
simulation that would be very
interesting and educational just the
same ok know what do you and we saw the
hackett um you know here here's my but
i'm free cuz you have to pick these back
at our Hackett's out damn then you have
to lie like that like so whatever I pic
I obviously either interested in or find
entertaining enough to talk about I
think it's a good idea I just think that
if their operating costs are half a
million dollars for the first year and
to get it and to get that camera up
there being so expensive like why not I
know that they want to be on the
forefront of it which makes it a lot
more expensive to do so I appreciate
that it's more expensive because they
want to be the first but then I also i'm
like i would rather wait until it was
less expensive to send something up
there you know what I mean yeah like to
me it's it's it's sort of that back and
forth of like I appreciate what they're
trying to do but I don't know that I
would want to back it at this point
because one I don't even know that that
camera is gonna make it up there might
not to if even if it does make it up
there let's say the astronaut puts it
together wrong or it is sitting in a
couple of module and the footage is not
that great like what do you do then you
feel like you didn't get your money's
worth when you could have a simulation
that is beautiful and perfect and has no
issues or problems without having to
have all these risks involved like I say
I say no I say no I say wait so wait for
it to be cheaper to send a camera up in
a space I just thought it would be
interesting to discuss yeah cuz i do get
that its ambitious it's very ambitious
and I and I do appreciate what they want
to do I just man there's a lot of risk
involved there so if you're feeling
risky and you got some money laying
around feel free to back it um but yeah
so for us yeah yeah maybe not all right
guys we got to talk about your robot
friends and by that not us I don't mean
us I mean your actual robo-pals that you
wrote about in user feedback
as I mentioned we asked you guys last
Wednesday or Thursday I don't remember I
never remember anything I had a long
weekend you guys so many things happened
uh we asked you guys use the hashtag TD
robo-pal to tell us it was we were
talking about the now robot who plays
Nintendo Wii U or we get wii tennis and
it was adorable and I looked up how much
and now robot is I forgot how expensive
they were because I was like I want to
get a now robot what are they like a
thousand dollars not look at this 9
grand I'm like I'm never gonna buy a now
well that's why it can play wii cuz it's
like nine thousand dollar robot so you
guys wrote in and beautifully responded
in so many ways to what you would do
with a robot sidekick Dave rodent said
hi kids here's my contribution to the
chiddy robo-pal discussion the comics
bot cool comics bot keeps your comics
collection organized plus you can take
it out in the field to help find new
comics you can also converse with it
about comics it can access comic book
databases companies libraries and other
sources so it's always right coming soon
to Kickstarter like as a joke man I am
actually scared of comics pot because
like I really thought oh man really like
Captain America did like bubble and then
I'd be like incorrect that is not right
issue 5 page 3 it was just like all
right easy comics but anyway you must
learn the truth yeah your facts are
indirect get your greasy mitts off that
comic it's just like he's like me like
he's in my mind he's mean I'm sorry
don't take them out of the bag yeah he
kill except it doesn't let you have any
don't lie you tell my comics I cannot
trust humans to touch comic books Justin
wrote in and said a robot he'll scratch
my back because I'm having a hard time
reaching those entry points that I can't
ask my friend do it a ride that's smart
that's really smart uh Matthew wrote and
said my Robo sidekick will make me a
robot suit like Tony Stark's which will
prep me for explorations in our universe
so a space a space resistant suit he
could live up in space I'll be good and
then lastly Dustin wrote and said I want
robo-pal to play games with help me help
me try help me track my progress and
offer tips on how I can improve myself
so he wants a rowboat pal to play games
with and then also be like a like a life
coat that's the most noble one of all of
them the good one yeah you just want to
be a better person
no one's faulty I'm sure the robot comic
robot would destroy that guy though if
they were in a battle mmhmm yeah not
great I am Superman I learned this
technique and Justice League number
seven like I would oh I'd be scared I
know I'm scared of comics lot thanks a
lot hey jerk all right guys let's
talk about our last piece to user
feedback time for our photog refer the
day our dear dear viewer Jeremy Rodin
and he sent this wonderful photo and he
says this photo was taken at the end of
my six our hiking trip to wedge mount
lake amira Whistler British Columbia
Canada this picture was taken by my LG
g3 love the show enjoy the picture guys
smiley face definitely looks like one of
those computer backgrounds wallpapers
not real you didn't hike six miles for
that you found that in a wallpaper
gallery that's beautiful and it is
really amazing ah that's what have you
heard of Whistler Whistler BC mm-hmm so
apparently this is like a really big
sort of it's almost like mammoths for us

been but I've heard about it I've heard
of it I have heard of Whistler I know
where it is but I've never been so there
you go it's a small small fun fact for
you Whistler fans out there there's so

briefly about something and she had a
SpaceX like developer shirt on I'm just
like question yeah but it was a casual
conversation and I but but she won't be
here tomorrow so know who's gonna be
here tomorrow ah Hana her name is cyber
Nova you'll know her cyber Nova on
YouTube Fanta yeah she's a she's just
like specializes in space space stuff
like I try and get some space stories in
here tomorrow excellent guest so she'll
be here tomorrow in my stead taking
taking my spot but kale will be here to
drive the bus and producer Logan will be
here to run pump the brakes if things
get out of control which they might
never know there can be tornado pump
those brakes Logan don't pump the brakes
I butt into where so that's it you won't
find us on social media I'm at Ashley's
