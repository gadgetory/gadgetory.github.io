google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show each week
Mobile World Congress is in full effect
and the announcements are putting CES to
shame with products that people actually
want to purchase right now now Samsung
finally revealed the new Galaxy s5
packing a slightly larger 5.1 inch
screen with the same resolution and an
extremely familiar design that will
remain a plastic body and a new
perforated backing with colors that a
Samsung calls glam probably not the
first word you want to hear when a
company describes their phone glam now
the s5 brings new technology like the
fingerprint scanner we talked about to
unlock your phone but it's also plugged
into paypal for mobile payments its
water resistant and dust resistant but
you don't want to put this phone
underwater there's a slightly cleaned up
interface but nothing earth-shaking and
they also touted it as the first phone
to bring a heart rate sensor on a phone
see all you have to do is just touch
your finger on that area that looks like
a flash but it's not it's a heart sensor
and we know everyone is going to want
that well the bigger problem Samsung
didn't even give us a compelling reason
for why it might be important they just
said it's an industry-first come on some
now my reaction to the galaxy faithful
users will be happy with the new
improvements we are floored by the
announcement but it's the same story
with smartphones it's a mature market
and it's harder and harder to wow anyone
now Samsung also updated their
SmartWatch lineup with the gear 2 and
gear neo lineup just five months after
its initial launch the watch will
feature a slightly streamline design the
camera placement is on the face and not
awkwardly placed on the side for perv
shots it includes a heart rate sensor it
also has four gigs of storage to play
music natively on the device but the
biggest improvement is that their entire
wearable line is running on Samsung's
own Tizen operating system and not
Android so it requires less power and
early claims expect two to three days of
battery life still the UI and os aren't
wowing us visually but they will work
with 17 galaxy devices when they
launched in April the original Galaxy
gear only
worked with a note 3 on launch now the
product I was excited the most about was
the Samsung gear fit with a truly new
design and form factor Samsung is
positioning this as their fitness band
but I think it's a huge miss for a
company that should have made this their
next-gen SmartWatch now my sources close
to the project pitch the finalized
design as a SmartWatch with its own UI
but Samsung corporate decided this would
be their fitness device instead and put
Tizen on it even if it only works
horizontally and not vertically the way
you would actually you know look at your
wristband or watch comfortably now it
has a one-of-a-kind look it does
everything the gear to can with heart
rate sensors and displays alerts from
your phone with a 32 Ford a battery life
you guys they absolutely missed it here
people weren't impressed with the first
Galaxy gear the gear 2 is an improvement
but there's no buzz around it and this
was a chance for samsung to make this a
flagship product instead of just a
fitness wristband come on son now all of
these products will be available on
april eleventh in a 150 different
countries but we want to know what you
thought of Samsung's product
announcements let us know at Google
ishes at cnet com and will read a few of
your responses next week now there have
also been plenty of other surprises at
Mobile World Congress like Sony's
waterproof and 4k capturing Xperia z2 or
Huawei's talk band that's a fitness band
with a Bluetooth speaker that you can
take out of the band and then use it as
a Bluetooth headset or even the geeks
phone black phone with a focus on user
security and privacy so all you guys got
to do is just make sure to check out
seeing that special coverage for all
things Mobile World Congress and more on
our website at cnet com now also there's
plenty of google news this week the
SmartWatch battles are just heating up
and a new cnet report says Google is set
to unveil its plans for a SmartWatch
centric operating system in March most
likely over a blog post with the actual
SmartWatch making its debut at Google
i/o in June LG is the manufacturing
partner for the hardware while the googs
will handle the software aspect of the
product pinning its SmartWatch OS on its
google now voice assistant and this
platform is really perfectly suited to
be adapted to a smartphone this will be
Google's second wearable product in the
market if it all comes
together and outside of the iWatch
Google's watch products is really the
only one I'm curious about now according
to website recode Amazon's long-rumored
Roku like set-top box is rumored to be
launching next month with the company
aiming for a March rollout they report
the box will be powered by Google's
Android providing access to amazon
instant video service and Amazon's own
music catalog while other rumors also
say it will double as a gaming console
now it sounds ambitious but we know 2014
looks to be the year of the video
streaming set-top boxes as well so we'll
see what they can do with it to really
make this compelling when people already
have an Apple TV or Roku or even both
what will make me want to buy this one
also the big google machine has recently
announced project tango and it's an
experimental effort to have an android
phone equipped with a variety of sensors
for advanced motion and space tracking
in hopes that it can be used to scan
real 3d environments using your phone
now their internal video shows how it
could be used to open new opportunities
for developers for indoor navigation or
even gaming experiences and this is just
another one of those out-of-the-box
thinking projects that gets us all
excited with the work Google is doing
behind the scenes now the prototype
phone includes a 4 megapixel camera to
computer vision processors integrated
depth sensors and a motion tracking
camera pretty much everything I'd want
in a woman now the practice is being led
by the advanced technology and projects
group it's the same team behind project
ara and the part of Motorola that wasn't
sold to Lenovo that Google kept for
themselves alright guys that's going to
do it for this week's show again we want
to hear from you about Samsung's
announcements so email me at Google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong thanks so much for watching I'm
Brian Tommy we'll see you guys next week
for some more of that Google Isha's
