at Aoife 2013 Sony made a big splash the
introduction of this it's the sony
cyber-shot qx10 camera designed as a
smartphone accessory now just to be
clear this is a complete camera tucked
into its lens shaped body and in no way
uses the camera built into your
smartphone it has its own sensor
processor battery storage and a 10x zoom
lens it even has a zoom lever and
shutter release what it doesn't have is
a screen and that's where your iOS or
Android device comes in by creating a
direct Wi-Fi connection between the two
you get a viewfinder and camera controls
on your device for Android devices with
NFC you don't even have to turn the
camera on to initiate the Wi-Fi
connection you just touch them together
once they're connected you've got
yourself a viewfinder and controls and
you can use the included spring clip to
attach the camera to your phone
connecting it with an iOS device takes a
bit more effort since you have to put in
a Wi-Fi password but regardless of how
easy it is to set up using the camera
isn't a great experience there always
seems to be some lag between the camera
and your device it eats your phone's
battery life since you're constantly
using your screen and Wi-Fi all the same
time and because of the nature of the
connection you can't just shut off the
camera or exit the app without needing
to pair the two again also the camera
itself doesn't do nearly as much as one
of Sony's regular Wi-Fi enabled cyber
shots and although the design certainly
inspires creative positioning again it's
nothing you can't do with Sony's other
Wi-Fi cameras in the end it doesn't
really solve a problem you still end up
carrying around a second device but if
you're looking for something different
in a point-and-shoot camera this is it
I'm Josh Goldman and
look at Sony cyber-shot qx10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
