chill out with your music without
annoying external sound intruding on
your listening pleasure but how does
noise canceling technology work to begin
with all headphones cancel out noise to
some degree but when we talk about noise
cancelling headphones we usually mean
active noise canceling which
electronically removes the sound of your
surroundings here's how it works
all sound is transmitted in waves
described in terms of amplitude
wavelength and frequency noise
cancelling headphones effectively arrays
external sounds by using a microphone
hidden in the headphones that listens to
surrounding noise then generates a sound
wave that's out of phase which means it
has the opposite shape and feeds that
into your ears the two waves cancel out
in a process called destructive
interference which sees the wave
generated by the headphones effectively
acting as a sound eraser resulting in
you hearing less of the outside world
this sound erasing tech can also be
found in some cars and it's been
suggested it could one day keep the
inside of your house quiet
although the tech has been around for a
while now however you'll still most
likely to come across active noise
cancellation in headphones these
high-tech headphones aren't perfect they
don't eliminate all noise and some
people complain that they can hear the
hiss of the noise canceling tech which
is annoying in itself you also need to
find some way of powering that extra
technology so many noise cancelling
headphones require batteries still if
you travel a lot on planes or trains
this clever sound erasing technology
could make for a happier more relaxed
audio experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
