crowded us laptop market I'm Dan
Ackerman this is the LG gram 14 that's
right the same LG that makes televisions
at refrigerators and other home
appliances in other territories around
the world they also sell computers I not
here in the US until now this is one of
the first computers LG is gonna sell in
America they have one 13 inch model 2 14
inch models this is one of the 14s and
it's called the LG gram 14 because it
only weighs 980 grams that's about 2.1
pounds they point out that as a 14th
laptop it weighs less than the 13-inch
MacBook Air and of course less than a
lot of other laptops it certainly does
feel very thin and light it's made of
magnesium and lithium and carbon and
various alloys the design certainly
looks very macbook like or even like
some the samsung's laptops that also try
to look like MacBooks
you get some high-end components here
Intel Core i7 processor big 256 gig SSD
eight gigs of RAM a very nice looking a
1920 by 1080 IPS display that means if
you turn it to the side it's not gonna
fade out a little bit glossy it's not a
touchscreen however that's something
we're seeing in some premium laptops
these days people moving away from touch
screens in return for cutting some
weight and bringing you some other
features instead so it looks and feels a
lot like other premium 13 to 14 inch
laptops out there
I think the LG wins some points are
being as light as it is and having kind
of a different look they they call this
champagne gold this sort of a almost
gold iPhone s color you don't see that
that often in laptops otherwise they're
entering a very crowded market and we're
gonna have to see how they compete
that's the LG Graham 14
