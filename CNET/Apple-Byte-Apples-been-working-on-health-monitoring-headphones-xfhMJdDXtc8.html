the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple plus a special
giveaway so let's get to the show and
it's not the biggest news week with a
few updates on all the latest rumor
products but a report from the china x
claims that taiwan-based touch panel
manufacturer tpk will be making flexible
displays for the iWatch with mass
production expected in the second half
of the year the report says the iWatch
will come with a flexible AMOLED display
and 3d protective glass and will use
silver nanowire touchscreen technology
that's developed by tpk now they aren't
the most reputable source but that's the
latest in the iWatch world more reports
continue to piggyback on the belief that
will see two different sized iPhones but
the latest from taiwan's economic daily
news claims that only the larger of the
two iphones will use the sapphire glass
and the rumored smaller but still larger
than the original iphone that 4.7 inch
model will continue to use corning's
gorilla glass like the iphone 5s and 5c
then the economic Daily News decided to
get a little cray cray and claims that
Apple will not name the larger 5.5 inch
plus device and iPhone because Apple is
treating it like an experimental project
and will not use the iPhone name now
that makes me lean towards them naming
it the iPad Mini Mini but come on I
doubt they have any idea about the way
app will be marketing these rumored
devices also a report from fud Zilla
says Apple will still stick to keeping
their next a series processor and
Qualcomm's LTE chips separate for the
next round of iOS devices integrating
the two typically helps optimize battery
life but it looks like that will be
another generation away KGI securities
also released a report that indicates
Apple will keep most of their products
with the same processor except for the
next iPhone which historically has taken
the lead when it comes to new processors
in their product line now no surprise
there and the rumored full-size iPad
would also be a candidate for a new a8
chip and more news about the Apple TV
AppleInsider has done some digging and
has found that Apple has posted several
new positions for the Apple TV team
related to expanding content on its
set-top box new positions for an apple
TV content part
her engineer and an apple TV software QA
engineer showed both roles hint at
expanded third-party support and we've
already talked about reports pointing to
a new Apple TV possibly by April this
year all right it's always cool to check
out some of the patents Apple has been
working on in recently they've been
granted what's described as a sports
monitoring system for headphones earbuds
and headsets now the key to this
invention would be sensors embedded into
one or more areas of the headset or
earbuds by coming into contact with your
skin the sensors would potentially be
able to measure your heart rate
temperature perspiration and other
physical stats it's basically a health
monitoring system for headsets it looks
really cool but unfortunately they won't
be able to use the name heart beats by
dre all right onto the quick bites
Apple's bringing the itunes festival to
America for the first time at South by
Southwest Coldplay imagine dragons and
pitbull will be some of the future
performers but no word if Elvis will be
performing does the Fox say okay I'm
done and a cool story from seen its own
daniel Terdiman where the TV show
diggers found the time capsule from the
aspen international design conference in
1983 now at the conference jobs gave a
talk and predicted things like the ipad
wireless networking and even the App
Store long before they became a reality
now the time capsule included the Lisa
Mouse Steve Jobs used it during his talk
along with other miscellaneous items
that were thrown in it and it was dubbed
the Steve Jobs time capsule so check out
this clip so I look in the tube there's
a little plastic bag in there I retune I
grabbed it
look I mean I kind of let go of it cuz I
I panicked like it was like a hot stove
now the time capsule had a strong moldy
stench but even Steve knew that that
thing would be priceless and put it in a
baggie he's smart now if you want to
watch the entire episode it will air on
februari the 25th on the national
geographic channel all right we've got
another amazing giveaway for you from
our friends at JBL this is the hottest
bluetooth speaker out there right now

because it's super colorful the sound
quality is great for speaker this size

rainbow the club or the chill is
seriously legit and you can even impress
girls with it by just telling them it's
magic wow that is so cool how does it
work ladies it's magic
