that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc alphabet owns lots of
companies like loon X and of course
Google I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar and
you are the fantabulous audience today
we're talking about way moe charging for
rides new androids your comments and
more but first up Samsung's plans to
galaxy gateway okay let's focus on the
future Bloomberg has a detailed report
on Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S 10
similar to other reports Bloomberg says
Samsung is working on three Galaxy S 10
models the Galaxy S 10 would have an
OLED screen with an N screen fingerprint
sensor there would be nearly no bezel on
the top and bottom of the phone
Bloomberg says the front camera is quote
visible and tucked under the screen end
quote
that's an interesting wording to
describe the front-facing camera no
mention of a notch it suggests Samsung
may have a hole in the display take a
look at these images of what leaker ice
universe says our renders of Samsung's a
8 maybe that's what the S 10 will have
two on the back there should be three
cameras let's talk about the other
models Bloomberg says Samsung is working
with Verizon on a 5g version a low-end
model would ditch the curb screen for a
flat display this model may or may not
have an N screen fingerprint sensor all
of that sounds very interesting the
worst bit of news in the report is
Samsung messing around with a prototype
S 10 that kills off the headphone jack
as I know that Samsung obeys everything
I say Samsung don't do it of course
there is even more Samsung news the same
report has lots of info about Samsung's
foldable phone apparently its codename
is winner that's quite the name plenty
of pressure there obviously we don't
have any images of winner but we do have
this promo video from Samsung watch that
while I Yammer on Bloomberg says there
are two styles that Samsung is tinkering
with one is longer horizontally the
other is longer vertically the one with
the longer vertical display is currently
winning out with developers and
designers winner would open up like a
flip phone the
folder display uses a film which may not
be as glossy as other displays in
testing the phone survived being folded
more than 200,000 times if and when the
folding screen cracks it quote shatters
like dried paper end quote
whatever that means when folded shut
there's a 4-inch display that is usable
for apps Samsung is also working with
Google on a customized version of
Android for the phone what does this
thing weigh over 200 grams that's around
the same weight as the Galaxy Note 9
it's over 40 grams heavier than the
Galaxy S 9 to keep winter light the
battery size might have to be reduced
Samsung don't do it all so technical
issues won't allow winner to have an N
screen fingerprint sensor we could see
the flexi phone at least a concept
drawing as soon as Samsung's developer
conference in November onwards to
Android Avenue the one plus 60 is
official it's got top-tier specs without
a top-tier price the 60 ranges from
around $550 to 630 dollars the base
model has 128 gigabytes of storage with
six gigabytes of RAM him take that pixel
three the mid-range 60 at 580 dollars
has the same storage but eight gigabytes
of RAM
if you max out everything you get 256
gigs of storage with 8 gigabytes of RAM
all 16 models run to the latest version
of Android they all carry a snapdragon
845 processor inside they all have an N
screen fingerprint sensor that worked
pretty well CNET's Lin law said it would
be nice if the sensor worked faster and
took up a larger area on the 60 all 16
models ditched the headphone jack as was
previously announced but there is a USBC
dongle included enjoy that prelim
battery test show the 60 could survive
around 16 hours when continuously
playing back video while on airplane
mode oh and the 60 will be available at
t-mobile in the US let's switch gears to
another phone the reviews for Reds
hydrogen one phone or out a lot of sites
are saying the same thing about us
holographic screen yep there's a 3d
effect like a Nintendo 3ds
but it's not great keep in mind that the
footage you're seeing right now does not
exactly match what you would see in real
life the hydrogen one can also shoot
video and photos with a 3d effect the
problem is sharing that content isn't
easy
unless you're sending those pics or
Vince to another person with a red phone
let's go to way mo away there's a new
report from the Financial Times that
says way moe is planning to charge
customers for rights as you know way Moe
is running tests in a number of markets
it's early writer program allows people
to be shuttled in the company's
self-driving cars during an investor's
call the CFO of way Moe said the company
is looking into commercialization of the
trial program
apparently some customers are already
paying for rights way most CEO told CNN
Roadshow that the company could charge
for rides for perhaps getting your
destination to foot the bill as a form
of advertising I look forward to the
self-driving future best of luck to
every company that's working on this
project on to Uptown updates the fine
folks over at xda-developers found
evidence that Google could be working on
a subscription service for Google Play
one developer was messing with the Play
Store app and found code mentioning
something called play pass combine that
with a survey sent by Google that said
the following
imagine your App Store has a
subscription that offers hundreds of
dollars worth of apps and games for a
monthly fee how well does pass describe
this service hmm what could that mean
we'll all find out together on to
comment cove this is the part of the
show where we shine a spotlight on the
most amazing audience in the world you
guys last week we mentioned the issues
plaguing the pixel pictures not saving
problems with apps not loading correctly
etc Daniel says I have all the problems
with my pixel 2xl don't buy those phones
stay away can BAM says I love my pixel 3
I haven't had any problems so far hater
says does the Google Home Hub include an
internal hub like the one in Amazon's
echo plus as in Smart Home Hub it's a
great question
let's ask an expert take it away Andrew
get part in short no it doesn't have a
ZigBee
z-wave radio the amazonica plus does
have ZigBee so the Google Home Hub isn't
a hub in the sense of like a smartthings
hub in that it's bridging your small
sensors to the cloud it's more of a hub
like a control center but it does have
bluetooth so right now if you have
certain GE smart bulbs you can set them
up using the Google home hub but that's
it thanks to everyone for writing in
this week over 250 comments and yes I
still read every single one of them if
you've enjoyed your stay in Alphabet
City please like and subscribe I my as
actor and I'll see you online
one more bit of news if you've got a
Roku Google assistant support is rolling
