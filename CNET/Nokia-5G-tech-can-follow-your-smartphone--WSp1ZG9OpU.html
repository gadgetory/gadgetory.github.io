all demanding and we all want faster
mobile data and one of the technologies
hopes to bring that to light is five
genes in practical terms
how is 5g going to actually get to your
phone while you're moving around Nokia
are showing off some technology here at
Mobile Congress in Barcelona that it
hopes could one day do just that so one
of the challenges if you want to send
loads and those are data is that you
need a lot of bandwidth to do it and
that might require finding frequency
bands that aren't currently in use today
now what nokia is talking about today is
a 70 gigahertz band and while that gives
you loads of bandwidth to play with the
problem is when the bandwidth gets
higher the waves don't actually travel
as far now Nokia's solution that is to
use a dielectric lens antenna which
squashes that beam down to something
that's much more focused and you get a
beam that travels a lot further as a
result so the next trick is to get that
focus beam to actually stay on you so
you can keep getting 5g even when you're
for example moving around town
so what Nokia's demo here shows is a
device that's moving across this room
and the base station over there as
illustrated by those little red lights
shows how the signal is tracking to that
device as it's moving so the result is
that you can get five GT or smartphone
Nokia says if you're a hundred and
twenty meters away 95% of people should
get speeds of one gigabit per second so
this narrow beam technology does face
some obstacles and I really mean
obstacles things like houses cars walls
corners these are things that those
narrow beams are going to really
struggle to cope with Nokia suggests
that a potential workaround for that
could be that if that beam losses you
your 5g signal could fall back onto more
established technology although you
could experience a speed drop in that
situation so 5g is still years away
Nokia is committing to the date 2020 but
it's really cool to see some actual
practical applications for how 5g could
work I'm Lou estrosi net and check out
