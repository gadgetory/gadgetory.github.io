appliances here with the Eugen robot I
Cleve Ord I cleveo stands for
intelligent cleaning robots now to some
extent that's true this $500 robot
vacuum has a lot of special features for
the price a lot of robot vacuums we've
tested have pretty basic functionality
they have you know a spot cleaning mode
and a regular cleaning mode and that's
about it
instead this robot vacuum goes way
beyond that they have a max cleaning
mode a regular mode a mop mode all kinds
of special features and that makes it
really cool also in terms of features it
has two side brushes which is more than
neato bot bag or AI robots Roomba brand
but I really think that the mop feature
stands out the most it's really a robot
vacuum but it has the special feature
that a lot of robot vacuums don't you
can use this microfiber cloth dry for
dusting the floor or you can wet it and
use it kind of as a mop unfortunately it
doesn't have a water reservoir so it's
not a full-fledged mop but it can get
kind of basic maintenance with all those
features I had some pretty high
expectations for this robot vacuum
unfortunately it didn't do very well in
our performance tests it actually scored
the lowest in two out of the three
categories we tested it did better than
the infinite Ahava 5/10 on pet hair but
that's just because the 510 wasn't able
to pick up any pet hair as far as its
mop capabilities it did okay we tend to
push it to the limits a little bit so I
spilled a good bit of coffee for the wet
test and it sort of just spread it
around the room and got really a sticky
coating of coffee and creamer
on the floor for the dry mop test I
spread a bunch of cornstarch around and
it kind of just pushed it to the corners
I also wet the microfiber cloth and I
did a little bit better but this is
really best for low maintenance if the
floor looks clean but just needs a
little bit of tidying up this would
probably do an okay job it's actually
pretty similar in terms of features to
the manual Rytas h 67 pro we'll be
testing that next week so stay tuned for
our review so overall I wouldn't really
recommend this robot vacuum even though
it has a
one of great features thanks for
