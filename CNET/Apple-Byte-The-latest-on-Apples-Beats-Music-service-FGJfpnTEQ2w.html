guess who's here the San Leandro high
school computer science class everybody
this is Brian Tom whoa yeah right yeah
I'm your biggest fan of political
gnome-like I've seen every single part
that you've done every Google issues
yeah that's like that's you're rubbing
my hand weird that's got a weird
put your hands are so soft okay um
Marlo's yeah I'll see you over there in
the rooms I'll I'll catch you later okay
min yeah I love you
what's going on Brian Tong here and
welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and yes there will be a bad apple onto
the show and the latest from French
website
ijen claims an apple event will take
place in the last week of February
Apple is expected to showcase the Apple
watch with a few more apps and features
but also the new 12 inch MacBook Air
rumored to debut in March so a February
announcement would make sense with that
timeline rumored features include a
fanless design with a revamped trackpad
and it may be the first Apple device to
take advantage of the new reversible USB
type-c connector but again this is all
speculation right now alright a lot of
you have been asking what's going on
with Apple's beats music service and the
latest from 9 to 5 Mac details aspects
of the new upcoming service you'll still
have to pay but Apple will reportedly be
taking over the look and feel given it
that Apple design aesthetic
while Beats technologies and music
content will be deeply integrated into
iOS iTunes and Apple TV the report also
says that Apple is settled on a price of
$7.99 per month that would make it
cheaper than the $9.99 plans from
Spotify RDO Rhapsody and Google but
still more expensive than Pandora's
$4.99 ad-free plans Apple plan to
announce the streaming service as early
as March but it looks like June is a
more realistic target at the Worldwide
Developers Conference all right recode
has confirmed that frenemy Samsung will
be responsible for manufacturing the a9
chip for Apple's next gen iPhone and
iPad Samsung has seen its profits to
Windell the past few quarters in its
mobile division thanks primarily to
Apple and others but it's semiconductor
business has also helped balance out
those losses the a9 processor has been
expected to be packed inside the rumored
iPad pro set to release sometime this
year as well
bTW our sources say Apple won't be
releasing iOS 8.2 until March it's
already out for developers in beta
format and the biggest difference is
built-in support for the Apple watch now
multiple reports claim Apple has asked
some of their high profile developers
working on Apple watch apps to have them
ready by mid-february most likely so
they can
how much battery life these third-party
apps actually use over time alright we
know the luxurious Apple watch Edition
will be going for a pretty penny and
there's still been no word on pricing
for their 18 karat gold timepiece but
Apple is reportedly planning specific
features to their stores to accommodate
the gold watches 9 to 5 Mac reports they
will be acting more like jewelry stores
by outfitting their retail spots with
safes in the back that will be custom
designed with MagSafe chargers
that will not only hold units for sale
but demo units that will be on the floor
for charging overnight Apple's plan is
to have customers try on the watches in
store with all the different band
options and some locations have already
begun installing the safes ahead of its
April release also Apple is working on
special weight scales if people return
the gold Apple watch additions to make
sure no gold has been removed prior to
replacement or returning them so you
won't be able to spray-paint that Apple
watch sport a gold color because I know
you people are out there now in things
to seed there have been multiple reports
of a mystery band equipped with an
apparatus on top with multiple cameras
but is not from Google it's a minivan
leased by Apple one theory could be
Apple is possibly working on their own
mapping project since the Apple van is
equipped with 12 cameras on top where
Google Street View cars use a total of
15 and filming for Sony's Steve Jobs
movie is underway and here's the first
peek at michael fassbender as SJ and
seth rogen as woz from the daily mail
from their recent shoot at Cupertino
splint center now Fox Bender looks
nothing like Steve and Seth Rogen has a
slightly more believable waz look but it
still isn't close the only encouraging
thing is that Aaron Sorkin is behind
this so I will hold my judgment for now
and the Steve Jobs biopic is set to hit
theaters on October the 9th and yes
there is a bad apple we need to address
see on last week's show many of you
pointed out that we use dollar signs in
correctly when revealing the number of
iPhones Macs and iPads sold so I wanted
to handle this internally and make sure
it won't happen again
Mitchell Mitchell Chang can you get over
here get over here all right now me too
the producer of the show he did all the
editing and Mitch do you have anything
to say anything I'm sorry for putting
dollar signs on units and and it won't
happen again that's right it won't all
right well thank you Mitch I appreciate
that but you know what you're still
getting a bad apple so eat it eat it eat
it
Oh costume Oh get out of my face
see we hold people accountable here all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show and before we go I wanted to send
out a special thanks to mr. Burke and
all of the students over at San Leandro
High School's computer class so maybe I
should hold it the right way that came
out to visit at CNET studios all right
guys you can always email me at the
Apple vidas cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong and I'll respond when I'm
getting my eyebrows threaded thanks for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple so then I
told her that's not guacamole and then
it was like up and down like a roller
coaster so then she told me it's you not
me all right so then the next movie do
is you go from here to here from here to
here it's still if you got that okay all
right um next question
hey Kevin what's up hey Brian I've got a
question so I've been working on this
Java program right it's just a simple
calculator not really too much to it
well you know how one plus one is
supposed to be two and two plus two is
supposed to be four and five times seven
is supposed to be 35 well when I
actually go to test the Java program one
plus one turns out to be seven and two
plus two turns out to be 35 and some
times five is 105 and when I run the
methods nothing's working it
I don't know Wow Wow Hey huh right huh
right yeah
he's done he's done with this question
okay so yeah as I was saying you know
life is like like flappy bird right you
have these these ups and these downs and
sometimes you don't know where to go and
it's just up to you to just just keep on
tapping you know keep on pushing through
life
tap tap tap a wait and follow your
dreams and you know you'll you'll get
there any other questions
it's tubes an idiot my grandma knows
more than he does and she's from the
thirties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
