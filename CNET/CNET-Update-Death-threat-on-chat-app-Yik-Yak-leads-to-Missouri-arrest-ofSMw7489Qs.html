anonymous on Yik yak I am Bridget Carey
this is your C net update the so called
anonymous social media app Yik yak II is
in the news again surrounded by
controversy over people using it to do
awful things
Yik yak is an app where you can keep
your identity a secret from other users
and you can see everything written by
people near your general location you
can think of it as a local message board
where you don't know the names of who is
posting on Tuesday students at the
University of Missouri noticed hateful
racist threats of violence against black
students and faculty posted on Yik yak
warning people to not go to campus if
you've been following the news you know
that this adds to the racial tensions on
campus where students and faculty are
protesting how the school is dealing
with racism well guess what the
university police arrested the suspect
who posted those threats to yek yek yek
yek works with the local authorities to
track down people who do such things and
violate the rules what you do online is
not anonymous just because an app
advertises as such and this is an
ongoing problem with yay gak with morons
who think they won't be found there were
four mass shooting threats made on Yik
yak at four different universities in
the past 30 days and you can find
multiple reports of similar threats and
hateful posts at school campuses going
back to last year Yik yak is also just a
breeding ground for cyber bullying and
mean gossip when no one's names are
published and every time I open it up
I'm looking at the worst of the Internet
I couldn't even show you the feed from
my own phone's app because it was too
nasty I would have to just blur out the
whole screen it's just garbage
well let's move on to another social
media app making news and I do mean
making news Facebook is diving deeper
into the news business with an app
called notify the notify app sends you
news alerts from a variety of different
publications you pick the topics you're
interested in like tech or sports or you
can get specialized reports from just
one publication such as the daily
morning forecast from The Weather
Channel or sports score reports from
your favorite team and if you tap into
the notification it'll take you to the
full article or video it's right
now only four iphone users in the US the
benefit is that you can get lots of news
alerts without having to download the
app for each of these separate news
outlets Facebook getting into news
shouldn't surprise you every social
media app these days wants to be a news
hub just look at snapchat discover
Twitter moments and apples news app but
Facebook's biggest challenge will be to
get people to care to download it
Facebook has many other apps that have
struggled like paper riff moments
slingshot and rooms to name a few
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more escena comm from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
