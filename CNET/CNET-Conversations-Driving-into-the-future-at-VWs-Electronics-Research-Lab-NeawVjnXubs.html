iron but today that or is increasingly
different it's software now wireless
displays but what odds do car makers
stand in a game that wilts even
legendary electronics companies I'm
Brian Cooley and in this episode of seen
that conversations we take you two
Volkswagens Electronics research lab in
Silicon Valley and there the heat is on
lab director Peter ill and his team to
come up with innovations that they think
could make their company the number-one
automaker by 2018
Peter research here involves what what
kind of technology are you putting in
cars at a place like this yeah via the
electronics research lab we deal with
infotainment systems driver assistance
systems with the you machine interface
driver distraction is a big issue we
also do a lot of software development
work for our products so basically you
get to work on all the stuff that is
really hot button in cars these days
yeah it's definitely true software's one
of the big topics at the moment
especially in the entertainment area we
have to deal with lots of intelligence
of the components in the car and the
Silicon Valley is definitely a place
where innovations in that field happen
this is attractive Peter what have you
done to me you put an eye tracker on you
on your head so this is watching my eyes
this is what you're watching your eye
and this camera is facing forward to see
where you looking to what's is going to
measure this measures visual distraction
one of the things we can measure with
this simulator and can measure
everything else too but visual
distraction is one of the key topics
while driving to make fiving safe this
is gonna figure out where I looked when
I shouldn't have been looking too often
in that direction correct all right so
put this guy in drive and start driving
okay
but I didn't pick up my smartphone or
any point which a lot of folks would do
yeah how do you get people to put this
down and look here how do you make this
head unit tastier than the phone that
I'm more familiar with because I use it
all the time this is kind of the big
part you have to make that the
infotainment system in a way that it's
attractive and that you would like to
use it visually and on the other side we
have to make it in the way that it's
safe while driving all right Peter now
here's a heat map that comes out of that
simulator what am I looking at yeah
actually you can see the red and yellow
and green areas the mall rat you see the
morph new looked at this area okay so
you can see the view it's mainly out of
this is good this is good there's a
couple of dedicated areas focus areas on
the infotainment system yeah farewell
time was spent here here here over and
over most car makers agree now they
can't roll their own on every experience
consumers want familiar services they
already use out of the car to follow
them into the car so we're zooming in
here I'm in the Google Earth and then
when I get beyond the 50-yard resolution
that I see here throw your own 30 yard
and then look at that now that's not
that's not something I've seen before
that street view and if I go to this pad
I can scroll around my position just
like I can if I'm sitting at a pc
browser tech companies like Google have
updates cycles measured in months at
most car makers in years how do those
two industries ever mesh their gears the
main goal is to have a modular system
because that's what the smart phone
companies do they do not release and
completely new develop smartphone every
half year so they all have their modules
and they combine them you package them
new together we have the same system
below the same operating system or the
same hardware and it's only packaged new
added some new functionality to that
here's a small example of how automakers
move at a pace more like electronics
using technologies like this 3d printer
to rapid prototype ideas today not next
week
let me show you something now that 3d
printer that we have here in the ERL
made this whole this isn't like that
thousand-dollar 3d printer you've got at
home that's real cool but this machine
was made ready to go this wasn't
assembled later same goes for this chain
it came out this way that's amazing what
we've seen here today is progressive and
new but it's no longer niche or odd this
is the car making game today the
technology you've seen here it's the
last bastion in our digital lives where
there's a wall left to be broken down so
our behaviors can flow across all the
places where we live in car and outs
