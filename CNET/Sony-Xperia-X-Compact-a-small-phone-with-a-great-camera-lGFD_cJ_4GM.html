things lighter and smaller for example
this car
the downside of making something smaller
is you give up a lot like this car you
give up space and dignity or this candy
you get a lot less candy but there are
some things that are smaller that you're
not giving a lot of things up for like
this the sony xperia x compact it's a
small phone with a lot of features the X
compact is a four point six inch display
which is undoubtedly small but the
chunky body and big bezels make it only
a little shorter than an iPhone 7 so
it's smallish as far as the design you
either love or hate is blocky plastic
good works the X compact 720 pixel
display is bright sharp and does well in
sunlight it also has a solid battery
life an hour test it lasted 11 hours and
28 minutes the X compact runs android
6.0.1 and has a PlayStation app which
works with your ps4 the most standout
feature is the 23 megapixel camera with
a 24 millimeter lens this camera can
shoot landscapes street scenes and tight
spots like this car
there's a lot of tech inside the camera
five axis stabilization predictive
autofocus and an infrared sensor for
white balanced images taken with the X
compact have a lot of detail and nice
natural color giving all these features
into a small blocky body comes with a
couple trade-offs the processor is
serviceable for light gaming the phone
handled well but when editing a photo or
taking a picture in a low light I
noticed some lag the US version lacked a
fingerprint sensor don't know why and
with all the amazing things the camera
does it does not shoot 4k video also the
X compact is not water or dust resistant
so if you're jonesing for a small phone
with an excellent camera the sony xperia
x compact is worth a look but if you
value things like a fingerprint sensor
4k video or waterproofing you should
look elsewhere
