little too much like the cars that
clowns drive in a circus until now let's
drive the 2012 Fiat 500 Abarth and check
the tech hey Bart that's not an acronym
it's a guys named Carlo Abarth the
famous Austrian masochist who devoted
much of his life to making Fiats go fast
we've got seven teens on here but 16s
that look like that or stock I'd pass on
the tape stripe and a much more balls of
your kind of a rear end with a splitter
and a little wing above the glass now
let's go inside you recognise this cabin
cutesy and retro in its own way but not
so over-the-top as a mini the concentric
gauges are here speedo on the outside
tack in the middle a little info display
in the center there that's frustrating
because you can never get it to the
right brightness because it's so much
brighter at night then the gauges around
it this is new over here the turbo gauge
because the a Barth has a turbo yes it
actually does get that much boost
apparently up to 18 even 20 psi this
would be your only head unit there's not
a lot of tech here as you can see but
the basic sources now hooking up your
iOS device here in the glove box will
give you a nice very simple connection
to the dash it doesn't give you a lot of
interface to work with because we've got
a real limited display now you may
notice right above there I've got what
appears to be a clip-on TomTom unit it's
actually a factory TomTom unit that goes
into this little port here on the dash
and after I figured out the world's most
convoluted pairing where this has to
pair to the head unit my phone had to
pair to the TomTom and there's probably
one more loop here I missed you get this
a car menu it's actually quite valuable
alongside navigation under this you'll
find Eco Drive this will show you live
whether you're driving greenly or in
this cars case not so greenly
you've also got the ability to drop in
to this area here where you've got your
phone in a much more graphical interface
than on that ribbon display and finally
if you head over here you're going to
find your media player again that is the
wired player that is in the glove box
not bluetooth streaming down here is
your one choice only gearbox 5-speed
manual no automatic yet there's an
expectation the a barth will get an
automatic for broader market appeal but
so far they're doing it right it's a
small thing but this whole array of
buttons annoyed me first of all the
sport mode button wouldn't you invest in
an LED so it lights up when you press it
and when I push this thing all the
buttons move that's not good quality
locking the doors there's nothing up on
the top here you just push the door
lever in to lock out to open last time
we drove at 500 it was a C that means it
had that retractable pleated cloth top
very cool this car doesn't come with
that not possible on an Abarth but you
do have an optional glass moonroof this
guy's 850 bucks additional the
frustration is that's as closed as it
gets with a mesh thing over it there is
no solid panel to draw closed so on a
hot day or during the summer you'll cook
all the time at least a little bit but
you can't tell the story of a Fiat 500
Abarth inside the cabin you got to do
that under the hood we're going there
next now of course a huge part of the a
bar story is the a Barth motor it's
still a 1.4 liter inline 4 sitting this
way driving the front wheels but once
you add a turbo everything changes this
guy goes from about a hundred horsepower
in a standard 500 to 160 horsepower 170
foot-pounds of torque
it's like a different car gets this 2500
pound diminutive Italian up to 60 and
about 6.8 6.9 seconds while delivering
28 34 mpg now another key thing here
butts much harder to understand is Fiats
MultiAir technology they throttle the
engine by actuating the intake valves
the bottom line is you can reduce what
they call pumping losses and also get
very precise metering of the throttle
function 10% better power 10% better
fuel efficiency on top of what the turbo
brings
the car is the first thing you get the
impression of its light and possible in
a different way than a mini mini always
feels kind of heavy and kind of like a
sled to me this car feels a little
tippier
lighter nimbler I'm gonna hit the sport
mode button right here that's gonna give
me sharper throttle response so a higher
graduation of the throttle curve I'm
gonna also get apparently sharper
steering inputs on the electric power
steering rack off as I understand it and
that's about it
the next thing you notice after you get
the sport dialed in and you get this guy
pushed around a corner is it it rides
like a truck although I shouldn't say
that because truck makers would sue me
for libel I don't know what it rides
like but it's a Jhansi little ride part
of that is the fact that it's got the
firm suspension we've got the bigger
wheels riding on 45s and we've got
almost no overhang front and rear on
this car of overhang in front and behind
the axle line really does a lot to
modulate a car's ride this car doesn't
really have any to do that so I'm sure
on paper this is not the best handling
car there's no limited slip differential
it's front-wheel drive it's got a pretty
simple suspension it's a torsion bar
with springs in the rear but it adds up
to more than the sum of its parts it's
fun to drive and it's got credible power
where the real basic mini does not okay
2012 508 bars is gonna run you a 22 7
delivered it's a pretty cheap date and
comes in about a grand below a bass mini
cooper s by the way the options I'd go
for 850
even though you're gonna get head cancer
but you have a good time doing it
thousand dollars will get you these
seven teens you got to think about that
as we notice the ride is already brutal
enough I would probably drop down to the
16s perhaps and then you're going to
look at the $400 for that TomTom unit
that I'm gonna do anything else with
except by that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
