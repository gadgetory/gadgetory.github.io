been solved or has it I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update an Australian
businessman has come forward as the
creator of Bitcoin but many Bitcoin
enthusiasts are skeptical that he's
really the creator
bitcoin is a digital currency that
operates with no central authority no
banks or one person that controls the
supply of money instead all transactions
are managed by a computer network and
logged on a public ledger for years
people have speculated who created
Bitcoin the creator only went by a
pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto since bitcoin
is an open source project it was set
free to grow within the network as other
engineers tinkered to help perfect it no
one has come forward as the creator
until now
Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright
says he is Satoshi Nakamoto he sat down
for an interview with the BBC shown here
he also spoke with the Economist and GQ
and he wrote a personal blog post about
it some people will believe some people
won't and to tell you the truth
I don't really care well there are
plenty of people in the Bitcoin
community who do not believe him asking
to see more proof right use some
transactions as evidence but the
accusations say that the information he
provided was not secret yet several key
bitcoin figures have gone on the record
supporting his statement including two
members of the Bitcoin foundation who
say they have been provided sufficient
proof Wright says he does not want money
or fame nor will he accept any money
from awards he just wants to be left
alone he also says he will never talk to
the media again about it
so why go public now he says it's to end
speculation and be left alone since a
few stories in December did suggest he
could be the creator reporters have been
bothering him and people close to him
admitting that you are the creator
Bitcoin comes with a whole new mass of
problems for one everyone knows the
creator is rich with how many bitcoins
he or she owns from the early days when
it was worth pennies right now there are
about fifteen and a half million
bitcoins in circulation each one is
worth about four hundred and fifty
dollars as of this report it
believe that the Creator has about 450
million dollars worth of bitcoins now
since it's not often that new bitcoins
are created he could influence the value
of a Bitcoin if he sells a bunch at once
and that means the fate of Bitcoin
success really does lie in the hands of
its creator and that's why people care
so much you can use bitcoins to transfer
money easily and you can find a number
of businesses that accept the currency
just last week the video game networks
team began accepting Bitcoin as payment
for computer games the company says in
some emerging markets like India China
and Brazil it's easier for people to pay
for things internationally with Bitcoin
than with a credit card that's all for
