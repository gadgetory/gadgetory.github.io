welcome to Google issues for everything
Google you can think of and okay right
off the top of the show I have to
apologize for last week like I
completely missed the announcement by
Google's VP of Product Management for
Hardware about the pixel to xl's hue
color ship when looking at off angles
and screen burnin issues you know about
this and a lot of you made sure I knew
it like a lot of you except for this guy
who said I look like a South Asian
electrocuted barber so I'm sorry it
happens and here's how Google is
responding now the pixel to excel will
come with a two-year warranty worldwide
that's extended they say it's decay
characteristics are similar to OLED
panels used in comparable products they
will use software optimizations to
maximize the life of their OLED screen
and for those that wanted a new mode for
more saturated colors will be made
available via a software update for both
new pixel phones in the next few weeks
and that's how you do it but next time
come on have sundar pichai say this so
it gets pasted everywhere in the tech
media and that's just on a post on a
Google forum and yes I deserve
absolutely where is it Google or raggle
I don't know either way it was my bad
and isn't it funny how the media
favoritism can work for or against the
company Apple released a statement of
their own about the iPhones OLED which
will exhibit the same hue color shift at
off angles and potential burnin but it
hasn't received nearly the same amount
of attention or any negative press like
the pixel 2xl did so let's just squash
this once and for all
both the pixel to excel and the iPhone
10 are affected by these issues and
let's just enjoy the technology that
each platform has to offer like can't we
all just get along no Bret from
California just said no and how do I
know he did because I can hear you
through the screen Bret
all right Samsung just hit peak honey
badger don't care status look it's next
up in the tree Let Me badd you don't
care honey bad you don't give just
what it wants that's after Samsung
released their latest commercial called
growing up that mocks the different
iPhones and the features that Samsung he
beat them to the punch with over the
years like having a bigger screen or
even being waterproof but then they went
absolutely savage with this guy in line
for an iPhone 10 come on son they just
went in on Apple now it's worth the good
laugh I I love it but you know Samsung
wishes they have lines as long as than
an iPhone for a worldwide launch like it
goes both ways
and we've also got some more pixel to
news I can confidently tell you after
how Google addressed the 2x ELLs
reported issues that you should feel
100% confident getting the best pure
Android phone on the market it's still
an amazing phone we know one of its cool
pixel 2 and 2 XL features is the ability
to recognize background music
automatically and they display it on the
lockscreen when you turn on the now
playing feature this is now rolling out
to the Google assistant as well so if
you have voice set as the assistants
preferred input method you will see
what's this song as an option above the
assistants microphone icon or you can
ask it directly what song is this and it
will tell you now the pixel 2 + 2 XL
still have the top overall rated camera
in the industry but guess what they
could get even better that's because
Google will be enabling the pixel visual
core in the latest Android 8.1 Developer
Preview 2 this November it's Google's
own custom 8 core chipset that was
developed in partnership with Intel for
machine learning and image processing
now it will improve hdr+ functionality
by allowing it to run five times faster
while using less than a tenth of the
power and third-party apps will be able
to use it as well so thing about it this
phone already takes some of the best
photos on planet earth and pixel visual
core still hasn't even been unlocked you
down with PVC yeah you know me I mean
it's almost as good as OPP right like ok
I can get a little carried away but
check this out the pixel 2 has new
camera gestures you might not know about
like double tapping the power to launch
the camera app or double twisting the
phone to change the camera you're using
it's pretty slick but one of them did
not make the cut a find by
xda-developers reveals Google was
working on a new lift gesture feature
that
launched the camera app if you lifted
your phone up into a picture taking
position their source says it would have
shown up in the settings as a lift to
open camera but during testing Google
decided to disable this gesture entirely
now Android 8.1 is in Developer Preview
and maybe we'll see something like this
comeback in a future version but they
were thinking about it just not right
now alright that's it for this week you
can email me at Google issues at
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tom thanks
so much for watching we'll catch y'all
next time for some more of that Google
issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
