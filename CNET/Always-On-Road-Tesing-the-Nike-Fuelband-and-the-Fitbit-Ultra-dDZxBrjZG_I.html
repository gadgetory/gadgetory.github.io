the setup of the Nike Fuel and the
Fitbit and now in keeping with the
spirit of our show I thought that I
should come up with a sufficiently
extreme method for testing these two
devices so against my better judgment
I've decided to train for a half
marathon and I found myself the water to
wine marathon in wine country here in
Northern California on August 12 2012 at
least everyone at the end anyway
let's start with a fuel ban let's see
how I go about registering downloading
the apps and getting it all set up so my
first step here is to download the
desktop software note that it's not
compatible I have to say I already
wished that this was a website and then
there's firmware updates of course there
are so definitely not a clip-on and go
oh login with Facebook I know this is
how Facebook takes over the world but I
like it opening Nike+ Kinect okay I am
not digging the software situation at
all okay so I'm successfully logged in I
have done nothing oh no one I'm like
halfway through the day okay I gotta go
have a little tip story no no just house
shopping thanks a lot thank you now I'm
going to sink my fuel bands with the
iPhone app so now it's your Fitbit
/ we have the Fitbit ultra oh good more
software download ooh one strike against
Fitbit no Facebook integration Oh it'll
say my name okay I like that bonus point
so I am going to install the Fitbit app
on my iPhone I do like that with the
Fitbit app I can track all of my
activity and enter my food because I was
a big fan of the MyFitnessPal app so
that's kind of cool
Oh neat I like the little animations
data bar that Fitbit is cool done
seriously it is making me sweat just
trying to like do all the registration
and the software installations and the
firmware upgrades this should all be on
the web or just on my phone and it
should not be this hard I know I'm never
gonna have to touch these things again
but oh my god I hate setup so one thing
I don't like I know I can use the cable
but it's obviously easier to plug the
Nike FuelBand directly and like this but
then it's such a stiff little thing that
it pushes on the delete button although
it's not nearly as clunky it's trying to
pull the Fitbit off this thing without
feeling like you actually destroyed it
alright so I have my fuel band on I'm
gonna clip on my Fitbit it is now time
to exercise wish me luck
okay I'm starting my half marathon
training today I have to do three miles
I have my neck fuel band and my Fitbit
so I'm gonna go my three miles I'm gonna
sync at the end and see which one makes
me feel better about all this hard work
dude I'm already at 2,300 boom okay I
just finished a four mile training run
forgot the Fitbit
yeah I just finished a four mile run yep
if we got lost I picked it
I just finished a seven mile run
just kidding so I danced around wash my
face and dance around brush my teeth all
trying to hit that magical goal
alright I've been comparing the Nike
Fuel band and the Fitbit ultra for about
a month now and I am ready to declare a
winner
first though I'm gonna compare and
contrast these guys I will say that as
motivational devices if you're looking
to get off the couch or improve your
kind of overall fitness both of them
really work they make you want to do
more in fact I signed up for a half
marathon just so that I could test them
appropriately and I'm up to eight miles
which I feel pretty good about all right
let's start with the Fitbit ultra for
one thing it's very unobtrusive you can
see it's really small it clips on snug
so it never falls off and wherever it is
you kind of don't feel it you can
collect so much information with the
Fitbit and then it spits out these
beautiful charts so you really get this
awesome narcissistic picture of how much
you're working out
the downside though is that if you get a
little bored or fed up with all that
data collection then this becomes sort
of a clip-on paperweight
also the clip-on factor a bit of a
downside because it's really easy to
forget
in fact I've had a problem where I've
changed out of my street clothes into my
gym clothes and left this clipped onto
my jeans but the biggest downside of the
Fitbit for me is that it does not sync
wirelessly you actually have to plug it
in to a base station which just feels
totally early two-thousands all right
pros and cons of the Nike FuelBand I
gotta say the biggest pro of this thing
is the simple convenience it's so
unobtrusive and so easy to wear that I
almost never forget to put this guy on
and the LED displays are kind of
futuristic and cool the other thing I
love is Nikes gamification every time I
get a new goal or I get a streak going
or I exceed my goal by a certain amount
I get this adorable little animation
that stuff seems small but it really
works and it makes this a lot of fun the
other plus is that this syncs wirelessly
with the iOS app I don't know why Fitbit
doesn't have that
alright downsides to the FuelBand first
it is expensive it's a hundred and fifty
dollars and then finally the fuel band
is part of this whole Nike family of
products and they don't talk to each
other like this can't talk to the shoe
pod and it can't talk to the nike GPS
running apps but those are all the cons
I can think of so when it comes down to
declaring a winner in this road test for
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
