biggest pro wrestler in the world
somebody called the Backstreet Boys
we're having a comeback party at
Fastlane on Sunday night Goldberg won
the WWE Universal Championship the first
time he's won a wrestling title in 14
years next month
will headline WrestleMania 33 in a big
match against Brock Lesnar so what
better time to look back at the best
moments of Goldberg's career Goldberg's
appeal is simple one she can smash
people is really really fun
many a sour on his WWE run but at
SummerSlam 2003 Elimination Chamber
match he gave one of his smashers
performances ever Goldberg was the
second loss to enter the elimination
style match when he did it was like
watching a demolition derby
when pro wrestlers come up with their
finishing moves they often think could I
do this to anybody sighs as it turns out
Goldberg can do pretty much anything to
anyone case in point he lifted the
500-pound Big Show high into the air to
deliver his signature jackhammer move
last October Goldberg made his
long-awaited return to Monday Night Raw
and what a return it was not only does
that mean that's your next but most
importantly it means Brock Lesnar your
last pretty bad off my crop for a 49
year-old he was only meant to wrestle
one match against Brock but he was such
a hit that wo you signed him on for a
few more now his WWE champ
and on his way to one of his biggest
matches ever okay this kind of cheating
because it's not technically a moment
but if you ask older fans about their
memories of Goldberg his entrance will
always come up the camera would follow
him as he walk from his dressing room to
the curtain he'd be flanked by a team of
security guards the crowd would be
chanting his name when he enters the
arena is engulfment spot he inhales the
fumes from the pirate and breathes it
out like a dragon on July 6 1998
Goldberg went from promising
up-and-comer to legit pro wrestling
superstar a record five million homes
across the US tuned in to watch the
undefeated Goldberg beat Hulk Hogan to
win the WCW championship it was one of
the biggest moments of pro wrestling's
biggest era Goldberg first stood at the
peak of pro wrestling in 1998 in 2017
he's back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
