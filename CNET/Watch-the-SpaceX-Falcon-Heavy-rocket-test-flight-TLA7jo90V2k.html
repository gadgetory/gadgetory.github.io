to drain for long
Stage two you basically
t-minus 30 seconds launch director our
countdown 1 SpaceX heavy you go
for launch
Falcon Heavy is configured for flight in
-15 stand by for terminal count and nine
eight subbu sir - six
here we are with a cheery
space on their chest way
building on a history of certain father
next killer
you heard the call-out vehicle is
supersonic
side boosters are now throttling back up
their past max cure the period of
maximum loads on the vehicle next up
we'll be waiting for the side boosters
to begin to throttle down
prior to booster engine cutoff at
separation two and a half minutes into
flight
CNC trajectory looks good on the
heavy
reports show that the m1b engine
performance is nominal
individual has begun
slide boosters have began to throttle
down in preparation for the upcoming
shutdown in ten seconds
major event coming up side mounted
separation inside shutdown side boosters
the tool
a mysterious box
successful separation we're coming up on
c4
Loosli
they don't recognition visiting going
students of decision
they start up
centipoid Assad engines on pilot also
knew good
sorry sir reduce
7:44 shut up
Wow Wow did you guys see that
that was awesome that's the only thing I
can man recapping all the great things
that you just saw there a successful
liftoff from the pad successful stage
separation but before that successful
booster separation you can see stage 1
the tube side boosters parting that you
can see the center core and you can see
impact lit up oh my gosh then the
beautiful shots of star man chilling in
the Tesla Roadster
absolutely incredible on your screen at
the moment you've got a few things
happening on the upper right you've got
em back d continuing it's burn on the
upper left you have the central core
headed back towards the autonomous
spaceport drone ship and in the two
bottom screens you've got the side
boosters headed back towards Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station landing
zones 1 &amp;amp; 2
the next step coming up for these side
boosters and the center booster is the
re-entry burn that's going to slow it
down from or slow all the boosters down
from way faster than the speed of sound
to just faster than the speed of sound
in order to reduce some of those
aerodynamic forces and heating that
occurs when you're moving that quickly
through the atmosphere
and as you can see on your screen
boosters at community
so the core
to central core and the upper left of
your screen performing a tone
you can see the the edge of Cape
Canaveral in both of the side booster
cameras those white center core and
Sherbourne shut down and even though
very similar those two boosters views
those are actually representing
different boosters
to begin their landing burns
he's lookin to be on track to arms
anyways at the pool
spaceport friendship
checking your screen loses footage goes
out when it approaches the drone ship
and the heavy vibrations make it lose
signal crossing our fingers that's not
the case right now
so it looks like that landing is
happening at the moment we have lost
signal we're hoping that signal comes
back shortly
as Michael mentioned earlier with the
vibrations of the rocket and how it
shakes up the cameras that are on the
drone ship sometimes we do lose signal
or shakes up the antennas oh and we've
just gotten confirmation wait here what
happens is oh we're listening in and and
we're still waiting to hear I will let
you know as soon as we find out you'll
know people are cheering but we'll get
the call and know hopefully very very
soon how that Senator Corps is doing
whether it's standing up proud on that
drone ship or not those are absolutely
gorgeous meanwhile the second stage is
continuing its trajectory towards Mars
it saw it's all looking good there John
Ike come give us a recap of the full
mission he stands
often heavy
camera cycling right now what he was
coming down from low-earth orbit the
second stage successfully got there and
it got there is the culmination of a
great falcon heavy test flight we let 27
engines through out of the Boosters up
and down we separated the side boosters
they came back spectacular simultaneous
landing the center core did its job the
second stage of it everything that you
could want in a test flight we got here
now we're just looking for the icing on
the Cape to find out what happened on
the drone show but all in all an
outstanding test flight for Falcon Heavy
momentous occasion I thank you so much
to the range for contributing their
expertise to today's launch the FAA for
the licenses to launch and land those
boosters as well as the rest of Falcon
Heavy and thank you to you the viewers
for joining us for a really really cool
moment here and to find out what
happened with the center core and what's
going on with star man as he makes its
journey through space and all of our
launches you can visit us at SpaceX calm
and follow us on social media on
LinkedIn and Twitter if you would like
to join us on exciting projects like
these please visit SpaceX comm slash

from the entire grateful team here thank
you again for joining us we'll see you
next time
