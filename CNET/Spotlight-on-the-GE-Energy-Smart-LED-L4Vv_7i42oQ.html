the GE energy smart 60 watt replacement
LED now the prices of these kinds of
bulbs has fallen pretty steadily over
the last few years right now you can get
a 60 watt replacement LED from Cree or
Philips or GE here for about $10 you can
find this one at Walmart Target Sam's
Club it's a very easy bulb to find but
how does it do in home lighting well it
does very well uses 11 watts to put out
800 lumens and that's nice and efficient
at 72 or 73 lumens per watt but not as
good as Krier Philips which both boast
better efficiency scores however the GE
bulb makes up some ground when you're
comparing it if you look at its color
rendering capabilities now this bulb has
a color rendering score of 80 out of 100
and that's the same thing you'll get
from creer Philips but those scores
don't tell the whole story they're an
average of every color it's trying to
render and so you can have 180 be better
than another 80 and in the GES case it's
a pretty good 80 take a look at this
bowl of M&amp;amp;Ms a lot of nice colors that
white bowl that natural wood tone we've
got it lit by the Cree 60 watt LED right
now and now watch what happens when you
fade to the GE 60 watt those colors pop
a little more the white doesn't look
quite so yellow the wood looks a little
more natural it's just a very slight
subtle uptick in color quality now if
that's the type of thing that matters to
you if you have artwork in your home or
you have a really specific color scheme
you might like that about this bulb and
that might make it worth the fact that
it's not quite as efficient and doesn't
have as long a warrantee as that cree
LED so all in all not my favorite 60
watt replacement LED but still one that
merits consideration for Sina I'm right
