Apple bit an Apple has officially gone
on the record saying it's slowing down
your old iPhone after multiple claims
and reports of showed it was happening
to really they just couldn't ignore it
anymore
so all those times you know you said my
iPhone feels so much slower you probably
weren't crazy because Apple is actually
doing it and now they're saying to do it
to offset problems with ageing
lithium-ion batteries and they're only
saying this because guess what they got
caught doing it and this is really a big
deal so let's just talk about the
battery first as your phone battery gets
older they don't really hold their
charges as well as newer batteries and
they can have problems when the charge
is too low or even the temperature is
cold if you don't recall you have to
remember those iPhone 6 and 6s
unexpected shutdowns of last year well
the processors in those devices they
wanted to hit faster speeds but there
are batteries couldn't handle the demand
so what it did is it prompted some of
those phones to just simply switch
themselves off and let's just look at
Apple's official statement about this
whole thing
all right our goal is to deliver the
best experience for customers which
includes overall performance and
prolonging the life of their devices
lithium-ion batteries become less
capable of supplying peak current
demands when in cold conditions have a
low battery charge or as they age over
time which can result in the device
unexpectedly shutting down to protect
its electric components last year we
released a feature for iPhone 6 iPhone
6s and iPhone se to smooth out the
instantaneous peaks only when needed to
prevent the device from unexpectedly
shutting down during these conditions
we've now extended that feature to the
iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2 and plan to add
support for other products in the future
so Apple is basically saying yeah we're
slowing down your iPhones for a good
reason I guess really a good reason for
them but guess what they weren't
planning on telling any of this to us it
was only because they were basically
caught doing it and then they had to put
on the good old Apple spin saying we're
doing it because it's in your best
interest and if we rewind back this is
really where it all started in a reddit
post where a user found performance of
his iPhone success saw that it was
slowing
and then significantly improved after he
replaced its battery then the big guns
primate labs they came in to investigate
this further using their popular geek
bench for benchmark tests to measure the
performance of an iPhone 6s and iPhone 7
and the findings really showed with the
software updates to older phones that
performance clearly showed a wider
distribution of lower scores lower
performance scores after the updates and
you know what this won't really affect
the iPhone 7 as much because of the
architecture of the a10 chip it has low
power and high power cores and really
uses the low power cores about 90% of
the time now it was only after these
results when Apple finally stepped in to
admit that yes they are slowing down
older iPhones but you know this you know
Apple would not have said a thing until
these Geekbench scores were actually
released to the public and this
information was out for everyone now
let's even go back to those iPhone 6 and
6s random shutdowns from earlier this
year that are still actually happening
to some users today Apple released iOS
10 point two point one with better power
management and this was their statement
back in February of this year with iOS
10 point 2 point 1 Apple made
improvements to reduce occurrences of
unexpected shutdowns that a small number
of users were experiencing with their
iPhone iOS 10 point two point one
already has over 50 percent of active
iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic
data we've received from upgraders shows
that for this small percentage of users
experiencing the issue we're seeing a
more than 80 percent reduction in iPhone
6s and over 70 percent reduction on
iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly
shutting down now again Apple said it
was only happening to a small number and
small percentage of iPhones so if it's
happening to a small group of users
why roll out this new software feature
to throttle down performance for all
iPhones without saying anything about it
until now see this is to me really a
lose-lose for Apple either way and it's
also a lose-lose for us like do you want
to have your older iPhone randomly shut
down on you or would you rather have a
phone with prolonged battery life while
slowing it down
the correct answer is none of the above
so check this out there's not much we
can really do right now this is a
feature built into software thanks Apple
and I'm not telling you to go out and
just replace your batteries right away
although you can compare your CPU scores
on Geekbench compared to what it should
be and then kind of decide what you want
to do from there now that it's out in
the open maybe Apple could give us an
option to opt into this prolonged
battery life feature now but come on
flat-out this is a bad Apple because
they didn't say anything about this back
in February but they only came clean
once they were caught red-handed and
then they gave us our spin on it so
check this out let us know how you guys
and gals all feel about this in the
comments that Apple will do the right
thing are you happy with how they handle
it or are you throwing out a bad apple
as well this is the big story right now
there you go it's another Apple bits
we'd love to hear what you think write
it down below peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
