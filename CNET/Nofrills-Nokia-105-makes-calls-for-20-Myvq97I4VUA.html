cheap
I'm Jessica Dahle court for CNET this is
the Nokia 105 it is a $20 cell phone
there is not much to it because its
chief purpose is really just to make
phone calls in fact it is so simple that
you won't even find a volume rocker
anywhere on it
the only buttons are the start and end
button and the directional pad and of
course the alphanumeric dial pad there
is however a flashlight which is a nice
little extra and a standard headset jack
this is a very light phone but it is a
little bit thick which I actually find
nice because it makes it easier to grip
and harder to lose slips into pockets
pretty easily and also person the
construction is predictably cheap when I
pull off the back panel and put it back
on again there's suddenly a little gap
that I didn't see before all around the
edges it took me a little bit of time to
get used to navigating this phone and
that's because the directional pad has
no central select button so if you want
to get around you have to use the soft
keys to select you can't just push
straight down there are a couple
shortcuts though you can press the d-pad
in any direction though and it will
launch an app like the calendar or a
blank text message the keys are
responsive and easy to press they rise
slightly above the surface and a little
bubble action right here but they are
not fully separated so it is a little
bit harder to dial by field there are a
few little extra apps on here there is a
radio there are a couple preset games
like Sudoku but you can't really get any
more calendar some converters and alarm
clock definitely so you can use it for
really basic actions the screen is
extremely small 1.4 inches and it does
support some color but it doesn't look
very nice or sharp and it's really not
supposed to apart from making phone
calls and sending text messages the best
part about this phone is the battery so
far I have not charged it at all and
I've had it for several days
batteries supposed to last up to 35 days
on standby and up to 12.5 hours on a
call so if you're definitely missing the
long life batteries of your then this
phone has it the Nokia 105 is being sold
globally especially
emerging markets like India and China
also sells for 15 euros in Europe and
the equivalent is $20 in the US it does
not sell through a carrier yet but if
you look really hard you might be able
to find it unlocked
