get it
who's always aware nice to have you back
professor no definitely wanted to to
play that at the beginning that she was
someone with a secret so that perhaps
when you watch the film again you would
realize oh you can start to see the
clues that something else is going on
for Siena but it's not not everything as
quite as it seems
that was the scene that never ended
actually we were saying to each other
surely we've got the scene but no every
day we would come back and shoot the
scene where we chased by the drive and
just hope it was it was a constant
feature of the schedule you have those
moments when you're doing those kind of
scenes when you're running away from
madrone and it's boiling hot and you're
in the middle of Florence and you like I
this is what being an act is about this
is great
well I liked with both the films I feel
the stories that they're telling
irrelevant I felt like there was
something very modern about Inferno the
the issues that addresses though the way
that ron was going to shoot it it was
going to use a lot of handheld
everything about it was so international
it felt like it was a very contemporary
story and then with rogue one it was the
opportunity to play a great female lead
character and when I got to the chance
it's so definitely I mean for everyone
Star Wars been a part of their lives in
some capacity and and I remember
watching it very early on and with my
cousins and my brother and we were all
huddled around the VHS player which
sounds very old-fashioned now but that
was the way then and I just it was a
great it's a great thing to be a part of
it is really like no other experience
York you're working with the most
bizarre-looking creatures every day and
you you get travelling spaceships and
all those those kind of fun things that
you don't get to do it everyday life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
