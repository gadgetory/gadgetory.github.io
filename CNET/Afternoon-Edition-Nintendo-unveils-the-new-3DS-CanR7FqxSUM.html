a and it's time to get loaded Nintendo
unveiled their 3d s at e3 as expected
the design is similar to the traditional
DSi look and it has a 3.5 widescreen
display and Wi-Fi connectivity with full
3d glasses without the glasses they
didn't show off any of the 3d features
on stage because they said it didn't
capture the full experience instead they
had units distributed among the audience
no details on pricing or a release date
Nintendo also showed off a few exclusive
new wheat titles including a Zelda game
a new goldeneye and new kirby and Donkey
Kong games no vitality sensor love an
apple launched a free app for the iPhone
and iPad called Apple Store today is the
first day you can pre-order the iphone 4
and this new app lets you reserve the
smartphone it also lets you browse and
shop through apple's line of products
make changes to your shopping cart read
customer reviews and find an apple
retail store in your area speaking of if
you're one of many trying to pre-order
the iphone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T or Apple's website
you'll know that it's been kind of a
nightmare both sites were down most of
the morning and apparently AT&amp;amp;T
customers are getting mixed up into
other users accounts while other buyers
are getting billed for multiple charges
word is that ATT stores are not handling
the situation any better it may be best
to wait a day or two before you
pre-order and t-mobile confirmed last
week's rumor that they will be giving
away every phone in every store for free
this is a one-day offer that will take
place on saturday jun 19th right before
Father's Day you need to visit a
t-mobile store and switch to any family
plan or add a new line to an existing
family plan and you get a free phone
this includes the newest smartphones
like the HTC hd2 and the mytouch 3g
slide you still need to agree to a
two-year contract that's your news for
today will be back tomorrow with more on
