Computex 2015 in Taipei and we've just
been in the session with Intel on the
details behind the new Thunderbolt 3
standard the new standard excitingly is
actually unifying onto the USB type-c
port that's the new slim reversible port
that everybody's been very excited about
with USB so seeing Thunderbolt now unify
onto that standard means we will see one
single port for all of our needs
once somebody chooses to make their port
Thunderbolt it will support the full
specification of USB 3.1 it will support
DisplayPort and support PCI Express
generation 3 as well as Thunderbolt so
it basically makes a Thunderbolt port
the one port to truly rule them all when
we think about real-world usage that
means two 4k monitors could be used at
once
it also means full 10 Gigabit Ethernet
it means charging over this port as well
up to a hundred watts for notebook
charging as well as 15 watts of bus
power support so everything that people
want out of the USB standard they will
still be able to get through this new
updated port and it will all just work
seamlessly that way now there will also
be cheaper Thunderbolt cables available
this time around that's often been a big
issue with Thunderbolt in the past but
there will be the option essentially is
a passive cable which will basically be
any USBC cable but this will mean
Thunderbolt will run at a slightly
slower speed of 20 gigabits per second
which is still twice as fast as USB so
these kinds of options I think will make
this new Thunderbolt work a lot better
for most people and hopefully we'll see
wider manufacturer adoption into actual
devices PCs notebooks maybe even some of
the smaller devices as well but that's
the big news you can read all the rest
of the details in the story on a
