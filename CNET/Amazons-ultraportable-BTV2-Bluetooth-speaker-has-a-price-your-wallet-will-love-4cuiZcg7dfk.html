speaker and don't have a lot of money to
spend well this might be the perfect
accessory for you hey it's Justin you
from CNET this is the amazonbasics ultra
portable bluetooth speaker btv - so this
thing cost 30 bucks and it's part of
amazon's line of budget-friendly devices
that also includes a bigger version for
50 bucks so as you can see the design is
pretty simple and exactly what you'd
expect out of a $30 speaker it's
available in black blue purple gray or
red and you get a couple buttons on top
for pairing and volume controls and a
few ports on the side that let you
charge the rechargeable battery and plug
in an auxiliary jack but there's no
cable included in the box so you'll need
to supply your own if you want to play
music from a non Wireless source a
couple things do set it apart from
competing speakers first the battery
life is rated at 10 hours which has
doubled the average for speakers at this
size and price also it has a 3 watt
speaker inside that can fire from both
directions you can compare that to
others like the Logitech X 100 or the
JBL clip both of those have their own
unique features but they can only play
music on one side that could make a big
difference depending on how you're
planning to use this speaker so how does
this one sound well I think you'll be
satisfied with the quality and volume
reach as long as you keep in mind the
retail price 3 watts obviously isn't
going to blow you away and it definitely
distorts at maximum volume but it's just
fine that typical volume is you'd play
at a BBQ a picnic or inside the house
you can read more details in my full
review on CNET but that's gonna do it
for me I'm Justin you you just took a
first look at the Amazon basics B TV -
ultra portable bluetooth speaker thanks
