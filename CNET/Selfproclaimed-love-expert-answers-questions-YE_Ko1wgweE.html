GAD well last week we asked for love
questions because this is our
Valentine's Day episode and I'm your
love expert I guess I don't know what
makes me a love expert I've been a
relationship for a very long time that's
gotta count for something what the hell
is a love expert
doesn't matter let's get to these
questions you and your wife get to go on
a romantic vacation to a fictional video
game setting of your choice where do you
go I feel like we would probably see
what the Green Hill Zone had to offer
I'm Sonic the Hedgehog even though it's
kind of like beachy I feel like I could
like find a place to relax there and oh
you know what is really nice the the
snow level in Mario 3 where you're just
like sliding on your butt the whole time
it seems like a fun vacation good
question what's the best song to help
get someone over a broken heart and I
guess that's why they call it the blues
by Elton John God that songs beautiful
do you enjoy those chalky message heart
candies does anybody really have you
ever seen anybody eating a bunch of them
like out of a cup or something they're
just to send meaningless messages to one
another or to throw at people it's
someone who has been in a relationship
for a while is the expert it's not
someone who bounces off relationships
all the time the on the
I know love at it's humanity what is the
best food other than spaghetti to
reenact that kissing scene from lady in
the Tramp assuming you're a dog you
don't have to be a dog to do that sour
punch straws Twizzlers Charleston chews
mozzarella sticks and onion rings we've
been together at 15 years man what
doesn't who know who knows a lot better
than that at Virtua mantis now that Taco
Bell has a wedding chapel
what other brand should host weddings
medieval times
it's been 15 years I didn't even get to
try out the swipey apps best 80 / early
90s hairband ballad Tim you've asked a
question that has literally infinity as
the answer but I'll just pick one out of
thin air winds of change by scorpions
what is the best video game love story
ever told and don't say Link and Zelda
all right I'm not gonna say Lincoln
Zelda I'm gonna get serious with this
one The Last of Us DLC the relationship
between Ellie and Riley like amazingly
written a beautiful story that is the
best worst date experience Oh IRA it was
my senior prom when I had asked this
girl to go with me she's like yeah I'll
go it was like the day the money was due
and I'm like you're coming right and she
like totally blew me off have you ever
bought a Valentine's gift knowing you
would get more enjoyment from it than
your significant other yes I thought my
wife would love a big-screen TV and she
didn't it was like I showed up in a tux
and I was like hey and she's like in
sweatpants is like sorry dude I'm not
going but she definitely ghosted me back
then that stays with you
I'm almost for 36 years old I was half
my lifetime ago that stays with you
I know roses will be number one how do
you know but what's your top three
flowers to give on Valentine's Day I
have opinions on flowers there's
something a little weird about giving
someone you love a dying thing it is
actively dying fine let's put that aside
I like the dead flowers that you can
like decorate a wall with they're
already dead so it's not a sad process
and they just look nice you can make
really interesting sort of sculptures in
wall art with that best themed
Valentine's cards you can remember from
your childhood Ninja Turtles ones it was
all Pizza like everything for them is
pizza they're so one-dimensional I love
the Ninja Turtles but all of their
Valentine's cards were like you are the
cheese to my pepero we get it you guys
are
turtles and you like pizza but they
didn't branch out at atomic death cult
how do you celebrate Valentine's Day
with mrs. Jeff Barney you asked at stacy
blair your pick this year the notebook
or the notebook
I guess I'm freaking watching the
notebook well that's gonna do it for
another episode a quick question thank

questions hope you have a fantastic
Valentine's Day even though everyone
knows it is a holiday make sure
