a look at the ax suzanne book ux31a now
we've already looked at a couple of
these zenbook laptops the UX 32 models
those are a little bit thicker actually
I there either less expensive and kind
of more budget ultrabooks or they're
more expensive and have core i7
processors and discrete graphics cards
this model strips out some of that stuff
keep some of those high-end extras but
gives it to you in a thinner body making
it probably the most sort of idealized
ultrabook like of the current Zen books
then with the thinner body in this
particular case for about ten fifty
maybe eleven hundred dollars you get an
Intel Core i5 CPU seems reasonable but
you also get a full 1920 x 1080 display
that's a nice high-end option on a
13-inch laptop you don't see too often
some people even think that's too high
res makes it kind of hard to see text
but you know I I don't mind having the
highest res screen possible you don't
get the discrete graphics that we saw in
one of these slightly slightly thicker
you x32 models in this case you just
have the basic intel HD 4000 graphics
and that's fine for basic casual game
playing maybe some older games
especially if you turn the resolution
down a little bit i find the front edge
of these end books to be a little bit
sure you put the heels your hand there
they kind of cut into you just a little
bit keyboard i always think is great by
the touchpad just a hair too
unresponsive compared to either a
macbook or maybe the very best windows
ultrabooks you do get to USB 3.1 is just
a little bit thinner your video outputs
you have VGA and HDMI are relegated to
sort of little mini display adapter
plugs you have to plug the external
dongle into them in order to get a video
out now the Zen booking go less
expensive and guessing at the UX 32a
which is under thousand dollars you get
more expensive get something like the
ux32vd which you've also reviewed which
is really nice has the high red screen
and discrete graphics that's about
twelve hundred dollars or you can knock
a hundred bucks or so off for a little
bit more than a thousand and get this
guy hand shave a couple of millimeters
off that is the asuste then
