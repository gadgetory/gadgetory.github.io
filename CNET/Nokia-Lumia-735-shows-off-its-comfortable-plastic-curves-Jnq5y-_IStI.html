part of Nokia meaning future Lumia
phones will be Microsoft not Nokia
branded the Lumia 735 is the last of the
Lumias will see with the Nokia name on
its face it's not a bad phone to go out
on either it's a lower mid-range phone
with a price to match but doesn't mean
putting it with ugly budget design
though it has a rounded plastic body
that's rather reminiscent of the older
Lumia 800 a phone I was extremely keen
on its curves makes it comfortable to
hold as does its smaller 4.7 inch size
the plastic backs are interchangeable as
well meaning you can swap it out when
you just fancy a different bright color
or when your existing one starts to look
a bit battered the display has a 720p
resolution which is a step down from the
full HD you'll see on the Lumia 930 but
it's more than adequate to make icons
and text look crisp and it's bright as
well it has very deep black levels which
give a rich contrast to videos and
images it's running on the latest
Windows Phone 8.1 software with its
scrolling list of live tiles a recent
update brings features like a pulldown
notification bar the ability to put live
tiles into folders and Microsoft Siri
like voice assistant Cortana Windows
Phone is fun easy to use and if nothing
else is an interesting alternative to
iOS or Android the downside however is
that the app store still receives very
little low from developers there are
some big names on its shelves but if you
want to play new games on your iPhone
owning friends get them prepare to be
very disappointed it's running on a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor which is
powerful enough to make navigation
smooth but it doesn't handle more
demanding gaming very well the rear 6.7
megapixel camera it takes acceptable
although hardly outstanding shots and
the front facing five megapixel camera
has a wide-angle lens meaning you don't
need to squash all your friends in quite
so close when taking those group selfies
all over Nokia Lumia 735 doesn't have
the top-end camera or the
high-definition display you'll fight on
the flagship Lumia 930 it's compact
attractive design vivid screen and much
more affordable price makes it a great
Buy if you're after
good all-round phone for everyday tasks
