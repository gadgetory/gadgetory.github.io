60 years ago we got the first one fifty
years ago the first stingray version and
now it's all back together again for Gen
7 the 2014 Corvette Stingray
let's take a tour of this new seventh
generation event first of all
proportions are about the same and by
the way they point out they're
remarkably close to a Porsche 911 I've
never really seen that in it look at the
front of this guy there's a lot of
Ferrari DNA in here I mean this is a
very different face easiest way to spot
the new vet the hood is carbon fiber
very very light same thing goes for the
roof panel all these guys have carbon
fiber roofs you can't see it underneath
here all aluminum frame and subframes
which is stock now on every single one
of the new vets and of course a lot of
these fenders and other panels are made
of sheet molding compound a high-tech
plastic so I'm not sure you can get a
fridge magnet to stick to this car
anywhere now it gets real controversial
back here these taillights this whole
cluster here is either the new look of
Corvette or if you're more of a doubter
in the various chat rooms and forums a
travesty that is too much Camaro or
Malibu very unique here these are the
trumpets of hell these things go to a
dual exhaust system out to four tips
that has this mechanical actuator that
opens up a valve back here for a whole
lot more bellow and more flow they say
can actually add five horse and five
foot pounds if you have the performance
exhaust system little free flow does one
okay now the roofs a big story on this
new vent all of the supposed hardtop
actually have a liftoff roof you can't
get a true hardtop bet at least not yet
in this seventh generation you can get
these in body color clear carbon or four
thousand dollars optional a clear smoke
stop that could be kind of cool now
let's put it away you put this into
these front clips drop it in here snaps
into place
how do you get your luggage in and out
of there well the Front's are kind of
like pivots so you can still get here
like it's a lid kind of clever and does
not clobber too much of your rear cargo
space alright the first big news about
the new vet is the cabin
they've upholstered basically everything
no hard plastic under sheeting is really
showing except of very few places and
the texture there is nice as well now
you may have already noticed the other
way they've upholstered this cargo
upholstered it with LCDs this one
carries Chevy MyLink nothing
dramatically new here we've seen this
before in Chevy vehicles over here
though is very different this is the
instrument panel for the Vette the main
panel is full of LCD though notice
you've still got us mechanical speedo
and a mechanical fuel gauge and
temperature gauge however what's in the
middle there is very cool
you could either be in Eco mode yes
there's an eco mode on the Vette will
talk about mpg in a minute it's pretty
darn good kick it again you go to
touring this is kind of your everyday
driving mode that isn't tuned down for
eco hit it one more time now you go to
sport look what happens you get very
tachometer centric and you pick up two
more virtual gauges for oil pressure and
oil temperature and your last click over
to the right is the track mode when you
do that you get a hockey stick rpm bar
and you also get your trap times best
previous and current for actual track
runs when you're using your launch
control in combination with that I've
got the best HUD yet on American car
it's quite bright and if I go through
the information button right here I can
change it from the hockey stick tack
traditional tack there my g-forces who
did 1.25 G's wish I was on that ride now
our drive controls the car sitting in
right now has an automatic 6-speed
automatic this is
car they'll sell a lot of but the more
interesting car has an all-new 7-speed
manual well get some time with that in
the road they all have a mode selector
right here which as I showed you changes
up the dash but more than that it
changes twelve parameters of the vehicle
from the tip in of the accelerator
transmission behavior suspension
behavior how the limited-slip behaves is
electronically controlled on this car
and all manner of other things around
the vehicle so it really does change
personality and when the engine bay of
the new vet is an interesting story Tale
of Two Cities one modern one not so much
here's what's modern 6.2 liter v8 the
Corvette and it does have direct
injection for the first time as well as
variable valve timing an active cylinder
management this guy can shut down from
eight to four cylinders I'll talk about
that in a minute here's what's old this
is still an overhead valve pushrod
engine they decided not to go with
overhead cams because of height the
designers wanted to package this nose
nice and low and to add a stack of cams
up here would have brought things up
know about here so the cams buried down
the valley the way it used to be and
keeps the top a little lower doesn't
seem to hurt the numbers inning 455 the
horse 460 foot-pounds of torque
they're the 64 this car about 3,300
pounds comes in around four seconds a
little under four if you get the z51
Performance Package here's the real
payoff they got some good mpg out of
this gun 1729 with an average of 21 and
a big part of that is because this guy
runs on four cylinders as I mentioned
earlier when it can you may think that's
kind of a limp home or a cruising mode
but because this engine is so big four
cylinders of this half of this guy it's
still a pretty Rorty engine so they say
this car can run on four cylinders a lot
even kind of in a performance way
first of all the power delivery on this
guy's real linear thundering but linear
you don't get this big pop at the
beginning you've got a nice even fat
torque and power curve and that's what
Chevy said they did with this guy
increasingly over the sixth-generation
it doesn't come on alarmingly but it
comes on big
I hit that paddle now I'm in rev-match
mode now watch this I go into a
downshift without touching the throttle
that's automatic I didn't do sit and it
matches my rpms now I gotta say this
it's kind of slow I can do it faster
than that but if you're not great at
driving a stick especially with 460 on
tap this is a nice aid now Chevy says
this car in stock trim will turn a G on
the skid pad on the autocross track you
really get a taste to that it's much
more directionally nimble than I recall
a Corvette at least the last time we
drove one a couple of years ago I'll
tell you this the driving dynamics of
this car don't feel dramatically
different than the last bet we had and
there's a reason for that Corvette still
a Corvette the layout is iconic as a
result you're not suddenly gonna have
some mid-engine turbo v6 car with a car
but we're gonna kind of drive the way it
drives
big moves on this car and you can just
come around the corner all day long with
that nice linear power and we're pushing
it and this car feels stuck right down
like a big ol super glue factory leaked
all over
okay some downsides it still is a
relatively shall we say gutsy feeling in
the interior there's quite a bit of
cabin noise the vibration is definitely
well managed though I got to get back
the shifter could be better the clutch
travel is nice but this shifters a bit
much your top three gears I believe are
over dry that's interesting probably an
EPA strategy 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 things get a little
wandering out there it's not as clean as
I like it on that part of the gate and
the rev matching thing like I say I can
do better there's a lack of legroom on
the passenger's side I'm six-two and I
cannot ride comfortably there for more
than about 20 minutes before it's
claustrophobic I can't get enough
legroom and it's still a little bit
tight in here I mean Corvettes are not
known rubbing a lot of space they're not
a big car but something about this big
massive centre structure here seems to
make it more so all day long all day
now the Corvette for all its performance
remains well they want me to say this or
not a value leader about 52 delivered
for your base coupe add $5,000 if you
want it convertible another paltry 2,800
bucks to get to the hotter z51 trim and
a thousand bucks for that clear liftoff
top that's optional above the base
carbon-fiber roof the Corvette has not
changed essential DNA it's a big ol
brawny front-engine rear-drive
being American classic but they've
definitely evolved this car to a point
that many thought it couldn't get just a
few years ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
