here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas I've got
the ZTE iconic phablet and yes that is
actually its name this has a 5.7 inch
display 720p resolution that's a little
bit lower than we've seen on some other
phones of this size but you probably
won't notice too much of a difference in
crispness and sharpness unless you're
holding two phones side by side 1 1080p
HD and this one let's talk about the
design and build for a little bit this
is a unibody design that means you're
not going to be able to take off the
back cover to get to the battery and yes
this is actually made of real aluminum
so it is really nice looking a little
bit heftier the aluminum is complemented
by some soft touch backing at the top
and bottom probably to make for easier
grip this phone has one feature that I
really like that you don't see on a lot
of smart phones these days and that is a
dedicated camera button on the side very
excited to see this here speaking of
cameras you've got an 8 megapixel
shooter on the back with an LED flash on
the front you've got a 1 megapixel
camera of course the 8 megapixel camera
on the rear does capture 1080p HD video
the operating system is Android 4.1
jelly bean so it is a little bit
outdated being a more mid-range device
will find a 1.2 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 processor on here on the
plus side this is a 4G LTE capable
device one thing that's kind of neat in
here is that you can use split screen
action so you can have a nap on the top
and a nap simultaneously running on the
bottom there's no pricing or
availability for this phone yet but it
will be coming to the u.s. at some point
to keep your eyes peeled for more
information on the ZTE iconic phablet
