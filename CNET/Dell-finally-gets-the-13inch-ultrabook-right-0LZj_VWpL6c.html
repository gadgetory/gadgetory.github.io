look at the Dell XPS 13 if that name
sounds familiar that's because we
reviewed in XPS 13 last year and the
original model the year before that and
these systems actually kind of all
looked the same the changes are internal
but they're very important changes
because for a slim 14-inch ultrabook the
first version and even the second
version we're missing some very
important features and I feel like this
time Delmas finally listened to all our
feedback and packed in probably the two
most important things that you need in a
small light portable laptop like this
the first version of the expo Sartine
just had a 1366 x 768 screen very low
res even though it's about a thousand
dollars then they added a 1080p screen
that's really what you want but it
wasn't a touchscreen even though this
was the very beginning of kind of that
Windows 8 touchscreen laptop era in this
new version of the XPS 13 they've
combined that high risk green with a
touch screen so that combined with the
fact that this is a really nicely made
laptop of an aluminum and carbon fiber
body really makes it probably one of the
top and ultrabooks I can think of right
now especially because it's a little bit
smaller than what you think a 13 inch
ultrabook would look like it's smaller
than a macbook air Dell says it's closer
to an 11 inch laptop side if it's quite
there but it's definitely a smaller
footprint than you expect from even a
regular 13-inch system like this it's
also a bit more business friendly than
some of the other ultrabooks out there
it's got a DisplayPort instead of HDMI
that's pretty standard for a business
laptop and you get an optional TPM chip
and that helps your IT department hook
it up to like all your corporate network
stuff attention we've called this the
jokingly the dell book air over the
years because especially when closed it
really looks a lot like a macbook air
and the design hasn't changed in a
couple of years i don't think it needs
it just yet but for right now i'm happy
that they finally have a high res
touchscreen and even at about 1,300
bucks for this particular configuration
that still makes us one of my favorite
current ultrabooks i'm dan ackerman and
that's the dell XPS 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
