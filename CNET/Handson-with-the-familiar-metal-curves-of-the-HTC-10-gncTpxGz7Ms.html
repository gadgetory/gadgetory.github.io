it's called to the HTC ten physically
you can see that this is a quite similar
beast to the previous models it's got
this curving all-metal bat it's got a
5.2 inch display on the front there's a
fingerprint sensor down at the bottom
and here's something new it's got USB
type-c port on the bottom now this runs
on the latest Android marshmallow
software but HTC has made sure it's a
lot more simple to use it's got rid of
some of its own native apps using
Google's apps instead so you don't have
to decide which email client or which
phone or contact client you want to use
it does make the software look nice and
neat right out of the box but there are
a whole load of themes you can choose to
personalize the look of the phone pretty
much as much as you want HTC has been
talking a lot about the camera on the
back of the phone it's got a 12 ultra
pixel camera which apparently uses
larger pixels to bring in more light
it's also got a wide aperture lens all
of which should hopefully mean that your
low-light shots look better than ever
the rear camera can also record video in
4k resolution and around on the front
you'll find a 5 megapixel camera which
is apparently the first front facing
camera to have optical image
stabilization
other features include 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage support for micro SD
cards there's also a battery that HTC
thinks will last for two days and it
will get half of its charge back with
only 30 minutes of charging time there's
sadly no word on price as of yet but we
do expect to hear more in the coming
weeks as this phone is due to go on sale
globally in May</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
