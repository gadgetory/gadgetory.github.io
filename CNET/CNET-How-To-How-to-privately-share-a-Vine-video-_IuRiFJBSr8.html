how-to contributor and today I want to
talk about how to share your vine videos
privately when Twitter launched their
service just yesterday it did not
include a privacy settings so anything
you share in the vine app is completely
public it's not like the private Twitter
profiles now where you have to except
for the request if you want a private
profile those don't exist on vine just
yet but there is a way to privately
share any videos that you make in the
vine app so what you'll need to do is
tap on the video icon
and go ahead and make the vine as you
normally would very good and then you
can review it if you like and then tap
on next and at this point right now that
video is actually saved here your
iPhone's camera below so you can even
back out of this or you can turn off the
string on vine and tap on done or you
can come back here and tap on the X and
then delete post but even though I've
done all of that the vine are just
created is actually in my camera so then
I could take this this line and I can
send it off to someone through email I
could send it post it to Facebook
privately to a select group or I could
send it through iMessage to someone else
so once again this is Jason Cipriani and
that was how to privately share a vine
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
