robot mechanical engineers at Stanford
chose an unusual muse the Gecko we talk
to biologists and I said well okay well
what animals are out there that are that
have really excellent wall climbing
abilities and they're fast they're agile
and so on gecko stands out they can run
at a meter per second up down in any
direction they can work on both smooth
and rough surfaces grad student Elliott
Hawks along with other researchers
developed a substance that like gecko
feet can easily attach and detach two
surfaces repeatedly and it works without
magnets or electricity the adhesive is
made out of silicon rubber so it's it's
not actually sticky
it has a cool property that when you
just touch touch it to the glass it
doesn't feel tacky or sticky at all but
when you put your weight on it it then
engages the invention led to a superhero
moment for hawks these pads equipped
with the adhesive and supports for his
feet turned hawks his hands into gecko
toes letting him scale this 12-foot wall
albeit slowly that had been a goal for a
couple of years and I was very exciting
to get up there and look down all right
we did it if we lift it off with a
rubber band our band doesn't really even
stretch but now we come down here we
wrap the rubber band around the loading
point and pull
the key to the adhesive is a sea of tiny
wedges invisible to the human eye this
silicone model shows what a single wedge
looks like enlarged a hundred times when
you bring it into a surface initially
they're like so and because it's just
the sharp tip of the wedge the contact
area is very small so there's no
adhesion they're not sticky but now if I
apply a shear force they all bend over
like this and suddenly the contact area
is much larger this microscopic feature
gives the adhesive its unique properties
but makes it challenging to produce in
larger quantities we make this adhesive
we make the mold by hand we do micro
machining and then we cast the polymer
into the mold and we make little little
patches you know four by four inches or
ten by ten centimeters at a time it's
sort of a handcraft NASA is exploring
using the adhesive to grab space junk
and the CEO of a car company sees the
potential to streamline windshield
installations they use suction which
leaves a big circular suction mark at
the end which he then has to a whole
nother step to clean afterwards and
since ours doesn't leave any residue he
was very interested in that but don't
cling on to hopes for tapping your inner
spider-man Stanford isn't looking to
license the technology for any climbing
devices in Stanford California
