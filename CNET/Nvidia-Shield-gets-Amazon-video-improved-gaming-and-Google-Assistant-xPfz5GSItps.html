Nvidia shield available now for
pre-order for 200 bucks it's an update
of one of our most powerful streaming
devices that we tested at CNET they've
added a lot of improvements and one of
the biggest is Amazon video that's right
the new Nvidia shield works with the
latest Amazon video apps you get access
to everything you have in Prime
subscription you also get 4k and HDR
video for Amazon that's a big new
addition to the platform the device also
has a new integration with Google
assistance if you have the game
controller on the table in front of you
you don't even need to hold it up to
your mouth to press a button you can
just say ok Google and get all this
integration for a Google home right from
the device itself so you don't even need
the separate Google home controller
other apps support on device include
Netflix before can HD our Google Play
Movies in TV with 4k Vudu Sony
Playstation view and plenty of other
apps of course since the Nvidia product
you get plenty of support for games - in
video streaming service ge force now has
been improved so you get better
resolution on the games and better frame
rates you also get an integration of all
the games in one place there's basically
just an Nvidia gaming app you can get
access not only those game screen games
of your subscriber you can also get apps
for example from Google Play Store
they're optimized the Nvidia shield to
play even better if you have an Nvidia
quick PCL surround the house you can
also stream from that PC to the shield
itself even get integration with shields
big picture mode which is a really cool
feature that could add it again this
year
unlike the previous version this shield
does include both the controller in the
box as well as a little remote control
so you have all those things included
for the $200 price they say they've
improved the game controller they've
added haptic feedback and of course it
has that new ability to listen by a
Google home she'll will also get the
latest version of the YouTube app which
involves 360 video so you can actually
use the gaming controller sticks to
navigate that 360 video it's a really
cool experience on the big screen in
conjunction with the Google assistant
functionality in videos gonna be
launching a 50-dollar device called the
NVIDIA spot ace it's a little microphone
that plugs into a plug in the wall to
extend your voice while always listening
functionality so you can talk and
because some of the Google assistant
from pretty much anywhere in the house
so most of the features I just described
are available now in the box ships but
some of them are going to be available
to coming months especially Google
assistant there's also going to be
rolling out more features and
functionality throughout the rest of the
year that's a quick look at the new
Nvidia shield for 200 bucks available
