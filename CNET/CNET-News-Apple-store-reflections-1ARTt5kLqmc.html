couple centuries so like this so sing
banks and you know ruts piece
I think through apple and iPhone and
everything is gonna leave all
I don't really think that words can
really describe like anything about
Steve other than just greatness it's
just right to do you know to respect a
guy who had given the world so much like
in terms of Technology and you know
rejuvenated a company that was on the
edge of disaster
mr. jobs was a visionary who changed the
world he changed the face of Technology
and his perfectionism shows itself and
everything he did and this is where we
go to recognize what his achievements I
was founder and CEO of an app
development company he made that entire
company possible I wouldn't have been
doing what I was doing for the last few
years if it wasn't for the iphone in his
inventions
i just feel incredibly sad i think the
world over has lost a really incredible
man and a visionary and he will be he'll
be deeply missed he has showed the world
that technology is obtainable there's
the things that they prophesied it in
back to the future and it's different
movies you know this man here came out
and he created it and he gave it to us
you know and it was it was so obtainable
to where every kid you seen had an iPod
he's just one of the best minds of our
generation I mean that's there's no
other way to say I mean he's so affected
our generation so and those younger than
me much you know so deeply because it's
just changed the way they've all
communicated with each other so I can't
there's really there isn't really words
to express how much he's changed Society
it's incredible I was on the train here
and I was like I just had to make a
poster that to show everybody how how I
feel like my thoughts the quotes from
the think different campaign in the 90s
it's the last line said because the
people who are crazy enough to think
they can change the world are the ones
who do and the end he did he changed the
world
