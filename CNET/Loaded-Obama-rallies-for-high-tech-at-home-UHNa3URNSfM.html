Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded during last night's State
of the Union address President Obama's
strongly urged Congress to continue to
fund alternative energy projects
regardless of the risks it's been a
controversial topic since the government
has been giving major loans to clean
energy companies that end up struggling
and filing bankruptcy the most
noteworthy of failures was solyndra a
solar panel manufacturer which received
more than half a billion dollars of
taxpayer money from the Obama
administration four months ago it went
bankrupt and shut down operations during
the address Obama said the payoffs on
these public investments don't always
come right away some technologies don't
pan out some companies fail but I will
not walk away from the promise of clean
energy the president touched on several
technology topics in his address he
suggested that high tech manufacturers
should get double the tax deduction for
making products in the US instead of
manufacturing overseas he also pushed
incentives to support entrepreneurs like
Steve Jobs and encouraged more job
training in tech fields there are twice
as many science and tech job openings
than workers skilled enough to do the
jobs he also called for revamping of the
u.s. immigration system so that students
who graduate from American universities
stay here to staff our labs and start
new businesses if you get wow by those
hand soaps with a little moisturizing
beads in it then I hope you're sitting
down for this one scientists at the
University of Bristol in the UK have
created magnetic soap it's designed to
help clean up oil spills and other
disasters the researchers dissolved iron
atoms into the soap solution the idea is
that soap can be picked up by a magnet
when cleanup is done removing it from
the water and having less of an impact
on the environment if you thought
apple's iphone 4s wasn't a hit think
again apple reported an all-time high in
its quarterly earnings with revenues of
46 billion and profits of 13 billion the
iPhone was the star of the report
selling more than 37 million units apple
also said it sold more than 15 million
iPads that's more than double the ipads
sold the same time last year and apple's
mac computer sales were also at a high
for the first time apple sold more than
5 million Max and a quarter Xbox rumors
are abound as sources tell I GN that the
next xbox game console could hit stores
by fall of next year the new Xbox is
said to have AMD 6000 series graphics
processor have 1080p HD multi-display
output and 3d the next Xbox would have
six times the processing power of the
current xbox 360 and twenty percent
creative performance then Nintendo's
next console the Wii U last month the
rumor mill heated up as Microsoft was
granted a patent for combining a DVR
within a game console those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
