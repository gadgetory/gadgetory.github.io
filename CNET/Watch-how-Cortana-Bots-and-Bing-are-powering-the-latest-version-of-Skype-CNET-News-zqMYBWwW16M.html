soon be able to plan trips chop even
talk to intelligent BOTS all from within
your skype chat and you see I have a
visual video mail from from guru deep
I'm gonna play it Hey I just learned
that you would ask Suki not go that's
again this year congratulations and
you're seeing here there are some new
things in this next generation of Skype
you see this visual video mail so we
have a video message with the transcript
right below this is one of the examples
where we're taking intelligence from
things like Skype translator and
bringing them directly into everyday
features like video messages so in this
next generation I said the other thing
that you'll notice in the canvas is my
personal assistant Cortana is always
there in the upper right hand corner
Cortana is there if I want to talk to
her at one on one or in a group or even
as you can see here she's subtly
improving my messages
by highlighting key points in my text so
now you see Cortana is actually sending
me a private message I'm gonna tap that
and I go into the one-on-one
conversation I have with Cortana so
she's telling me the cups and cake spot
would like to know my location for
delivery and yes I'll share it the agent
Cortana is actually brokering the
conversation with the third party bought
the cups and cakes but now I see this
rich card that is showing me that the
cupcake is on its way and that it will
be here within a few minutes all of this
is happening within my Skype chats this
is just one example of the many ways
that you're going to start seeing
businesses using the power of Skype and
Cortana
to interact with their customers now
since I'm already talking to Cortana and
I've committed to doing this keynote I'm
gonna go ahead and try to plan the rest
of my trip
now Cortana is proactively thinking
about the next steps in coordinating my
trip so she's actually suggesting that I
connect with the Westin but anybody that
knows me knows I normally stay at a
Westin bot and so what you see here now
is Cortana has actually introduced the
Westin bot into the conversation but not
only has she done that she has given the
Westin bot context so I don't have to
repeat myself the Westin bot knows this
is for Dublin and it's for those
particular dates all of this saves me a
lot of time and effort and now because
Cortana has all my relevant details the
Westin bot
actually leave the conversation now
we're seeing a third aspect of Cortana
she knows my connection she knows who I
communicate with and so here you're
seeing her actually suggests that when I
go on this trip to Dublin that I
communicate with my friend Jani and I
see this card I could call her directly
from here or video call her but I don't
know what time it is and so I'm gonna
choose to message her clicking that
takes me to the conversation I have with
Jani the other thing you'll notice is
that Cortana because she has context
about why I'm pinging Jani as she's
pre-populated the text with context
around when I'm going to Dublin and
basically why I want to talk to her so
this is just a glimpse into how Skype
and Cortana powered by Bing can make our
conversations more productive informed
and fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
