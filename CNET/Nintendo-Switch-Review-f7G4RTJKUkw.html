company's first new console in almost
four and a half years and it's a hybrid
console which means this thing right
here is pretty much the entire thing it
can be docks you can use it with your
television or you can take it with you
wherever you go it works really well the
docking and undocking takes just seconds
so I've been using the switch on my
commute every day and it's awesome to be
able to bring a huge game like Zelda
breath of the wild with me wherever I go
and because it boots up so quick you're
never really waiting around for loading
times now you're definitely going to
need a case if you plan on bringing it
around so Nintendo sent me their
official one that goes for $20 but there
will be plenty more at launch from
third-party manufacturers so on a single
charge it's going to give you roughly
two and a half hours and I've been
getting about three with Zelda but
different games are probably going to
give you different battery life
so overall the switch feels great the
screen is really nice it's arguably the
best build quality that's ever come out
of Nintendo leaving the operating system
is really clean quick and smartly laid
out switch lets you play in a number of
different ways you can remove these joy
con controllers from the tablet and use
them in the included grip or just go
commando in either hand they need power
too but they last a while and charge
when they're docked with the tablet my
biggest hang-up with these joy con
controllers or that they're really small
now I've got big hands they felt a
little cramp when they're on the grip
sometimes I wound up hitting buttons
that didn't really mean - thankfully
there is this this is the pro switch
controller it's the best way to play
Zelda but it's 70 damn dollars you could
also use the switch as a tabletop
monitor by propping it up with its
kickstand now a kickstand is not the
best and if you bump into the table
that's resting on it might fall over
it's really only going to work on a hard
flat surface but more importantly it's
going to be tough playing a game further
than like two feet away maybe other
games will fare better but
you can't really read anything when
you're that far away from the screen
it's tough imagining a few people
comfortably crowding around this thing
the way Nintendo had been pitching it
also you can't charge it when it's
standing up you're gonna have to hold it
in your hands so while we're getting
what's likely the best Nintendo launch
game ever we're also getting a fairly
bare-bones launch now we're recording
this a few days before switch comes out
and right now there is no online
features or virtual console to download
legacy titles we also don't know much
about how the switches online service is
going to work but a preview for it is
going to hit later on in March and then
there's the fact that well there aren't
really any compelling games available at
launch but it is great to hear that
Nintendo is working with independent
developers and that they'll be up to 60
indie games for switch by the end of the
year I mean let's be honest zelda is the
highlight here right thankfully though
it's amazing but is it worth getting a
switch just to play it I'm not sure I
mean you're talking three hundred and
sixty dollars to play the new Zelda game
now there's a lot we still don't know
about switch
I like this console a lot because it
delivers on its hybrid pitch there's a
lot of potential here - I can't wait to
play games like Super Mario Odyssey but
because there's still so much that isn't
here the games the online the apps the
Virtual Console it's entirely reasonable
to hold off on a purchase
