first thing that comes to mind might be
something like this from science fiction
or it might look more like this this is
misty - and it's from a company called
misty robotics who want to put one of
these robots in every home in office it
can be anything from a security robot to
a friendly companion to keep an eye on
your elderly relatives when voice
assistance like the Amazon echo first
hit the market no one was really sure
what we'd use them for beyond setting
alarms or playing music fast-forward to
today and we're ordering groceries or
even controlling appliances with our
voice here Siri close the shades but
misty wants to be more than just a voice
assistant her creators see her more like
Rosie from the Jetsons who was a real
part of the family we got to see misty
Bing built and get a sneak peek into the
future of home robots misty has a range
of sensors to detect obstacles and it
can map rooms in 2d and 3d with depth
sensors you can say hymnist II can you
go to the living room and she knows how
to get there there's also a high
resolution camera which we use for
computer vision so for things like face
recognition we go up to misty she knows
who you are I'm gonna take you through a
demo that misty calls receptionist I'm
gonna register my face on misty and then
she is gonna take me to the person that
I'm visiting in this case in so here we
go hi misty are you view to see so
I will show you to them your visitor is
here Thank You misty programmable robots
aren't exactly new and there's growing
competition in the home robot space
Amazon's rumored to be making a home
robot powered by Alexa while the likes
of Buddy peppa and Curie can do many of
the things misty does misty robotics is
a spinoff from Spiro the company that
brought bb-8 and r2d2 to life so it's no
surprise that misty is pretty cute and
personality is one of the ways that
misty is hoping to set itself apart it's
actually one of the hardest parts of the
robot because it's not you know
especially when we have a bunch of
engineers sitting around creating a
personality isn't maybe what comes
naturally to us like we went through
probably 200 different iterations of
different types of eyes to find just the
right ones
so you can kind of look at misty and
understand how she's feeling
eventually misty will be able to respond
to different inputs like your facial
expression or the tone of your voice and
adapt based on these cues it's like
going to a pet adoption center where
there's like the ones that are like
super outgoing and come up and jump
around and then there's like you know
the puppies that are like in the back
and there's more shy and you really find
the one that connects with you like
eventually we think robots are gonna
have those sort of personalities and as
you're interacting with them they're
changing at the moment part of that
personality is showing through Misty's
expressions and sounds even if you've
never seen a line of code before it's
easy to program the robot using blockly
I got misty to roll forward deliver a
cup of coffee and make a sound misty is
modular so you can attach a trailer or
swap out components like the arms for
cup holders the Arduino back pack powers
lots of different projects like this
touch screen so you can feasibly 3d
print almost anything
misty and it would work once you had it
basically plugged in yep absolutely
what's the craziest thing that you've
seen so far I mean I love the LED mohawk
that's probably the craziest one future
versions will add to this modular
concept the misty 3 might even be able
to pick things up and move them around
for now misty is really targeted to
developers and students whether or not
people find a use for home robots in
general remains to be seen especially if
they end up costing hundreds or even
thousands of dollars misty 2 is set for
release in December 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
