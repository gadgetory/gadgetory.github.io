editor here at seen it today I'm going
to talk to you about mountain lion which
is the latest version of Max OS 10 so
I'll walk you through a few of those
first is notifications well on the Mac
you actually take to your two fingers
place it on the end of the pad and drag
it over and you'll see a notification so
I have one missed message there and then
you can just slide it back now we do
have notes as well the experience is
about the same but the bigger screen
allows you a little more space so you
can see all your notes here on the side
can drop photos in and you get multiple
notes you got a lot more space for
typing so basically the same as what
you're used to on iOS but just here in
OS 10 the next app will talk about is
messaging now this replaces I chat so
you see that interface is a lot similar
you know the messages appear on either
side and the little bubbles bigger space
of course means more so you can see all
your chats here on the side you can drag
in photos you can drag in contacts you
can drag in videos so they will all be
sent as long as you're online you can
chat with an iphone so an iphone phone
number or you can use an email address
if they use in an ipad or an ipod touch
next tap is reminders this is another
thing you'll get you'll notice from iOS
5 you can see the full calendar over
here so you can just click on individual
days and it can show you the reminders
for those days you can make new list you
can set by time by day so you'll get a
reminders unlike iOS though there is no
geofence hear something that's really
more appropriate for a strictly mobile
device anyway you're also going to find
and hands Twitter integration click on
that it has a little notepad and there's
a little paper clip and it puts it all
in so very easy to use nice to be able
to have that few other things that come
Newman with mountain lion vs. share
sheets that enables you to share links
photos directly from the app so saves a
lot of steps you also have Game Center
integrations so that's a lot deeper
integration and you do have something
called gatekeeper which is enhanced
security features from Apple developers
can also sign up for a unique ID so they
have an apple developer IDs and so then
it's sort of given a level of security
so that's nice last couple things are
airplay mirroring that enables you to
take whatever is on your mac link it to
apple TV and put it on a TV screen I
can't show you that because it's not
enabled yet on this particular laptop
but we'll be able to look at that later
and of course there's I cloud
integration
so this is really about unifying the
user experience whether you're on a Mac
whether you're on a mobile device iPad
whatever it might be so that is
developers build a mountain lion the
latest version of Mac OS 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
