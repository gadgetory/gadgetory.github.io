week you've probably heard a lot about
Reddit if you're confused why it's in
the news this video is for you so let's
start with what exactly reddit is right
it is a website where people share
articles photos videos and stories with
others who then vote them up and down
all of this content is submit to
subreddits which are sections for
specific interests and topics there is
literally a subreddit for everything in
anything one for funny memes another to
talk about movies and even one to share
the deep thoughts you may have in the
shower one of the most popular sections
is to ask me anything subreddit here
users could ask people like Al Gore Bill
Gates and even President Barack Obama
anything they wanted now this is
Victoria Taylor Taylor was largely
responsible for acting as a liaison
between celebrities and the mods of
running to ask me anything subreddit she
was fired without reason on July 2nd the
reddit community was already on edge
following recent changes that resulted
in some subreddits being banned in an
attempt to curb harassment but it was
Taylor's firing that led to a huge
revolt because each subreddit is
controlled by unpaid moderators they
have the power to set the sub Reds they
control to private mode which
essentially shuts down reddit itself it
all started with the AMA section going
private and then more than ten other
very popular sovereigns hollowed even
singer Lorde got involved with the drama
tweeting that rule number one in the PR
handbook was always victorious days the
protest lasted about two days and
received mainstream media attention
reddit head Ellen Pao made statements
depressed and not read it directly which
ticked read it off even more
it wasn't until July 5th Pao admitted on
reddit that management quote/unquote
screwed up and made mistakes over the
past few years she also announced a new
moderator advocate position to work with
the mods and to better communicate with
them meanwhile memes like this one and
this one continue to pop up on the site
mocking the apology there was also a
petition calling for Ellen Pao to resign
as the head of reddit which garnered
more than 200,000 signatures and while
that may sound like a lot of people it's
really about 1% of the nearly 164
million people
who visit reddit each month whether the
petition worked or not
POW on July 10th resigned from reddit
and was replaced by none other than
Steve Hoffman a co-founder of Reddit and
the site's original CEO many users
appear to welcome Steve back with open
arms but the relationship between the
corporate side of Reddit and the
community still has a long way to go are
you a reddit user tell us how you feel
about what happened in the past few
weeks in the comments section below
