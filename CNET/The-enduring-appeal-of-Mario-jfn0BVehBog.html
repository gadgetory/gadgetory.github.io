can you tell me his name Mario Mario
definitely it's Mario grew up with that
guy Mario dos Mario it's Mario indeed
the dungarees wearing gaming icon that
for decades has endured as the
mustachioed mascot for an entire
industry but how did the world's most
recognizable plumber leak to such heady
heights and as video games grow up how
of Mario's cartoonish antics continue to
represent the very best that the medium
has to offer
japan 1981 and an almost 100 year old
company called Nintendo is expanding
into the booming market for Electronic
Entertainment with its latest arcade
wander Donkey Kong the game's director
Shigeru Miyamoto had only a few pixels
in which to animate his protagonist
Mario who was originally called jump man
in fact if you're wondering why Mario
looks the way he does it really is a
direct consequence of being only 16
pixels tall why does mario have a
mustache because it saves on animating a
mouth why does he wear a hat so you
don't have to try and make hair out of
only a few pixels the colored overalls
they made Mario's limited running
animations easier to see the finished
product was an endearing plucky little
plumber and Mario soon spread into other
Nintendo games including early game and
watch titles and Donkey Kong jr. which
featured Mario's only role as a bad guy
if getting dropped kicked by a gorilla
isn't a humble origin I don't know what
is but Mario's fame grew his cheery face
becoming inextricably linked with a
phenomenon that was changing the gaming
industry the rise of the home console
Mario's big break was the legendary
Super Mario Brothers for the Nintendo
Entertainment System a perfectly honed
platformer this title set the tone for
Mario's 2d adventures from the precision
mechanics to the cutesy enemies
power-ups and insanely memorable theme
music the work of longtime Nintendo
composer Koji Kondo
the thing that I always gets me excited
to my marrow is the music it's so it's
really iconic and it's so catchy and
everybody knows it and you know we can
be sitting in the office and someone
will just go denon in an in it and
everyone will join in it's this sort of
touchstone that everybody has in that
childhoods everyone can join in everyone
can sort of remember what it was like to
play those games and it's just sort of
this really nice think it's quite rare
as well you can't me say that about many
games over mario super mario brothers
would rack up sales of over 40 million
propelling Mario to international fame
but the game did something much more
significant it helped save the gaming
industry still reeling from a massive
crash in 1983 the reason why the great
the industry crash happened is because
so many companies for releasing so many
utterly terrible games and these weren't
just like bad games as in like oh
there's a bug in this room it was like I
don't know what is this a game I dunno
what i'm doing here is this i was dumb
but this is fun and intended came out
with a console home console that seems
to work very well and a game that
appeared to be good of all things in
fact very good and I think that turn
them up he was head so oh people are now
making fun games again the fun games
kept coming Super Mario Brothers 2 was
released in 1988 followed by super mario
land in 1989 which was set to be bundled
with the Gameboy hand held until
Nintendo decided to go with Tetris
instead the early 90s brought Super
Mario Brothers 3 and super mario world
while the booming popularity of the
brothers themselves saw the cast of
regulars expand as well as spin-off
appearances including a somewhat
ill-judged movie in 1993 and the
entirely surreal Super Mario Brothers
Super Show sitcom do the mario swing
your arms from side to side come on it's
time to go
demario like beanie babies or the
Macarena larios time in the Sun could
easily event it in the 90s say for a
single title look once more
revolutionized the industry and proved
how far video games as a medium had yet
to evolve released in 1996 Super Mario
64 was nothing short of a technical
marvel putting Nintendo's 2d character
into a vibrant fully explorable 3d world
one of gaming's first and still one of
its best if the processing power of the
new nintendo 64 console made the game
technically possible it was the
ingenious camera system and flexible
controls that made it a joy to play
successfully making the transition to 3d
proved that Mario and Nintendo had real
staying power something that sadly not
every video game icon at the 90s really
managed ah who knew what 3d gaming is
gonna be like and merciful came out and
everyone went oh it's gonna be like this
and not only were these games you know
be very different from what the Mario's
that we normally expect they were very
very good I think it allowed Nintendo to
use the weight and the respect the brand
on to other games so they've been made
very tennis very party paper mario mario
golf the crucial thing is all those
games also brilliant so if you're
looking for a single reason for Mario's
enduring success is that his face has
become synonymous with a certain level
of video gaming quality that's down to
Nintendo's cautious controlling approach
when it comes to its stars a mindset
that's very much at odds with the
broader entertainment industry where pop
culture is increasingly built out of
heavily franchised multi-platform media
empires Nintendo own some of the most
beloved characters in the cultural
pantheon but so far doesn't seem that
bust about branching out you know if
they're feeling quite frivolous still
make and a Mario amiibo tweet thing
that's as far as I'll go that's when
they let in their hair down
who has now lasted 30 years you don't
stay relevant for 30 years if you start
smearing a face on a lunch box you know
they like to keep they like to stick to
games they like to stick to a few
releases and they like to make it great
and I think that's why that's why even
though that the Nintendo may seem out of
step that's actually why they're
successful with care and caution
Nintendo has managed to build mario into
more than just a symbol for platforming
or his parent company but into a
figurehead for what games are at their
best honest uncomplicated fun and the
longer Nintendo can keep churning out
high-quality Mario action the more fond
memories it creates and the stronger
Mario becomes there's a baseline of
Marianas like that everyone can relate
to so music the gameplay the aesthetic
all these games sort of hold on to what
makes Mario special but are also unique
in their own way so he's managed to stay
relevant and knowing that but popular
from 30 years and of course it would
hardly be fair not to mention Mario's
often forgotten brother Louis but it
looks like we're out of time here to you
Mario keep on entertaining us and
viewers let us know your fondest Mario
memories or what you want to see the
character do next and stay tuned to seen
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
