TV but don't want to give up too many
channels or the ability record stuff to
watch later Sony has a great option the
PlayStation View TV service has been
available in a few cities for the last
year but it's just one nationwide it
also costs less than before and you
don't even need a Playstation to use it
let's take a look the first thing to
know about view is that just like sling
TV and Netflix it streams TV shows over
the internet so it requires a fast
connection Sony specifies at least 10
megabits per second the second is that
it costs different amounts depending on
where you live in the US if you're in
one of seven major metropolitan areas
including New York San Francisco and
Miami
it starts at 40 bucks per month and
offers live local channels namely ABC
CBS Fox and NBC if you live somewhere
else
it starts at 30 bucks but those local
channels are on demand only beyond
locals views channel selections very
robust but most of the channels you're
used to plenty of on-demand and ketchup
shows and even some regional sports
networks on some packages the third
thing you know is it view works just
like a full service cable TV package
complete with a cloud DVR and the
ability to watch a bunch of different
TVs in the house simultaneously it's
easy to tag shows to record later which
basically sets up a season pass to
record every show that airs you can
pause and rewind live TV the
fast-forward past commercials on
recorded shows although it's not quite
as responsive on a standard DVR I also
love views innovative menu system which
prioritizes individual shows over
channels just like Netflix you can even
create up to five profiles for different
family members you can watch by any
PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4 console
but if you don't have one you can also
sign up and use view with an Amazon fire
TV box or fire TV stick in fact I
actually preferred using the fire TV box
in many ways especially because remote
is easier to use than the PlayStation
controller there's also an app for iPad
and iPhone which can also work with
chromecast
in my experience playstation view work
very well with good video and audio
quality and no major delays or buffering
issues on my fast internet connection
it's definitely more expensive than
alternatives like sling TV but it's
excellent features and channel access to
a long way to ease the pain of cord
cutting and the fact there's no contract
or hidden fees and you can try it or
cancel anytime is icing on the cake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
