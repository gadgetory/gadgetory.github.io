general I think social media is just for
losers to feel like they important they
get to voice their pain on every single
thing in the world that's probably some
good quality to it but the problem is we
made it where every loser out there gets
divorces to pay on every subject in the
world and everybody opinion doesn't
matter unfortunately and unfortunately
the more success you have the more hate
comes at you at different times so I
have chosen to eliminate all social
media from my world
now is there any tech things that you
like to use or you even use anything
like uber or anything like that you got
to use uber you got to use your computer
I mean that's some great stuff out there
I got just saying I don't do Twitter
Facebook and Instagram and that type of
crap listen you can't survive in this
world without technology and it's
getting bigger and better every year
okay Charles I've got something to show
you here okay I'm not gonna freak you
out here when we talk about technology
and it's a combination of maybe two
you're one of your favorite worlds have
you have you seen these you know what
these might be I think is that the laces
up like yes it's the self Lacey - now
what what if this existed back in your
day I mean it's silly stupid listening
you know I'm starting to get nervous
with America is the greatest country in
the world but now we got everybody is so
lazy now we've got a self-driving cars I
like if you're too lazy to lace up your
own shoes or something wrong with you
like we're making things so easy for
Americans the other countries are
passing us baka we're just so stupid and
lazy
we got the first of all I love Mikey yes
I but I don't need anybody lacing my
shoes I've never if I ever get that lazy
I like to do stuff I cut my own grass
that's important yeah I watched my own
clothing but we got to quit making stuff
so easy for America that's why we're so
fat and lazy
all right a Charles thanks so much thank
you all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
