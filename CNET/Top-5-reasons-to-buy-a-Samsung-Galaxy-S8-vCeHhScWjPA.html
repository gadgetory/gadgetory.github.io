the Samsung Galaxy s8 you're looking for
an excuse to upgrade your phone to
Samsung's new fancy flagship aren't you
well here are five and number five fix
me yeah this one's a bit of a stretch
I'll admit it however Samsung must
really believe in this thing because
they dedicated a frigging button to it
additionally the company will integrate
technology from viv in the future viv
was built by the same people who made
Siri down the road it could be pretty
great
and number for convenience I'm going to
lump in a few little things that makes
the s8 a smart buy it's got a headphone
jack unlike some other phones out there
Samsung even throws in a pair of fancy
AKG headphones in the box the s8 also
has the option of iris scanning to
unlock the device
plus there's USB C to connect the device
to all kinds of things that brings us to
number three desktop mode a really
important note this does require the
Samsung Dex accessory if you've ever
wanted to carry just one device for
pretty much everything the s8 with the
Dex might be a great idea we've seen
this kind of thing attempted before but
Samsung has Adobe and Microsoft working
on apps optimized for its desktop
experience those are some pretty
powerful partners and number two the
insides there are a lot of great phones
out there right now but the Galaxy s8
will pack a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 or a
Samsung Exynos 88-90 5 in benchmarks
they're both crazy fast on top of that
the Galaxy s8 will be able to support
gigabit LTE speeds
there's also Bluetooth 5.0 inside that
has a longer range and can carry way
more data than older versions and the
number one design look at this thing it
looks like a design from the future
small bezels everywhere means you get a
huge screen in a relatively compact body
and if you're wondering if apps will be
weird on that screen Google has told
Android developers to update their apps
to take advantage of that new aspect
ratio the s8 also brings the edge design
to all Galaxy S users and that comes
along with a whole set of cool features
as well if you're looking for reasons
not to buy the s8 check out top 5 calm
