this is a review of the panasonic UT 50
plasma if you're looking to buy a
television in 2012 I have no hesitation
in recommending a Panasonic Plasma based
on the performance of two TVs we've seen
so far this year the st 50 and the UT 50
the st 50 is a stunning TV for the money
and the UT 50 is almost identical and
yet it's three hundred dollars cheaper
both tvs shared the crystal edge design
which is a little dated compared to this
year's metallic models but still look
attractive UT 50 is essentially a
cut-down st 50 and features just two
HDMI ports which may not suit users with
a lot of electronics the most important
difference though is that the TV lacks
the st 50s louver filter this means the
UT 50 screen doesn't perform as well in
a little room with muddy blacks but turn
the lights off and the picture looks
stunning blacks are incredibly deep and
while colors don't look that good on a
graph thanks to a lack of professional
controls they look stunning on the
screen as this is an entry level screen
you'd expect to lack some of the more
modern features but no it still has
smart TV via ethernet and optional
wireless adapter and 3d playback if you
stumped up for the glasses if you do buy
those glasses the 3d performance is only
just possible though with a fair bit of
eye strain inducing crosstalk in the
future when we talk about truTV bargains
I think the you 250 and st 50 will crop
up as benchmarks at 1400 for the 55 inch
GT 50 as far as I'm concerned there's no
real reason to pay that much more for a
high-quality television this television
comes in a choice of sizes too from the
forthcoming 42 inch up to 60 inches as
far as I'm concerned they all seem to be
terrific buys I'm try Pendlebury and
this has been the Panasonic UTV
