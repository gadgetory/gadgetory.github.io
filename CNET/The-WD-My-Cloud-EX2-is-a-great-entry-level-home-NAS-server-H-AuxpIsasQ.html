only my cloud eh soo from WT this is the
latest in the my cloud serie from WD
very similar to previous my craft that I
review a while back now these two are
very similar in terms of features they
both very easy to you home networks or
device and they both can host data to
share with your network and also for you
to access over the Internet
known as personal cloud they are also
both support vector machine natively but
the ext here has a few things of his own
now first this one here is a duo bein a
server meaning it comes with two hard
drives on the inside instead of just one
and that means you can mirror the two
hard drive to each other in a red one
set up and that means if one of the
drive fails everything is still fine you
just need to replace it and thing
continue to be okay now it's very easy
to replace the hard drives on the inside
with the ex2 the top is also the driver
impressed right here you open it and now
the hard drive can be removed without
any tool now you can also combine a to
hard drive on inside in a red zero
configuration if you want to get the
most capacity but in that case there is
no protection and let it be known you
living life just a little bit too
dangerously if one of the drives fail
you lose everything now for now the x2
here is available with hard drives of up
to 40 by each and that means at most you
get up to a terabyte in rate 0 or 40 by
in rate 1 if that's not enough you can
always resort to is two USB 3.0 put on a
back here to add more external hard
drives to either expand the service
capacity or backup the service content
which you debit should do if you decide
to use a server in red 0 now the last
thing that make this new server here a
great upgrade to the previous one is the
performance in my testing using a
gigabit connection via is network portal
back here the server offer more than 70
megabytes per second for writing and
more than 100
per second for reading now that's by far
the fastest in Napoli's my class series
and also among the fastest among dual
based servers on the market so now the
question is how much did you pay for
this new server here I'm happy to report
that it's also one of the most
affordable with a suggested price
ranging from just $200 with no hardware
included to up to 500 seven dollars with
a terabyte
you can expect the strip right to be
even lower in a near future the server
works with any standard desktop SATA
hard drive from any store it banners and
come with a three-year warranty from WD
now for more on this ax tune a server
check out my full review a SATCOM
oh by the way I tested it only in red
one which is the only way you should use
it or any Duan bein a server for that
matter why well how about because I say
so and that's because I'm don't know and
this has been the first look as the my
cloud ex2 Nass server from WD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
