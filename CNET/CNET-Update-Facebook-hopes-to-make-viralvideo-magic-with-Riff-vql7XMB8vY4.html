to download I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your scene that update hey kids
there's another way for you to create
and share video on social media if
periscope meerkat vine and snapchat
weren't enough for you now Facebook has
riff it's a new app for making short
videos with your friends that are about
a single topic on riff you can start a
fresh topic or jump into an existing
topic someone else started so let's say
it's about bananas you record 20 seconds
of a video about a banana and if your
friend jumps in and then his or her
friends seat and they jump in the next
thing you know there are 100 videos
about a banana on Facebook and that
makes Facebook happy because more people
are uploading video and that means the
network can make more money from
advertisers so the next time a viral
video of movement comes along like the
ice bucket challenge or the Harlem shake
maybe it'll take off on riff or maybe
people will just keep using their phone
to record video and upload it manually
to Facebook yeah how boring in other
news Nintendo has announced a new wave
of amiibo figurines going on sale but
some characters are sold exclusively at
certain stores among the characters
coming out on may 29th our pac-man Wario
Charizard and Jigglypuff a total of
fifteen will be out in September
including dr. Mario similar to
skylanders and Disney infinity you put
these little characters on a sensor to
play them in a game in the fall there
will also be little Yoshi's made with
actual yarn to play in the game Yoshi's
woolly world Nintendo has sold more than
5.7 million of these amiibo figurines
and these toys will also unlock a short
demo of a classic Nintendo game from NES
or Super NES and you can buy them in the
Virtual Console store in mobile news
google is giving you one less reason to
log into google plus a major perk of the
social networking app is that it
automatically saves an online backup of
your phones photos but now Google is
adding this photo backup ability to
another app the Google Drive app for iOS
and Android Google Drive can
automatically save copies of your photos
and videos from your smartphone or
tablet also your photos from Google Plus
will
we'll show up in Google Drive it looks
like Google's taking steps to separate
Google's photo services from Google+ and
Dyson has a new space looking blade free
fan that also purifies air it's called
the pure cool the purifying fan has a
360 degree glass HEPA filter that's
supposed to filter out ultrafine
particles including cigarette smoke its
first coming to China and Japan and
there's no price yet for the US but it's
safe to say that it'll be more money
than you want to spend about three
hundred to four hundred and fifty
dollars that's your tech news update for
Moorhead to cnet com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
