Korean wireless charging countertop
installed at the CNET smart home I was
pretty stoked I was imagining something
like coming in every day dropping my
keys and phone on the countertop
anywhere and just having it charged all
day while I was going about my daily
activities but that's not really how it
ended up working instead of the whole
countertop having charging functionality
there are two chargers that are affixed
to the bottom of the countertop and that
you have to place your phone directly
over in order to wirelessly charge them
each of those chargers will set you back
about 200 bucks now more recent Android
films already allow for wireless
charging so you'll just have to set them
directly on that spot but iPhones and
other phones that don't support wireless
charging require having this qi wireless
charger plugged into them which kind of
defeats the purpose now for 200 bucks
each these chargers should be top of the
line the problem is they're really not
finding the sweet spot where your phone
connects with the charger is pretty easy
with Android phones but with iPhones it
takes 2 or 3 minutes every single time
that pretty much eliminates any
convenience that you would imagine
getting from a wireless charger
especially one that's nestled in your
countertop if you want a wireless
charging countertop here's my advice for
you buy your new countertop drill out
the bottom of it by your own wireless
charger for a fraction of the price of
these attach it to the bottom and you'll
have something that's more affordable
and probably more reliable than these
ones here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
