house of mouse Disney announced it was
purchasing a large chunk of assets from
21st Century Fox 450 4.2 billion dollars
of its stock in a mega deal worth sixty
six point 1 billion dollars it's one of
the biggest moves in the film business
with almost all of Fox headed to the
Walt Disney Company including its movie
and TV studios entertainment cable
channels and intellectual properties the
only assets not part of the deal are Fox
News the Fox broadcast channel Fox
Sports 1 and the company's real estate
portfolio the news comes as Disney
attempts to grow and launch its own
streaming services as competitors to
options like Netflix it might be a geeks
dream merger since it brings the rights
to ip's like x-men and Fantastic Four
under Disney's watchful eye but there
are also critics of the deal who say
it's anti-competitive this purchase
eliminates one of the six major studios
in Hollywood and in 2016
Fox and Disney combined for over 40% of
market share so the merger could be
considered dangerously close to monopoly
territory Disney CEO Bob Iger lauded the
deal in a statement saying quote we're
excited about this extraordinary
opportunity to significantly increase
our portfolio of well-loved franchises
and branded content to greatly enhance
our growing direct-to-consumer offerings
unquote it remains to be seen whether
the Department of Justice will approve
the sale Tiger expects the review to
last 18 months but if the pact holds
it's expected to dramatically alter the
landscape of entertainment what do you
