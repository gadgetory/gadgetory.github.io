fans can breathe a sigh of relief and
rejoice at the fact that their favorite
brows are no longer Sun hi I'm Seth
Rosenblatt prasena and today we're
taking a look at what's hot and what's
not in Internet Explorer 10 IE 10 comes
in two flavors on Windows 8 Metro mode
and desktop mode IE 10 desktop mode is
basically identical to what you'll see
for IE 10 on windows 7 something that
you've got to know about IE 10 on
Windows 8 though is that touch is simply
put fantastic websites feel like mobile
apps in Metro mode the interface is
hidden until you swipe towards the
center your tab bar lives on top and
your location bar is on the bottom
there's a new feature called flip ahead
which when it's activated lets you skip
to the next page of a multi-page story
or gallery automatically there are big
tabs and icons in the IE 10 frequently
visited and favorites in IE 10 live just
above the location bar a new change and
pin sites in IE 10 allows you to pin a
tile into the Windows 8 Start screen IE
10 can also automatically detect when a
site has a complimentary Windows 8 app
like Bing ie 10 is blazingly fast and it
has very good privacy protection thanks
to do not track being on by default and
it's tracking protection lists which are
available in desktop mode security is
strong in IE 10 thanks to smart screen
which scans or downloads before you run
them not all is perfect on IE 10 though
it works only on windows 7 and 8 the
three of you still using Vista you're
stuck on IE 9 and people still on
windows XP or as I like to call them the
phalanx of The Walking Dead can only get
up to IE 8 like the rest of Windows 8
some preferences in IE 10 are in Metro
but all of them are in desktop that's a
little bit confusing pin sites are not
like bookmarks if you change your
default browser they still open in IE
and frequently visited and favorites
appear horizontally making it difficult
for people who've got a ton of the
despite its flaws ie10 is the best
browser that Microsoft has ever made
Bar None it's got the best Windows 8
integration around which is very
important however we'd like to see some
more refinements before we recommend it
more enthusiastically we've seen that
I'm Seth Rosenblatt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
