your iphone 4 update it's Friday July 16
i'm natali del conte and it's time to
get loaded Apple CEO Steve Jobs took the
stage in the San Francisco Bay Area
today to discuss iphone 4 antenna issues
he admitted the iphone 4 does have some
replicate able antenna and reception
problems but he said that reported
dropped calls on iphone 4 were happening
less frequently than dropped calls on
iphone 3gs so it happens enough to have
a press conference but not as often as
the last phone okay then Apple solution
is that they will give away free bumpers
to iphone 4 users and refund the money
of anyone who has already bought a
bumper they will also waive a restocking
fee so if you want to return the phone
you get the full refund we already knew
that job said they're continuing to
research this issue so that it won't
persist in future phones he also said
that this antenna issue happens in all
phones but they are getting enough
bellyaching about it an iphone for that
they are offering something for free not
to mention the fact that their stock has
dropped because of bad press this week I
would say this is a pretty grandiose way
to respond to a very small problem that
happens to a small amount of users but
at least they're talking about it enough
that we did an entire show about it this
afternoon so there you have it the
reason Apple called an impromptu press
conference you can read more about it at
cnet com that's your news for now thank
you for watching i'm natali del conte
with cnettv and you
him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
