buzz report and now for the gap of the
week the gadget of the week is the new
fantasy fs9 underwater housing for the
nikon coolpix s 9 airtight plastic case
for a camera that lets you take all the
photos you want underwater it's awesome
for snorkeling and I got the chance to
try one out during a recent Beach
vacation check out the results damn you
waterproof sunscreen damn you and now
for the news we in the technology world
are also often space geeks so I've been
carefully following the story of Lisa
Nowak a formerly high-flying astronaut
who's now accused of attempted
first-degree murder in the apparent
culmination of a love triangle gone
horribly wrong it seems that Noah
allegedly drove 900 miles in diapers
packing a knife a steel mallet a wig a
trench coat and four feet of rubber hose
allegedly tracked down her love rival
pepper sprayed her and would have tried
to kill her if police had not intervened
apparently Nowak and her alleged victim
were both dating the same man who is
himself a space shuttle pilot you know
this is really a sad and age-old story
such a promising successful woman
brought low by sexual jealousy and you
know there's an important lesson to be
learned here space makes you crazy a new
york state senator wants to ban the use
of iPods and other electronic devices in
crosswalks which he says is extremely
dangerous yes but what would that do to
our hopes of having Beatles music show
up on iTunes someday I mean
yes you've probably heard that after
nearly 30 years Apple and the beatles
have settled their legal battle over the
use of the Apple name trademarks and
logos under the new agreement apple
computer will own everything and they'll
license some of it back to apple core
The Beatles company now the deal made
many believe that the Beatles would soon
relented allowed digital distribution of
their music on iTunes but see everyone
thinks the Beatles are the ones holding
up this process but I have access to
some inside information that suggests
it's Apple who doesn't really want to
get involved in handling the beatles
catalog see there's still this one major
sticking point that's making Steve Jobs
keep his distance see what I'm saying
Microsoft has dramatically raised the
prices for its tech support for Windows
Vista after the first 90 days of free
tech support the price for calling for
help will go up from thirty-five dollars
to $59 Wow but hey there is a silver
lining here I mean it's a good bet that
any problems you have with Vista will be
caused by one of its no doubt thousands
of source code bugs and those calls are
free I'm Hollywood and this has been the
buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
