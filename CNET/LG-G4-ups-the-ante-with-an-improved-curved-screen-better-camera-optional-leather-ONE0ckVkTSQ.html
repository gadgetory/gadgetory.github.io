remarkably good phone the g4 is the
sequel and this one sports a few new
features that could put her over the top
it has a 5.5 inch display like before
with the 2560 x 1440 resolution but LG
is claiming IPS quantum technology here
the first of its kind they said which
allows better color accuracy better
brightness and better contrast than
before it's also slightly curved not as
much as the flex but you will notice it
and it provides just a little bit of
extra contour to your face the g4s back
design will come in several different
variants a metal one one with ceramic
paint and one that uses vegetable dyed
leather and elegant stitching those
backs are replaceable and underneath you
can find a replaceable 3,000 milliamp
battery there's also a microSD card slot
replaceable batteries are a rarity in
phones now so it's nice that this has it
this has a new qualcomm snapdragon 808
processor that LG claims is fast enough
to get the job done especially compared
to the competition there are also brand
new cameras on the g4 16 megapixel rear
camera with improved low light levels a
larger sensor better optical image
stabilization and manual mode including
the ability to shoot and save in raw the
front camera is 8 megapixel and will
also allow you to do special time
selfies with gestures the LG g4 runs the
latest variant of Android lollipop
they're also a couple of extra smart
software features including event pocket
which adds calendar entries from
Facebook and from areas around you
directly into your calendar the LG g4 is
coming out in Korea on april twenty
ninth and should be available in the US
some around the end of May or early June
at a price that LG says will be similar
to the g3 stay tuned for more i'm scott
