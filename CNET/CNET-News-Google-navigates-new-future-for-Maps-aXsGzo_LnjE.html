the exact same map what would it be
awesome if you could build billions of
maps one for every user and not only
that I map that adapt to what you do a
map build for you I just moved here
about a year ago this is a nice
neighborhood and it was an exciting time
as I got to explore a new area and I
love exploring and so one of the first
things I did a search for restaurants
and this is our new search experience no
more just ten pins all the results are
labeled directly on the map this makes
exploring really fast and easy and the
top results they come with a useful
description that gives you a flavor of
the place so you can make decisions very
quickly no need for cross-referencing
everything is right there on the map the
map is the user interface now of course
this is all the way how you can find
restaurants you can ask your friends and
now you can do that directly in the new
google maps we added a filter and now
you see those search results are all the
sushi places that my friends have
reviewed the key to hear that my friend
Stephanie likes and these are new cards
they summarize everything that is
important about this place but earlier I
was talking about imagery and you see
those three photos and I love this part
let's take a closer look
so but I know my friends kids and they
will definitely want to explore more now
that's going to be really easy because
now all the landmarks is he on the map
are related to the landmark to the
Randall museum and so they're all about
kids in museums you can see the cartoon
art museum you can see their walt disney
museum and when we click on that you get
a whole new map with new places to
explore so we can click on the
exploratorium and when we click on
exploratorium another map appear so we
can keep going and going this is a great
way to explore new places the map is the
user interface great using is that we
directly compare driving the public
transit on the map before we showed you
the next three departures but now we are
going to look at every departure every
second for the entire next week and
summarize that for you and if you want
more details you can use our new
schedule viewer so let's take a trip so
this is a really nice 3d model of the
st. Peter's Basilica but can we have a
more realistic view
no plugins no downloads this is the
google earth experience right there on a
browser that's not all you see this row
of images at the bottom these are other
great views of that area that makes it
really easy to explore and the beauty of
this place is really on the inside so
let's go on a tour this is a 3d photo
tour that is automatically generated
from user uploaded photos so we'll only
get better and better so we jump back
out and that's assuming out and you're
leaving the Earth's atmosphere you can
see the whole world and those clouds
they're real time
but we can go further that this is the
earth traveling through space and you
can see the stars in the Milky Way at
the right position and as the Sun sets
behind the earth the night lights come
out and this is the future of Judah
