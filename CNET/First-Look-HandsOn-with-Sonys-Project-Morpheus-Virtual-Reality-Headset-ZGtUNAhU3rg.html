com and check this out on my head you
know what this is this is Sony's project
Morpheus this is their dev kit their
first ever virtual reality headset now
we've seen things from oculus rift and
Sony's also had their own hmz series of
a headset to watch video but this is a
full immersive virtual reality
experience and right now the project
Morpheus this is not the final name this
is not the final prototype but this is
their first proof of concept it's done
really well you know over all the weight
on my head it wasn't too heavy and then
there's space in between where my eyes
are on the modder so overall it felt
pretty comfortable now this headset does
need to work in conjunction with a ps4
it's not stand alone it'll connect
hardwired right now through hdmi and USB
so they're hoping in the future to make
a wireless version but right now this is
set to work with your PlayStation 4 and
then also to enhance the experience
you'll have the motion controllers the
PlayStation Move also the PlayStation
camera they all work in a harmony to
create a really immersive virtual
reality experience now some of the other
things and the challenges that they have
here is that they want to create a world
that feels real that sounds real when i
was playing this castle game i was able
to interact with a night with swords
with a crossbow and with the dragon and
other aspects of this is it supports
full 360-degree audio so depending on
where you are you'll hear the different
sounds now this dev kit again it's not
the final version but it does support a
90 degree viewing angle from where you
are also it's 1080p LCD displays in the
headset and then you can rotate a full
360 degrees to really be in a world of
your own now the thing with this VR
headset is this not looked as an
accessory Sony and others like oculus
rift are really trying to make this a
platform it's really a genre that is yet
to be defined so it's going to come down
to the content and the games that
support this now sony has no official
release date they've said they're trying
to get this out to the public as soon as
possible with the highest fidelity
quality of image also the lowest latency
so that when you move around the world
feels real and there's not any of that
motion blur that I experienced a little
bit time to time but really it's an
immersive device it has a long ways to
go but this is just the start it's gonna
get a whole lot better so for cnet.com
i'm brian Tong with your first look at
Sony's project Morpheus
