TechRepublic and I'm bill detwiler had
technology editor of techrepublic we're
here today to crack open the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus this is something that we
do every week and this is our second day
in a row doing one live Turner on the
cnet stage yesterday we cracked open the
amazon kindle fire so today bill it's
the Galaxy Nexus what everybody why we
do this and how long we've been doing it
and what the what the deal is well if
you've been doing it for about five
years now for five years the first thing
that we took apart was the xbox 360 the
original and our audience members liked
it so much that we started doing one
every week we take these apart because
our audience really likes to know what's
inside them it helps them determine what
might go wrong and how they might fix
them if they if it does something does
go wrong and they need to replace
something very good so let's get started
let's krump in and you start cracking
open the the Samsung Galaxy Nexus when
he totally what's the first thing you do
when you're cracking open one of these
right well the first thing you're going
to do is try to get inside the case and
you're going to try and do this as
delicately as possible so with most
smartphones that have a removable
battery like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
you can just remove the back cover
that's not a problem and then you can
see the battery right here is inside so
I'm going to take the battery out and
now once we've removed the battery the
phone is is powered down so we're not
worried about any kind of shorts inside
the inside the device which is always
what we want to do is remove or
disconnect the battery first I need
pants inside there yes or no just short
and so the next point we're going to do
is we're going to remove the screws that
hold the front case in the rear case
onto the front panel assembly now
luckily Samsung was very kind to us or
kind to anyone that wants to take these
apart they actually used standard
Phillips double zero screws some dice
Baker's don't
do that the use of that start with the
name of a fruit especially they like to
use specialized screws yes try wing
screws pentalobe screws in the case of
the Apple iPhone 4 iPhone 3s and so but
even those you can there are
screwdrivers sometimes they're tough to
find that you can get to do this right
so why don't you tell everybody where
you get the tools that you use to do
these so that's an excellent point even
though there are specialized tools
required usually with the internet you
can find these kind of tools you can see
I've got a variety here of very small
screwdrivers or screwdriver with vets
and thin metal blades and I also have
some plastic spudger zaz these are
called and they helped me just
disconnect things from inside the case
you can even get specialized case
opening tools that are designed to
remove glass cases without sort of
marring the surface of the metal on the
device when we first started this we
actually use the butter knife but we
tried that once that's right tool a
butter knife razor blades exactly now
that we have the all the screws on the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus removed from the
back panel we're going to remove this
case from around the front panel
assembly unfortunately on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus I have to use this metal
blade i'm going to do so very carefully
putting it between the thin between the
case and the metal or the glass panel so
this we're going to be very gently i'm
even going to use my fingernail a little
bit and work our way around the outside
of this and i do have to say builds a
bit of a brain surgeon in this we added
there was a time when we wanted to do
more of these cracking opens and you
know we didn't want it to all be on bill
and so we we kind of would hire some of
our contributors and really highly
technical people to do this and almost
always the device came back like
somebody taking a hatchet to it and what
was not in working condition you know
one of the things one of the sticks that
that we do is that we always try to put
these back together in working order
actually i should say bill always gets
them back together in working order and
part of that is because he's real
patient with them you kind of
you can't force this that's one of the
sort of when people ask me how do I do
this or how can they do this one of the
things I tell them is you have to be
very patient you can't force things so
you can see I've got one side of the
plastic here popped loose and now we
have to get the other side but again you
can't force it you got to be patient I
you can hear it which connect there a
lot of the mistake people make when
they're trying to pull their own devices
apart or do something like this is that
something sort of won't come and they
force it right that's right that's when
Andrea breaks so you can see that didn't
take very long but I was very careful
not to break the glass panel because we
don't want to do that and how we've
removed the back cover and we can see
the insides of the Galaxy Nexus you can
see our main circuit board here there
are the speaker assembly it's already
see one of the cameras so from this
point we're just going to go ahead and
remove the circuit boards and keep keep
on going very good so when you're doing
these in the studio like like we said we
published one of these every week and
bill does not only the cracking open
where he's taking photos all along the
way but he also publishes an analysis
post we talks about what's inside the
device and you know what you need to
know in comparison to this device to
another destroyed so one of the things
that is interesting is that when he's
doing this is kind of like patting your
head and rubbing your stomach at the
same time because bills not only
cracking it open he's also taking notes
he's taking photos all along the process
we've got some photos up on the screen
that show you you know build taking
photos and you know getting into the
device and he's making notes of each of
these chips right so you'll show us a
little bit about that process well it's
so we have to do two or three things at
one time and we'll be taking things
apart on one part of the studio and then
moving them over to another part of the
studio and so it takes it's just another
thing that takes a little bit of
patience and one of the interesting
things here with the Galaxy Nexus is
that there's a lot of little connectors
that you have to disconnect from the
mother
to be very gentle when you do that
because once you're inside one of these
devices if you break the device if you
break one of the small connectors you
have to find a replacement part and
that's hard to do when we take these
things apart the actually taking apart
is very easy the hard part is binding
replacement components manufacturers
don't really like to do that yeah they
want you to bring the device back to
them to be repaired and be fixed well so
they don't probably better to buy a new
one that's right so they don't provide
replacement parts very easily so it's
it's a matter of being gentle not
forcing things and making sure
everything comes loose so but why don't
you talk a little bit about how we
choose which devices to crack though
prize you do you're doing one of these
every week and you've done lots of
different things you've done with almost
all the most important tablets this year
you've also done you know all the
prominent smartphones how do you choose
which tablets which smartphones which
products and what are some of the other
things you've packed up we've cracked
open old computers like the Tandy model
100 and old luggable laptop we've taken
apart like I said the xbox 360
playstation 3's we've taken apart Apple
iPhones I've fours just about any piece
of new technology that audience might
want to that their users might use that
they might have to support they might
want to use themselves you know when
you're going to recommend this to a
family member you want it to be rugged
you want it to be solid you want to know
that they're getting a quality product
and so we do all kinds of stuff we've
even even done some old stuff we've done
some old amigas so from laptop so our
phones and tablets Tandy we crack open
in our CID MPC that's right some of this
is is for educational value but some of
it's also entertainment right because
most people who are in technology
they're very curious they just need to
see what's going on inside yeah we're
all geeks so part of this is just for
our own fascination we love to see
what's inside these you know and you can
see here this is the Galaxy Nexus I'm
gonna hold us up for everybody in the
audience to see this is the Galaxy Nexus
motherwort or the primary circuit board
you can see all the chips that are on
there the processor their chips on here
from this as a Texas Instruments
processor one point two gigahertz
processor there are a lot of chips on
here from Samsung their chips from
silicon image there are chicks for chips
from InvenSense there are all kinds of
different chips on there and so when
we're doing these you know a lot of a
lot of what we do is research on the
different types of chips on the
manufacturers of those chips so that we
can see how they're used commonly
throughout different devices and you put
those into your analysis oh you do in
your analysis post you show like here
the chips inside here are you know how
they compare a lot of times you're
compared to other devices so one of the
things that you say when you crack these
open off it is that you can tell a lot
by about the company by the type of
device that's right when you crack it
open so you've cracked okis and open
some things this year that you haven't
always been real impressed with and you
crack open some things that you were
really impressed yeah right so tell us
which are which what are the things that
you're in most interested well the
kindle fire wasn't it was an excellent
example of something we cracked open we
cracked it open yesterday and just so
everybody sees no Jason mentioned that
we always have to put these back
together I'm gonna show everybody this
is the kindle tablet that we put back
together that we crack open yesterday
and i put it back together so it works
it functions so everything he always
gets back together it working women
always gets them back i can count on one
hand the number of devices over a period
of five years that bill has broken and
putting them back together or cracking
them open so like I said he's kind of
the brain surgeon you know in this field
all right you know what do you got here
so tell us about what your what you got
well we've removed like I said the
motherboard now we've removed both of
the cameras we have both the rear-facing
and the front facing cameras and now
we're going to remove this board that
holds the storage chip and the micro SD
card reader so we're going to go ahead
and pop this loose again you're going to
have to be very careful when you pop
loose these connectors you don't want to
damage the motherboard and then this is
one of the things a lot of people ask me
all these metal plates here yeah these
are shields prevent electromagnetic
interference from bothering the chips
underneath so you have to be very gentle
when you remove these or you'll risk
damaging the chips underneath okay so
we're going to do that gently kind of
pop this loose and you're popping these
loose so that you can see what chips are
in this thing that's right when you're
doing you're cracking open that's what
you want to know that's right we want to
see the processor we want to know who
makes the baseband modem we want to know
who makes the storage unit so for
example this is a sand disk storage unit
this is a 32 gig nand flash storage
storage chip and underneath that we have
a lot more chips there so we'll what's
you know for people that do want to take
or you know break their device what are
the questions we get a lot is somebody
drops their phone it cracks the screen
and they want to they say look I just
started my contract you know I can't I
don't want to buy a whole new phone have
to pay retail price for a whole new
phone can I replace the screen myself
right we get that but you get that
question a lot of I do and so I just got
that this week somebody emailed me and
they had a cracked screen and they
wanted to know whether or not they
should replace it or not now and i'll
use the Samsung Galaxy Nexus as a good
example okay here's the problem with a
lot of phones when people break their
phone a lot of times they crack what's
called the digitizer the front glass
panel and that's the part that
translates the motion of your finger
into the actions on the phone and a lot
of time that's that's the glass and
that's what gets crack it's not the
screen underneath okay sometimes if it
is the screen underneath its crack then
those are two separate components okay
now with the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
unfortunately the two are almost fused
together permanently like with ajith
with extremely strong adhesive okay so
unless you have a heat gun unless you're
willing to heat the edge around this
glass here and separate that elusive
left and then you can pull it apart then
more than likely you're going to have to
buy them as as a single unit you're
going to have to buy the front last
panel the digitizer and the LCD screen
that's going to be a little more expect
that it's going to be a little too
expensive get both now on the Kindle we
took apart yesterday they're actually 27
units they're very easy to separate just
simple screws you lift one right after
one right off of the other and so you
can buy them separately and replace them
fairly easy okay so if you go to if you
have a device that you know breaks and
you're not sure um you know if they're
separate or if they're the same you know
you can look at some of bills cracking
opens that he's done and that can help
you figure out you know whether you
might need to buy just the digitizer or
the just the screen or bow when you do
it so that's all cracking open blog on
techrepublic has all of your cracking
opens in it right people can follow me
on twitter too I bet he'll Detwiler very
good and get all the latest updates on
cracking up so we'll what about putting
these back together you know does it
take longer to put it back together than
it takes to get it apart me there's a
lot of small pieces here I'm not usually
honestly because when I'm taking them
apart I'm usually taking photos i am
doing things very gently especially if
I've never been inside the device before
I don't know how the device is put
together the manufacturers don't give
you manuals or don't give us manuals to
take them apart so you have to sort of
figure your way through the device you
know for when I got the Galaxy Nexus I
didn't know whether I was going to be
able to separate this part from the case
and the front panel or whether they were
going to be two separate pieces or
together so I had to sort of feel my way
through and that takes some time so I
know you've come in sometimes you like
bill have you got it apart yet and I'm
like no I'm still working still trying
to get this piece you know to get so
that gets back to the bed thing of if
you are trying to take a device apart
yourself you know take take it easy if
it doesn't want to come apart don't
force it because that's almost always
when you run into trouble it's almost
roadies when when it breaks so let's
take a look at what you're doing now
bill you pulling something else apart
what do you got so I'm going ahead and
removing now that we've rue removed the
circuit boards now that we remove the
card reader the cameras we're going to
go ahead and we're going to remove some
of the components here on the bottom
this is going to be the
the headphone jack down here it's got a
single screw that comes out this is an
audio unit uh-huh this is a little
headphone jack we're going to go ahead
and remove this and then at the bottom
we also have the micro USB port and the
microphone so we're going to go ahead
and there's actually the cellular
antenna here you can see these very thin
wires so while we're talking about it
these are the wires for the radios that
are inside the phone is it be very
careful with these when you're
disconnecting them that you don't rip
them that you don't break them something
pretty example what are the things
you've said to me before is you know
about how you can tell a lot about
accompanied by the way the products are
made is here on this product they've got
a nice line there that holds that
antenna wire that's right where you say
sometimes you'll go in there and you'll
see literally just they've taped like
wires down came across right and some of
the devices I took apart the HTC Flyer
that was a device that wasn't a bad
device but you could tell that HTC who
has a background in phone manufacturing
so for example and no necessarily tablet
tablet so the way the wires were run
inside the case the way they went down
to the channel the way the components
were installed it just wasn't as clean
as it could have been just a little
sloppy it was a little sloppy I wish I'd
put a little bit more effort into the
design of the internal as they did on
the X term so you know and you see that
sometimes with products from Apple they
do a very good job inside the device
just as well as they do outside the
device ok amazon did a good job with the
kindle how about samsung you've got to
open a lot of sense samsung as well to
samsung has a history of device
manufacturing and so they have you can
see the cracking open is pretty much
complete here there's not too much too
many other components to remove so i
mean they've done a very nice job of
component izing all the different pieces
the cameras are separate so if one of
the cameras did break and you were able
to buy a replacement camera then you can
take this you could buy you know a very
small camera like this you can take the
phone apart put the camera back into the
phone and you know you've got a brand
new camera you know phone will work
again how about you know what are the
questions we get is how about upgrading
your own device you know taking these
things apart and like that's an 8
megapixel camera you know what I'd like
to put a tent
16 megapixel camera in there can you do
that unfortunately no they're really I I
actually did get a call from someone or
an email from someone the other day and
they wanted to upgrade the memory in
their tablet now I told him well I'm
sorry unless you have really good
soldering skills and you're going able
to separate this chip from the circuit
board underneath you're not going to be
able to upgrade the storage in the phone
it's just not practical these things are
designed their customized these warts
are all custom and the software that
works am ray assessed as sometimes the
drivers that work with the camera may or
may not work with a different camera not
like a PC where you can buy a different
video card and the video card will come
with drivers and you just put new guys
with new drivers on there you have if
you were to replace the cam afraid to my
question you would have to somehow get
into the software itself and replace
that dryer and that you know really men
would I mean you really just have to
find apart somewhere so if you were to
buy a Galaxy Nexus and you drop it the
next day well I hope you have insurance
and take it back to the store and get to
you know replace it under warranty yeah
if the warranty is expired or if there's
really nothing to lose then yeah sure go
online and you're willing to do this
kind of thing right sure go online see
if you can find the parts you might even
be able to find an old one that no one
is using anymore that they're willing to
sell you for parts like maybe it has a
cracked screen but maybe you need to
digitize it or maybe it has won't charge
anymore but you need to screen out of it
well you can do that so that's a good
way to sort of find spare parts because
most of these manufacturers don't sell
spare parts to the public so it's not as
if you know you had your phone for two
years and you can just go on to
samsung's website and buy a new camera
buy a new sure you might be able to buy
a battery but not a new camera not a new
card unit and memory chip that's going
to be harder to find ok so talk about
some of the things that you've got
coming up that you're going to crap
kokum open because you already got some
things in the Hobby you plan to or you
know what are some of the things you
seem at CES that you're interested in
cracking open as well well i'm
definitely going to get try and get
samsung to give me one of the new all
LED TVs oh yeah they might
I want me to do that I pinched a 55 inch
LED or maybe the 80 inch 88 better we
have cracked open a 55 inch ta looked at
the hardware inside of that but Sabian
LED that was a fitting right samsung LED
that's right baby shower maybe shark
will send me an 80-inch LCD if you're
out there sharp I send me one well we're
also going to be taking apart the
motorola xyboard their new tablet device
we're going to take that one too that's
right we're going to be taking apart I
think the motorola droid maxx which has
a much larger battery in it oh that's
like razor the droid razr maxx yes it
has a much larger battery in it okay
then the droid does which is very
important for people that don't like
phones like the iPhone but they like
phones like the Galaxy Nexus that have a
removable battery a lot of people can't
get through the day on a single charge
so a bigger battery will help we're also
going to be taking apart I thank the
Asus Transformer Prime okay we've got
that learn a convertible tablet another
another tablet we're going to taking
apart so there's a lot of exciting
things coming up in the next few weeks
asus zenbook isn't that one that's
coming up there that's one of the ulv
pcs the Ultrabook that have been popular
at the conference some other ultrabooks
have been popular here what are some of
the ultrabooks you've seen that you know
because we crack open some laptops as
well what are the ones you're most
interested in and you think the audience
would would enjoy seeing cracked open
well the Samsung the Ultrabook from
Samsung we took open one of those a
series 9 okay it was a good quality they
got some new stuff here acer has a
really nice ultrabook that we took apart
just last week that should be a you know
pretty popular about the new HP was one
the wh last HP HP Envy it was really
exciting too that's on my list of things
I'd like to take apart it has a gorilla
glass front panel on not just behind the
screen yeah but on the top too so they
say it's more scratch resistant they not
so sure about shatter resistant but it
looks very nice I my doubts about that
one okay but what else anything else
you've seen here
that that you'd like to crack open what
are the things at CES that you're most
interested in you know learning more
about well I really like the Nokia the
loo Lumia 900 I can't wait to see that a
very nice another phone just like this
an LTE phone yeah this AT&amp;amp;T though so
it'll be interesting to see the chips
inside that and how they differ from
this phone that's on the verizon's
network and it'll be interesting to see
the new just the new TVs the new
ultrabooks there are a few more sort of
tablets that are kind of interesting and
kind of on my radar I did go up two
razors booth give a shout out to them
yesterday yeah and they have their new
blade laptop which is a high-end gaming
laptop so if you're in the gaming and if
you have twenty eight hundred dollars
burning a hole in your pocket this is a
17 inch laptop it has a really unique
switchblade interface and so that should
be interesting a lot of nice hardware
inside there a lot to see that's going
to be exciting too okay so bill where
can people go to find cracking open and
where can they go to find you to learn
more about the stuff that you're doing
techrepublic com we do a cracking open
every week in the cracking open blog we
also do a video the describing the
device and the teardown and then you can
always follow me on twitter at build
that Weiler all right so you can also
find me on twitter at at jason hider and
so thanks for seeing it for letting us
come up here and do this we're going to
wrap it up so thanks so much for joining
us up next we'll be mollywood hosting
the cnet women in tech panel you don't
want to miss that got some real heavy
hitters coming up so stick around for
that and we'll see you next time thanks
