wants to offer you a more authentic way
to date and all you've got to do is open
up your fridge
welcome to refrigerating an app from
Samsung that works with the family hub
refrigerator to take a picture of the
inside of your fridge and match you with
your forever dinner date you swipe left
or right depending on how strongly you
feel about kale they say you are what
you eat so what do the contents of your
fridge say about you
maybe you're health-conscious or aren't
how much or is that an open can of cat
food if you have a family hub
refrigerator you can use the fridges
built-in camera if you don't have a
family hub refrigerator you can just
take and upload a picture with your
phone the samsung family of refrigerator
is a touchscreen smart fridge that also
has cameras inside along with that big
touchscreen on the door it debuted a
couple of years ago for about four
thousand dollars which is very expensive
and people were a little slow to adopt
it the prices come down still Samsung's
trying to find a way to get people
interested in it and to market it so I'm
not surprised to see them try a frigid
dating kind of gimmick to get people
he's talking about it I mean it can't be
any worse than actual dating right like
dating stinks and if you're gonna use a
picture and a couple of paragraphs on a
site why not use the content of your
fridge as well as an alternative RiRi's
is a good point why not give refriger
dating a try okay so some of these
fridges that you look at that have
nothing in them just concern me like I
think this guy has maybe like a can of
sardines and some kind of a fast food
bag in here and I just I want I want to
know that he's okay I want to like send
someone to his apartment be like do you
need any help ok so here's another one
this person in San Francisco has
basically an entire beer fridge there's
nothing in here except beer of all
varieties
I know this I hope this picture is not
real this guy's fat and it's like the
cat sitting there looks like he's eating
sausage links I think from from swiping
through I think that you run into a
couple things I think there's some
people who are clearly joking around and
those are the fridges that are just like
every single shelf is just filled with
beer I I think that people are not
staging their fridges as much as I would
have thought because there's definitely
instances of like questionable looking
Tupperware contents and yeah and you
know old old containers of leftovers and
and whatnot so I'm I'm thinking that
there might be some degree of honesty on
here refrigerating launched in January
worldwide it's free and available
through your web browser so it'll work
with any phone samsung didn't disclose
numbers of how many people are using it
but they say people are signing up so
the next time you go to your fridge you
could be filling your stomach and your
heart
it's organic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
