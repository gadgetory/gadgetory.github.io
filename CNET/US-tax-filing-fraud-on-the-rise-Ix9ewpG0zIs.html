haven for hackers a growing percentage
of tax refunds are going to hackers
filing fake returns on behalf of
taxpaying citizens like you and me jerks
the IRS expects over 150 million returns
once tax season ends some of those
returns have refunds attached to them
this year's average refund is $2,900
that's incredibly enticing to fraudsters
looking to make a quick buck they're
using phishing and email scams to gather
information file your tax returns before
you do steal your refund and then
disappear before you or the IRS knows
anything has gone wrong an IBM security
report found tax themed spam emails
designed to steal information increased
by a whopping six thousand percent
between December 2016 and February 2017
they can look like fake IRS emails or
fake emails from tax softwares like
TurboTax
that report also reminds us that stolen
personal information like w-2s and
social security numbers can be bought
pretty cheaply on the dark web
fortunately there are precautions you
can take some states have opted in apps
that help prevent tax fraud if you're
not in one of those states your best bet
is to file as early as possible if
you've already filed thieves can't file
in your name a second time or otherwise
overwrite what you've already sent in so
while it's a little late to file early
this tax season it's a good idea to keep
in mind for next year for more
