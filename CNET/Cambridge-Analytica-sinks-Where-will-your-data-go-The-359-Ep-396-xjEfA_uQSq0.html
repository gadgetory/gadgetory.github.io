Alfred Eng cambridge analytic
became a household name for all the
wrong reasons and now it's dead the
political consulting firm accused of
misusing facebook users data is shutting
down that was announced yesterday alfred
let's get people up to speed in case
they didn't already know what did
cambridge analytical what were they
accused of doing so they are a political
consulting firm and they say that they
can profile people based off of like
data that they take now a lot of this is
supposed to be like public data from
like advertisers and things like that
but what had happened with it scandal
with facebook is that they created an
app and they created a bunch of apps
actually that were supposed to be like
fun quizzes kind of like oh this is your
digital life online this is a what type
of what you know what song represents
who you are or something like that and
then instead of you know only giving
them those answers they would take your
answers and then use that to like build
a whole profile about you but not just
you but like all your friends and stuff
and then they would use that data to
basically create voter profiles and say
okay so this person is most likely going
to vote if you like target your ads to
them in this way and that kind of stuff
so considering how creepy that sounds do
you think that there was any possibility
that they might have been able to hold
on or the fact that all their clients
were fleeing there just potentially
wasn't like like there was too much heat
around it yeah I think the service is
definitely still in demand if you look
at their former CEO Alexander nicks he's
at a new company now with several other
Cambridge channel former Cambridge
analytic executives now called Emer data
and they're pretty much doing the exact
same thing that they might not be
getting the data
illicitly anymore but i think it was
more of a a-- we're going to dump this
ship and then jump on another one that
does the exact same thing but like it
doesn't have as much heat on it as
cambridge analytical so as far as the 87
million Facebook users that their data
was allegedly misused what happens to
that data
what do you unclear right now a few
lawmakers from both the US and the UK
have told camera gentlemen okay hey look
you can't delete this data you have to
hold on to it we don't care that you
know you're not a company anymore we're
still investigating this so you can't
just up and delete all this data it's
unclear whether or not they're gonna
listen to them so we you know it's it's
still it's jury's still out there and
where do that data is going to end up
yeah the Cambridge analytical closure
came at the same time of the Facebook f8
Developer Conference they're the social
media company has worked to move forward
from the controversy by showing off some
of its newest projects among them was a
VR prototype headset called Half Dome
which promises wider field of vision and
improved depth of focus it sounds like
it could help make V are a little bit
more immersive a little bit more like
the real world which I'm obviously all
for that sounds like it could could be
really helpful yeah I mean I just
because they announced the oculus go
yesterday right I'm not yesterday that
it was gonna be shipping yeah yeah so
I'm compute imeem I feel like this one
probably looks a lot better than the
oculus go I'm just confused why then it
just put all these features on a product
that they already have this is still in
prototype they're still working on it
that's why and there's also another VR
headset that's expected to come out
before this one call me Santa Cruz I
think it probably was a lot for the
future VR though I think like the
biggest gripe against is like things
don't really look that realistic here
when you're putting in it is very
immersive it's just like it's hard to
buy into the illusion that you're in VR
yeah and you know it shows that they're
working on not just the current head
side oculus go but a handful of next
generation headsets that could help
improve that and get people more
interested in VR last our own Abrar LGD
wrote about simulations using virtual
patients to train healthcare
professionals to be more empathetic and
to tackle some tough conversations on
topics like mental health this is of
course on a screen but I could see how
this could be useful if it was in VR I
don't know I don't think I mean I don't
feel empathetic towards like virtual
reality but simulations or anything like
that so I feel like it might have the
opposite effect where you start looking
at like real people as if oh I've done
this in my simulation oh that's an
interesting yeah I don't
I don't know I'm a I'm weird about that
but yeah I don't know I'm glad you're
not my doctor if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNET
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Aang thanks
for listening all right everybody thanks
as always for joining us in the
recording of the audio podcast I'll jump
into the chat now and yes that's really
me don't at me bro I'll find some good
question the comments keep the
conversation going and in the meantime
Alfred them been busy my point though
like I feel like it's weird if like the
only like trauma or stress that you're
dealing with is like when you're doing
it or like a VR setting I feel like
you're like very desensitize to that at
some point it's a weird example but like
I think of somebody who if like their
only interaction with like women is like
VR like pornography or something like
that then yeah that's an interesting job
it's just like oh this is how it's
supposed to be I don't know what I'm
doing anymore
I heard it's a very weird job arguments
no III know where that argument is but
taking it back to the healthcare
professional perspective I think a lot
of doctors and health care professionals
are accused of having lousy bedside
manner especially when they're giving
people bad news so providing folks with
providing those specific professionals
with a little more training specifically
directed around that I think could
absolutely be helpful whether doing it
on a screen with virtual people like a
little software program is actually
gonna help I don't know I'm also curious
when like doctors and medical
professionals would even have the time
to do this I don't know they're always
training they're always doing stuff yeah
but like our doctors training in the
same way that we trained like for like
for like annual like you know what I
mean like those seminars I don't know
yeah yeah I'm not a doctor I'm not sure
you're asking me questions I have no
idea about so I'm usually all in favor
of using technology for to better
healthcare to better legitimate
resources rather than just put silly new
cameras in their pockets this one you
see how it feels kind of like a swing
and a Miss though it seems to kind of
like one step forward two steps back
where I don't know if this is actually
going to help
further encouraging virtual interaction
doesn't necessarily mean better
one-on-one interaction area I'm very
skeptical of somebody learning empathy
through like virtual reality that does
that just doesn't really like I just
wanted to learn to love it's as my
Zuckerberg impression but it's like when
good it's like when Nintendo had like
Nintendogs or whatever where's like you
took it or like Tamagotchi where like
you take it oh love their time ago it's
like taking character Tamagotchi I just
think it's paging doctor very different
thing than like something having
something like they're in front of you
people love their Sony dogs to
Nintendogs no no no what is it
I bow yeah oh yeah but that's like
they're in front of you that's a digital
thing that's like it's also not real you
know that right yeah maybe that's what
they should do maybe instead of VR they
should have robot patients crying and
whoa now you're just getting into like
West where we see baby dolls that used
to cry and wet themselves and we're like
which you would give to high school
students so uh to like teach them what
it's like and that really traumatized us
at all I don't know I never was in that
class but I do remember that from high
school that there would be you know the
kids would get paired off and then
they'd have to take care of a kid and it
would start crying in the middle of
class and you have to push a button on
its back to make it stop crying which in
real life now that I have kids I can
tell you that button does not exist
anyway do we have questions or I wanted
to pivot back to f8 because I was I was
interested in asking you guys whether
after two days of f8 whether you think
Zuckerberg and Co managed to get get
away from this whole Cambridge analytic
a thing maybe they showed us enough
shiny new things to I mean they've
gotten away from it for a while now i
feel i i i think that the the political
pressure on them has kind of died down
but i also think that it's like it's
something that like looms in the
background for them like that will
always like loom in the background for
them like it's it's not like the focus
now but like people like that's like the
undertone of like everything that i look
at Facebook of now
yeah I'm also pretty bummed out to hear
that the Cambridge analytical folks
basically just renamed themselves and
move to a different anything less it's
true it's true but it is unfortunate for
users and when you exist as a POS you
will continue as a POS that's right
speaking of that we'll take a question
about the shutdown of Cambridge analytic
a--from DC one four seven does anyone
think that the shutdown of Cambridge
Anna Luca the problem with that with
this shutdown the problem is actually
over are we just waiting until the next
company makes headlines I mean do you
think they're actually going to try to
better themselves or are they just going
to do a better job hiding it no you Data
Corporation you're talking about a
Facebook specifically no no no what are
their what's a new Emer data
Emer data no data collect again a
terrible friggin name yeah it's always
Cambridge analytic I mean were they can
also change it to like Oxford Statistics
or something like it's actually like
that name they have a style yeah I mean
the point is that like data collection
is a massive industry and it's here to
stay and I don't think it's going away
anytime soon you have all these websites
that you use for free like Facebook and
Google and Twitter YouTube which is
owned by Google the fact and you know
all that data is going somewhere and you
know they're using this to basically
develop profiles on any money at like
essentially you know massive
demographics on the Internet and you
know that's how like advertisements get
to you like specifically to you it's
like oh wow when you see something
that's like oh that's very specific to
like what I just looked up like two
hours ago I don't I don't know how this
ad landed on like that's all like the
data industry oh yeah and it the
advertising is one thing the other one
is these political consulting firms that
use this type of information to target
either potential voters for your
candidate or against your can yeah to
try to encourage or suppress votes it
one way or another which is it's it's so
important I think to really tell people
about this because it's something that's
going on and it's going on and like your
your social media feeds and is with with
Cambridge analytic Oh like what they
were doing as a data you know
analytical firm wasn't inherently wrong
I mean like their people are very quick
to point out that the Obama campaign did
the same thing in 2012 I think the you
know the big issue of camera janaloka
was that they misused that like they
took it without telling people hmm
so I mean I'm sure that these companies
like all these other data companies
include including Emer data are gonna be
doing the exact same thing but you know
they're either gonna try much harder to
not get caught or they're actually going
to just continue taking your data in
like the legitimate way which is so
shady but perfectly okay because they
told you yeah
well but shall we pivot back to virtual
doctors short hunter Manzon had a some
great input I think it's good for the
students in med school have you seen the
Grey's Anatomy where all the interns
freeze up and make huge mistakes I have
not seen Grey's Anatomy however I have
watched scrubs at least 11 times maybe
it will prepare them better than
throwing them straight into the fire see
that sets may be applicable right yeah
there's actually frankly I was a little
surprised that you guys were so down on
this concept because I'm gonna sit down
just very cautious yeah I mean obviously
especially with like health care tech
it's really important not to over
promise that kind of thing I think we
try to do that as much as we can on this
podcast to say like hey this is
interesting but you know let's not
promise everybody the moon with this
it's not gonna solve cancer whatever but
any level of additional training
especially as it relates to empathy I
think there's is just a lot of health
care professionals don't do a lot of
training related to that at least that's
generally the knock about that point
well-taken
yeah shall we talk a little bit about VR
sure I wish Joan was here for this I
know right
I don't and Scott yes well we already
had Scott on yesterday oh that's right
he thought woman yes okay I am go get
him right now I don't know how much I
care about this innovation of the focal
length crap with the VR because I'm
getting really strangely paranoid about
finding myself in the matrix where the
simulation has become too real we've
surpassed the uncanny valley
like I want to know I'm immersed in a
virtual experience and not have any
questions about the reality of it hmm
any any feedback on that one I don't
think they're anywhere near that type of
situation I mean like I I've seen some
of like the higher level VR headsets and
those are kind of fun you get to mess
around with them a bit like the HTC vive
I believe it was the HTC vive where
there was this like cool Mount Everest
climb that I got to do and you're like
going over this shaky bridge and you're
climbing up like it was it was cool but
like and and the visuals I thought were
really good for VR but at no point was I
just like oh yeah I'm definitely doing
this yeah you know I think it's gonna
take a really long time if the robots
are ever gonna take over to make us
think that this is a simulation that's
where they want you to think right and
then we'll leave already taking over
then this is already all just a
simulation red pill and end up in like
this weird vat of goo and I have to take
like you know that really long thing out
of your mouth like neo does and then eat
that nasty oatmeal stuff yeah yeah right
why don't they have better food doesn't
make any sense we need to talk more
about virtual doctors I guess a couple
great Orient's brought up in the chat
from Matthew doctor I guess the idea is
kind of like flight simulators for pilot
training so that's a very good analogy
I've done a flight simulator before when
I was doing a story out of Louisville
with ups I got to do a flight simulator
and I will tell you that it was way
easier I'm sure than actually trying out
trying to fly for real well they
probably put you on like the novice
setting not only that only game genie
codes in there the guy that had been a
pilot for like 40 odd years was sitting
right next to me and I'm pretty sure he
was like secretly working the controls
so I wouldn't crash completely but you
know it gave it gave me at least like a
very very minor flavor of what it might
be like or what it's kind of like you
know it was when you're when you're
flying it's totally different than
driving a car where it's kind of like
you know working like a really big ship
anything that you do you have to
anticipate and move things like you know
pretty slowly and carefully and
deliberately so like if I got even
that little bit from a flight simulator
then you know maybe doctors could get
something out of this true
Josh boy de also points out that I'm
going to school to become a police
officer Congrats sir I feel that this
taller technology will be applicable in
law enforcement training as well that's
another good point because there is a
lot of interpersonal especially in this
modern day and age sensitivity wise
we're more peer-to-peer training could
be a beneficial yeah yeah I would agree
with you so for sure I think that's
interesting good points everybody thanks
for bringing those up we're probably
just about out of time any closing
thoughts for the week we had a busy week
we had FA next week we got Google goog
leo is that happening next week yeah oh
wow
all right sucks is that is that your
official review I'll uh we'll see I'm
definitely very interested to see if
there's gonna be more like Google home
news because like I write so much about
like Alexa and Google assistant that if
they make another announcement about
some like interesting Google home stuff
I think that could be kind of cool
because um Facebook was rumored to be
working on a smart speaker but
apparently they delayed that effort
because of all the controversies for f8
so but we had time to work on dating
profiles yeah definitely dating profiles
I'm glad they got your priorities
straight
sure all right thanks everybody that's
gonna wrap it up for the week it's been
a busy week but it's nice to end on a
nice somber thought-provoking episode
for for the UH for the weekend and we'll
be back with googley oh crap next week
sounds good to me
alright I'll get us out of here the 3:59
podcast is available on iTunes tune in
stitcher feedburner Google Play Music
the Amazon echo and of course cnet.com
thanks everybody for listening I will
see you again on Monday so take care
