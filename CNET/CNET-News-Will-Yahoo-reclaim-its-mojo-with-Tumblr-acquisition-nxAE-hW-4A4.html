people who blog on tumblr a friend of
mine introduced me to a blog that was
only on tumblr so when I went on that
blog I liked it and it just it made
blogging easier to kind of condensed all
your blog's into one spot the site as a
diary like filled offering users a mix
of blogging and social networking samra
was drawn to its simple format finding
it faster to follow and share fashion
and music blogs on tumblr versus
competitors like WordPress if my mom
wanted to do to get a blog I would
recommend her to use tumblr it's almost
like painting my numbers it's so easy
since it's 2007 launched tumblr has
built up clout beyonce and her husband
jay-z debuted photos of their firstborn
on tumblr it also attracts fashion icons
and sports outlets tumblers distinctly
youthful vibe most users are under 35
makes it especially appealing to the
struggling tech giant Yahoo which is
acquiring tumblr for 1.1 billion dollars
so we couldn't be more excited about
bringing tumblr into the portfolio right
now it's kind of an eighteen-year-old
brand that kind of lost its mojo by
bringing in tumblr and all those users
and all that content it's possible for
Yahoo to be reimagined as a as a truly
21st century rather than 20th century
website the news had some tumblr users
bolting to competitor WordPress perhaps
worried about advertising which could
play a bigger role on the new tumblr
well there been some defections from
tumblr users but it's a small number
when you compare it to the overall
number that they have yahoo CEO marissa
meyer has said tumblr will remain
independent and said quote we promise
not to screw it up tumblr is a
phenomenal company and we couldn't be
more excited while we're acquiring it we
intend to operate it independently their
roadmap their vision all of that stays
on track meanwhile tumblr fans are
hoping that's a promise the company
keeps in San Francisco I'm Sumi das
