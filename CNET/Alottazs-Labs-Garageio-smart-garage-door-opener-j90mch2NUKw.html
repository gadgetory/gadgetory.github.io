in the garage of a lot of these labs and
they have a product called garage EO so
this is an Internet of Things device is
designed basically to let you remotely
control your garage doors through your
cell phone so you can see garage eoin
stall here there's a couple cables they
connect to your existing garage door
opener so it's designed to be kind of a
DIY solution a lot of these lab says
it'll work with ninety-five percent of
garage doors that are already on the
market so you don't have to buy a whole
kit or call a dealer to install it
really supposed to be DIY give your
controller inputs here that go out to
the opener and then there's another line
here that goes out to sensors on the
door the whole idea is that through the
app you can see who's coming and going
out of your garage and basically get a
little bit more intelligence behind the
whole operation so this product is still
in the development stage they have a
crowdfunding campaign coming in the next
month or so they say it'll cost about
149 when it hits retail but you may be
able to get a better price if you get in
on that early funding so there are other
garage door controllers out there
they're part of larger systems or maybe
tied to a certain brand of garage door
but this is the only DIY one that we
know about so far and right at this
point anyway it looks pretty promising
timers Brown this is that a lot as these
labs garage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
