NBC and our parent company CBS boo
amazon is working on a way for you to
protect yourself from bad gifts the
company patented a system that
intercepts gifts that you don't want
it's kind of like an email filter you
basically get to stop the order of
anyone who you know will get you
something terrible and then convert the
value of that gift into a gift
certificate you could also convert bad
gifts into something on your wish list
block specific products or ensure that
clothing is sent in the appropriate size
brilliant amazon took a lot of steam for
refusing to stop selling an
instructional book on paedophilia the
pedophiles guide to love and pleasure
has been for sale on Amazon despite
vehement opposition to the book amazon
originally claimed that they should keep
selling this book since it would be
censorship not two but just a few years
ago amazon stopped selling cockfighting
magazines because that is illegal just
like pedophilia amazon did cave in and
took the book off their virtual shelves
and for the record this book great
example of a bad gift yesterday we
reported that apple may have purchased
wireless headset maker y gear the CEO of
that company says that did not happen
I'm sure he wishes it had though in
other Apple news the company has an
update for OS 10 this is ten point six
point five it's said to have improved
stability and performance of graphics
applications and games better
functionality with the magic trackpad
and improved reliability of Ethernet
connections the National Hockey League

over there set-top box NHL gamecenter

comiXology and finally you know the same
it's on like Donkey Kong it means well
it's kind of hard to explain you know it
means well Nintendo has applied for a
trademark of the sane in honor of the
November 21st release of Donkey Kong
Country Returns not too sure what you do
with a trademark like that but I guess
it's meaningful to frat boys the world
