finally here in the flesh from Google
first there's no headphone jack it's a
drag but you'll have to listen to music
through wireless headphones or carry a
dongle to plug in to your headphones
it also has squeezable edges similar to
the HTC u 11 just give it a quick
squeeze and Google's digital voice
enabled assistant launches oh and the
phone is waterproof now - so you can
rest easy if it ever falls into the pool
or ocean
unlike most current flagships the pixel
2 doesn't have dual cameras on the back
but google insists that it's single lens
camera is still the best around its
portrait mode feature it uses a combo of
algorithm training and a special image
sensor Google also added optical image
stabilization for steadier photos and
video recording and there's a fun motion
photo feature that animates your
pictures inside the Photos app there's
also google lense which Google
introduced earlier in May lens works
similar to Samsung's Bixby and lets you
take photos and get immediate info about
objects if you wanted to know more about
a painting for instance just take a
picture and lens will call up info about
it it works on art landmarks and books
in general the new pixel 2 + 2 XL looks
tidier and cleaner than last year's
there are fewer lines and visible bands
going around the phone and the glass
shade on the back runs right up to the
phone's edges but there's a camera bump
now and the top bezel and bottom chin on
the pixel 2 are especially thick the
main difference between the phones are
mostly size and screen related and
neither them are more advanced than the
other the pixel 2 is smaller with a 5
inch 1080p display while the pixel 2 XL
has a 6-inch 1440p display it also has a
higher pixel density and a bigger
battery to accommodate the larger screen
the pixel 2 starts at $650 while the 2
XL starts at 850 dollars in the US and
UK you can pre-order the phone starting
today and pre-orders in Australia begin
