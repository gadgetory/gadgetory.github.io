welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now last week we showed off the mountain
lion but this week we wanted to give you
an inside look at some of the hidden
features that you haven't seen it so
let's jump into them first off
cosmetically there have been a few uin
system tweaks the dashboard app that
allows you to add a variety of widgets
has changed so you won't have to scroll
through a bar at the bottom anymore but
instead you'll be able to choose them
from a launch pad like view you can
stack widgets on top of each other like
an iOS folder if you want and even
widgets like stocks have a new way to
flip through information and we might
see more like this in the future now in
the system preferences you'll also have
a new lineup of screen saver animations
like photo mobile look at how that flies
in or the weathered aged look of the
scrapbook theme or vintage prints now
clearly they're adding a higher
production value to mount line you also
have a notifications preference to
manage them just like you do in iOS so
you can set how many are displayed which
apps notifications you want to view but
apps like mail also take advantage of it
now so let's show you the mail app and
one of the new features is VIPs it lets
you mark the real important people that
you interact with and you can make
someone a VIP by clicking on the star
icon to the left of their name in an
email now once there a VIP you can
select to read only emails from them but
even better if you go into the
preferences of mail and then into the
rules section you can create a rule that
sends you a notification every time that
specific VIP send you an email and
you'll never miss it now Safari combines
the address and the search bar together
while also making the reader button a
permanent fixture that strips away all
the ads and distractions when you're
reading a story much like in iOS also
Apple talked about share sheets but the
slick addition is share sheets to the
quick look mode now I know plenty of
people who aren't even familiar with
quick look where you press the spacebar
on a file to instantly preview it but
now you'll be able to share files
directly in the quick look mode so
that's pretty slick so there's a look at
some of the additional features and
tweaks and mountain line you haven't
seen before it's released later this
summer and I could tell you guys right
now i'll be waiting first and lion for
it you get it line and lion
that's not funny uncle Brian oh really
well I guess that means no more uncle
Brian pillow jumps for you all right
back to the actual show because that's
why you're all watching in ipad 3 News
macrumors acquired what they believe to
be the rumored ipad 3 Retina display
that's been circulating on the internet
and this week they have confirmed with
iFixit with the help of microscopes that
the next gen ipad will have a resolution
of 2048 by 1350 six and four times the
pixels compared to the ipad to keep
drooling Apple biters the unofficial
March 7th date is just around the corner
now we also love taking a peek at apple
patents and there are some good ones
that recently serviced on patently Apple
one of them is a feature to create DJ
style beat match crossfading between two
audio streams for Macs and iOS devices
so creating a seamless transition to
some of your songs you might have in a
genius playlist and another discovered
by AppleInsider shows apples ambitions
to reinvent the keyboard with a thinner
and lighter design with a single support
lever keyboard design with a travel
range of 0.2 millimeters that's how far
it goes when you press it down now the
goal of this new design would be to
create a slimmer keyboard that
eliminates that rattle noise and slimmer
products and accessories in the future
all right let's check out our app of the
week
this week's app is on live desktop plus
for the ipad now it's made from the
creators of the online video game
streaming service but this time they've
created a way a real clever way to
access Windows 7 in a touchscreen
environment directly on your iPad with
touch support so why should you guys
care now in addition to having access to
the entire office suite you'll also have
the ability to watch flash content
through the internet explorer browser
that stream to your iPad over 1 gigabit
connection now the lag between your
finger touches and the responsiveness of
the app is really minimal it's pretty
amazing and it's one of the first
examples we've seen of a cloud computing
solution that works really well you'll
also have two gigs of storage space that
you can access through the cloud it's
five dollars a month and it will be
coming soon to Android max monitors and
TVs and it's left me very impressed so
you guys should check it out now back to
the stories earlier this week apple gave
abc's nightline behind-the-scenes access
to their Foxconn production line during
a fair labor association review that was
paid for by Apple after the overwhelming
reports about the poor working
conditions on site now it's worth
mentioning that ABC's parent company is
Disney and Steve Jobs was disney's
largest shareholder so no conflict of
interest there but overall the report
revealed nothing new but it did show
that it takes 141 steps to make an
iphone and it takes an iPad 5 days to
build and passes through 325 hands
during production workers are paid one
dollar in seventy-eight cents an hour
they pay roughly 70 cents per meal and
pay 17 dot fifty cents a month to share
a company dorm with five to seven other
people now the next day after the
segment aired reports from factory
workers claimed that underage workers
were transferred to other departments /
not scheduled to work overtime during
the inspection talk about a bad apple
now it's really a story that won't go
away no matter how much Apple wants it
to and we'll keep you posted if anything
new happens alright let's wrap things up
on a happy note you know we're good
friends of gelaskins here on our show
it's the skin you always see on my eye
goodies now they launched their new
hardcase line that recently brings the
same awesome designs on a real
protective case and to celebrate they
are hooking up five of my favorite apple
biters with a forty dollar gift card so
how do you win this thing well did you
guys know that a cougar is a mountain
lion okay okay i know you guys do and i
love Cougars but there are other wild
cats in addition to the Cougar that are
mountain lions so named meet at least
two if you're correct will pick your
name randomly and announce the winners
next week just like that alright that's
going to do it for this week's show
email us at the Apple by to cnet com
thanks for watching I'm Brian Tom and
we'll catch you guys next week for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
