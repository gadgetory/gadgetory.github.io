e3 video game Expo I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update III the biggest
video game conference in the world is
going on now in Los Angeles game makers
are showing off new titles and
technologies to come and of course
virtual reality is part of that
conversation but at this early stage of
the technology we're really just getting
teases of what's possible Microsoft
announced it's going to work with
virtuality headsets made by valve and
oculus but it also showed off a demo of
how microsoft's hololens will work with
the blocky building game minecraft with
hololens it can just project an image of
your game in front of your view like a
floating TV but you can even have it
project the Minecraft world you created
on top of a table in your room giving
you a unique perspective that can be
manipulated using your voice enhance but
there's still no word on when you can
get a hololens or play this now getting
back to the real world microsoft also
announced that the xbox one is going to
be able to play your old xbox 360 games
later this year but there is a catch
stick in an old game disk and the
machine will allow you to download a
version for free from the online store
and there are about a hundred games to
start it's up to the game developers to
allow it to be backward compatible when
the Xbox one came out in 2013
older 360 game discs were useless on the
new system so this may be a bit of a
bummer to anyone who's sold or gave away
their older games in the past two years
but it has added incentive for anyone
who did not upgrade yet this fall Xbox
one will also have a new controller
called the elite wireless controller
with four additional paddle buttons that
hug the back you can also interchange
pieces it has hair trigger locks and
adjustable sensitivity among the many
games Microsoft teased perhaps the
biggest this year will be halo 5
guardians or you're on a team hunting
down the Fallen star of the series
Master Chief now labeled a traitor
the halo environment lets 24 people play
together in a multiplayer mode called
warzone if you're looking for something
more creative check out the game cuphead
it's a game designed in the style of old
9
20s and 1930s cartoons like Betty Boop
Felix the Cat Popeye in Disney Silly
Symphonies it's so weird it may just
steal the show from the usual
apocalyptic theme games these days the
end of the world just feels a little
mundane speaking of which there's lots
of excitement around fallout 4 it's a
game six years in the making and it's
launching on November 10th this time you
can build your own weapons to survive
the nuclear wasteland of Boston game
maker Bethesda also just released a free
iOS mobile game called fallout shelter
it's sort of like Sim City where you
help manage the towns underground
shelters keeping the residents happy and
healthy that's it for this tech news
update there's plenty more ìiî
coverage in cnet.com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
