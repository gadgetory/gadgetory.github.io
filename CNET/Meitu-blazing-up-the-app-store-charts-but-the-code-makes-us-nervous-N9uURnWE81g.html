face app may too if you've been seeing
hyper-realistic anime portraits in your
social media timelines that look like
knock off sailor moon you're familiar
with me to the app uses filters to give
faces porcelain skin exaggerated eyes
and other features that make a person
look like they stepped off the pages of

some of the best uses of the app have
been pictures of people who would never

important to remember that free apps
usually mean that you and your data are
the price you're really paying that
being said if you decide to use me to
send me your very best anime images i'm
