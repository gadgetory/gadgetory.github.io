was years past exclusive to 30 inch
displays has recently become much more
prevalent in 27 inch monitors these
monitors offer users a beautiful high
pixel count screen at a much lower price
but does the latest 2560 x 1440 monitor
from a sous live up to the categories
fine performance tradition hi i'm eric
franklin and today i'll take a first
look at the asus pb278q design-wise the
assumes offers no real surprises as with
many asus monitors released recently it
has this crazy wide foot stand which
unfortunately isn't as stable as I'd
like thanks mostly to the swivel
mechanism underneath speaking of which
the monitor does include swivel height
adjustment pivot and tilt options
connections include DVI displayport hdmi
vga as well as a headphone jack and
audio in jack to complement the built-in
speakers the on-screen display array is
located on the lower right side with his
buttons placed underneath five presets
are featured including srgb you will
have access to the usual brightness
contrast color temp red green and blue
options gamma and hugh options the
monitor has a 2560 x 1440 resolution and
uses a POS panel in games images are
crisp bright and vibrant and 1080p
movies look clear and colorful the Asus
cost six hundred and ninety-nine dollars
while that's kind of a lot of money by
any stretch it's actually a pretty good
deal for monitor with a resolution this
high with the kind of features it
includes check out my full review for
more details once again i'm eric
franklin and this has been a first look
at the asus pb278q</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
