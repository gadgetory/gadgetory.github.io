permutation of crossover and SUV
imaginable suddenly wagons are cool
again let's drive BMWs entry and their
most accessible version of the art form
the 2014 328 D X Drive and check the
tech now our 3-series wagon has dual
claims to coolness one it's a wagon
that's resurgent Lee hip right now -
it's a diesel also resurgent Lee hip
right now I'll be honest I'll be curious
to come back and watch this video in
five years and see where both of those
are in terms of the trend meter in the
meantime the face of this car is
virtually indistinguishable from a
3-series sedan it's around the back that
things were done really well I think
BMW brought a very graceful sporty end
to the sentence and they've also got an
interesting dual tailgate of sorts back
there you can lift the whole gate which
by the way is available power for the
first time on a three wagon or you can
just lift up the actual glass lid with a
cleverly hidden button underneath the
base of the wiper stalk now inside are
328d
is a very basic cabin this is not loaded
up with all the CNET style tech but a
quick glance here shows you familiar BMW
DNA notice even on a very basic car you
still have this sort of sticking up
display on top of the dash but it
doesn't have a lot in it it's basically
your media and phone and contacts
display a few settings in there
ConnectedDrive doesn't work and you've
got just basics here in a very nice
interface and you're still using an eye
drive controller basic eye drive is so
basic it doesn't even have bluetooth
streaming just bluetooth calling now we
happen to have a sport wheel because we
have the M Sport Package so know that
this is different you got some nice
paddles here for shifting our automatic
transmission control is very familiar in
BMWs right now we also sports seats in
this car which are quite hugging again
these are all along with that rather
lofty redline cues that this is not the
old style of diesel that just kind of
lugs and tugs all the time this one's
got some sporting pretensions great
panoramic roof overhead by the way for a
smallish car it really covers all rows
of occupants very nicely and you can
open up a full half of it to the sky
now these BMW three wagons come with two
two liter engines you can get the two
litre inline-four gas motor or in this
guy of course our 2 litre inline-four
but it's a diesel the twin turbo or twin
power technology on this car is BMW
calls it is not a twin scroll turbo but
it's a variable geometry single turbo a
little different than the gas engine car
beyond that of course it's
longitudinally mounted driving all-wheel
drive in this case and you've got the
usual direct common rail injection that
is really revolutionized Diesel's lately
your numbers 181 horsepower but 280
foot-pounds of torque
welcome to turbo diesel and the car
weighs about 3,800 pounds but gets up to
60 in about seven point seven seconds
now no that is 1.7 seconds slower than
the gas engine car it's a dramatic
difference but I will tell you when we
get on the road I'll be able to report
to you that Diesel's feel faster than
they print and your mpg is the ringer
that's the big story here 31 City 43
highway for an average of 35 estimates
now controlling that engines output is a
fairly simple set of drivetrain controls
here is the key to the operation of four
position rocker all the way up is Sport
Plus and then sport comfort and then the
most interesting to me is Eco Pro
especially in this vehicle I don't think
anybody buys a diesel without having eco
pretty high on their shopping list now
all these modes affect engine
transmission steering traction control
and in our car suspension because we
have the optional adaptive underpinnings
the Eco Pro Mode of course dampens
throttle response up shifts occur sooner
down shifts later air conditioning gets
dialed back and you can set this car to
coast to decouple its powertrain when
you lift off so it really glides without
drag even the heating of the mirrors and
the seats gets tuned back a little bit
to put less load on the engines
alternator and battery combine that with
brake energy regeneration that's on
almost every BMW now as well as auto
start/stop technology up here and you've
got about a 10 point plan to bring down
this cars fuel consumption now the last
drive control I'll show you in here is
actually not an ear at all and that
would be any settings for the all-wheel
drive there's nothing to do with it no
controls that change its modes or
behavior it's just in there and it works
now the silvers taking a diesel for a
gas engine in terms of that at tone of
its engine and that's going to turn some
people off even when the windows are up
it comes through the base and the
firewall of the car this is a relatively
inexpensive car by BMW standards and so
there's less isolation of that than
let's say in a 5 Series diesel however
as I mentioned this car is really only
slower on paper yes it is slower in
reality but it doesn't feel slower when
you're behind the wheel that nice
accessible torque makes the car feel
quick not necessarily fast there's a
subtle difference you've got a decent in
fact a very good yellow and red line to
work with here so getting onto it and
shifting is no longer an absurdity like
it was with diesel cars a few years ago
you've got some rev range to work with
and it does make a difference in
perkiness you're not going to miss the
manual transmission that you can't get I
don't think this is a good alert
automatic as BMWs tend to be and because
of the torque the vehicle doesn't get
buried under its upper gears like so
many cars do today you can be in 6th or
7th stomp on it
and get something German diesel wagon
with a M Sport kit and adaptive
suspension I like it
ok pricing our 3-series wagon while it
is a small wagon doesn't necessarily
have a small price because to get it
seen that style you know how it is with
BMW you got to tick off a lot of boxes
we start off at about 44 to base with
destination but then there's another
rough
sixteen thousand dollars in add-ons that
I'd want to see here to truly give it
the old CNET stamp we're ending up
around sixty thousand two hundred now
the other cost a 328d wagon costs
fifteen hundred more than a gas engine
328i based on us fuel price trends so
far this year the 328d will save you
maybe six hundred thirty dollars a year
at the pump compared to feeding the gas
wagon premium that means diesel payback
will take a little under two and a half
years longer if you're okay feeding your
328i mid-grade which it will run on
quite happily the d is also 17% cleaner
in terms of tailpipe co2 but trust me
they don't get that question a lot in us
car showrooms you've got to like it for
more than just its native fuel
efficiency at least as long as prices
stay where they are you got to like it
for it's torquey fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
