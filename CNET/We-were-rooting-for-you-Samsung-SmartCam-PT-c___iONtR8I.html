PT seriously frustrated me it's actually
a fine camera with 1080p high definition
resolution motion and audio alerts
motion zones and local and cloud storage
you can also pan and tilt the smart cam
PT either manually through the smart cam
app or using its auto motion tracking
feature all of that worked decently well
the live feed didn't have much lag the
motion tracking feature followed me
around provided I wasn't standing too
far away from it and the manual pan tilt
function let me see most of a room on
demand the motion and audio sensors were
way too trigger-happy at first but
adjusting their sensitivity helped some
the bigger problem is that Samsung
hasn't made any substantial updates to
its smart camp series in years the smart
cam app for Android and iOS looks
seriously outdated and it's really
difficult to find what you're looking
for and this camera doesn't work with
any smart home platforms even the
Samsung owned smartthings hub
considering Samsung's status as a
multinational tech giant I'd expect much
more innovation in this category even if
you don't care about smart home
integrations the smart cam PT is still
overpriced for what it offers I'd avoid
this model altogether</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
