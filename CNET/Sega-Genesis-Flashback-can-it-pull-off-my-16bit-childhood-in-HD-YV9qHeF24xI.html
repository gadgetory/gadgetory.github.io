of Sega systems if you were like me the
Sega Genesis flashback really is a trip
to the past for $80 it's a mini Sega
Genesis with two wireless controllers an
HDMI port for 720p playback dozens of
built-in Genesis games and it can play
all Genesis cartridges too and it uses
your old controllers but how good is it
and sat down with Sega superfan Bridget
Carey and we played all the games that
we could so there are so many sonic
games here Sonic 3d blast which is not a
great one sonic the hedgehog sonic 2
sonic and knuckles Fox bimbo was hard
but I enjoyed it
let's just Sonic and Knuckles oh yeah
that one's not on a lot of collections
but we're Sonic 3 this is really choppy
wait this was never that choppy on
Genesis
no actually now watch what happens in
here everyone oh it goes back and it
does this weird oh wait can I interrupt
myself like if I die like let's say I
fall off some yeah go jump in the 100
every wound oh and I can control it
again yeah cheating total cheating music
kinda sounds kind of choppy ok this did
not interest us for very long I feel
like the controls are like not fat not
accurate there's a bunch of weird why
would there be non-singer games on here
because they just filled it with lots of
crap we're ok this looks awful I don't
even know what's going on here this is
ok you'll find many random games like
this on your sink really involved I
could just dust off my old Genesis on
the copies a little bit speaking of
which this works with old Genesis
cartridges yeah ok I'm here let's do
that let's see how it performs we have
to examine our all
this was my favorite this is game
absolute favorite what is this
by the time you enter it in did you
enter this game in a lot no this is like
this before I think is this like a
broken ROM reading
I don't know it looks pretty good wow
it's really good but this game was
always kind of like this this makes me
okay
it feels the same for $80.00 it offers
some thrills you caused tomato rain not
a good present opener but this one isn't
as well made as the NES classic thank
you for the trip down memory lane even
though it was a little strange and not
everything I remember</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
