BlackBerry's next phone I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
research in motion began talking about a
new operating system over a year ago but
we finally have the date of when the new
blackberry 10 operating system and new
smartphones will arrive on january
thirtieth you'll see the first two
blackberry 10 phones one is a full
touchscreen device and the other looks a
lot like the current bold product line
with a physical keyboard this is
BlackBerry's best shot at a turnaround
but is it too late many business users
have already switched to iPhones and
Android phones Facebook is always
testing out new features and the latest
is the ability to reply directly to a
comment instead of just replying to the
original post and mentioning the
person's name so it's like a comment
within a comment Facebook is also
testing notification sounds some users
already hearing a little ping every time
there's activity on their page but the
sounds can be turned off in settings for
those of you that recently bought a
windows phone 8 device a preview of the
skype app is now available to download
but some features are still being worked
on like getting a call when the app is
closed Microsoft is on the fast track to
replace live messenger with skype as a
primary voice and instant message chat
service YouTube will cut funding to
about half of the channels at back last
year to create original programming
according to add age YouTube will keep
funding about forty percent of the
original content providers but some
won't learn their fate for another few
weeks a year ago YouTube challenge the
cable industry by investing a hundred
million dollars into the development of
dozens of YouTube channels but just like
cable not all shows get picked up for a
second run apple and HTC have ended two
years of a bitter patent dispute they
came to a ten-year joint licensing
agreement for all current and future
patents from both companies they didn't
share the financial details but one
analysts estimates that Apple will be
getting about six to eight dollars in
licensing fees for every HTC phone sold
looking ahead we'll be hearing more
about a new droid phone from verizon the
droid DNA HTC was expected to announce
the droid DNA in
new york on tuesday but verizon
accidentally spilled the beans early on
its website and then quickly took down
all mentions of the droid DNA the
smartphone is set to have a 5-inch
screen android 4.1 jelly bean but the
full specs will be announced soon also
there's a report that a preview version
of internet explorer 10 for windows 7
pcs will be available to download
