Brian Tong here and Google Isha's is
back that's right we're back after a
long hiatus and you know we didn't
forget you for everything Google you
could think of now this week we're going
heavy on the Samsung Galaxy S nine
details because it's what everyone is
talking about now ventra beats evan
blast dropped the bomb a few days ago
with an official image of the five point
eight inch s9 and the six point two inch
s9 + that design-wise are nearly
identical to the s8 an SI + but you know
what the changes will really be with the
components inside both phones will bring
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip in the US
and China or Samsung's Exynos 9810 to
the rest of the world but the difference
between the s9 phones codenamed star and
star to the standard s9 will get four
gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage while
the s9 plus will start with six kids of
RAM and 128 gigs of storage now the
official Samsung invite they sent out
for its February 25th announcement made
it pretty clear it's going to be all
about the cameras hardware and software
for the s9 with the captions the camera
reimagined now both phones are believed
to feature a new 12 megapixel sensor
with variable aperture that will be
mechanical and can switch between an F 2
4 and f15 aperture now you can see how
it might work like this with Samsung's W
2018 flip phone and it shows it off but
let's not overlook this it's f15
aperture besting the LGV 30s f-16 of
last year and allowing more light to
come in for better images that's the
best aperture on any smartphone camera
in the industry
Evan blast leaked out the camera
components with a single lens for the s9
and a dual lens for the s9 plus with the
biggest change being the alignment of
the fingerprint sensor below the camera
lens which is what we asked for last
year so you won't get that smudgy smudgy
now another feature that was leaked on
the alleged retail packaging says super
slow-mo
where's being reported rapid movement
will trigger a 480 frames per second
video recording at 720p now there will
also be new features come in the s9 Sam
Central's tear down of the settings apk
for the latest Android Oreo beta for the
note 8 has revealed one beam
old intelligence scan it will combine
face and iris scanning to improve the
accuracy of security even in low or very
bright light now this video explainer
was even buried in the apk it's not
using the same technology but clearly
it's their answer to compete with
Apple's face ID intelligent scan won't
replace facial recognition or iris
scanning but will disable the other two
if it's in use this feature may also
replace the fingerprint authentication
completely for verifying your identity
with apps or even signing into websites
now other features like 3d stickers will
let you add stickers similar to think of
the pixels AR stickers that features
Star Wars on its launch and another
discovered feature called tag shot will
allow you to take pictures and tag them
with the current location and weather
information there's also signs that
smart stay will return where your screen
stays on when it can tell you're looking
at it and smart rotation something that
goes as far back as the galaxy s3 might
be making a comeback as well with the S
9 and in case you're an either Bieber or
you just want a cool new wallpaper you
can get the latest galaxy s 9 wallpaper
that looks like all this purple
geometric glory by going to this link on
screen to download it yes you're welcome
so the official galaxy s 9 announcement
will be going down on February the 25th
just before the start of Mobile World
Congress 2018 all right that's gonna do
it for this week if you felt like we
