mouse is essentially mini travel
friendly version of the company's
flagship MX master this trimmed-down
mobile version retails for $80 though it
can be found for closer to $60 online I
used it with both Mac and Windows
laptops and liked it a lot though
ergonomically speaking and isn't as
comfortable to use as the MX master that
said it's about as comfortable as you
get for a smallish mobile mouse that's
designed to easily fit in the side
pocket of your laptop bag and it's
nicely weighted at 3.7 ounces for 106
grams as you might expect from a
high-end mouse it has plenty of extra
bells and whistles thanks to Logitech's
dark feel the laser technology it works
on just about any surface including
glass and it's integrated rechargeable
battery lasts up to 60 days on a single
charge like the MX master you can
connect this Mouse to your Windows or
Mac computer with the included Pico
unifying receiver or via bluetooth smart
technology you go with bluetooth you can
pair the mouse with up to 3 devices and
switch between a laptop desktop or
tablet using the easy switch button
Logitech's options software lets you
customize all the buttons on the mouse
and Mac users enjoy the extra luxury of
gesture support most the multi finger
trackpad gestures can be duplicated by
holding down an extra key one of the key
features of this mouse is its speed
adaptive scroll wheel that lets you auto
ship from click to click the hyper fast
scrolling with a press of a button that
scroll wheel and it's smooth precise
nature is one of the components that
helps justify the mouse's premium price
and make it a worthy successor to the
original MX anywhere which was powered
by two double-a batteries and didn't
look or feel quite as swanky is this
Mouse I'm David Carr noid for cnet.com
