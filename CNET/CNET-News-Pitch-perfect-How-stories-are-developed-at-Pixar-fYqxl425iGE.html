lot of times you know sometime we will
go off and we'll kind of work in our
offices alone kind of solving a problem
or just or avoiding a scene but every
lunch smile there'll be something where
we're like okay we need to come up with
a lot of ideas and we call those gag
sessions yeah yeah well brainstorming
and gag sessions you know depends upon
what we're what we're doing sometimes
we're solving a problem and doesn't
really know to be funny but you know we
try to you know put a little bit of
comedy and everything we do so we'll get
together in that story room and actually
just like all right we're all here to
like discuss this idea and let's go over
some ideas and then we just start
cutting paper and we start drawing and
then we're like oh that's hilarious and
then he'll pin that up and then we'll
pin it up and we'll react to other
people's drawings go ah that's funny
what if he did this and you draw
something else and it's it's really kind
of an improv type of thing you're kind
of building up haunting each other so
this board here was we had a thing where
we needed some monsters who were
athletes to get really mad we're like
okay monster
athletes getting mad how could they do
that in a unique way just not just us
like yeah getting all angry but what's a
funny unique way so there's ideas like
Oh like here's unless he puts all like
the three basketballs a mountaineer I
don't he just like boom
bites them all down or a guy like ah
boom slams and went on his like you know
Hornick Shh it like you know yeah this
little dude is like he gets really mad
like he's like wow it's really big and
like runs around yelling I also like
this one over here we're a free monster
gets all bed he just grabs us for rips
it all off
there's some other good ones oh yeah
multi-character like you know when they
get sad it's just yeah it's more of an
animation note all you can have to have
them droop down a little bit or let's
see what some other ones you know
monstas actually just literally when
they get mad they start to steam and
that could I could actually probably
what I would do is I'd like I gave me
some paper and I'd draw him on fire so
this is like a 1 2 3 and I do a form
where he's like like
in flame because you can do that in the
monster world and then what happens from
here so you throw all these ideas
yeah bored and then how do you make a
lot of good ideas here how do you
condense and we're actually just trying
to come up with as many ideas as we can
and then what we'll do is we get
together with the director and we'll say
okay here's our best you know and then
I'll go up and I'll pitch them all of
these different ideas and then we go
okay cool it would class me okay great
great and then you know Dan in our case
the director dan scanlon would come up
and be like alright cool well you know
what I really like this one I think that
one could really work that one's really
kind of solving it and I don't
mmmthat's really funny but we can't do
that for whatever reason or we shouldn't
or it's just not appropriate for the
story sure so they can narrow it down
and even sometimes what what's so great
about doing it together in a room is it
spawns new ideas that you wouldn't think
of it on your own you may come up with
an idea I may come up with an idea and
then somebody says whoa both our idea
has just just inspired a third idea and
then really that's it that's the you
know and if we did it all alone if we
wouldn't get to that point that's why I
love Pixar it's everyone working
together being collaborative to find the
best solution how many people are
involved in the story team you know it
grows and shrinks depending on where
we're at but typically it's anywhere
between five to like ten-story artists
not including myself ya know we try to
keep it you try to keep it small you
don't want to have a room yeah I mean
whatever room more than like 10 story
artists it would get too crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
