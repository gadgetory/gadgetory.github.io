takes a lot of time at Google we think
we can give you some of your time back
by combining your camera with our cloud
we can do some of those labor-intensive
tasks automatically for you in fact
today we'd like to introduce the notion
of Google it's Google's data centers
being your new darkroom
now what does that mean but when you
think of the cloud most of us think of
backup but today we're going to go
beyond backup and we're going to talk
about three exciting new areas that
combine the data center Google's cloud
with photography now let's talk about
highlight what you're looking at is 686
of my vacation photos from my trip to
New Zealand Google can pick the best
pictures for you we can go from these
686 pictures to these it's remarkably
accurate now let's talk about enhancing
your images today we're introducing auto
enhance we can automatically take an
image that looks like this and make it
look like this
things like tonal distributions skin
softening noise reduction structure
vignette Ingrid
perfect let's talk about skin softening
let's zoom in on this picture a little
bit
wrinkles right watch what happens when
we apply skin softening just gently tone
down let's zoom all the way out that's
the original image that's with skin
softening enhancements just gently and
beautifully enhanced let's talk about
noise reduction now maybe you've taken a
picture in low light
well our noise reduction filters can
automatically take something that looks
like this and make it look like that so
here's an image untouched out of the
camera and we're gonna start layering on
these enhancements let's begin with
tonal enhancement okay let's add some
skin softening before and after on the
skin softening now let's add some
structure for the clouds let's add a
vignette to emphasize the human face and
let's go before and then Auto enhance by
Google pretty amazing isn't it now let's
talk about awesome we're introducing
five Auto awesome effects today
auto-awesome creates a new image from
one that did not exist we recognize that
you've taken several pictures in burst
mode or taken around the same time
together we will automatically gift to
you in your album something that looks
like this
