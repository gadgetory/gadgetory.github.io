now the qx80 as they like many other car
makers go through a name change to go
from one confusing set of nomenclature
to another
anyway let's drive there big boy have a
nice comfortable day on the road as we
drive the qx80 and check the tap I
recall they launched this model I think
it was in New York Auto Show five years
ago it continues on now is the qx80 with
still this big bulbous nose and kind of
sad saggy ass but I'll give it to them
they have sharpened up the face with the
Infinity grille and better-looking
lights and such it's not to me an
attractive vehicle but that's my opinion
it is very luxurious and it definitely
makes the statement inside infinity
argues it's got seating for eight adults
if you get the optional second-row bench
we don't have that I'd say it's seating
for five adults and three of their kids
but I will give them credit it's one of
the roomiest third rows out there 64,000
is base rear-wheel drive then add
another 3,000 plus for all wheel drive
2400 for a rear seat theater system I
would pass on all day long 2100 gets you
one basket of adaptive driver assists
and then another 5500 gets you this
really big more deluxe package to get
you the rest of driver assist kind of
annoyed by how they tease those two
apart even more annoying that that
deluxe tech package requires a
25-hundred dollar tire and wheel package
now all-in were at about 80 grand let's
see what you get
now inside this big luxurious school bus
is actually not much in the way of tech
headlines this is a lot of familiar
Infiniti head unit tech we've seen for a
couple of years now quick refresh you've
got a hard drive based navigation system
I find the display to be a little
childish but it's functional to say the
least you have voice command on this
that is very quick but it does not take
an entire address as a phrase and of
course there's no connectivity to this
navigation system so you have to already
know the address there's no discovery
here so it's starting to feel rather
dated and as far as interface you've got
this seven-inch screen touch of course
on it or you've got the Infinity
controller with roll kick and click
camera button over here calls up the
fact that we have surround view camera
on here that's also standard and it'll
trigger automatically if it detects for
example a pedestrian walking across your
car as you're at an intersection or just
creeping at low speed for drive controls
you have no paddles on this car tells
you a little bit about its mission its
luxurious here is your shifter for the
one choice only 7-speed automatic very
conventional stuff and here's the most
amazing thing in the entire cabin you'll
poke and stab at this Chrome button
trying to figure out what it does until
you realize it's a placeholder for the
optional four-wheel drive control the
instrument panel on this vehicle has yet
to go with the new trend of a full LCD
you still have there very nicely
rendered but traditional analog gauges
and a real crunchy monochrome LCD in the
middle you're really not missing any of
your modern mainstream digital media
sources from broadcast radio to
satellite you still have a disc player
here audio and DVD we have a DVD rear
seat system of course you've got iPod
connectivity through a USB jack and
bluetooth streaming all the major hits
are there but you see what's missing
there no streaming apps that are
supported here natively in the head unit
you can be streaming Pandora on your
phone for example but that's just gonna
be a Bluetooth or aux connection bose
audio is standard bose audio with
surround and more speakers is optional
now up here in the engine room of the SS
qx80 we've got a five point six liter v8
that's the only engine that comes in
these made it up as I mentioned that's
7-speed automatic rear wheel drive is
bass all-wheel drive obviously is
available on these vehicles you're
looking at 400 horsepower 413 pound-feet
of torque for a vehicle that weighs
nearly 6,000 pounds still gets up to 60
in the low seven so the mpg is where you
pay the piper obviously 14 20s you're
rating for something with this profile
and weight that really means 14 is my
hunch okay look I kid the qx80 a lot but
I'll give it one thing it drives much
lighter than it reads there's no 6,000
pound feeling on this vehicle I'm happy
to say and of course everything is super
smooth and rather heavily assisted the
fact that you don't see any paddles up
here on the wheel no sport mode over
here it tells you this car is meant to
be driven lower case D now we have this
optional body control suspension which
is basically an air suspension that
tries to come back listing in a corner
like I'm doing now seems to work pretty
well I expected this thing to keel over
a lot more than it does it stays pretty
upright the rides very cush is you can
imagine and everything's very quiet now
in the infiniti way you've got just
about every flavor of adaptive driver
assist on this vehicle the only thing
that's missing that they do make is they
are steer-by-wire technology it's not
here yet maybe in a future refresh and
the lane departure by the way is active
using your braking basically it'll break
an opposite wheel to kind of drag you
back into your lane
big plush roomy and isolating it's
