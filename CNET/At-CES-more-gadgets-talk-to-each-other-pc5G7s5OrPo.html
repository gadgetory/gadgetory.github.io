is project shield is smarter than that
because it can talk to your computer any
pc game i already owned as long as it's
got good controller support i'll be able
to stream it on my home network and play
it on this device video game companies
generally don't debut products at the
Consumer Electronics Show but thanks to
this connectivity and its ability to
stream games from an Android phone it's
generating a lot of buzz well this is a
big moment in terms of mobile games the
fact they didn't play those those pc
games and be able to use the physical
controls is pretty exciting massive
combination one big trend on the show
floor is gadgets that can talk to each
other forget reaching for the TV remote
grab your tablet instead one of the big
TV transits here we've seen as
improvements in Smart TV technology for
example can recognize what you want to
watch before you want to watch it and
suggest shows kind of a recommendation
engine so say you have CSI on the TV you
don't want to interrupt that what kind
of content are we getting access to
photos videos those in videos that you
have stored on a thumb drive plugged
into the TV set typically you can browse
those applications instead of doing it
on the TV screen you can browse them
here and launch them here when you're
ready but ready or not your tech web
just got a whole lot stronger in Las
Vegas I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS
