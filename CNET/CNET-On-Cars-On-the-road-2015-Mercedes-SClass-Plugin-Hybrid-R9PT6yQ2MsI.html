hybrid but it's not their first hybrid
it's not even their first s-class hybrid
these two have this unloved beast called
the s400 that was a mild hybrid without
the plug-in part and it did mild things
for the mpg like for better in the city
not bad and zero better on the highway
so nobody cared it died in 2013 this is
a much more serious animal with a much
bigger battery and the ability to be
plugged in as well as generate on the
fly now back here of course is where the
big battery lives the additional
traction battery for the powertrain this
is clearly taking up some space back
here although it's by no means killing
the trunk this is an eight point seven
kilowatt hour capacity battery to put
that in context compare it to a Nissan
Leaf which is electric only that has a
24 kilowatt hour battery a Tesla Model S
has either a 70 or 85 kilowatt hour
battery so this is a more modest helper
since this car isn't only an Eevee you
charge it right there in what I believe
is the only charging port I've run into
yet that is integrated back here on the
bumper some folks have expressed concern
that that's a very frequently hit part
of a car and how often will that be
disabled by bumps and dings in parking
lots don't know it's a two-hour charge
from flat on a 240 volt circuit which
you'd certainly want to have at your
home
now inside the s550 hybrid is a lot of
familiar territory very plush very
comfortable and this wonderland of duel
giant LCD wide screens
I'm not going to recover all this cabin
technology for that head over to see net
and just search s550 and you'll find our
detailed review of the debut of this in
gas engine form we take all this apart
here's what I want you to notice though
two new controls on the console this one
here has a little battery icon above the
car as you cycle through that you get
four different modes right there on the
instrument panel hybrids gonna be your
most common mode it's your well
understood blend of gas and electric
power --mode is electric power only
silent running and the accelerator pedal
will actually push back if you're
goosing it too hard to optimize battery
drain East save defends the battery
state by using the electric motor the
least and recharging it the most and
charge goes the furthest it prioritizes
charging the battery above all and
doesn't use electric motor at all
honestly there's a lot of inside
baseball here
I bet you'll just leave it in hybrid
mode and this button right here has an e
plus mode it's a separate layer separate
from those four it gets a little complex
here that one among other things is
going to set up camera and radar to look
ahead and if you're closing on a vehicle
in traffic we're going to trounce the
brakes and waste inertia it's gonna
prompt you to do so more gently and
earlier conserving momentum now unlike
what you expect from an s-class there's
not some big brawny engine in here it's
fairly small it's a 3 liter gas engine
v6 they love thee you've got your bright
orange electrical current cables down
here and that means you're attached to
of course the electric motor which is
embedded in the transmission on this
vehicle inside the works of the 7-speed
automatic so it's highly integral for
both adding as well as doing
regeneration of powers going back to the
battery some of the numbers compared to
your base v8s 550 329 horse on this guy
plus another 114 from the e motor give
you an odd 436 total the gas engine car
is 449 so that's 13
Center torque here is 479 pounds feet
516 on the gas v8 so we're losing 37
both have the same 7-speed automatic
architecture although the gas engine car
can be had all-wheel drive this hybrid
goes to 60 and 5.2 seconds the gas
engine car is a little quicker at 4.8
and of course that big battery charging
apparatus and electric motor add weight
the mpg is notably improved we're twenty
four thirty in the hybrid just seventeen
twenty six without it and of course
where there is no comparison is electric
range this car can go 20 miles on
electric power only in the right
conditions and up to 80 miles per hour
on pure electric this is a key part of
the strategy that helps this car work on
the credits that Mercedes needs in zero
emissions market places like California
and other very stringent states final
under way you know that an S Class is a
big buttery thing this one's bigger and
buttery R it has this incredibly
modulated ride of course owing to that
450 pounds of battery in the back
unfortunately the throttle response is
real lumpy sometimes you've got a bunch
of power sometimes you have a good
amount but it's not the same kind
deceleration is coming in and out
because you've got all these different
drive modes of electric gas gas and
electric and different kinds of regen
it's just not linear and if you trounce
the pedal and really get onto a freeway
on-ramp or something absolutely no
problem
it's that around town stuff where it's a
little bit you know in and out of
different modes it's jarring which
doesn't make sense in a car like this so
I'm left wondering who's really gonna
get excited about this car who out there
is saying Oh finally that's the s-class
I wanted it saves some gas it's it's
measurable
but it's no Prius so what are we left
with I think an s-class that the world
wasn't asking for but California and
other state regulators work
okay pricing on this s550 hybrid is
about 95 3 delivered what is interesting
is that that base price is the exact
same as the gas engine v8 twin-turbo
there is no hybrid penalty on this car
that's pretty notable other things to
bear in mind is these kind of luxury
cars in particular the s-class have
dramatic 5 year depreciation I think
that will be compounded by the fact that
you've got a hybrid here which is
probably going to be much better in five
years and this will be the antiquated
technology that's not gonna do you any
favors either also know that this is
only available rear-wheel drive if you
want all-wheel drive you got to get a
gas engine only</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
