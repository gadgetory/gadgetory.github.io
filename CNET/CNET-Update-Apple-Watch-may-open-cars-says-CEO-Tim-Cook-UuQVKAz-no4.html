and we say farewell to a beloved actor
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update will the Apple watch replace your
car keys that's what Apple's CEO Tim
Cook and visions for the future as he
revealed some perspective on the
SmartWatch to the UK newspaper The
Telegraph in an interview Cook said he
thinks the Apple watch could replace car
key fobs and that the watch's battery
life will last an entire day it also
won't take as long to charge as an
iphone of course we'll learn more about
the watch at an apple event taking place
on march 9th but until we have a watch
release date we'll just have to keep
captivated with the color of a certain
dress posed to the tumbler actually I
hope we're not still talking about it I
think many people are trying to mend
friendships that were broken over
arguments whether the photo of this
dress looks more black and blue or gold
and white explainer articles flooded our
feeds to give us some closure as experts
weighed in on the science of the
phenomenon and how our brains perceive
colors based on shadows and cones and
rods but I won't have closure until we
can get to the bottom of the biggest
question of all we need to find out what
camera took this photo so we can warn
others to never buy it because in real
life the dress is navy blue and black
the photo is so washed out and over
white balanced and was there flash on in
the room with the worst lighting ever
but seriously if you think the photo of
the dress was blue and black you need to
have your eyes checked ah but we
shouldn't let labels bog us down
Facebook has made a change so that you
can use any word you want to describe
your gender before Facebook required you
to choose from a list of choices male
female transsexual or transgender but
now in settings you can type in any word
and make your own label on your own
terms in other social media news Twitter
announced is doing more to crack down on
trolls and harassment the network says
it tripled the size of its support team
that handles abuse reports and new tools
could ban a bad user based on their
phone number and it's an emotional day
for all science fiction fans as beloved
actor and director Leonard Nimoy known
for his role as mr. Spock on Star Trek
died Friday at his law
sanja 'less home at the age of 83 after
battling end-stage chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease the world will
remember him as the iconic pointy-eared
half-human half-vulcan Spock who
inspired generations of stargazers
social media was filled with messages of
people expressing sorrow at his passing
and sharing their favorite moments
Nemo's last tweet was on Monday and he
wrote a life is like a garden perfect
moments can be had but not preserved
except in memory it's hard losing
someone who has such an impact on our
culture it can feel like losing a friend
but we thank you for your work Leonard
Nimoy we are now and will always be your
fans your legacy will certainly live
long and prosper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
