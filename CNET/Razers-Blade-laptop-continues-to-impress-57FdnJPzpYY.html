the performance of a gaming system but
without the bulk weight or typical
aggressive design here's your answer
I'm Josh Goldman and this is the Razer
Blade a 14 inch laptop that's thin
weighs less than four and a half pounds
but has high-end components including a
quad core Intel Core i7 processor 16
gigs of memory and a three gig nvidia
geforce gtx 970m graphics card for
storage you have your choice of a
hundred and twenty eight 256 or 512 gigs
solid-state drives the bodies made from
aluminum so it has this great sturdy
feel to it open it up and you've got
this fantastic 3200 by 1800 resolution
touchscreen with great color and
sharpness that makes everything games
videos photos text they all look great
the keyboard and touchpad are excellent
too and the stereo speakers have a nice
full sound to them and can get quite
loud you'll probably want to hook up
some headphones though because under
load the fans in here get pretty loud
trying to keep this thing cool which is
definitely a challenge in something this
thin to Razors credit only the bottom
back gets really hot leaving the
keyboard and deck warm but still
comfortable as you might expect this
doesn't sit power when gaming but for
regular productivity stuff you can get
four four and a half hours and while you
can game at its qhd+ resolution
depending on what you're playing you
might need to dial back on the quality
to keep your frame rates up
lastly the Razer is not inexpensive with
prices in the u.s. starting at 20 $1.99
you can read the full review at cnet.com
but frankly it's worth the price to get
the top-notch performance in a body this
compact
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a quick look
at the razor blade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
