creepy and it's getting people worked up
I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update it might not make much sense for
a streaming music app to want to access
your GPS or your photos so when Spotify
was requiring permissions to access
these things in his new privacy policy
people were understandably creeped out
and upset Spotify users took to social
media to complain about the concerning
terms of service in the latest app
update but Spotify has apologized and
said it should have done a better job of
explaining what sort of information it
is accessing from users and that if it
wants to access anything it's going to
ask for permission first in a blog post
Spotify clarifies it isn't scanning your
phone's camera roll that wording is just
so you can pick a photo for your profile
or put a photo as your playlist art and
as for location in GPS will that let you
see trending music in your area and it's
part of a feature called Spotify running
which serves up music beats that match
your running stride and you can turn
that off some are saying people are
overreacting to this policy but I say
it's the right reaction we need to be
skeptical and put pressure on companies
to be more clear about what data they
collect instead of hiding it in fine
print with layers of legal jargon also
in app news the Google photos app has a
new perk but the concept isn't new it
will now show you photos taken on this
day from previous years kind of like
time hop it's called rediscover this day
and it can show a collage of photos from
that calendar day taking years ago it's
completely private you have to opt into
the option it's available now for the
Photos app on iOS and it's rolling out
to Android next switching to the world
of gaming Nintendo's not so popular
portable game console is dropping in
price the Nintendo 2ds which is like a
flat tablet ish version of the 3ds it's
going to be priced a hundred dollars on
August 30th and it'll come with the game
mario kart 7 that cuts thirty dollars
off the price of the system it plays 3ds
games but it doesn't fold like the 3ds
and the screen isn't in 3d and if you're
looking for a new game for your phone
one of the most iconic games is now
available on iPhones and iPads final
fantasy
is available to download as a mobile
game for fifteen dollars the critically
acclaimed game originally came out in
1997 for the PlayStation this mobile
version is similar to the pc version and
it has touchscreen controls if you want
to just get through the story quickly
you can turn off the random enemies that
battle throughout your quests but that
takes away the spirit of the RPG the
whole point is to keep battling to level
up with battle after battle and get this
sound stuck in your head for the rest of
your life well we won this update but
you can keep on playing at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
Carey
