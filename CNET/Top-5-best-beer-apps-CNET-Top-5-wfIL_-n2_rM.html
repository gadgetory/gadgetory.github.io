guys I did a lot of research for this
episode last month I tested out a bunch
of apps and went to a lot of bars
because I love you guys all of these
apps are available for iOS and Android
by the way let's get to it
and number five barley open up the app
and you're able to snap a picture of a
print menu barley will give you
suggestions based on your tastes you can
customize what you like in the palette
section there's also a nearby feature
that lets you see what beers around you
and there's a search function if you
just want more information on a
particular beer and number for BJCP beer
styles this is a reference guide BJCP
stands for beer judge certification
program what's the difference between an
American strong ale and a British strong
ale this app can tell you that in fact
it can teach you about over 30 types of
beer oh and the difference between the
strong ales British has more specialty
malt and or sugar character than
American strong ales so said BJCP at
number 3 rate beer maybe you want to
pick from two stouts or IPAs which
should you get I'm always a fan of
asking for a taster of each but you can
rely on the good people at rate beer to
give you a fair idea of what to expect
I've been using rapier the site and the
app for a really long time now and their
judgment has not steered me wrong
and number two beer menus finding out
what beer is available wherever you are
is great the app also lets you keep
track of upcoming events and whatever is
being added to your favorite bars
clicking on a beer on a menu will give
you information about that beer there's
also a log feature if you want to keep
track of what you're having and the
number one is untapped share it's got a
weird spelling but untappd is a great
app if you're a social drinker and by
social drinker I mean you're curious
what your friends are having and you'd
like to share to like many of the apps
on this list there's a nearby feature to
see what's going on close to you you can
add things to your wish list to get
alerted when that beer shows up which is
really cool now you can't go wrong with
any of these apps so use one use all
five go for it as for me it might be
time to try out some cocktail apps rest
assured I'm on it I'm also I as a
colonelcy
