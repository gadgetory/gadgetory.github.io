live text which lets users send each
other texts along with live video but
there's a twist the thing that we did to
innovate was we removed audio and this
way you can actually use it anywhere and
so what you'll find when you start using
the product is doesn't matter if you're
in a room crowded or if you're outside
you actually will text but you'll get a
lot more information through that video
when we introduced it to people the
first reaction is actually a little bit
of like what and it's a little
conspiring that they kind of are like
huh that's that's unique that's
different and then what we found is that
keep on coming back to it and what what
really was happening is that they were
introducing new times in their day to
start using the product I know from my
own experience I will immediately answer
a lot of texts no matter where I am and
I've been in meetings with Marissa or
anywhere and just happily respond you'll
find that people adopt and use a number
of different services and this isn't a
social network right so it's not about
building a follower ship or things like
that it's really about that one-to-one
communication this is ben rubin foreseen
