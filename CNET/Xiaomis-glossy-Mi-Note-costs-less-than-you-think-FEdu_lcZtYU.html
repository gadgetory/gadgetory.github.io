this is a look at the very popular show
me need no phone now this phone did sell
out within about three seconds in China
that is the only place that sold but we
thought we would give you a little look
even if you don't live there because a
lot of people are talking about this
device it has a 5.7 inch display 1080p
HD resolution on the regular me note the
amino Pro will actually have a higher
1440 pixel resolution now you do have a
13 megapixel camera with flash on the
back and on the front you have a 4
megapixel camera inside is the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor the pro version
of this device will have the Snapdragon
810 processor which is even faster both
phones are equipped with Qualcomm quick
charge 2.0 technology which means that
the battery is going to juice up really
really quickly inside you've also got a
3000 milliampere hour battery which
promises that's going to last for a very
long time up to 30 hours on a single
charge now this does have a very slim
design that is made out of aluminum and
glass on both the front and the back
it's curved on the back here and for
this reason it has compared to the
iphone 6 and 6 plus very favorably
indeed the icons on the me you I are
also very reminiscent of Apple but there
are a lot of extra features that Jamie
has thrown in that this phone has that
no other Android phone does the
operating system of the me node is
Android 4.4 KitKat at launch but it will
of course be upgraded to bali pop even
though there's no external card slot for
extra storage it does have 64 gigabytes
included and this is a dual-sim device
once again the me note does not sell
outside of china but if it did it would
cost about three hundred twenty dollars
with the pro version costing about four
hundred dollars I'm jessica's all four
