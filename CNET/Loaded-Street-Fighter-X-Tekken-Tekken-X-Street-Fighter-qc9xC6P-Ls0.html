it's time to get loaded some big gaming
news out of comic-con was the
announcement of a fighting game mashup
between Tekken and street fighter oddly
enough to separate games are being
released by both Namco and Capcom if
you're familiar with both franchises you
know that the fighting mechanics for
each game are very different Namco were
released tekken vs streetfighter with
its respective fighting game mechanics
and capcom will release street fighter
vs tekken with their classic style
control scheme no release date as of yet
and super excited YouTube is
experimenting with html5 in their latest
embedded videos depending on what your
system supports you'll view videos
through YouTube's html5 player or
standard flash right now videos served
through the html5 player do not have
advertising due to Google's current code
format Panasonic's new 3d camera now has
a name the HDC sdt 750 is being
advertised as the world's first 3d
shooting camcorder the lens looks very
different from standard camcorders and
it will shoot in 1080p AVCHD at 60
frames per second no other details the
ctia wants to sue San Francisco over a
new law that requires stores in the city
to display radiation levels in cell
phones the ordinance was passed last
month and the ctia says that this
interferes with the FCC's own mandates
for cell phones currently the FCC tests
each phone before it comes to market and
every unit is required to fall below a
1.6 watt per kilogram threshold Apple
Insider is reporting on a rumor that the
new line of Apple IMAX may include USB
3.0 and firewire 1600 and 3200 no other
details and the USB 3.0 seems a bit
unlikely considering the trend hasn't
caught on in the industry just yet the
rumored to launch end of summer that's
your news for now i'm marko seiya with
