important it is to get the most out of
every charge because those last few
minutes could get you the winning shot
so here's a few tips on how to maximize
your battery life lithium polymer lipo
batteries found in most drones are
sensitive to temperature store in a cool
dry place when you're not using them
never charge immediately after use while
they're still hot and once they've had
some time to cool off
make sure to charge them at room
temperature most batteries start to
drain on their own after charging so
timing is important the longer the wait
the more it will drain so aim to charge
a few hours before you take it out that
said avoid overdoing it and remove it
from the charger once it reaches full
capacity some batteries stopped charging
automatically but it's never a good idea
to leave a lithium-ion battery plugged
into the wall for longer than it has to
be no matter how experienced you are
it's always harder to control your drone
when you're fighting the elements strong
winds could significantly reduce your
battery life as the drone uses extra
power to balance a clear dry day is
optimal in this case if you don't need
it take it off this includes any
propeller guards lens filters or other
accessories that may be weighing down
your drone the harder you fly them the
more power you use and now that you got
rid of the propeller guards you should
probably aim for a more steady
controlled flight anyways plus you'll
get steadier footage
yes it's tempting to push it to the very
end but those extra five minutes of
flight are not worth the damage you may
be doing to the battery in the long run
so listen to the warning signs and land
as soon as possible and for more drone
