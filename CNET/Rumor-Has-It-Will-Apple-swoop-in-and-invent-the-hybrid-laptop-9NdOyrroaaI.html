franklin and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumors and vote on what
sounds likely and what's probably not
true at all and remember that you can
vote on all of the rumors too so keep
your eye out for the poll in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet up first according to the wind beta
forums windows 8.1 would allow you to
bypass the touch base Metro interface to
effectively boot to the desktop
apparently one of the reasons windows 8
isn't selling very well is because the
OS currently boots directly to metro and
that's a bit scary for people most of us
fear change and don't want to be forced
into learning something new yeah it's
like when we were supposed to switch the
metric system because every other
country uses it and it's intuitive but
then nobody wanted to learn it so now
we're stuck with inches just don't next
up not to be outdone by everybody in the
universe Microsoft is now rumored to be
working on a SmartWatch of its own the
wall street journal reports that
Microsoft has us suppliers in Asia to
ship components for a potential
touch-enabled watch device this isn't
the first time Microsoft has tried its
hand at the SmartWatch game a partner
with fossils watch in suunto to create
smart personal objects technology or
spot watches in that key no it's really
not and neither is this whole SmartWatch
trend we've already had several rumors
none of them has come out yet and I
already don't care yeah but once all the
cool kids start using their smart
watches and syncing them with their
smart phones and your tablets then
you'll care stopped knowing me so I'll
that's what she said in the Bible up
next a patent document that came to
light recently shows that Apple might be
working on a convertible MacBook ipad
hybrid and what really sets it apart is
that this device could be charged
wirelessly that and also all the fanboys
will lose their minds and have to have
one now patent applications don't
necessarily mean
the product is being worked on last year
Tim Cook basically said that computer
tablet hybrids are dumb and we'll
probably make you fat you didn't
actually say the fat part on the other
hand apple also said it wouldn't make a
smaller iPad but we have the ipad mini
now true i think that apple will make a
laptop hybrid eventually Apple would
never buy pass an opportunity to enter a
struggling market and try to do
something better yeah it's kind of like
when I see a little kid playing
basketball and I grabbed the basketball
and I dunk on him like in your face
Billy do you really do that Oh what do
you guys think will Apple make a laptop
hybrid don't forget to vote and leave a
comment and we'll check in with the cnet
council the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet council's verdict is no
they do not think an apple hybrid tablet
laptop is imminent however one editor
said he would love for them to do that's
our show everybody please share your
rumors at rumor has it at cnet com or
call us at 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us
thanks to this week's co-host Eric and
