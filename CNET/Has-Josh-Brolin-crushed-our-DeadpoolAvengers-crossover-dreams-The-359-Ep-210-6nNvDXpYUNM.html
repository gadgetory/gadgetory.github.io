welcome to episode 210 of the 359
podcast on BBG thanks for joining in the
house today we've got Ben Fox Ruben and
Roger Chang what's up guys hey morning
hello how's everybody doing come back
doing great you're back you've been gone
for a two things seemingly forever
yeah come he pass over every got you
yeah that was I was off the grid eating
matzah so I'm very happy to do that guys
that sounds wonderful
yeah we had some we had some tough years
in Egypt and I'm glad I'm glad
everything worked out okay - its natural
extreme a good day to come back on cuz
what are we talking about yeah we've got
a relatively slow slow tech news day so
we'll be talking about Josh Brolin being
cast in the next Deadpool movie it's
cable and whether or not that confuses
everything since he's already Thanos in
Avengers which is a big deal which is a
huge deal
oh yeah literally yes we're gonna be
talking about Silicon Valley gearing up
for its net neutrality fight and and
lastly will be time at Microsoft rolling
out a program to let gamers get refunds
which is good cuz that's alright as
always if you have any questions leave
them in the comment section Brian will
pick out the best and we'll get to them
in three minutes in 59 seconds from
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all of
the crap you want to throw him I'm Roger
Tsien I'm Ben Fox Ruben so we decided to
geek out a little today josh brolin was
cast as cable in the next Deadpool movie
and our minds are blown he's now playing
to Marvel characters so does that mean
you know him double dipping means that
we don't actually get a crossover
between the Avengers and x-men universe
which would be sad that is constant
which we'd be sad but like I kind of
feel like Deadpool doesn't really fit as
much with the Avengers universe in the
movies in the movie true the r-rated
Deadpool you know cursing violently
killing people yeah which one made it
such an interesting
yes that it was you know kind of this
like we're fright it like refresh or a
totally different version but from a
broader point that does that also like
exclude the idea of the the x-men
universe which is owned by Fox
integrating with the Marvel Universe
which is owned by Disney yeah I mean
it's it obviously makes it much more
difficult right and and the potential of
cable killing Thanos now you just gonna
have to use a lot more computer graphics
they could do it they could do I do I'm
hoping it happens I don't think I don't
think cable would actually first of all
what are cables skills like what makes
fine Brian you know our producer
absolutely know this it's a form of
energy conversion I think there's
something with telekinesis too right
yeah cuz he's the son of Cyclops and
Jean Grey right so he's kind of got like
a little bit of a boat best of both
worlds there his remembers I flashed a
lot I don't know why that was over this
aesthetic okay it looks cool for sure I
have to comment by the way Josh Brolin's
like it's perfectly I thought was
perfectly cast for Thanos but he's also
kind of perfectly cast for cable like
yeah he looked like he's got the right
like chin blocky jaw stronger right
growth he just looks like a and we look
at cable he doesn't actually look like a
real human character he's it's like like
three times wider than a normal human
being
that's because Rob Liefeld has a hard
time drawing people overly masculinized
whatever which is what you think about
when you see Josh Brolin's face
absolutely all right next up Silicon
Valley is gearing up for the net
neutrality fight the internet
Association a trade group made up of
copies like Google Facebook and Netflix
of the officially voice there objection
to the FCC and president Trump's plans
to dismantle the rules that govern how
the internet work yeah yeah exactly it
really seems like everybody is playing
the part that they were expected to play
this doesn't seem at all surprising to
me the real questions here are is net
neutrality definitely going to go away
all right is there something these major
companies can do to prevent this from
happening because on the other side of
the coin are other major companies like
comcast in a variety yeah and Verizon
that want to see
Neutrality go away so like this anybody
have an edge right now I mean I would
say the the serve anti net neutrality
side has the advantage right now because
President Trump Republican the sec is
run by the republicans and generally
republicans have been for laxer rules
when it comes to net neutrality so yeah
it's i mean it's great these guys are
coming in but i'm a little skeptical
that will actually make a difference but
we'll see lastly a Microsoft is rolling
out a new option two members of its
insider program that allow for refunds
of games within 14 days of purchase as
long as the game hasn't been played for
less or for more than two hours
something's team already offers but
that's you know that's kind of ice but
have you ever returned a game I mean a
digital game or physical I would
probably say that I've never returned
like an iTunes album when sometimes you
play like one song you know like why did
I just leave been ten dollars I've asked
for a refund I think it's because I I
just think this is this is good customer
service is a smart thing to do
and I like that they're doing it right
all right food for more stories or for
that store and more check us out seen it
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening
I return games before yeah yeah I mean
I've I mean I think everybody's done the
trade-in program will wait you're
talking about digital games or physical
games because everybody yeah physical
games for this is just for digital this
is just for digital yeah which which
they have to create this new type of
system for it because for physical games
there's this entire industry yeah but
set up for trade ins and you know yeah
I've sold games on like the Amazon
Marketplace yeah I joined that like Game
Stop membership program yes I was able
to like turn in games for free I mean
they said get a new one but they don't
make it as easy when it comes to digital
copies of things yeah so it's more
convenient true like Steve actually
makes it pretty easy to return those
games it's really offer but yeah I mean
it's an interesting idea it's long
overdue for sure yeah you're spending 60
bucks on these games so it's it's nice
that you have an exit exit hatch if you
need one you know
because otherwise it's also a good way
to preview these games right we've got a
two hour limit
I mean that gives you a good chunk of
time to experience what the game is like
right make sure you want to commit to it
mm-hmm
I kind of missed the day look like the
glory days of the digital demo download
that's correct
all in a little bit yeah I mean I know
hasn't gone away but it's definitely not
as robust as it was I remember when I
first got my xbox 360 back many many
moons ago that was kind of a nice
feature was signing up for Xbox Live and
just trying demos all over the place I
loved that yeah yeah I took way more
advantage of that then I probably should
have okay they're making it available
for you is that yeah all right let's
let's talk about the elephant in the
room or the giant purple space okay with
minute II rings yeah yeah I get to
really participate in the show today oh
please oh yeah is it an expert when it
comes to this stuff so I mean what do
you guys think yer iya Stu I think Ben
you're the least initiated in the room
no but you are like a pretty hardcore
Thanos like you read I mean I knew
Thanos quest from back in the day I know
it's been a while I have those Thanos
quest comic books back home so maybe I
should like polish them off yeah yeah or
before the actual movies maybe when we
finally run out of chair we'll just have
you read the comic for the podcast all
right Ben those are really good stories
I mean I know a lot of I'm sure a lot of
people are really excited to see those
movies I guess one of my like in my
naivete I had actually thought that
maybe there was going to be some sort of
cresting 2 or like we had reached peak
comic-book yeah apparently that's not
happening any time see you saw the Thor
Ragnarok trailer like apparently it's
the most viewed trailer oh yeah which is
justified because that thing's awesome
and watch it like 10 times also come on
Zeppelin yeah you've already on my heart
but this is the thing is that like how
long have comic book movies like these
big epic comic book movies coming been
coming out like they it's been 10 years
now like they're well you know Balcon go
back to the OG go back to where the boom
really started was probably x-men yeah
we're going on 20 years now yeah 20
years
I feel like there's a bit of a gap there
sure but that was weird yet where
people's attention started to turn back
around after Batman and Robin say oh
wait there's still potential here was
spider-man and then Marvel like loaded
the every bullet they had and just
started rapid firing you're right there
was a while there where it was just the
Batman movies yeah and they were really
hit or miss like and they weren't nearly
they were just terrible they weren't
really as high impact they all basically
existed in Arkham there was a ceiling
there was a oh it's just a comic-book
movie right right supposed to the guys
in case huge like you know basically
like modern warring world-spanning you
know like not just like global stories
these are like universe Fanning stories
absolutely so interconnected all linked
yeah it's yeah let's get into those I
load a lot more to come apparently let's
get a little dialogue going everyone in
the chat what was your absolute worst
least favorite like what was the the
trough in your comic book movie
experience and what was your peak what
was your favorite I feel like the the
trough is so obvious which Batman versus
Superman like that was just them no no
no it's a bad movie but I don't think
it's the worst I mean like it was pretty
fantastic four movies okay I could not
even finish those matters or the
original Incredible Hulk or the Hulk
just Hulk have you seen you are y'all
making a good argument for that no steel
that's right I never watched Star Trek
as as John Henry irons okay okay
seriously one up to me I've never
watched it but it just looks really
really like the suit is supposed to be
metallic but it's clearly like leather
or something like me it's not it's
really terrible right in Batman sorry
that meanin Robin was very well known as
like a classic horrible only killed the
franchise yeah well that was it that was
the the bottom out in the industry that
was the 1983 pre Nintendo video game
bottom of comic books before x-men
jumped back into the game yeah you said
83
you mean like 93 93 yeah well I'm
talking about I'm comparing it to like
when video
bottom down they felt like that was
essentially we have the comic-book
movies right because of Joel Schumacher
yeah
but yeah no I it's yeah we were talking
about this earlier like when do we hit
peak comic book movie it hasn't happened
well I don't think it's gonna happen
till at least like Avengers comes around
like I think everyone's waiting for a
vengeance cuz that's a culmination of
all these these movies from basically
from Avengers 1 right mmm they tease
Thanos after that I don't know like how
do they how do they one-up that like
that's situation they've definitely done
a good job of building it ultimate
crossovers Warner Brothers and Disney
meet in the middle and we get Justice
League versus Avengers I mean happen in
the comic books right a couple times yes
yeah I didn't make out like was that
successful as a comic book oh sure
effort yeah yeah it wasn't the most
critically acclaimed but it sold like
bonkers yeah cuz they just are the dudes
put two teams in the room and just have
a fight each other for a while just seem
until they find out there's no there's a
greater Menace and they have to team up
exactly it's always how it's like it's
completely formulaic nubs in the chat
loves Deadpool Wow chat TV did not like
the Avengers that is Wow shocking oh by
the way or the Voltron shout out to chat
DV me and me and Chad TV had some words
before and oh yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna
I'm gonna send him my love
alright I do agree with Chad on Luke
Cage though Luke Cage was in I have
inaudible it was like the perfect
culmination of everything from like
soundtrack to add it to is it the best
of the Netflix Marvel shows mmm-hmm
that's really hard to say I've only
watched daredevil on half of just John I
have a really hard time objectively
looking at them because I can really see
a lot of parallels between Deadpool Luke
or not Deadpool sorry uh daredevil Luke
Cage and Jessica Jones
I personally was so pleasantly surprised
by Jessica Jones cuz I really got to go
and blind on that one I didn't know much
about her in the car yeah either and I
was just really floored by her
performance and I have really loved
David Tennant in the show um that was
just one of those like it was so fresh
to me so I really got to enjoy it was
the same deal with the fall for like I
think we watched half of it
like my wife got like GE birth and like
we stopped watching we stop consuming
all media after that we don't really
have to finish it and then it was the
other one Oh the fourth what's the
fourth the one that's really bad
Oh iron fist iron fist yeah yeah yeah I
haven't watched it yet I've been a
terrible I'll get there sooner or later
Jessica Jones I definitely I mean you're
the one that turned me on to that one
and I think that was a very well
produced show I still haven't finished
it I got really into it for a while and
then it was kind of it was brutal slow
down yeah what I found those Marvel
shows is like the the midpoint like
there's like episodes in the middle yeah
it's really great the beginning yes but
there is part really they're clearly
stretching out the plot yeah we're like
we have 13 episodes of Phil we've only
got about seven episodes of story
don't think of them as a show think of
them as a ten hour movie that's the
second act second act is tends to feel
like there's no real slow down come on
we talked about that on the podcast this
is that we complain about the build-up
on Game of Thrones where there's
build-up for seven to eight episodes and
then everything falls a domino effect on
the last two episodes and everybody's
like it is all awesome but a lot of it
is build-up let's run through a little
more on the list from the chat a couple
people were not thrilled with ant-man I
did laugh my ass off it was a big
departure it's hard to even call it a
superhero movie he's a heist movie with
a lot of comedy elements a cast was
fantastic but I could see where a lot of
people are like alright this doesn't
really fit the mold but it's good that
they're experimenting cuz otherwise it's
gonna be the same even formal okay like
Marvel's the genre is a comic book
movies it's just the lens like the genre
is a nice movie or a political thriller
or a straight action movie but it
happens to incorporate comic book how
they've charged I don't know if that's
gadgets powers capes something of that
rage or happens in there to kind of
round it out
like Logan is clearly it's a Western oh
god yeah yeah it's like a Western or
even like a samurai movie that that
happens to be comic books yeah yeah I I
haven't seen him and yet but I like the
idea I've heard very good things about
and I'd like to laugh yeah that's the
whole thing of like to get away from the
formulaic comic book movie introducing
things like ant-man and Deadpool to
react expand out the universe or the
concept yeah what a comic movie can be
no coincidence that like Deadpool is
like their most successful Fox is most
successful because it's completely
different right and it was like I got a
shoestring like they couldn't even get
ready and they make noise about it which
side character perfectly into
characterization of absolutely I know
everybody says that Robert Downey jr.
was one of the best casting calls and
all the history of all the movies yeah
I still say Ryan Reynolds it so you
could make a really strong argument one
of those someday they're gonna make more
Iron Man and Robert Downey jr. is not
gonna be in it and when when Ryan
Reynolds puts down the red cowl they
have to retire that character this is a
strong prediction but I like it I like
it oh yeah all right well let's get a
few more imagine Sagi was not thrilled
with Hellboy I find that I did not watch
Hellboy 2 but Hellboy it had really
underrated look Hellboy had some really
great visuals do you want to remember
the storyline at all no I mean like but
but I think that was really what they
focused on it was kind of like watching
Pan's Labyrinth
to history oh yeah yeah we're like
you're watching it for visual aspects it
was yeah I'm Pan's Labyrinth arguably
had a much more obviously it's all del
Toro yeah it's it's very yeah but like
it was a very visceral storyline as
opposed to Hellboy a few low-hanging
fruit of course at taking shots of
Batman Forever and Batman and Robin I
argue that Batman and Robin is
significantly worse than Batman Forever
I still kind of enjoy Jim Carrey and
Batman Forever it's like they're both
pretty terrible Batman and
it's definitely far worse though that
one also had like Schwarzenegger and
that weighted bat mean forever right
that was Batman and Robin
that was BAM yeah George Clooney to have
gone out and tried to actually give
people personal refunds for buying
tickets to them that's a rumor I heard I
remember he showed up for New York Comic
Con to talk about to promote
Tomorrowland and I remember he was just
like he was super politic still like
Tomorrowland you know what like last
year two years ago then Robin Kubelik
what I'm still sorry godlike but like
the kid from like the Anakin Skywalker
game oh yeah they'll be apologizing his
whole life no he'll be in jail okay
that's true
yeah he got arrested really yeah he lost
his mind when I'm like a car chase or
something like that and he's like kid
actors that's kind of sad never let your
kid be in a Star Wars yes never let your
kid be famous Dillon says obviously Dark
Knight's got to be up there on top of
the list
oh yeah
Scott's asking do we think if Netflix is
ever gonna release some Marvel shows on
blu-ray I think they will but I think
they're gonna wait and do a big box
don't you since they're all kind of an
inter weaved giant movie - yeah in a
sexy that I think we'll wait to the end
of defenders and then maybe you'll get a
blu-ray this is all just you know
speculation on my part I think it'd be
cool if you could just buy like you know
drop 200 bones and get a big ball of it
I'm not - not to be but not to quibble
with our viewer too much but why do that
you know you're paying like what is it
nine or ten dollars a month for Netflix
they're never gonna remove those because
those are Netflix shows why buy a
blu-ray to check blu-rays other Netflix
shows on disk people still like shelf
porn okay yeah which shows though
orange is a new black okay it's on DVD
it doesn't make a lot of sense to me as
a consumer doesn't make a lot of sense
to me to buy them as blu-rays consumer
not a collector right
that's true there's definitely market
there for folks who would like to have
that that's true okay
Assad is saying that he was really upset
that they kind of killed Superman and
Batman V Superman spoilers sorry
everybody gone forever he's definitely
not gone dad cavils been on the set of
Justice League that was my biggest issue
well one of my biggest issues with they
killed Superman and now that they bring
him back like their there's never any
kind of sense of Jeopardy for Superman
never hildo even if he dies you're like
well that's been the problem with comic
books in general right but well the
thing of it is is like maybe you do it
movie two or three or four or whatever
but like right off the bat they kill
them just like it's like it is a
storytelling tool for sure like you know
death and resurrection of the comic book
character is one of the many yeah tools
that they use but like why do it on
movie one we're moving for a movie - for
Superman right like they just seduced
Batman they killed off Superman right
away yeah they're just they're they're
pedal-to-the-metal they're blasting
through this stuff and it's not working
and I want to be cautiously optimistic
because I was a Justice League kid I
grew up on Batman and Green Lantern I
want it to be great but I'm not blind
it's not great yet are you disappointed
that Green Lantern there's still these
weird rumors floating around that the
he's like a secret that shows up at the
end kind of I call BS I know that
they're going to bring green and he'll
never put that costume on I know I want
to see Green Lantern again I want him to
get that one right I love Green Lantern
Jon Stewart that'd be awesome because so
many of us grew up on the Justice League
Unlimited animated series where he was
the feature and only Kyle Rayner kind of
showed up in the Superman animated
series and how Jordan kind of popped in
and out there are a lot of Green
Lantern's oh my god you guys have
totally lost me some heavy geekdom
alright so before we wrap it up cuz we
are going way long today we really got
to get back to the task at hand of
Brolin being able to cross over that's
right so what do I mean okay here's my
perspective berlin's a tremendous actor
Santos is a kid is a puppet I mean he's
basically voice acting it you
no prob there's got to be mocap involved
socially look like cappers are like is
it's not actually him with makeup right
no no it's gonna be a CG render yeah
much like the halt but the december's
resembles Ruffalo yeah yeah he just
answered the question then it would be
very easy to do that I think it would I
don't think this rules out anything
mmm-hmm there's a really kind of weak
pay out for a long I know Ron outcome is
a very sorry Roger but what do you think
what do we think you can complain
incessantly in the comment no I would
say that I mean yes logistically I don't
think it's it's that hard to put those
two together I think it's more what it
says about the relationship between
those two Studios the like Fox just went
off there like basically nabbed the the
key villain in like the Disney Marvel
Universe to play you know a main
character in one of their big movies and
I think it just sort of at foreshadows
effect that if they're if ever there was
an attempt to you know bridge these two
universes like it would be hard yeah
we're realistically looking at it's
probably not going right and as much as
we'd love to okay yeah of course these
comic-book movies just cash machines
Brolin's a tremendous actor though like
that was a good casting call for cable I
was kind of had my hopes up like I was
when they said Pierce Brosnan was kind
of hanging out there Versailles I was
really shocked and then I'd be kind of
good right yeah right cuz he my my
thought is he kind of resembles James
Martin who plays Cyclops who has the
yeah fair enough and there's a babe not
we did not address the fact that Josh
Brolin was already in a different comic
book movie thanks
yeah which was I want you have terrible
cop this was this was like make that
five point yeah it was it was a big even
remember a movie that's right yeah what
a shame I didn't watch that movie there
by the way because I had heard so many
bad things about it and I think that was
one of the movies that essentially
killed Megan Fox's career Tom Jane they
were like they were like
now that your now anytime you're in a
movie like it just as horribly yeah the
Punisher Tom Jane was the punish right
first movie and then he wanted to play
Jonah Hex I think he should have played
Jonah AXI have been a much better cast
in fact he did like his own reel 42 at
least did the makeup and took photos
trying to pitch to get the role oh
really
yeah that guy he deserves a good comic
book role he's a director he's a great
dude and clearly the subject matter he
did an incredible sequel you can find it
on YouTube it's called dirty laundry yes
I'm sure
yeah it's a ten minute thing but oh man
it's better than every other Punisher
incantation on film supporting his own
except for the Netflix series and not to
take anything away from I can't remember
the actor's name Jon Bernthal yeah but
yeah as far as like the film ish
versions go that Tom Jane short dirty
laundry look it up it's awesome it's
brutally violent though warning well
yeah but some people don't have the
stomach for it all right it's good way
to wrap things up ya know in bond brutal
violent Brian I bow to your great comic
book knowledge thank you it's
encyclopedic yes it's all right wait
impressive I don't know if I'm gonna put
that on a resume all right do you like
