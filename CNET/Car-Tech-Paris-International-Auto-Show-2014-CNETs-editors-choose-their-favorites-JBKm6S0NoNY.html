name is Tim Stevens I am antuan goodwin
and I went getting them and we are
standing in the pooja booth which is
appropriately right next to the citroen
booth which is next to the Renault booth
which is next to the Ford booth and
Nissan and Volvo and everything else in
your mix of cultures in the wonderful
paris auto show which is kind of winding
down we've been touring the show floor
for the past day and a half and now we
thought we'd take a little time to talk
about our favorites the beautiful cars
we've seen the concepts and the new
technologies that we've seen in why
don't we kick things off with you what
would you say would be your highlights
car than this 2014 show well you guys
know that I'm a huge not a fanboy so the
fact that the fourth generation Miata
was here got me excited but there's not
a lot of details about that long a
little bit a little bit but more
questions and answers at this point so
the car that I'm most excited about the
show is actually the honda civic type r
concept that's actually really do I a
neuron de fanboy I was a Honda fanboy
before I was in the out of fanboy
they've been kind of dropping the ball
with me out of this car is pretty
awesome it's got the wide body kit it's
based on the civic hatchback that they
have over here in Europe and it's got a
turbocharged i VTEC engine that puts out
about 278 horsepower Wow scott front
wheel drive like every other civic but
this is also the first civic type-r that
I've ever seen that has an adaptive
suspension so you'll be able to set this
thing up to be track ready you'll hit
one big red are button on the dash
that's going to set your engine off it's
going to put your suspension at a
snippets and just have you ready to hit
the track they want to be the world's
fastest front-wheel drive car around the
neighborhood
you got a pretty good shot I think do
they talk about differential technology
about they didn't talk about any
differential technology but I'd imagine
that there'd be some sort of limited
flip and wouldn't be the first time that
they've used that on a tie part and any
any hope of a production version this
gotta happen this is you know there's
how Honda does is they start showing
these more and more thinly veiled
concepts and you know this is pretty
close i think as far as like the engine
and suspension technology goes to being
ready to go the actual design of it
there was still very concept of you get
those really sort of LED strip
headlights and the phytic it's probably
too wide body for the road but i think
it's getting in there and i think we'll
see it sometime something close to
production maybe next year awesome that
would be great for for Honda fans I know
there are still quite a few left up
there yeah it's be really sad when it
doesn't come to America Wayne what do
you think what's your favorite the show
well I saw two head units yeah they are
they around the Nurburgring depends on
what they're in and in one case irina
volvo xc90 which could be pretty
powerful at pretty fast because it's got
a potentially 400 horsepower dry praying
with a plug-in hybrid system this is
their new ta twin engine system in the
new xc90 but the sets is connect a head
unit for it is pretty cool it's actually
a 9-inch portrait style touchscreen you
don't really see these in cars too often
yeah just Tesla is really the only other
notable when I can think of tesla model
s and i got to you know use the demo
unit here it was responsive a work fast
it seemed intuitive you get four tiles
across the the main home screen which
shows you navigation and audio and
stereos like that and the phone
it's ignored pretty well and there's
also Honda actually two viewed a new
Honda connect head unit only in Europe
for now it's actually based on an
Android operating system and there's a
Tegra 3 NVIDIA Tegra 3 chip underneath
so pretty robust hardware and that
looked like it had a lot of potential as
well because with the Android operating
system you can install a bunch of apps
on there yeah the hot is going to curate
those app so you can you know put 20
Birds or whatever the latest game is on
there but funky pigs I think you get
that kind of stuff it actually is for
cars what really kind of won me over is
the Citroen ds3 series I know that's
actually a car that's been out for a
while then citroen is kind of
highlighting their diaz brand which
they're breaking out as a separate brand
with a new concept car here and some and
some interesting d s stuff is actually
one of the s3 rally cars here d s divine
concept that college is based on the ds3
really cool-looking little tight
hatchback with kind of a diamond pattern
all over the place kind of hidden in the
headlights the taillights on the back
end and actually the back end is just a
really cool like Hoover treatment that
looks a little bit like a dinosaur too
yeah it is a very interesting car with
the kind of aggressive masculine diamond
louvers in the back but yet they
interior that's festooned with gemstones
it's a bit of an odd mix it's very
curvaceous on the inside lots of fabrics
that are kind of wrapped around and not
a lot of hard edges on the inside but
it's kind of interesting to see them
sort of blend something so curvy and
some sharp at the same time alright so
we've got citroen des we've got honda
civic type-r now what's your favorite
i'm going to go with probably the
longest named concept car the show the
lamborghini ass tyrion LPI 9 10 4 did I
get that right yeah all right all right
this is the Lamborghini 910 horsepower
hybrid car with a v10 in the back
electric motors up front all-wheel drive
of course as you can expect from a
Lamborghini which is all well and good
but I really like the styling it makes
me think within urine and I've been
wanting them to bring the mirror
for a long time now it's not exactly a
throwback design there's a little bit
more classical styling than their kind
of hard edge agro cars I've been making
of late I don't really know what's going
on with my meeting i looked at the
pictures of that car and the example on
the floor here and the curves just do
not go with that recent lamborghini
styling not exactly where they got the
look of his car from and it the
lamborghini urus concept that debuted in
beijing a couple of years ago their SUV
if you take that concept and smoosh it
down to like a saloon that's pretty much
what this car is with a hybrid
powertrain it is and they've said that
they're going to make it a more casual
driving car so not quite so extreme alex
is in transition a lot more luxury on
the inside it is it's a lovely looking
car I do hope they make it I certainly
won't be able to afford if they ever do
they didn't give any indications or
whether or not they will you know
fingers crossed I don't know in terms of
the scale of probably going to make it
to totally not going to make it I'd put
it somewhere in the middle let's say the
last car that will the second to last
car they debuted here in France with the
Vivino and they only made three of those
so they're got to make at least one or
two of it so yeah they're gonna make it
this is sort of a GT style car and
that's not something they really have in
the lineup right now that's true it's
it's a hole that they could definitely
feel you know before they even put his
SUV out right how the car that caught my
eye was the new Mercedes AMG GT it's
kind of a soft replacement for the SLS
which is now after a million special
edition is no longer in production
rather more affordable but still not
affordable they did put a price of one
hundred and twenty four thousand nine
hundred euro which is not cheap but it
is significantly cheaper than the SLS
what used to be different powertrain
interesting v8 with dual turbochargers
mounted within the V which is a curious
thing usually you know you try to move
the turbos away to maximize cooling and
that sort of thing there put them right
there in the middle they say that the
heat is actually good for the turbos
which i think is an interesting movie
yeah when they mentioned this car when
they announced it a couple of weeks ago
before showing it here at the show you
know they pointed out that that it's the
first time they use that high in fat B
and the internet quickly jumped down our
throats and say wait a minute BMW has
been doing this with their twin scroll
turbo
for a long time not actually a new
technology but it is a little bit more
interesting for their packaging mm-hmm
as you can see Mercedes going with a
dual temperature to set up at all I mean
we've seen bigger bigger bigger engines
of supercharges things like that and now
we could duel turbo v8 I think it's
going to be gonna be fun to drive i hope
i think it's a good-looking car but i
think without the gull wings of the sls
it loses a little bit of the exotics ism
and it does look a lot like a 911 from
the rear it looks exactly like it i
think a lot of people going to be cross
shoving it with a 911 to it is obviously
starts at a higher price but if you're
looking at maybe like a Turbo S or
something like that but you don't want a
little drive I think people will be
crush up in the two so i'll be curious
to see what the sales figures look like
i'm 24 is almost 4 dab'll compared to
the previous sls literally there's a lot
of people in that band you might see
these cars around actually on the street
whereas an SOS seen one on the street is
like a once-in-a-lifetime experience
yeah I'm already on the waiting list for
this you are and the Lamborghini too Wow
Antoine man or any other cars that
caught your eye before we wrap things up
from here just got to mention the Jaguar
XE was pretty interesting as far as a
car that you'll probably see a lot of
them around this looks like a competitor
BMW 3-series Audi's mid-size sedans I
think it'll be an entry point for Jagger
for a lot of people not a super exciting
car except for the fact that it does
look like a pretty nice jab yeah and
it's so that's the space that Jaguar
really needs to be in there actually on
a pretty good sort of like push as far
as like getting some really interesting
cars out to the market though being able
to get people in at a lower price points
definitely
kind of push their cachet up all right
well I think that'll wrap things up for
us here on the show floor of the paris
auto show we've enjoyed our coverage
