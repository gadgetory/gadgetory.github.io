where luxury watchmaker tag heuer has
just announced a partnership with Google
to create its first android wear
SmartWatch which will be the first
luxury Android wear SmartWatch we've so
far seen my biggest announcement is what
I got to tell you is a world information
the people that will give birth to the
greatest connected watch we believe that
wearable technology is going to take off
but this is not something that can be
driven by tech companies only wearable
technology is very personal it's
something that represents either who you
who you are who you want to be seen as
and certainly tech companies are not
necessarily the best people to figure
that out I think the partnership with
Intel and you're like where is going to
enable us to build a beautiful smarter
watch I'm really excited to do it
together you can see the energy here
mixes very well with a DNA and Silicon
Valley tag has such a phenomenal track
record of technical innovation the
people are fantastic to work with we're
going to really have something special
that may sound nice and exciting but
before you get too excited there is
actually very little detail available
tag heuer hasn't yet announced when the
watch will go on sale how much it will
cost or even what it will look like but
has said that will find out a lot more
about it at the end of the year and
during the presentation of the work you
will know what price the watch will be
you will know in which executions the
words would come out you will know all
the function of the watch one thing we
do know is that it will be designed in
Switzerland and will have the usual tag
heuer Flair although we don't even know
whether it'll be around or a square
android wear watch we do know though
that as it has processors from outside
switzerland it won't be called
swiss-made difference between the apple
that idea what she is very important one
is called Apple the other one tag or
Android wear has yet to make a huge
impact in the watch market although
perhaps with a luxury brand like tag
heuer on board its chances may be better
