ever defeat a lava monster no have you
okay talk to the back if you've seen
takeout Takaya has an emotional range of
anger somewhere I'm scale of one to ten
pick out fall somewhere between like an
8.5 and a 12 like oh so so we have these
things out off at our finger tips to
kind of help support how angry take is
at any given time we've got fire coming
from our head we've got lava drips we've
got splashes we've got lightning you're
very often volcanoes or their own little
microclimates so all these little cues
also let us know how complicated or
angry take highs it also kind of roots
the character to what people have
experienced when they've seen volcanoes
hopefully not too up close so just wanna
touch would take this same shot apart
break it down you can see all the
different levels that we have in the
shot all the lava the drips the
lightning the water foundation effects
were very also very helpful and making
shots that were very complicated a
little more doable so you can see these
water splashes where the lava hits the
ocean and there's steam coming up these
were foundation effects these were
effects that we did early on that an
effects animator could then place as
they saw fit throughout this throughout
this shot on generations this peaceful
Island has been home to our family
beyond our reef a great day in jammies
again with the foundation effects this
is what the way to take a shot would
look like very often coming into our
department what looks like an electic
slated like 8-bit animation here is
unrendered foundation effects of plumes
of smoke and the layout artists could
actually place these the character
animator she could place them and put
them around to kind of compose around
takeoff and this would very often with
we would start off with here's the same
shot with effects specific for this shot
all the lava coming off got hey Kazi
hair coming on flaming hair coming on
for the first time and this is what the
rendered foundation effects along with
it
affects specific where the shot all kind
of look like now I also heard that you
guys use tools and learned about even
some of the engines from frozen where
kind of a doubt adapted and applied to
this can you talk about that a little so
like Dale and I worked on frozen
together really the heads of effects on
that show and so I'm just like we
actually did splash for this film we
created a tool called Matterhorn to to
snow and we did a lot of the sand form
wanna with that same tool and we didn't
use it so much on the lava but we really
developed it quite a bit that to do
various thicknesses of lava
Takada as in the final character in the
film does not have it there's not super
crunchy lava or anything like that
so we didn't need it as much but it's
really great sometimes in them look with
splashes for this film
Matterhorn for frozen they get used I
think Matterhorn was used to do ice
cream in Utopia too so we create these
tools and they're shareable across other
shows Nick they all kind of live on got
your back
it's merry time this shot was kind of
special to my heart because this was
actually the first shot we actually did
of take ha all the way through character
animation when we all saw this we all
read the collective sigh of relief that
you know after more than a year of
actually exploration and development
that we were actually going to be able
to get this character on screen
we're going to the realm of monsters
don't worry it's a lot farther down than
it looks
I am still Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
