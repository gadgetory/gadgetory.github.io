to play doom and halo I can't play those
games anymore for disabled people the
hardest part of a video game is figuring
out how to play with 33 million disabled
gamers in the u.s. players have to find
innovative workarounds like playing with
your face or creating new controllers so
I have a quad stick
it's a sip-and-puff controller used by
gamers who either quadriplegic or have
different physical disabilities and you
completely use your mouth to game so say
if you're driving a car and you want the
car to go faster you then blow air in
here to make the car go faster if you're
playing Skyrim and you want to move the
character through the woods you would
steer using the joystick capability here
at AbleGamers the charity organization
helps people by providing controllers
that best fit their needs this is a
little strange like the placement a
little tight but I mean obviously
everything I could get used to Kristi
Moyer wants to play video games again
with her husband I have a servo palsy
and my right arm in my right leg and I
can't really game anymore with my
husband six seven years ago I was able
to play two player games with my husband
and could successfully move the
controller like everybody else up and
down shooting and then it just started
to deteriorate
who became a tradition for both of us we
play we enjoy ourselves sometimes we
dedicate a whole Saturday to just gaming
we share these things and we have you
know traditions and even when we play
Civilization six you know the first
thing I'll type at the very beginning as
I love you even if we're sitting right
next to each other and AbleGamers
provides a custom solution with a USB
panel originally made for graphic
designers and a foot board to control
movement so with this I can like make
this my you know visual and I can move
back and forth and then I could use the
keyboard for the movement or something
or the run of the jump and I think
that's gonna open doors for me that's
one really really cool AbleGamers
founder mark barley is always looking
for solutions for disabled gamers which
sometimes can be as simple as just
putting the controller down AbleGamers
is always about exploiting movement if
you can move it how do we exploit it we
see the potential in everything it
doesn't have to be a disability product
for us to figure out how to use it
instead saying no I don't feel like it
tonight I don't want to play sip six I
want to place their sex tonight because
I have this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
