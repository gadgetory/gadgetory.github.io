screens have had a size cap of about 10
inches now with the release of the
toshiba excite 13 toshiba has blown away
any size cap expectations and then some
hi i'm eric franklin and today i'll take
a first look at the toshiba excite 13
the world's first as far as i know 13
inch tablet if you're familiar at all
with the excite 10 but you know almost
exactly what you're getting except on a
larger scale you still get the 128
gigabyte SD card expansion slot micro
USB micro HDMI a headphone jack and a
rotation lock switch the tablet has a
textured metal backside and maybe by
nature of its size doesn't feel quite as
bendy as the excite 10 but I still
notice some build quality issues it's
how it weighs about 2.2 pounds and
there's a full 13.5 inches wide this
makes typing while holding the tablet
pretty much impossible unless you
possess some kind of fantastic finger
stretching ability also 13 inches means
more inches to clean I mean look how
smudgy this thing gets there is a 2
megapixel camera on the front and a LED
flash supported 5 megapixel camera on
the back both of which produce typically
mediocre tablet quality video and images
the screen resolution has been upgraded
from the excite 10 from 1280 by 800 to
1600 x 900 and it feels responsive when
swiping and navigating menus the tablet
houses a Tegra 3 cpu and with our go to
game Riptide GP it ran pretty smoothly
on it with the expected Tegra 3
splashing effects 1080p movies from
outside sources ran smoothly and look
sharp and I have to admit watching
movies on a larger high-resolution
screen will always be the preferred
method prices start at six hundred fifty
dollars for the 32 gigabyte version and
seven hundred fifty dollars for the 64
gigabyte version while movies look great
on larger screen at these prices you'd
be better off buying an actual HDTV if
movies are that important to you bottom
line yes this is a larger tablet
but it really doesn't offer anything new
to the tablet experience and at 650 to
750 bucks at that price you really have
the question whether it's worth it for
something that feels kinda like a
gimmick once again i'm eric franklin
this has been the first look at the
toshiba excite 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
