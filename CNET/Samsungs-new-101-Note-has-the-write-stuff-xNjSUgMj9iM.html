10.1 tablet to fit the times and here it
is I'm Jessica doll court with cnet here
is your first look this 2014 Wi-Fi
edition of the note slides into usual
stylist so that you can freeform draw
write and multitask but it also includes
a higher resolution screen an eight-core
processor a TV remote and android 4.3
design-wise you're looking at a lighter
thinner tablet than before though at 1.2
pounds it's still heavier than some the
design is a lot smaller than last year's
model in fact if you sheared off the
sides then this year's note is pretty
much what you'd get its proportions
resemble the samsung galaxy s4 flagship
phone but then it adds this kind of
cheap feeling faux leather cover that
you're going to start seeing on other
note devices going forward the tablets
10.1 inch super clear LCD screen it's a
2560 by 1600 resolution colors are
bright and text and images are both
clear and sharp if you must use your
tablet as a camera then both the 2
megapixel and 8 megapixel shooters take
quality shots it uses Samsung's fairly
extensive modes you can get filters and
there's a way to insert yourself into a
picture gameplay was good on the
processor and there were strong graphics
note that some versions of the tablet
will have a quad core chipset instead of
this eight core processor especially if
you get a carrier version with LTE now
what about this S Pen I'm glad you asked
you can bring up this air command
palette on any screen to quickly access
tools one new trick will turn memos and
phone calls emails and map settings
another one will let you temporarily
open apps on top of the screen you're on
there's also a universal search tool
that's called s finder and there are the
usual multitasking windows as well
Samsung's beautifully redesigned s note
app makes taking notes much simpler and
more enjoyable than before with brand
new templates and a cleaner more legible
interface without a doubt the new note
10.1 has a load of high-end features but
it also has a premium price the Wi-Fi
version costs five hundred fifty dollars
for 16 gigabytes and
six hundred dollars for the 32 gigabyte
Wi-Fi model once again i'm jessica doll
court for cnet and you can read all the
pros and cons of the new Samsung Galaxy
