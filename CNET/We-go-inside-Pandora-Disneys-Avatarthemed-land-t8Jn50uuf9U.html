whole new world one that's 4.4
light-years away this is Pandora the
world of Avatar it's an expansion to the
animal kingdom theme park at Walt Disney
World in Florida now it doesn't open
until May 27th but Disney Imagineers
took us on an early sneak peak tour of
this land where visitors are immersed in
the alien world of James Cameron's 2009
blockbuster movie avatar
wait a second this movie is almost 8
years old what if you don't remember the
film where nature-loving knobby beans
battle money-grubbing humans bent on
destroying their land for the mineral
unobtainium well Disney working in
collaboration with Cameron and his
production company made sure you didn't
need to know the plot to enjoy this
alien jungle and make it feel believable
so there's a whole integration here
between technical solutions and artistic
solutions even James Cameron himself is
crafting that world of Pandora to remind
you of things you know animals you know
plants you know we're doing the same
thing here it's really a remarkable
dreamlike alien place but it seems very
familiar
Cameron is working on for more Avatar
movie sequels but your journey takes
place long after the plot of the movies
now human tourists visit to learn Noby
language culture and of course taste
local food and drink
in the relaxing navi river journey boat
ride you drift through the beautiful
nighttime jungle past glowing animals
and plants and then you meet the
magnificent Navi shaman of songs and an
olive disney I have never seen an
animatronic figure move so lifelike and
then there's the thrill ride avatar
flight of passage this is where you're
going to be matched to an avatar those
are the hybrid human aliens engineered
to be controlled by the human mind put
on the 3d glasses sit in your seat and
hold on tight since it's 3d we can't
quite capture how you write a banshee
that's swooping and whipping around the
sky but this ride hits all the senses
blasting you with air water and smells
at sundown the plants rocks and water
begin to glow bringing you energy into
the night play around to see what reacts
to your touch this world needed to be
interactive we hear it with the sounds
right now where there's a
call-and-response all of the lighting
fixtures go back to a huge programming
board that allow us to create the
bioluminescence literally thousands that
you see throughout the land are
connected through one central system the
mythical land drives home the same
message of conservation that's woven
throughout Animal Kingdom park with the
hope the visitors will take a lesson
from our Navi neighbors in Alpha
Centauri and cherish our precious planet
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
