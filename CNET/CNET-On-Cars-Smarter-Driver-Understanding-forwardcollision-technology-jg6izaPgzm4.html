from the loins of adaptive cruise
technology which uses a device like this
either radar or laser sensor looking out
in the traffic ahead of you to maintain
a set distance to that traffic not just
a set speed and it does that by
operating the accelerator and the brake
okay I'm on the freeway in this Infiniti
qx80 I'm set 259 on adaptive cruise but
traffic ahead of me is starting to slow
down and sure enough accelerator comes
off the brakes go on a bit maintains my
gap and now traffic opens up we're
heading back up to target speed 259 and
target gap it really works and it's kind
of eerie forward collision just takes
that same experience we had on the road
and Divis it up into two flavors first
there's a warning only version that's a
car that's going to detect you're
closing on something too fast and give
you beeps or flashing lights or
typically both then there's the kind
that intercedes the prevention flavor of
technology that will do all the above
and we'll jump on the brakes all the way
to a full stop now for those of you who
are averse to having any machine drive
for you know that in production today
I've never seen a car that doesn't let
you defeat the forward collision
technology but it wouldn't surprise me
if in the near future it becomes a
mandated on kind of like anti-lock
brakes it turns out forward collision
technology and all of its flavors
actually works some better than others a
recent study by the highway loss data
Institute found about a 14 percent
reduction accident claims among cars
that have the kind of forward collision
tech that gets on the brakes for you
quite a bit less improvement in those
that only warn and now for the first
time the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety is giving ratings to cars based
on their forward collision tech not just
on the other more passive safety
technologies we're familiar with the
good news is a lot of cars are offering
this technology now and getting really
good scores the bad news is an awful lot
of cars are getting fair to mediocre
scores so forward collision tech is not
the
same card a car now what's in the future
the next big evolution of this forward
collision technology can be exemplified
and let's say Cadillacs coming
supercruise where the car will read
what's ahead hit the brakes
use the accelerator steer come to a
complete stop if need be and resume
acceleration do all of that in city
speed traffic that's getting awfully
close to a self-driving car so if you're
looking at a car that has forward
collision tech they're these three
shopping tips in mind first of all know
that the kind of forward collision tech
that can hit the brakes for you is more
effective than that that just gives you
a warning beep secondly look at the
ratings on cars that have this tech they
don't all operate the same and the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
has just begun to grade them finally
look at a package that may also roll in
blind spot and lane departure tech along
with forward collision it might be a
better value and it certainly should
provide you a little more security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
