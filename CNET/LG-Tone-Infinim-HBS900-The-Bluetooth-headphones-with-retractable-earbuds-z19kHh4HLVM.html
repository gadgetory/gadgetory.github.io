this is the LG tone infinim HP s900 a
stereo Bluetooth headset that costs a
little over a hundred dollars as the
current highest end model and LG's
popular tone line like those other tone
models
this hasn't around the neck design and I
found it to be a little stir your built
than some of the step-down models and it
looks and feels a little swanky overall
though it is an all plastic headphone
the key new feature with this model is
that the earbuds instead of adhering
magnetically to the front of the neck
band when not in use retract back into
it on each side of the neck band you'll
find a button that when pressed reels
the thin cable back in it's a pretty
nifty feature but those cables are very
thin and I just don't know how well
they'll hold up over time there are
additional buttons for pause and playing
your music volume control answering and
ending calls and skipping tracks forward
and back it is a lot of buttons so it
does take a little time to get familiar
with where everything is as for extra
features you get apt X which is supposed
to make Bluetooth trimming sound better
for devices that support it but this
headphone doesn't feature noise
cancelling as for performance this is
another LG tone that features sound by
Harman Kardon it sounds good for a
bluetooth headphone with decent clarity
and also a decent amount of bass but the
key caveat that you have to get a tight
seal or you lose a lot of bass and the
headphone will sound thin in fact the
sound is night and day if you don't get
that tight seal battery life is good
however with up to 14 hours of music
playback and caller said I sound a
decent when I use the headphone as a
headset in all I like this tone infinim
better than some previous tone models
and have no problem recommending it
though you should also take a look at
Sol Republic Shadow Wireless which
arguably sounds slightly better and
retails for $100 I'm David Carr noise
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
