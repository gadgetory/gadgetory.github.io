404 show coming to you live from cnet TV
New York I'm Jeff Bakalar and I'm Justin
you and this is the show where we need a
social network for our social network I
think so it's about time that we got all
of our ducks in a row you know what I
mean like these office buzzwords we're
just using now it's all about the buzz
for ya with more where those buzzwords
viral you need a viral outreach
situational context thing but ok so this
we should explain that Joe title we're
talking about Facebook's new demoting
tool hmm it lets you pretty much
downgrade your friends to acquaintances
and they introduced us last year I'm
like thinking like November of 2011 they
introduced an acquaintance's button you
can add friends to these lists of
acquaintances and that means they won't
show up in your newsfeed is often but I
wanted to talk about this overarching
discussion that like lets you know
facebook has become this it's been such
it's become such a giant social network
that now we need social networks within
these social networks to control the
amount of friends that we have you know
i mean like i feel like people would
rather use instagram or like twitter or
something like that where they don't
necessarily have to friend everybody but
the original point of facebook was that
you're only supposed to be adding
friends right like why are we wired of
why are we adding facebook friends
profiles that we don't even like it
would it's true I mean like why even do
that why are we friends with people who
don't even know it's like social graces
I feel like they you know I guess the
way Facebook started they were really
trying to patrol the whole are you a
college student thing yeah there's a
whiz you know of a morsel of background
checking right now it's just like hey
got a pulse yeah you got a facebook
proof like it's it's become a thing
where you don't even add friends anymore
you just literally add everybody you've
ever met or known i do that higher life
I don't do that most people are though
and that's why they come out with things
like this because people need more tools
for control I think I have something
like seven hundred friends which is
inaccurate
crazy inaccurate yeah i only have like
200 right but um you know I just think
that they really should have considered
doing some sort of legitimate friendship
connection background check yeah I don't
know that I feel like there's more value
there I don't but I don't know but it's
up to the user also to be sure their own
profiles true I feel like it's just
because people are so worried about
insulting their friends by not adding
them you know whatever that they'll just
do it I have a something to admit about
Facebook that I'm kind of ashamed of it
this is embarrassing yeah uh is this
kind of sucks i was looking at someone's
timeline profile the other like last
night yeah is there no longer i'm gonna
sound like a total idiot is there no
longer a wall what like I I just can you
no longer post on somebody's wall if
they have timeline no you can yeah of
course y'all me because I have no I was
literally searching for I don't know 40
seconds okay okay there we go okay
switch to this person yeah you could
switch this person all right so Oh see
now my buddy Mike so Mike's got a little
smile bill on the profile was on
yesterday that little box on the left
was in there I would have soon it uh
yeah I would think so it was a nominally
displayed maybe it's because your friend
in their private and their privacy
preferences doesn't seem letting people
post on their wall did you check to see
what other people had done he cheats at
words with friends so I wanted to call
him out on his page okay and be like hey
bro I heard you cheat with in words with
Eddie and she do you have a knowledge
sharing with you his back his freakin
bored look is filled up like it doesn't
make sense so he's making up words that
don't exist finding out the way it
worked right he's cheating okay everyone
knows everyone who plays and knows he's
cheating no one's confronted him and I
just want to go on his stupid wall and
be like hey do is called we all know
you're cheating at words with friends
and then maybe include like a screenshot
where he used the word like I don't even
know how would you need to cheat on why
would you need like I'm words with
friends you colossal a hole yeah
that's messed up like jacking your
friends yeah I don't get it man you play
scramble with friends at all or what now
I don't you were telling me that you've
been getting rid getting bad it's
getting better the game where you have
to like you know critical J yeah attic
boggle remade words yeah it's good man i
want i want people to play me if your
friends in the office book do it yeah i
got i think someone yesterday hit me up
and i was playing that Mandy and I was
playing I think that's a fourth I was
like a random person yeah um but it's
exciting yeah it's really exciting
please I would love to play with you
just cuz I think I could beat you whoa
are using you have a larger vocab
nothing you do vocabulary trial and
error okay simply trial and eric is that
I mean it's sort of like words of
friends were the friends is largely Tron
there if anything its mortgage have more
time right you know this is a time limit
or thing yeah but yet this guy he blocks
is I think he blocks people from posting
on his Facebook wall cuz he know he had
words the friends you stupid cheater i
want to say his name so bad everyone so
about it right now no one's gonna know
no one's gonna toast it Andrew we all
know Andrew are you hating the words the
French Intervention we all know the
funniest thing is my buddy red comes out
to me the other night like dude I'm
gonna call you out on something and you
can't lie if it's true you have to say
he's like are you cheatng it words and
I'm like no dude what are you talking
about it you and then he goes isn't your
name blah blah blah like a username and
I'm like no dude that's Andrew and then
turns out this is nick is cheating oh
are you cheating on words with friend
Andrew would do something like geez if
you have a friend who does something
like that please let us know I can't
stand people who cheat yeah what monks
friends like Chantay get a video gamers
and a good get a life yeah that's all
troll his wall seriously I would love
nothing more but you can't he's made it
impossible to do that I know I know it's
the problem I I have these are the days
of our lives uh we got so we have a
story we talked about and loaded
yesterday that you and I can personally
relate with talking about nokia getting
a patent for a tattoo that now get this
vibrates right when there's some sort of
cell
other activity on your phone with you
get a call an email a text something
like that they're trying to patent
technology that allows at at now I don't
even understand how this works i
remember it was something called like
ferromagnetic technology right that is
somehow injected into the your epidermis
and you can get it colored you can get
it clear whatever they want I would
probably get like a little telephone
right to or something like that that be
cute and it's gonna make your skin
vibrate because i'm sure that feels
comfortable yeah sure that's that's what
she's crawling under your skin is
something you want to feel exactly
exactly my tattoo to feel a lot and
think about how many times your phone
vibrates notify you of everything that
goes on yeah you're gonna give me a
whole skin will be vibrating every five
minutes it's very strange this is
definitely one of those patents that
they just filed for the hell of it and
maybe in the year 2079 they'll finally
come out with tattoos stations sponsored
by Nokia I gotta talk to my Joe our
tattoo buddy are the artist who's
working on my leg I'm gonna see you next
week I'm gonna ask her about this and be
like dude what what's the deal and can
we get this done right away my question
is why why would you need that I mean
what a wise is better than just a phone
vibrating in your shirt that's oh not
attached and do you really want to have
to deal with like oh I don't know
getting a text in the middle of the
night yeah and we have to wake you up
right and then you're going to be like
oh well I can't get tattoo vibrations
from the hours of 12 am 27 a better
question is where would you get the
tattoo to vibrate on your body that
opens up a whole different conversation
now you're talking about you probably be
calling yourself a lot yeah person
surprised gonna test something yeah I
just got test something hey everybody
called my phone its social call this is
among the Dumber things well it's done
because not only is it a ridiculous
concept but also there's no way nokia
would ever open up a tattoo shop for
people to come into you know i mean
there have to get into that business and
what would you get tattooed like what if
nokia subsidized this technology and
kind of gave you a discount but then you
have to get the nokia logo tattooed on
your skin
and that would vibrate would you do that
no dude are you giving me I love how you
just jump to that conclusion though too
you're like well this is what I just
planted this is what they're really idea
walking talking breathing ads yeah at
scare is dumb I would never do this it's
very dumb stop coming up with stupid
ideas now yes that putting things under
my skin what are three online dating
sites that have agreed to uh what what
are these three sites that have agreed
to scream for predators because it's a
big deal we talked about this yesterday
with Katie linendoll a little bit about
Riley dating for a second mm-hmm so this
is this is interesting um up until this
point I guess online dating users I
haven't really had a way to screen you
know like who there'd been talking to
who they're talking to online you know
like you could be talking to anyway it's
basically like an online chat was just a
really fancy for all you know adult
meetup section of craigslist baby so um
three of the big online dating websites
those include match com which already
owns okcupid is they bought them out
last year I eHarmony and sparks networks
which I hadn't heard of before this they
signed an agreement yesterday to
basically pledge to safeguard against
predators online sexual predators so
they're gonna do this in a couple ways
which I think are kind of a good idea
they're gonna background-check every
subscriber against sex registries like
you know like Megan's Law basis right
like you can go online and find out who
is a sexual predator so they're gonna
know if they know about that I thought
they don't let those people register
though here's my question too is that
online dating sites never verify that
you're the person exact you say you are
online they don't they prove like your
name you don't give your name for yeah
well you have a handle of course so the
only thing identifies use the photo you
can upload a photo of anybody people do
that there's a lot of trolls online why
not cut this problem off at the root
what's and how would you do that you
freakin do some sort of like being
verified you know thing at the beginning
yeah see you know have it uh you know
take effect right in the beginning I
mean people pay for the service right yo
you know you're you're denying them
the what they paid for there should be a
service when you sign up you should be
able to provide your real name but then
so has remembered and you see all that
stuff you know and then they'll mask
that with whatever handle you choose
just go verify you want to call yourself
you know asian lover 15 that's fine do
that want to make sure you are in fact
easy and little Romeo excess that was
your that was your hands my current
handle match.com no it's not it's not
you get all the ladies that way I'm on
adultfriendfinder though are you yep are
you really no I'm not an adult friend
finders wonder who does it no one's ever
going to admit they do that what adult
yeah AFF AFF EF I mean that one the
Ashley Madison yeah like who's really on
that I would I feel like if if if there
was sort of an anonymous survey of your
close friends it would shock you how
many people are on right I don't know
what do you think I don't know why no
one's trolled the people on Ashley
Madison and you know like ask them to
meet up and message 300 people to meet
up in the same spot hmm and then just
shoot them all you whoa you know what's
amazing though with that you never up
until now and still to this day you
never hear crazy like divorce breakup
stories stemming from Ashley Madison do
you you hear about it from facebook you
about like someone seeing you know a
thread a back-and-forth conversation
someone's having right a husband or have
with someone else outside of the
marriage you hear about those you hear
about those leading to divorce facebook
being cited as evidence in divorce
litigation uh you don't really hear
about that like what what are they doing
right that uh they're able to cover
their tracks maybe in the future we'll
have a court case where the lawyer will
cite Ashley like existing profile Ashley
Madison but I feel like there's there's
gotta be some sort of you know Americans
for a better nuclear family sort of
thing yeah you know that have been you
know up in arms against the fred phelps
yeah like where r why is that not
happening and this and it's not like
actually madison is quiet about it
they're very vocal right there marketing
get a Super Bowl ad yeah they're like oh
they got pulled off right there like you
want to cheat on your spouse and come to
our site we'll make it happen for you I
wonder what the gender breakdown
of the profiles on Ashley Madison do you
think there are a lot of women that
would surprise me enough that's a sexist
remark no I don't think it would really
surprise me if there are a lot of women
just looking to cheat online I I mean of
course are your knee-jerk reaction i
think is to say there's more men and you
can make the art I think people would
make the argument that it's easier for
women just go out and find anybody chief
do you think that Valerie if you're
female anybody or just dang it now i
think i don't know i would i would not
be surprised to see if it's 5050 really
I would almost like hope that the law of
averages ya know had the higher ground
and was like yep it's actually 5050 it
would delight me if it was ninety-five
percent dudes Oh five percent women it
wouldn't be called what would be called
sausage Madison yeah we called Ashley
Madison and what is with that name
Ashley Madison yeah I don't know who
that is that's whoever that there's a
lot of pissed-off Ashley Madison's out I
am sure there are up in arms these
people poor ashley will take a break
when we come back more 404 we've got a
few more stories and we're going to
check out a new commercial done by wes
anderson for sony yeah and that'll be
interesting to see more 404 right after
this stick around we'll be right back
this is the 404 Mr effers the show where
we all sing songs
maybe there's green little robots teeny
tiny little robots their job is to make
the phone work and the leader helps
decide what their job is like I guess
hey you marry you job is to help the
guys and they have little tiny robot
vehicles except they have to be careful
because they're a little small for a
small guy they're pretty smart they can
predict the future past or present
actually they just record the stuff on
themselves and then end up and they just
shoot it out just like a slingshot and
then they go through the air and bring a
song picture the video and they're
pretty good mostly they like doing it
because they never actually saw when
like an humor just like how we don't
know what's inside at that device
hey it's laura from houston and you're
listening to the fluorophore where it's
going to even be elliptical tonight i
think i'm going to use the stationary
bike oh thank goodness Oh kicks your
GTFO seriously haha who was that again
was a risk I larissa right yeah the two
S's everyone you want actually no I'm
gonna get on um dude that's awesome
thanks for the call definitely enjoy
that workout session yeah seriously work
up a sweat please wet it out ah during
our break we watched wes anderson's new
Xperia Sony commercial yeah whoo so it's
basically in the vein of like the
fantastic mr fox sort of thing you know
with the with the stop animation right
um it's like it's just funny because I I
only watched it because wes anderson had
something to do with it I feel like no
one's really clamoring to watch a sony
commercial no nor does it make you want
to buy the new experience and that's the
thing that i want to talk about it's
cool it wasn't at first that the story
doesn't didn't really do anything for me
yeah so the story was a kid who is far
too old to be speculating about yeah
what it goes on that's cool yeah this
kids maybe go back to school Jimmy yeah
who was this kid irritate yeah it is
like a they should have maybe cast like
a four-year-old sounded like the
mutterings of six years six at the ol at
the you know that even then I'll slap a
six-year-old if he said I'd be like
really you really think this robot
really you're in like third grade or
whatever well you are that age really
this is what you think's going on yeah
uh there's a good parody video to be
made here to of who actually makes these
phones yeah there's like a good like
Foxconn ish for sure like factory made
video yeah sure I'd like it not little
obat yeah those little robot ten little
niggers attached to a little Chinese
beating heart Oh God anyway regardless
of this the incomprehensible story um
it's a cute commercial I'll give him
that and I love Wes Anderson and all of
his little you know films and whatnot
but i don't i don't know i think like
this is a prime example of you know a
sort of celebrity endorsement that to me
doesn't really do anything right in in
in the vein of sort of you know
promoting a product successfully I just
there's a disconnect it's yeah it
doesn't even feel like it is a sony
commercial on even personally I think
this question what phone were they
advertised some experience no idea no I
didn't give any details about them know
they merely even showed the phone it's
just such a misuse of celebrities yeah
you know what I mean yeah it's a misuse
well I hate to say it about saw you know
but we're just calling how we see it we
just don't think it's effective it's a
good cook it's a fun little cute you
know aesthetically you know aside from
the the endorsement it's a it's a cute
little project but it did say that this
is the first in a series of videos and
get on with celebrity directors so maybe
future videos will be a little smarter
this is an introduction type thing right
that's I'm speculating sure enough they
might all be crappy yeah I don't know
but that's that's interesting to see how
they do that sort of stuff yeah all
right let's move along I would rather
see a video like that if I had to watch
a commercial on TV I'd rather see
something like that than just uh like
regurgitation of specs yeah for sure yes
I agree with it ahead and that he could
have I mean baby all they did was take a
Wes Anderson short and put a sony logo
yeah they didn't first take the sony
logo and turn that into a Wes Anderson
right right which they should have done
uh we're going to move along from Sony
to AT&amp;amp;T ATT reinventing the steering
wheel coming up with a vibrating
steering wheel that tells you when to
turn yeah claiming it is less
distracting than visual and auditory
cues people love vibrators pause who
doesn't long pause people it's a polite
causes vibrating devices yeah vibrations
let me that's interesting what's going
on it's interesting AT&amp;amp;T Labs yes it's
contributing with a vibrating steering
wheel that promises deliver turn-by-turn
navigation information to drivers now
this is the big sort of key point here
more safely
what we're used to with you know the
auditory and visual cues right makes
sense well okay so the visual cues makes
sense because obviously you want to keep
your eyes on the road core as long as
possible the auditory cues I don't know
that they're saying basically that
listening to voices weathers from like a
dashboard gps or distracting voices the
radio or the radio whatever you're
listening to it they call it a cognitive
burden that sort of distracts you from
whatever you're supposed to be
concentrating on which is driving but do
you think that's true people have been
added ooh sounds make a really big
difference I mean how we more than
listen to things in how many years have
radios been in class 70 right I mean
we'll talk about the Steve bored
listening to music has now become a
passive experience to where you can
multitask while listening right I think
it's it's not even in in the same realm
as talking on the phone I think arm you
know what it might not it might be the
fact that when you're only listening to
somebody give you turn-by-turn
directions it's hard to memorize that
and so you're constantly playing that
back in your head whereas the radio
you're not like wait what did the guy to
say yeah you're right it's more of like
an interactive sort of thing yeah cause
getting in structure hearing is like
dictating and that's directly leading to
you doing things right and then there's
a lot of like oh wait let me just look
at the map a little bit yeah that's
becoming distracting for sure I'm
surprised you know that is sort of
surprising when you really think about
it yeah the the the effort that goes
into getting people to stop effing
around in the car and just keep their
eyes and reload right you would imagine
that GPS screens and all that sort of
stuff for whatever reason they've just
slithered their way into the you know
what's acceptable right and you know
that's that's really it but yeah I don't
know I just I didn't but I still think
of a haptic feedback a sort of vibration
isn't enough to tell you what to do yes
okay the idea behind the steering wheel
is that it has 20 actuators arm situated
across the circle ok so 360 degrees all
around like has vibrators and then when
you have your hands on the wheel it'll
vibrate each dot consecutively in the
direction you're supposed to be going so
like for example if you
turn left it'll go from like the twelve
o'clock position to the nine o'clock
gotcha so I know but like and when when
there was the next left I didn't tell
you exactly when to do it and it
sensibly should warn you a little before
so you have time to make that move I
mean maybe that coupled with an
audio-only right sort of notification
and eliminating the map maybe but I
don't know there's something good about
having the map and being like Oh Tom you
know Gordon Street yes exactly me you
imagine like a 75 year old man trying to
use this try to interpret these
vibrations while you actually see is
like a Lincoln Town Car wrapped around a
tree that's all I see that's all I see
right think about that exactly they can
go hold the steering wheel it's just
like it's still vibrating and then
comparing like a legend like oh wait to
vibrations on the pinky finger my left
hand means you turn just tough I you
know I don't know I think I think the
best way to do it yeah and it's more
science fiction but maybe not maybe not
perhaps not is a sort of uh overlay like
a hood sort of thing right we shield you
know I think at the same like you can
distinguish person between Holograms or
you know like that I still think we
should be doing right they did stuff
like that used to have like Pontiacs I
remember had like the the your your
speedometer in the in the windshield and
stuff like that and I think people are
experimenting with that too there's no
reason why in the vein of the HUD system
there's no reason why you can't have
aught mented reality put into a monitor
on your on your way yeah I mean I see it
it directly goes against what we were
saying about distracting people but I
feel like rather than someone look away
from the windshield yeah just bless all
are all in the windshield yeah but no
you can really make the you know the
opacity where you know make make that
really really adjustable and transparent
and will be okay which will try it out
just try it how many people have to die
before I don't know we finally reinvent
this technology uh here's some news for
people who love their bittorrent a Miami
judge mr. mark shoemaker has issued a
landmark
order in which he protects accused
bittorrent downloads from mass lawsuits
filed by copyright holders this was a
tldr for me I'm not gonna lie this is a
very long article long story short this
long story short he claims that
bittorrent downloads are protected under
anonymous speech ok so now whether or
not that translates on a federal level
probably not this is just what one judge
Miami has ruled arm it's tough to say
that oh you know every judge in every
court should uphold what this guy has as
you know thrown down right but it is
sort of a little um you know loophole
that some people might try and take
advantage of for instance if i live in
florida and i get brought up on some
sort of torrenting charger you know
legal downloads maybe I look to have
this court case moved over to Miami
court yeah yeah looks you know and maybe
you put all your servers if you're
hosting something on BitTorrent in
Florida it's it opens up a little bit of
a loophole you know how I know you
didn't read this article fully what's
that did you read the end I didn't read
the well there's an update is an update
and here's the update let me read the W
it says shortly after this article was
published right we learned that the
order in question has been vacated which
means it was basically thrown out white
spot but but but there's a hold on if
you if you read a little uh yeah turns
out it was apparently designed by
mistake uh but completely by mistake
yeah it says it turns out the order was
drafted by a defense attorney and the
judge that made the rich initial calling
apparently signed it by mistake thinking
that all the parties had agreed on it
which they hadn't yet it was still in
deliberation so they basically just
threw it out you cannot use this as a
defense in court I will still be doing
that okay it turns out it turns out that
this is all wrong is a big tease is what
it is what I understand is like how does
this get to the point where people are
like all okay now we can jump on this
right you know nothing people were so
excited about the prospect of having
this be landlord you know what's messed
up this article was updated mithun the
time that I put it into the rundown oh
really now
shall we go yeah that's not fair things
change really quickly this world how is
that fair it's probably going on as we
speak I live literally when I popped it
in this morning it did not have this up
they had no update okay all right no I
don't you reckon a jackass that's fine I
mean it's not fair it got closed that's
a step in the right direction we we
touched it yeah you touched it right on
the head all right so it looks like why
is this even an article I want to talk
about this speaking of words of friends
and all that good stuff here's an
awesome limited edition Scrabble
typography version that includes the

front they using wired I like the font
and now New York Times and I like non
the home is ok to our verdana is this to
houma right he had a stoma oh no this is
Times New Roman yeah I mean we can go we
could literally go on about that
exciting podcast let's just list off
thoughts but let's never do that we are
nerds Richard thinking that Richards
ringing the nerd alarm uh some emails
rich in Cleveland this one is about the
Mass Effect saga which we will continue
I'm kind of holding off on most of this
stuff so we can finish up the week
tomorrow when Russ fresh dick Grace's us
right Russ fresh dick man he's like oh
i'm at vox now i'm a big shot look at me
you know same guys on the verge looking
he you know with his frickin glasses and
whatnot anyway uh he's gonna kick my ass
tomorrow with his bony little body
Richmond Cleveland our good buddy rich
says doesn't capitulating the fan
demands on huh what would you say
capitulating capitulated oh yeah yeah
tufan demands I mass effect 3 and
they're ending further denigrate the
idea that video games can be art I would
agree that mass effect with its
compelling plot and characters comes
closer than most you just delete my
thing come closer to most but changing
the ending to fan reaction totally
invalidates and maybe I'll feel
different once i finish the game but
it's still the weak sauce Richard I
agree dude uh this is crazy and we
talked about unloaded this morning it's
like someone calling up Robert Zemeckis
and being like hey back to the future
three sucked right can you change it no
I'm not changing it I mean I know it's
easier to change a video game cuz
there's you know there's not uh oh you
know maybe it's not because there's a
lot of reshooting that's gonna have to
be done more motion capturing they're
gonna get the actors back into record
stuff and no I mean makes a really good
point that people say that video games
are art but when you you would never go
up to someone like Georgia O'Keeffe and
be like I don't see the flower in his
painting can you redo it hey Ally oh
yeah don't get it small elisa thing yeah
or hey every modern art artist I don't
get it not working for me change it
she's smiling or what yeah she holding
in a fart what's the deal ridiculous
stop that you do that I don't like it
and it sends the wrong impression where
sends the wrong I'm ordering a burger at
a restaurant and then sending it back
put onions exactly this is a work of art
works of are not meant honestly it's it
almost falls into the same categories
like the whole remix debate yeah you
know sampling and stuff and it makes
video gamers sound spoiled yes I think
there's a very small sample size of the
overall video game they did raise like
Katie told a seventy five thousand
dollars for charity rake it's a lot of
money yeah so what does that mean well
they're just have a lot of money I guess
yeah moving along thanks for the email
rich moving along we got a new new
character been emailing us
uh lately his name's dr. Mike yeah he
comes from the great state of North
Dakota and uh he sent us a picture which
is funny dr. mike is a 55 year old
doctor that plays our show in his
waiting room wow isn't that a dangerous
or that something we hear before you go
to the doctors I don't know he says he
loves us and so do his patients by and
large ok so there's Jerry might still be
out on that can he dr. Mike if you're
listening to this can you take a photo
of the lobby or the waiting room where
yelling our show need that I really
really want to see that he wants us to
do a few things dr. Mike sounds like a
cool whatever it is like I want to hang
out with dr. Maha ok dr. Mike first says
please mention between the folds which
is a documentary on origami cool okay
check it a queen the folds it's got five
stars and amazon prime go check it out
uh he's he's not in it it doesn't star
him he just wants us to say it say
between the folds he says origamis the
pre everything a true force of nature I
never knew until now its scope rocket of
this line is the best at the end he says
you're bad if you don't investigate this
video it's amazing goes aged will bring
money and start them to you bet my ranch
on it bitches dr. Mike you are see you
and out like mad don't get that is not
that he's just sounds like a really
interesting dude and if it's good enough
for dr. Mike I will watch between the
folds here it is on Amazon this is a PBS
movie so you know it's good yeah I I
mean I'm just gonna take this guy's work
for a word for it he is a doctor even if
you don't want to take his word for it
it's got five stars out of 33 customer
reviews on Amazon I trust that I do I
truck man I trust that was doll amazon
i'd miss bolivia movies are doubt it's
gospel its total gospel right there um
we've been talking a lot about the FAA
and their decision to revisit the list
of approved electronics on flights uh
Joe from Phoenix says from talking with
friends over the years who are flight
attendants the real reason for not being
able to use cell phones or electronic
device
is during takeoff and landing is because
those are the most dangerous times of
the flight makes sense wait laughing I'm
just I'm sorry I'm still thinking about
the patients and dr. myself listen to
have to listen to our show why that's
cool man the waiting room is always a
very awkward experience is really
questioning what the other people in the
lobby you're thinking about it with
diseases they have that you don't want
to catch all right like very reluctant
touch the magazines exactly so instead
of having to deal with that awkwardness
why not throw on our fine program right
I wonder if they're listening to this
podcast in the waiting room right now we
watch oh don't pick up that people nice
dad don't touch that don't touch that
toy you know buddy sickkids if that's
pretty good i like it um where was I you
freaking interrupt me uh okay so he says
landing and takeoff is the most
dangerous he says and our electronic
devices could become airborne
quote-unquote missiles right during that
those two landing landing and taking off
possibly striking people potentially
causing injury I don't know about that
what if the plane were to get out of
control obviously if the plane crashes
no one cares right they're just being
cautious um yeah I don't know we uh I I
think it's got to do with the fact that
yes it makes sense it is it is the most
vulnerable time and maybe you want to
cut down every sort of variable right
which makes sense oh here's some more
insight this is pretty cool um this is
our buddy he calls himself geek in the
cockpit he's actually a pilot himself on
the subject of electronics on planes I
am a commercial pilot for a major
airline cool man don't listen to us
while you're flying here's how phones
interfere that I have experienced put a
gsm phone next to a speaker near that
ticking right imagine it in your
headphones communication cables run the
length of the plane you might be in row
45 but still over communication cable I
hear it all the time often you're
clicking in my headset it gets worse the
closer I am to the ground very annoying
and it can actually block communication
the average person doesn't know gsm from
HTTP thus all electronics have to be off
great show longtime listener first-time
complain
yeah that's really uh insightful but we
were also making the point that when you
put it in airplane mode that turns off
the right cell for radio but then why
should you still not be able to use
those electronics as a music device when
the flight exactly I think again it just
falls into the better state like a bar
do you know what I mean that's that's
what I'm thinking and can you not listen
to music on your phone for like five
minutes while the flight taking off is
that too much to ask you know like just
playing devil's advocate on the on the
on behalf of the FAA you know like
people can just not use their phones for
ten minutes it don't think that's crazy
to ask oh no no Joshua be right sin he
also has a link for us in the email cell
next to that if you want to click on
that Justin please the 44 guys should be
able to solve this ongoing battle in my
house is it okay to golf the early bird
special before work and then use one of
these two just freshen up and what he's
talking about did something called quick
shower can we pull that up please golf
the early bird specials going to golf
before work or whatever and then use one
of these things it's called a quick
shower too what is golf said wife says
no you can't use these Justin would you
use a quick shower wipe before work up
when going to work after you've biked to
work so check it out these are these are
Krishna they're basically like wet towel
sized wet net right ah huge huge
absolutely like I said they're towel
sized wet-nap I've never heard of this
this is disgusting sort of it if you
imagine if you had a cut on your body
and use a rub this on it it would stay
like a mother it would sting this is
really weird yeah is it not yeah imagine
what I don't know like wiping your
entire naked body with one of these you
might as well just jump in the shops at
second exactly if I mean if you can if
you can get to every nook and cranny of
your body with this thing right well
guess what dude she's probably be in the
shower anyway because you've really you
know violated yourself it's not that
it's it's 10 inches by 12 inch that's
pretty big there's like you know that's
that's like a paper yeah yeah
okay and not it also this is like it's
is but it's small up to where it's not
enough space to actually wipe down your
whole body you could you could get
enough you know you know I'm it but the
real estate would work out that being
said if I was already married I wouldn't
care about what my wife thought about it
because you know in sickness and in
health yeah I don't mean divorcing you
for this dirtiness I guess unless you
work with it I guess I guess uh we had a
bunch of emails about getting 404 to
play on your playstation 3 Chris from
West Palm Beach where I used to frequent
all the time when I was a young guy
visiting my grandparents says first time
I apologize for emailing from an AOL
account I like that to help to follow
the fellow listener with his inquiry
about watching the 404 on a ps3 he's got
a suggestion I don't know of a way to
watch directly from the internet on the
ps3 but I do have a way to that you can
work around and he uses it and it works
real well first download the podcast on
iTunes the high quality version because
you really got to see us up close and
personal then use ps3 media server to
stream the podcast so this is an app
that you get for your pc I don't know if
it works for Mac but you basically are
using your computer to scream our show
to your playstation 3 playstation 3
smells that on your network and then is
able to use it so it's sort of like
diversity that's what another email are
suggested using to versity to stream the
show from your computer to your
playstation 3 that's probably the best
way to do it so look up those two
suggestions to versity it's TV ers ity
or use chris's suggestion and going on
itunes downloading it and then using the
ps3 media server district i gamble i
mean and i will verify because i can see
his email not going to read it all for
his privacy but he does indeed have an @
aol.com account it's crazy that is
ridiculous would you respond to somebody
if some like i would assume immediately
that it's spam well how long does it
take for an email to get back to
nineteen ninety-six i don't know what
we'll find out that is truly sad that's
it we're gonna router here guys thanks
so much for tuning in 866 404 cnet
that's the number to call or email us
not from your AOL address yeah
the 404 dot cnet com thank you Kevin and
I found this out because our too deep
you big it's pretty awesome oh okay some
