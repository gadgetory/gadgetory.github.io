needs to change about the pixel phone
alright folks this is my google pixel
I've owned and used one of these as my
personal phone since it was released in
October of 2016 and after months of
usage this phone could be better at
number five make it waterproof if you're
going to charge a premium price for a
phone it'd be nice if you could keep up
with its competitors being waterproof is
a nice little feature on the samsung
galaxy s 8 and the iPhone 7 it just
means one less thing to worry about when
you're using your phone and number four
add optical image stabilization the
camera on the pixel is really good and
the electronic image stabilization does
a bang-up job however Google price of
pixel as a premium phone like the Galaxy
S 8 or the iPhone 7 both of those phones
have optical image stabilization why is
this feature important less blurry
photos and number three add better
screens the current pixel features a
five inch screen with full HD resolution
that's 1920 by 1080 the pixel XL has a
5.5 inch screen with a resolution of
2560 by 1440 those are respectable but
could be much better
Google is pushing VR with daydream I can
tell you the pixel plus the daydream
view is not great because of that lower
res screen let's cram in more pixels in
the pixel shall we and number 2 redesign
this thing I'm not going to mince words
in my opinion the pixel features one of
the most uninspired design for a modern
smartphone there was this enormous chin
bezel if it has a fingerprint sensor or
some buttons or something Navy it can be
forgiven however it has no function for
a pixel owner let's get some more screen
on the front and something bold
somewhere on the device before we get to
number one let's talk about some stuff
Google should not change with a pixel
because it's a pretty good phone keep
that headphone jack yeah I hardly use
wired headphones anymore but I want the
option without needing an adapter also
keep up that free unlimited cloud
storage for full resolution versions of
videos and photos that's a great little
feature lastly keep it light this
version of Android is snappy clean and
easy to use don't go changing that back
to the countdown and the number one
thing that needs to change is its
stability one of my chief complaints of
my pixel
it's lack of stability it is frozen on
me far too often the device also
randomly restarts with no real pattern
I talked with Google to troubleshoot and
those issues could be due to third-party
apps ok that's possible
however this is the phone by Google and
all apps on this particular pixel are
from the Google Play Store so maybe
things should run just fine recently
Google issued a patch that could help
here's hoping it's a step in the right
direction again this is based on my
personal experience with the Google
pixel as my everyday phone for many
months if there are other features you'd
like let me know am i as a kernels at
you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
