talking about movies TV shows and games
and tell you what you should be watching
let's kick things off this week with
scary stories to tell them oh god that's
so scary
guillermo del toro tweeted that the film
adaptation of alvin Schwartz's amazing
scary stories book is finally starting
its filming in Toronto details are
sparse but the description says the film
follows a group of teens trying to solve
horrific deaths in their town so this is
where we all go yay or is it so here's
the deal guys Ciaran del Toro was
supposed to direct this movie but
because overbooking is something
guillermo del toro loves to do he's
actually producing it now and his friend
of the director of troll hunters Andre
over Adal is taking over helming the
picture so that's pretty good but gamer
del Toro's track record as a producer
isn't that great so don't be afraid of
the dark it didn't exactly light
anybody's world on fire and the guy who
is Co producing this movie with cara del
Toro was responsible for this pile of
garbage
rest in peace dark universe rest in
peace grids but you know uh
the studio who made Winchester's in
charge of this movie that's not good
either
okay there are some good news though
Phil Toro co-wrote the script alongside
the guys who wrote the lego movie so
that's great and of course we have this
man now this you may not recognize his
face but you definitely know his art yes
this is Steven Gamal the man responsible
for all these terrifying images that
have stuck with us into adulthood and
continue to give us nightmares every day
so in this movie I'm really excited will
we see Harold the Scarecrow will we see
Sam's new dog will we see the bride I
got my money on the bride for sure
that's an easy one but at the end of the
day everyone involved this project is
going to have to be on their a-game top
of the top best of the best work to make
sure it's not a shameless ripoff of
stranger things all right that's the
film news let's move on to TV this is
some really exciting casting news that
is a blast from the past
Brendan Fraser has been tapped to play
robot man in the upcoming DC live-action
series Doom Patrol he'll play
steal the race car driver who has his
brain transplanted into a robot body
after a terrible accident I like it I
like it now he won't actually be in the
robot man suit that honor goes to Riley
Shanahan but Frazer will be doing a
voiceover and appearing as cliff in
flashback sequences now I have to be
honest I wasn't super familiar with the
Doom Patrol I know I'd kind of heard
about them but I didn't really know
anything about them they were introduced
in the early 1960s and they are a sort
of misfit band of heroes that
investigate the stranger happenings in
the universe and some of the members
include Elastigirl you got your Beast
Boy and of course negative man
so heroes you may have never heard of if
you're not a super hardcore comic book
fan but robot man has always been in the
lineup he's in fact the only character
that has always been in the lineup this
show is going to be part of the DC
Universe streaming service that DC
announced back at comic-con it's like
eight bucks a month that comes with a
bunch of stuff we're pretty excited
about checking it out
but honestly I'm just really excited to
see Brendan Fraser upgrade to a
superhero franchise and even if it's on
TV and even if it's on a standalone
streaming service I will take it because
this man is awesome I love his acting
and I'm ready to see him play robot man
all right guys agent self overwatch we
have to get hype we got so many goodies
this week Gamescom kicked off in Germany
this week and Blizzard brought the heat
with a fancy new overwatch cinematic
starring our favorite mech pilot slash
pro gamer slash actress Hana song
otherwise known as diva in the short we
are treated to some highly requested and
anticipated backstory for our one and
only favorite off tank diva and it is
honestly just as fun and emotional as
any Pixar or Disney movie that you can
think of seriously if you have not seen
this cinematic you have to watch it
Blizzard is so good at these now we did
not only get an animated short about
Devo we also got a new control map
welcome to Busan Korea it'll feature
three fabulous locations sanctuary which
is
a little bit like Nepal's sanctuary
downtown which reminds me of Li Zhong
tower and the mecca base we love
overwatch here at stream economy and so
we cannot wait for Busan to hit the live
servers and you can bet that I will be
keeping my eyes peeled for any and all
clues that could lead to the identity of
the next hero in the game there has to
be something right right all right those
are our main block of news stories but
outlaw King just dropped its first
trailer online it was a Netflix movie
starring Chris Pine as Scottish
rebellion leader Robert the Bruce of
course there is only one man on earth
qualified enough to discuss this trailer
and that man my friends is Mark Searles
we think about what are things these
days accents TV movies not remember
Highlander a lot of time on the road are
we kid when I go about older I thought
about Highlander I thought a bit and I
was like what what see us coach peasant
played a Spaniard and a French person
playing a Scottish person who does that
make sense that this our walk was a
point to us there's a new movie coming
up and all the sky smoothly but if I
remember blue farm and Neil Gibson with
like ie awfully dumb can even talk
properly bit for some reason have deal
of that whatever it's called do walk
hang or someone that I and and that's
about the Oscars pest this peanuts
Robert the Bruce and Jewish plane Robert
the Bruce guess who Christopher Payne
give them a pain scores gas goes person
scores accent scores person magic great
but normal winner because of these
thoughts get the scores accents all the
actual scores people sound like this
hello I'm Scottish
hello I'm Scottish person man I talked
like this
I'm squash I told my Les Paul witness
all the time I don't care
pit stop tales on so what what do you
already like said let me saw me tell
that's why your some real man just beam
you know but the Brits of it because
painter space this is where I'd normally
make a joke in a Scottish accent but I'm
actually too afraid of sterols
