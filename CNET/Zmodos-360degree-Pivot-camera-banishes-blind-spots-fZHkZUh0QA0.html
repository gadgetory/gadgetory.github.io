just one simple thing they have live
streaming they might have motion but
that's about it
this 199 dollar 50 cent Zee moto pivot
security camera actually does a whole
lot more for its basic specs it has a
1080p live streaming camera it has a 135
degree field of view and it comes with
two door windows sensors that you can
put anywhere but it's best to stick them
within range of the camera because you
can actually program the app to pan the
camera to capture any activity that
these are detecting this camera actually
has built-in motion sensors that cover
360 degrees so even if motion happens
outside of the traditional field of view
it'll actually capture that and then the
camera can also pan 360 degrees to
capture that activity now it didn't
always get that right maybe it just
missed the motion that it was panning to
capture but for the most part it did
pretty good
it also occasionally had phantom alerts
so I would check the the livestream and
I would check the motion clips that it
saves to the app and and actually not
find anything which can be pretty
annoying so it's not super reliable in
terms of motion and that's a significant
thing I do like that this camera has a
lot of features and it's trying to do a
lot of things but the app itself is a
little tough to navigate and I wish that
were more streamlined but overall this
is a nice camera that I definitely
recommend if you're trying to capture
the whole room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
