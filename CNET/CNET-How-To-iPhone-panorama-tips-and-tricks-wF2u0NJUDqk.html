photography but if you upgraded to iOS 6
and you have an iPhone 4s or an iPhone 5
you might have a newfound interest in
panoramic photos let's start with the
basics and then I'll show you a few
tricks okay to start taking your
panorama photo you'll launch the camera
app as usual but then hit options and
select panorama now you'll see that by
default your iPhone will take you from
left to right but if you want to do a
panorama from right to left just hit the
arrow I'll go from left to right though
now before you start taking your
panorama you'll want to set the exposure
just like you would any other photo
obviously you can't set it for the whole
scene but you can set the general
lighting so to start hit the shutter
button and now your task is to keep the
white arrow along that line so try and
go nice and slow but if you go too fast
or get off-track your iPhone will tell
you you can do a 240 degree panoramic
photo but you can really stop at any
time by either hitting done or just
moving your phone back a hair that's it
so unless you have a really study hand
it's going to be hard to keep that
arrows straight but that being said you
can create some funky photos by
intentionally twisting your camera
around to create a sort of distorted
panoramic photo and if you put your
phone in landscape mode you can create
what's called a verdana just follow the
same method tapping the arrow to change
directions here is my favorite okay I
gave Chris my phone and now he's going
to start taking a panoramic photo all
pose and as soon as I am out of frame
I'll run around him and I'll pose in
time to show up in another frame we did
it twice but you can do this as many
times as you want in a long panoramic
photo but in the end you get a fun photo
that's definitely worth sharing and
speaking of sharing there are a number
of ways to show off your panoramic
photos message email photo stream but if
you want to give the viewer a different
experience
check out the tourist app which utilizes
the iPhones gyroscope for viewing these
live photos if you have any cool
panorama photos to share or any tips I
missed hit me up on Twitter and check
