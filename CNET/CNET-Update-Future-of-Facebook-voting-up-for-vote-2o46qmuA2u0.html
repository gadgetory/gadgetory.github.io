on Facebook policy I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update Facebook is
letting you vote on whether or not the
service should still put changes up for
a vote back in 2009 Facebook declared
that users can vote on policy changes
and the vote would only count if 30% of
all users participated problem was not
enough people were voting so it didn't
even matter it's up to one last vote to
decide if Facebook will keep this voting
mechanism Facebook is also proposing two
other changes one has to do with who can
send you Facebook messages right now you
can control who can send you messages in
settings but Facebook proposes it should
be more like email filters and since
Facebook bought Instagram it wants to
share info between the two sites which
could mean unified Instagram and
Facebook profiles users have until
Monday December 10th to vote and it'll
require 300 million people voting for it
to even make a difference the voting is
being done by a third party Facebook app
you can find it by searching for
facebook site governance the latest
gadget to bring live tv to your mobile
device is the elgato ITV it attaches to
an iPad iPhone or iPod Touch to stream a
few live TV channels you only have to
pay once for the hardware which is a
hundred bucks there are no other charges
most areas have just a couple of
over-the-air channels so you won't be
seeing much at launch check the coverage
map before buying it but on the good
side it lets you pause and rewind live
TV it doesn't require an internet
connection and it works in a vehicle but
before you dive in read our full review
at cnet.com if you're into discovering
new music or podcasts soundcloud.com
just got a refresh the audio sharing
site is trying to become the YouTube of
audio it added ways for users to
discover new music and audio recordings
by seeing what's popular with your
friends and other users the service also
links with Facebook new apps for Android
and Apple devices will be out Thursday
today we got our eye on a new app called
unity it's spelled crazy as most apps
these days but the idea is pretty
interesting
it lists I phone users
says all files from any device without
needing to first synced everything to
the cloud unity communicates with your
other devices both desktop and mobile to
access your files and stream music and
videos but the app doesn't make copies
of files and the files don't have to be
uploaded to a specific folder it's just
another tool in the growing cloud
storage space except it's not really a
cloud that's your tech news update you
can find links to all these stories on
the blog cnet.com / - Jeff Bakalar for
filling in for the past few days while I
was away from our studios in New York
