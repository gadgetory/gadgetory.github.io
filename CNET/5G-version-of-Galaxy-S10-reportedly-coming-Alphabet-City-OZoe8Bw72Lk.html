show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc the company that owns lots
of other companies like calico moon and
a little company called Google I'm your
guide Aya's Akhtar and you are the
excellent audience today we're talking
about a settlement the plastic pixel
your comments and more but first up the
s10 again let's go to galaxy gateway
there's a new Wall Street Journal report
with even more details on the galaxy s
10 it says some of the same stuff we've
heard before like expect three versions
to hit around February this report has
more info on the fourth version that
would arrive in spring this would be a 5
GS 10 with a 6 point 7 inch screen and a
total of 6 cameras two on the front four
on the back now what are all these
cameras for
the general sources say the cameras will
quote promise richer photos and better
spatial perception end quote I really
hope that means 3d tracking and not
hokey 3d photos ice universe published
images of what it says are the galaxy s
10 and s 10 plus glass and protective
film it looks like the S 10 will have
super teeny bezels on the top and the
bottom ice universe also says Samsung's
tech to put a hole in the active display
is exclusive to the company so we
probably won't see it elsewhere for a
bit here's one more tidbit from that
Journal article Samsung is also kicking
around the idea of reverse wireless
charging for some of its phones that
would allow the phone to wildly charge
another device like maybe headphones or
a watch or even another phone the huawei
mate 20 pro already has this feature by
the way let's go to uptown updates
The Guardian reports that Google has
settled a racial discrimination claim
with a contractor of Moroccan descent
the contractor apparently complained to
Google about being profiled and quote
accused of acting like a terrorist while
conducting undercover research for
Google in retail malls end quote the
nature of his work meant the contractor
did not have Google identification as he
walked around malls to acquire data he
told the Guardian quote someone asked me
point-blank if I was a terrorist because
I was walking around with a laptop and a
backpack it was so humiliating
end quote The Guardian says Google paid
the contractor 4000 British pounds or
around five thousand one hundred US
dollars to settle things its slideshow
time I guess will Saddam publish
pictures of what it says is the
mid-range pixel they be talked about
last time what do we call this thing
it's code name is sargo but it's also
being called the pixel three light let's
take a look at it in all its boring
glory yep looks like a pixel there's
just one camera on the front instead of
two
and here's another pic and another
you've got to say this for Google
products they are generally inoffensive
in design let's go to comments though
this is the part of the show where we
shine a spotlight on the most amazing
audience in the world you Jameel asks
why is Google getting rid of all their
robotics divisions that's a good
question over the years Google has
acquired a lot of companies a number of
those got passed off the alphabet to
determine what to do with them to me it
looks like Google's current hardware
track is in these smart home
well that eventually lead to a smart
home robot probably but I bet it won't
be a bipedal robot like shaft was
working on unpronounceable name says can
you include me in the next video yes and
a number of you seem to enjoy the shaft
Joe from last week while others think
the humor was cringing I agree with all
of you the jokes are absolutely terrible
I'll have a word with my strip writer
also known as me thanks to everyone for
writing in and surviving my awful sense
of humor if you've enjoyed your stay in
Alphabet City please like and subscribe
I'm iuz Akhtar and I'll see you online
