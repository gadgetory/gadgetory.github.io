your uh you know boobalicious I guess I
mean can we really even call the show
that anymore or is it alphabet alicious
or I don't know what we should call it
like i like alphabet soup but maybe you
guys have better ideas you know you
should let me know so let's get to the
show and if you have no idea what I'm
talking about it's all because the big
news from alphabet the artist formerly
known as Google now the big G officially
announced its plans for an all-new
operating structure by creating a new
company called alphabet that will
oversee a collection of all their other
companies with Google being the biggest
it allows alphabet yeah I know it still
sounds weird to still do what they're
doing while driving their core
businesses and pursuing their amazing
other non Internet related projects
without having to always lump them
together as Google so here's really a
look at how all of alphabets companies
will be broken down alphabet will be
overseen by Larry page's CEO and Sergey
Brin as president a slightly slimmed
down google is still the biggest company
and will be run by new CEO sundar Pichai
google will still do everything and now
there are other companies and projects
will be run by their own ceos like
google x's home of their Wi-Fi equipped
weather balloons for project loon or
their modular android smartphone known
as project ara nest is its own company
under Tony Fadell for the connected home
they also have their life sciences group
that's still working on the glucose
sensing contact lenses we've seen in the
past and calico will continue to focus
on health and well-being with the
ultimate goal of extending our lives
yeah that's big picture stuff now all of
these companies and more are part of
alphabet also in the mobile space Google
Hangouts four-point-oh is officially out
with an all-new and sleeker look thanks
to material design it's simpler to use
and performance is even faster with less
battery consumption with full android
wear support the grooves is also
planning to bring a new 3d rendering api
to Android called Vulcan Vulcan is an
open standard for 3d graphics and
rendering Android will still continue to
support OpenGL for graphics but Vulcan
will allow developers more explicit
control over renderings and CPU over
also check this out Samsung's unpacked
event happens this thursday but a retail
worker has posted the best-looking pics
of the note 5 to date including shots of
the packaging specs and a hint at the
new S Pen on the corner now this really
confirms a lot of what we've heard
already with the 5.7 inch quad HD
display for gigs of RAM and 64-bit
octa-core processor we're expecting a
whole lot more at Samsung's flagship
event including the rumored s6 edge+ and
possibly more news about Samsung's gear
line and even another look at what
they're doing with gear VR now check
this out the oneplus 2 has officially
launched worldwide but all of us in
North America will be delayed by two to
three weeks from getting our hands on
them according to the company now you'll
still need an invite to purchase one and
you know NFC wireless charging a fast
charging are still absent but they could
still return to the second phone that
one plus is expected to release after
this one this year and a heads up that
you should all pay attention to we told
you about the Android stage fright
exploit that enables someone to take
over your Android phone when an mms is
sent to you even if you don't open it
well the researchers who found it have
created a free app called the stage
fright detector app and it will tell you
if your phone is vulnerable or not
google has committed to offering monthly
updates on Nexus devices for the next
two years while the other major
companies including Samsung LG HTC Sony
and Android one will be issuing patches
as well all right now we still want to
know what you would rename the show
since you know now it's all about the
alphabet so send us your emails and
ideas to Google issues at cnet com you
can tweet me at Bryant on Laurie no drop
it right into the YouTube comments we
read them and we'll have some fun to
show off your suggestions next week
that's gonna do for this week's show
thanks for watching we'll see y'all next
time for some more of that you know I
don't know you guys figured out
