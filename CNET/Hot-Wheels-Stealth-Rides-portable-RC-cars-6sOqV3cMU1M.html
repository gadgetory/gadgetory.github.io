scenic car tech I usually review
full-size cars but today I'm looking at
something smaller
these are Hot Wheels stealth rides a new
radio-controlled car from Hot Wheels
these operate on a infrared controller
and the unique thing about these is that
they are compact and they fit in their
own controller case folding up and
sliding away
Hot Wheels design these so boys can take
them anywhere and play with them all
over the place
they have little buttons on the top of
this case here which serve as their
remote control so you merely push both
buttons forward to make the car go
forward or both buttons back to make the
car go back push them to the side makes
the car go in a circle and with this
racer car one button back and one car
forward the car goes in a circle
similarly the treaded vehicle the tank
which is another style of car this has
treads and similarly both buttons
forward they could go forward and both
buttons back they could go back now both
of these cut each of these cars can
operate on one of two channels so kids
can race them by having one on one
channel and one on a different channel
the range is about 15 feet for the
remote and we've tested up to 20 feet
although the control gets a little
spotty at that point operating time is
about 45 minutes these things operate on
watch batteries basically there's three
in the car two in the controller but
you'll need a screwdriver to get at them
right now there's two cars available the
racer and the treaded vehicle and in
October
Hot Wheels is coming out with the Batman
tumbler these cars go for about
twenty-five dollars I'm Wayne Cunningham
