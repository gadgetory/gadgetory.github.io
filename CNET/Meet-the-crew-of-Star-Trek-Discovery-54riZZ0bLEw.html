Spock's adopted sister that's true is
there a kind of pressure that comes with
that because Spock is arguably to me the
greatest Star Trek character of all time
I love how they woven me in I did feel a
bit of pressure yes because people are
familiar with the Vulcan behavior right
and so you have to be familiar to them
in that way but I am my own woman with
my own struggles with this Vulcan
indoctrination so I'm different as well
the captain is kind of a messed up guy
how will that sort of manifest itself in
the show and and three of the gear
character he's an interesting
complicated guy and all the characters I
think are born of our times you know it
might be set in the future but the
pointer Star Trek has always been to
reflect our times back of this because
I'm not the vanilla hero at the center
of it they I think they can explore
things that are much more nuanced and
three-dimensional than we will have seen
before your captain acts as a mentor to
first officer Burnham what kind of
influence does your character have on
her captain Joe Joe brings the humanity
back into Michael burden because she
grew up in the Vulcan society it's not
about wanting to break her spirit and
not be this like logical smart and you
know get getting things done
Michael Burnham but to make her accept
that she is human and to be human is to
have emotions but to have the good
emotions of love and compassion and
empathy because without that you won't
survive yourself
because he's the doctor he has
privileged and permission you could say
and and so that part of the story has to
do with some of the some of the work I'm
doing and how that may or may not be
affecting me and then there's that
question of like how do we talk about it
you know and what is it what is this
responsibility as as the doctor and also
as my partner you know I think I think
what's really refreshing is that we're
still even in the future dealing with
something as very simple and arcane as
life work balance these kelpy ins being
a prey species on their planet and I'm
the first one of my kind to rise above
that and to go through Starfleet Academy
and to become a high ranking officer on
it on a starship bridge so I I hold
myself with a certain pride in a certain
you know a sense of accomplishment and
and and hope for my own future and all
that you know I've seen as an outsider
but but but definitely embraced you know
the first time we meet him
so you're a Klingon pretty great how do
you think Laurel differs from previous
Klingons her heart and her integrity is
there her humanity is very much a part
of her storyline and I'm so thrilled
because of course anytime you play a
character you don't want them to be
one-dimensional and I feel like she's
four-dimensional she's got so many
different complexities our show seeks to
remind everybody that we need to be our
best selves I mean that even if we're in
conflict you've got to put your best
foot forward and I think it's all about
how we resolve our disputes
I think this version of Star Trek
reminds us of where we can go because we
are furthering Star Trek's legacy of
diversity and universality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
