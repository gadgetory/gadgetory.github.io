as you can see today we are not in the
studio we are at the Apple event in fact
if you can peek through those trees
you'll be able to catch a glimpse of the
Apple Campus that spaceship campus and
right behind me here is the Steve Jobs
theater where Apple has just announced
their latest batch of products and I'm
gonna give you a play-by-play of
everything that happened today ending
with our first hands-on look at those
new products
the first product out of the gate was
the Apple watch series 4 and there's a
reason why it was the headliner because
the least in my eyes it really stole the
show it got the first big redesign since
its launch and thanks to nine-to-five
Mac we knew exactly what that redesign
would look like so yes
bigger screened but not just because of
those barely-there bezels but also
because the screen itself got larger
from 38 to 40 millimeters for the
smaller version and 42 to 44 millimeters
for the larger one that means more
complications on the screen up to 8
which we also knew from the leak and a
new set of watch faces to choose from
but still no watch face store or sleep
tracking and the battery life doesn't
seem to have improved much from the last
model but once in the demo room I
actually got to take a closer look at
the watch and put it side-by-side with
the series 3 that I had on my wrist and
here's where you really see the
difference in that screen size also
worth noting the digital crown looks way
better with just the red outline for the
LTE version instead of that big red dot
it also has the now haptic feedback
which is useful for a superpower but
I'll get to that later
I also want to point out that the mic is
moved position it has a better speaker
so just to reduce echo they've moved it
below the digital crown and the back is
now made of ceramic and sapphire this is
supposed to boost cell signal on the
watches it also feels more comfortable
on the wrist I think the body itself is
slimmer but also the sensors don't jut
out as much and it seems to be more
flush with my skin it's actually those
sensors that are the main event for the
watch
it has a new EKG or ECG feature meaning
it can pretty much screen for
potentially life-threatening diseases
like atrial fibrillation it now alerts
you when you have an irregular heart
rate and then you can either confirm or
deny by just putting your finger on that
digital crown to take an ECG and maybe
send it to your doctor for analysis now
the other big thing is that it does have
FDA clearance which is a huge step
forward for a consumer wearable it also
has an improved accelerometer and
gyroscope so
precise that it could actually figure
out when you've taken a tumble now this
is helpful if you actually hurt yourself
and if it detects that you're not moving
it takes the next step for you and
actually sends out an SOS alert and lets
your loved ones know that you've taken a
fall that to me really elevates the
watch for a different kind of audience
that's not just looking to get in shape
or to use it as an extension of their
phone but who's looking to really keep
tabs on their health or an audience
who's looking to keep tabs on the health
of their loved ones okay next up iPhones
the sequels to the ten are officially
the 10s and 10's Max and I still can't
get used to saying max so excuse me if I
at some point stumble and say Plus
because it still still hasn't sunk in
but moving on they were exactly what we
expected thanks again to a leaked by 95
Mac we had the 5.8 inch and the 6.5 inch
super Retina Howlett screen with that
nice gold finish they both have better
sound better camera sensor a 12 Bionic
processor faster and more secure face ID
dual SIM option and a 512 gigabytes
storage option at the low price of 999
dollars or 1099 dollars oh yeah or 1499
dollars for the 512 gigabyte option
yikes that's a lot of numbers and a lot
of money now up close the 10 doesn't
look that much bigger than the previous
8 Plus which is pretty cool the fact
that they've been able to really take
advantage of all the real estate on the
front of the phone it has one full inch
more so also a much nicer goal than the
previous models at least in my opinion
here they are all three of them together
we have the aluminum 7 plus the glass
and aluminum 8 plus which looked more
like pink let's be honest and this new
stainless steel which in my opinion is
kind of what makes the gold on this
finish look better I also got to play
around with the advanced portrait mode
feature that lets you change the
intensity of the blur after you've taken
the shot that's similar to what we'd
already seen from Samsung with the
selective focus but I did feel like the
blur on the max looked a little bit more
natural than what I was used to seeing
on the iPhone 10 at least in the few
minutes that I had to play around with
it then that one more thing which in
this case happened to be an iPhone which
we were already expecting what we didn't
know was the name the iPhone 10 are
don't ask me what the arch stands for
because I'm not sure that Apple knows
what the R stands for but that doesn't
mean we can't have some fun playing a
guessing game down in the comment
section below or hit me up on Twitter
with your funniest or best guesses of
what that R stands for anyway we didn't
have an official leak of this phone but
it did match up to a lot of the mock-ups
we had been seeing pretty much
everywhere at this point it did have six
new color options that we weren't quite
sure of a red a blue a yellow a coral a
white and black with that 6.1 inch LCD
screen oh wait liquid Retina display and
single camera on the back here it is
side by side with an iPhone 10 and an
iPhone 8 plus it's actually a really
nice size right in the middle of these
two there are a few other differences to
point out like the aluminum frame we
also expected that versus the stainless
steel and no 3d touch instead it
actually has haptic touch on the side
button and for things like quick launch
of the camera but aside from that it
seems to be on par with the other two at
least where it matters the same a 12
Bionic processor a dual SIM option that
faster face ID and it even has portrait
mode but it's doing that with software
because it obviously doesn't have that
second telephoto lens so TBD whether or
not this actually works the Google pixel
does it with software and it does it
pretty well so it could be that it does
a legitimate portrait mode as well but
the best thing about this phone is that
it's 250 dollars cheaper than its
cheapest counterpart which happens to be
smaller and it's kind of sad that
anything below $1000 now is considered
cheap so I'm just gonna call it less
expensive either way it's a good
alternative if you're not willing to
fork up the thousand dollars for either
of the other two models and and again
that's just for the six
before gigabyte option because if not
you're going to spend closer to the
thousand dollars
sadly no more one more things after that
except we did find out that the fast
charger and the dongle will be mi a in
the box of these new iPhones pre-orders
for the iPhone 10 s 10 s max and the
Apple watch series for begin on Friday
September 14 with the phones and the
watch actually going on sale the
following Friday September 21st but
unfortunately the rumors were also true
about the delays for the cheaper iPhone
10 R and you're gonna have to wait for
the pre-order which begins October 19th
and it doesn't go on sale till October
26 so that concludes the gather round
portion of the Apple event here at the
Steve Jobs theater we got four new Apple
products we got three new iPhones and an
Apple watch series for that I want to
know which one of these you guys like
best hit me up on the comment section
below or on Twitter and we also didn't
get answers to all of our questions at
this event so we're gonna be back next
week at the apple core discussing what
we didn't get from the Apple event so
come back at cnn.com or you two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
