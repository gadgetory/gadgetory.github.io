are pretty expensive so this year the
brand is working to give you more bang
for your buck specifically a new feature
called hue entertainment will work to
integrate your smart lighting with your
favorite media now Phillip SEOs first
integration of the year is with razor
and the idea is to bring your color
changing lights on board with your PC
games so right now I'm playing overwatch
and I get character and ability specific
lighting I'm playing as the character
Reinhardt so the lights are white and
whenever I activate my shield ability
like right now I get nice flashing blue
lights and signify it there's a growing
list of games that work with you
entertainment to take advantage of the
integration you'll need to install Razer
synapse 3 software which is a free
download the integration with Hughes
sinks the lights up with Ray's or chroma
devices things like keyboards and mice
with built-in color changing lights and
if you don't have chroma devices don't
worry because the software will still
work if you're just using bulbs first
you'll need to set up an entertainment
area in the hue app you'll tell the app
which lights to include and you'll also
tell where they're located in relation
to your screen from there you will pass
that info along to whatever integration
you're using in this case Razer synapse
3 software once you've synced that
software with your entertainment area
you'll be all set
your lights will automatically sync with
your game as soon as you start playing
it in between you can even set default
lighting effects sort of like a
screensaver for your gaming setups
lights now the quality of the effects
really depends on the game some are
pretty basic flashing red lights when
you die in a zombie for instance other
games like overwatch feature effects
that are more sophisticated at any rate
it's very early and I expect to see
better deeper integrations as time goes
on now Philips tells us that they have
all sorts of new hue entertainment
integrations coming later this year as
well as new hue sync software for
computers that'll let you pair anything
on your screen to your lights not just
games as soon as all of that arrives
we'll test it out and let you know what
we think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
