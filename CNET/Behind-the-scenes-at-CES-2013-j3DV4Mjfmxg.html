Convention Center and this is where all
the action is gonna happen it's over
here you'll see the North Hall this is
where you gonna find all the big names
for car companies like Lexus and Ford
showing off their latest tech as well as
an area for all the third-party
accessories and different companies
doing other things specifically around
the Apple ecosystem and then really the
biggest the baddest hall is central hall

you're seeing the big lights the bright
lights the big TV screens all from Sony
Samsung is really put together the most
ridiculous booth every year as well as
LG a lot of the big products that we're
expecting to see we're gonna find it in
the central hall and then over the South
Hall to come over this way this is the
area where our stage the biggest and
brightest stay to see us CNET's own
stage is gonna be as well as companies
like blackberry Verizon Qualcomm that
are showing off some of their other cool
stuff but you know overall this is the
entire show right behind me well we're
gonna jump over to our CNN stage and
show you what that's all about
hey guys let me tell you it is a jungle
out there all right now we're here
inside of the South Hall this is where a
lot of the booths are still setting up
their plane to get ready with two days
away from the convention actually
starting but what we're gonna show you
is really the biggest and baddest stage
of them all this CNET stage at CES 2013
so follow me we're gonna go this way
when you check it out okay all right
guys let's check it out here this is the
scene that stage here CES 2013 we're
still getting things set up and ready to
roll but if you look around and see all
the big LED screens the big TV screens
are staged back over here this is where
a lot of the action is gonna be
happening live on stage what's this you
know I want to tell you something
there's like a secret pathway inside the
back of our stage set this is an
exclusive a/cs exclusive re so I'm gonna
show you how to get to it right
come here don't trip
charlie don't trip okay that's our
cameraman this is the back pathway into
our editing band station so during the
course of CES we have all these first
looks all these in-depth you know
product reviews and things that we've
seen that are gonna be announced here so
yes this is where all the magic happens
all of our editors that are pumping out
all those videos that you see here every
day so again this is kind of the battle
area where all of our video is gonna be
put pumped out here we're gonna move you
over towards the control room area this
is really where all the content that we
talked about gets produced live on scene
so if we go up this stage we have our
man Stephen B to them howdy there you go
audio podcast producer as well as to
producer on stage how do you okay this
is the mic here so if you look here this
these are all the controls and boards
controlling the audio the video you'll
see down here these are our multiple
cameras that are controlling all the
different views that you guys at home
are gonna be able to see because here at
CES we really kind of produce this like
a real live real-time broadcast back to
back from the day it starts from the
data ends we have content coming through
24/7 so this is where it all gets made
I'm gonna keep on moseying out here
we're gonna get back to our stage all
right all right so this is a really cool
view a side angle of our stage this is
again where you'll see a lot of action
some really cool stuff will also be
happening here on the stage we have
Molly's show always on we're gonna
actually live torture test gadgets here
we're talking about putting them through
heat tests cold tests or even bringing
liquid nitrogen to the stage think about
like the Terminator a guy when he froze
we're gonna do that here on the CEF
stage and we come a little closer here
also this is really the home where
you're gonna see the best of CES award
show every year this is really where all
of our editors come together and select
the best products that we see here at
the show and hopefully we end up seeing
them sometime in 2013 to make it as real
products but you know take a look around
you'll see all the different faces on
the wall a layout that we love and know
from CES Lasher but we've kind of
updated it made it fresh and added a lot
more elements now we know you guys walk
long distances at CES so look we have
all these nice seats so you know put
your kick your feet up it relax a little
bit but we even have this
real soft comfy boudoir couching man I
mean it's comfortable you know like like
real comfortable right no so make sure
you guys throughout the show you'll be
able to find all that content here at
CES cnet.com I'll be running around the
floor live so you guys will see really
what it looks like when the show is
happening on the floor as well but hey
