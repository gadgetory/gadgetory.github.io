experience an obsession with mobile tech
is a dangerous place to be that's
exactly where you'll find many teen
drivers a brand new State Farm
Commission survey of 1,000 drivers aged
16 to 19 found they both fully
understand the dangers of distracted
driving and do it
texting is number one in the world of
cognitive dissonance 95% of teens say
yes it distracts them from driving and
44% still do it anyway watching videos
behind the wheel came in number one in
terms of how distracting teens
acknowledged it was that's good but a
substantial 15 percent said they still
do it talking with a passenger was of
course almost universal and 49 percent
of teens recognize that that too is a
form of distraction red lights are seen
as a sanctuary by our teen drivers
though the law doesn't typically
distinguish that from any other part of
driving and that statistic is no comfort
if you're the one behind a teen texting
madly as that fresh green light agents
this teen panel reported deterrence to
distracted driving come in two main form
number one not wanting to crash and
about half that many by the way said
they know someone who did have an
accident while driving distracted and
number two not wanting to get busted by
the way only six percent said having a
safe driving contract with their parents
was a deterrent
teens may not be envisioning a world
where they put the phone down as much as
one where they don't need to the vast
majority believe that crash avoidance
tack will prevent crashes by distracted
drivers

drivers connection between what they
know and what they do more realities of
