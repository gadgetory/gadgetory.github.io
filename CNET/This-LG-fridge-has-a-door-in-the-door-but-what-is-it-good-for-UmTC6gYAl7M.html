refrigerators that have a sort of secret
compartment here in the front that lets
you access the indoor shelves most of
them are French door units but this one
is a side-by-side it's a $2,000 fridge
26 point one cubic feet and 16.9 cubic
feet in the fridge compartment itself a
nice looking unit here with black
stainless steel and kind of a minimalist
monolithic design now I'm not the
biggest fan of door and door and other
features like it it's not that much more
convenient just to open the different
door and get the thing you want out of
the shelf then opening the door like
normal and getting that thing out of the
shelf and plus it doesn't ever impact
performance doesn't make the fridge any
better at keeping your stuff cold in
fact if you look at this performance
heat graph from the tests we ran you can
see that those door and door cells run
kind of hot that's not surprising that's
kind of par for the course with door and
door compartments and with door shelves
in general more of a red flag is that
bin at the bottom you can see that it
creeps up at an average about 40 degrees
that's not a great result
even worse inside that door indoor
compartment you get this plastic barrier
that kind of blocks off your shelves you
can get in by opening this door here by
reaching in through this window but it's
kind of a tight fit and this top shelf
where you're probably keeping your
butter totally blocked off you can't get
in unless you go in through that front
door indoor compartment compare that to
the Samsung Food Show case side-by-side
that we reviewed last year it's a very
similar side-by-side fridge with a front
panel you can open up and those indoor
shelves aren't blocked off at all on the
inside there's no plastic barrier no
nothing and the performance on that
fridge was even better than this one so
I'm not sure why LG needed to include
that plastic barrier blocking things off
if you like door and the door features
more than I do then a fridge like this
might be tempting but I say go with that
Samsung or with another unit that
doesn't block the shelves off and
performs a little bit better than this
one does</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
