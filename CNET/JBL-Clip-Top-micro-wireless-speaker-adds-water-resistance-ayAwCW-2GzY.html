plus a $50 mini bluetooth speaker that
looks almost identical to the earlier
clip what's the difference well this
model is splash proof which means you
can rinse it off if it ever gets dirty
but you can't submerge it in water like
the original clip it has a carabiner
style clip at the top instead of a
closed loop that allows you to attach
the speaker to a strap on your backpack
or whatever else you want to clip it to
there's a call answer and button on the
side of the speaker yes this does have a
built-in microphone for speaker phone
calls
along with volume controls and a
dedicated Bluetooth button for easy
pairing also on board is an audio input
as well as an integrated cord that
allows you to connect the speaker to non
bluetooth enabled devices or the audio
output on your laptop computer it's
pretty nifty how the cord stoves in the
bottom of the speaker sound quality is
pretty good for what this speaker is
there's some bass just not a lot and it
will distort with certain tracks at
higher volumes its strongest in the
mid-range and it does well with
acoustical music and with speech and it
makes a good lightweight companion for a
tablet or smartphone for watching movies
television shows and sporting events its
battery life rating is 5 hours which
isn't that long but about average for
this size speaker like its predecessor
it's recommendable for someone looking
for a very compact speaker that can
produce decent enough sound for its tiny
size it's arguably one of the best tiny
wireless speakers out there and now it's
splash proof I'm David carnally thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
