comes to security I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update in a time where
consumers are counting on tech companies
to keep their data secure and encrypted
Amazon is choosing to leave it's fire
tablets vulnerable and it's stopped
protecting the data stored on the
devices security researchers say this is
a backward move by Amazon and it's mine
borrowing to say the least on why
software would be changed to be less
protected but if you own an Amazon fire
tablet or the Amazon fire phone be aware
your personal data is at risk if someone
takes your device or if it gets in the
wrong hands it's an attractive target
for thieves now to understand what's
happening we have to go back to this
past fall when Amazon released new fire
tablets with an operating system called
fire OS 5 it's based on Android but with
Amazon's own twist to it turns out that
operating system is lacking something
called device encryption but it's only
getting big attention now because fire
OS 5 updates just started rolling out to
older Amazon tablets with an alert about
the encryption change one security
researcher David's gaveta posted on
Twitter this message about losing
encryption it popped up when a spire
tablet wanted to upgrade Amazon released
a statement omitting this change Amazon
said device encryption was a feature
that customers were not using and that
data in Amazon's Cloud is still
protected so that means data you send
somewhere data in transit that's still
safe
but if you have this newer operating
system you may want to avoid saving
sensitive photos or documents to the
hard drive older tablets can choose not
to upgrade to fire OS 5 but not
upgrading means you can be missing out
on another important bug patch so you're
stuck in a bad position security
researchers say this goes against basic
security fundamentals lone theory is
that Amazon may have done this to help
its devices run faster but Amazon has
not yet responded to questions about the
reasoning behind the move of course it's
incredible that this comes right as
everyone is focused on a battle between
Apple and
Department of Justice over the
encryption of an iPhone the same day
this Amazon News blew up is the same day
Amazon teamed up with 14 other major
tech companies and filed an amicus brief
supporting Apple in its fight against a
court order which demanded Apple creates
software to break the security of the
iPhone 5c belonging to the San
Bernardino shooter now many other tech
companies and industry groups also
supported Apple by submitting separate
statements Apple heads back to court
with the FBI on March 22nd that's it for
