less I'm Dan Ackerman and this is the
assist transformer book t100
this is a hybrid laptop tablet combo and
unlike a lot of the yoga style ones that
kind of bend over backwards this is the
more traditional take the screen off
version is actually held on with a
magnetic latch as opposed to one of
those little kind of hook latches we
have to move a little button back and
forth or hold down a switch so you just
kind of give it a tug and it pops off
like this behind the screen of course
because this is a hybrid you have all
the components the the processor the
memory the hard drive the battery so it
gets a little bit top-heavy inside
you've got an Intel Core and processor
that's the same thing that's going to be
in Apple's upcoming 12-inch MacBook and
that's good for having kind of a very
light very premium fanless design it's
not as fast as having a standard Core
ICU CPU and frankly battery life we
found with the first couple of core M
systems we've tested ok not great but ok
certainly not as long as you'll get
using a regular full power CPU with a
larger laptop with a bigger battery so
here
the keyboard has its own battery inside
but it doesn't help you power this it's
strictly to keep the keyboard powered
when you have it separate because you
can flip this little switch and use it
in Bluetooth mode put the tablet over
here just the keyboard over here or if
you connect them then it makes a
physical connection and you don't
actually need the bluetooth for that so
if you want to have this plugged in and
fully charged you'll need the regular
power cable for the for the screen which
is the actual computer and you'll need a
separate micro USB charger for the
keyboard down here the t300 starts that
are very reasonable $6.99 especially
considering its metallic construction
and fanless design we've got to say the
upgraded version here that's got eight
gigs ram instead of four and has a 2560
by 1440 resolution instead of the normal
1920 by 1080 all the models currently
seem to have a 128 gig SSD there are a
couple design quirks that drove me a
little bit crazy using this the main one
was that the power button is right up
here so every time I'd reach out to
adjust the screen to kind of change the
viewing angle I'd accidentally turn the
system off and that happened to me
several times
so that combined with the only so-so
battery life and the fact that the
quorum just is not a speedy is a regular
full power processor you might be used
to means that this may not be the high
end hybrid for everyone I'm Dan Ackerman
and that is the assist transformer book
