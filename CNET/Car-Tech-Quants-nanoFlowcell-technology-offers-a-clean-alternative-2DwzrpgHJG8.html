sexy little car like this is what's
happening under the hood this is the
quant quanti no say small 2+2 electric
car but there's no battery anywhere in
here instead it's powered by what's
called a nano flow cell now the science
of what exactly is happening there kind
of escapes me but what's basically
happening is that you fill up its two
tanks with an ionized electrolyte fluid
and the vehicle uses that to generate
its electricity on the fly now what's
interesting here is the range that you
get from this technology Tuan tells us
that the quantum there's about a
thousand kilometers per Phila that's
about 621 miles that is pretty amazing
when you consider that most electric
cars are struggling to get about 100
these days but this isn't the only car
Qantas brought today they've also
brought a larger quantity now the quant
F is a much larger sports limousine it's
also more powerful for the quant Eno had
about 136 horsepower total each of this
guy's four electric motors do about 270
horsepower that gives you zero to 60 in
under three seconds the range on this
thing is a little bit smaller than the
quantity now because it's a much bigger
car we're looking at about 800
kilometers that works out to about 500
miles still impressive
now with battery electrics ruling the
roost today and hydrogen electric
vehicle is gaining a lot of ground
lately it remains to be seen if there's
any room in the market for this nano
flow stealth technology we'll definitely
be keeping an eye on it I'm Anna Swan
Goodwin on the floor of the 2015 Geneva
Auto Show taking a look at the latest
from quant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
