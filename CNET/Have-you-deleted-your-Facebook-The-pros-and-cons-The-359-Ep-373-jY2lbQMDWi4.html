Joanie Sussman so in the wake of the
Cambridge analytic a scandal there's
been a massive call on social media for
people to delete their Facebook there
was a trending hashtag on Twitter on
Tuesday and Brian Acton the whatsapp
co-founder he ended up selling whatsapp
to Facebook for 19 billion dollars in
the past and he tweeted out also it's
time to delete Facebook but you know I
I'm very doubtful that people are
actually going to do this Joan do you
still have your Facebook page I mean I
do one of the reasons that I do I think
underscores the reason why it's hard to
delete facebook you know as a journalist
I'm like basically not allowed to delete
facebook it's something that we have to
do to promote our stories and it's not
just people like me I mean like I didn't
in addition to the normal reasons why
people stay on Facebook to stay in touch
with friends and family and know what's
going on their lives you have to sign it
a lot of apps sign in you just choose to
sign in through Facebook so you don't
have to remember another password
there's a lot of ways that in facebook
has become sort of an infrastructure for
wider press the internet that makes it
harder to just delete your account yeah
so a lot of people have chosen or like
jumped on this campaign to delete
Facebook because of all the you know
issues with data collection and issues
going on with Cambridge analytic oh that
broke last Friday you know a lot of is
more of like a moral like issue for them
but I feel like this is much different
from the delete oberg campaign that had
gone on or the delete HQ campaign that
had gone on you know I feel like
Facebook is a lot more essential to
people's lives than a quiz app or
getting a ride in a you know rideshare
company right that's the thing about
Facebook is that they're basically a
monopoly in social networks I mean
there's nobody that even comes close to
the amount of their scale even with uber
or at least it's a not as big and B they
have robust competitors what would it
what would it take for you to delete
Facebook though like what would what
like even if they did like the craziest
thing in the world like would you still
use it because it's so you know it's so
ingrained in our society I don't know I
mean I think that for the normal person
a normal person to have to delete
facebook an average user it would have
to take a lot more than what's happened
so far I mean we don't know but we don't
know
don't really know yet it's only just
started to see if there's really been a
ding to so so as a counterpoint you know
for the stay on Facebook campaign Chris
Wiley the Cambridge analytical
whistleblower actually had his Facebook
account deleted by Facebook itself so
you know you can't delete us we're
deleting you and he said it screwed up
his life in many ways
ironically on a Facebook live chat on
Tuesday you know he's saying that he
can't use tinder now because you can
only validate your login through
Facebook which you were talking about as
like it's a login mechanism for a lot of
people and he compared it to being
deleted from the internet which i think
might be of a stretch but i think he
does have a fair point that you know
there's a lot more cons than pros to
deleting facebook i found in the past
when i have tried to scale back the
amount that i use facebook there are all
these because it's so ubiquitous there
are all these ways where i'm sort of
forced to open and not force but if i
want to make sure that i see this video
or if i need to check something or even
if it doesn't have anything to do with
my own facebook account there's lots of
times where I'm like oh I actually have
to open a Facebook even if I don't want
to yeah and finally the Senate Intel
committee they hosted a hearing today on
election security it turns out not every
state is interested in the federal
government's help
so while 21 states were hit by hackers
in 2016 only about 19 actually asked the
Department of Homeland Security for its
help so wasn't during this hearing
wasn't there a senator that made a kind
of extraordinary suggestion for how to
test our security yeah so if senator
angus King he's an independent from
Maine he mentioned this to the
Department of Homeland Security
secretary saying hey you should create a
Red Team which is basically like a you
know offensive hacking team to hack
these states that haven't opted in to
show them how vulnerable they are and
then maybe they'll choose to opt in I
think there's ways to convince people
that their systems are secure I wouldn't
say that this is the best one and that's
most of the time that we have for today
but if you liked what you heard check us
out on CNET I'm Alfred Inge I'm Joni
Salzmann thanks for listening
okay thanks for joining us everybody we
are still gonna do the same even though
we are running late I'm gonna jump
through the chat and find some great
questions and comments because we all
have an opinion on Facebook and I think
the first thing I want to start out with
is this this is coming from me as a user
of Facebook how much is it truly
Facebook's fault at this point is it
really a broken infrastructure or is it
that it's been poisoned and destroyed by
malicious users um I was I was gonna say
it kind of depends on who you ask
Facebook and you know a lot of like
stories out there have been kind of
saying this isn't really Facebook's
fault in the way that you know this is a
third party app that like lied to them
and didn't you know like you know comply
with their rules and then basically
centas did something that they weren't
supposed to but you know you could also
make the argument that you know facebook
didn't do enough to protect that
information in the first place so that
people couldn't lie to them so yeah
there's two different perspectives on
this but Facebook is well you know
they're saying that they're the victims
here and it's not their fault on this
and I think that I think people have a
good point when they bring up the you
know if facebook was deceived then they
were deceived and that's kind of been
the party line for Facebook so far even
though there's been a lot of kind of
leadership silence about response to
this particular scandal but I mean their
friggin Facebook I think that argument
falls on a lot of deaf ears when you're
one of the most powerful companies in
the history of the universe yeah this
this is you know something that happens
with insecurity a lot when a company
gets breached the the idea is you know
hey we were like hit by a criminal and
you're saying that this is our fault
like I don't write but you know in
Equifax this scenario the idea is yeah
but you didn't do enough to secure your
system to begin with right I think
that's the debate going on with Facebook
right now it's right it was like we were
like lied to and deceived right but if
you're like a company that's enriched
yourself yeah
yes astronomically and you have
incredible power if you're not wielding
it with responsibility then then that's
on you that I think is a valid
counterpoint to the but we were deceived
argument so we got a great comment from
Matthew dacher am I the only one scared
about how
Facebook has changed the way I
communicate let's think about that let's
really think about that for a second has
Facebook reformatted how you communicate
at large the way you think about how to
interact with people interpersonal
communication I think it's been really
interesting in the last year is the
number of early stage Facebook
executives and investors that have come
out saying just those concerns like like
Shawn Parker as a main as a major one
who said like What did he say
probably don't use yeah he says he calls
himself a Facebook conscientious
objector Rodger McNamee he was an
investor who he wrote an op-ed and then
this guy whose name I can't pronounce
but he went to Stanford and he I'm sure
a lot of people saw it he had this like
whole talk about how he doesn't let his
own children use Facebook how it's
ripping apart society it's one thing for
you know users to have grudges against
Facebook before the people that actually
create it himself I think it's
interesting it's great that they've
chosen to you know after their sailors
after making billions of dollars off of
it I feel it it like really feels like
to me like drug dealers just saying like
don't get high on your own supply kind
of thing I don't know if they've changed
the way that I communicate but I feel
like maybe it's because the change has
been so gradual that like you don't
notice it like a frog in boiling water
like I don't like I can't like specify
any specific ways that they've changed
how I communicate but at the same time
I'm like I'm sure there is yeah and it
might not even be a communication I
think a lot of the research that has
shown that Facebook changes the way we
feel has to do with self-worth and
identity more so than with as a
communication I think as a communication
tool Facebook has been isn't that that
foundationally changing but in terms of
like yourself worth how you present
yourself to the world how you structure
your life in order to present it to the
world of Facebook and Facebook as the
biggest social network has had a big
influence I've done that for me at all
because I my self-worth is at a peak I'm
the greatest yeah I don't think that
you've been influenced by by
try again Facebook so is Zuckerberg
currently selling off his stocks is that
some writing on the wall yes he had sold
it in like January or so he's actually
did a new boat that could be it
he's a he's actually supposed to finally
make a public announcement today you
know he's been kind of hidden for the
last like five days or so and so there's
no confusion there's a very there's a
different stock structure at Facebook
even if he does sell off some shares he
has what are known as super voting
shares and so without getting into the
details of it partly because I can't
remember box off my head basically if
Mark Zuckerberg is is entrenched as the
leader of Facebook for the till the end
of time unless something catastrophic or
he becomes president basically there are
a lot of people in the chat who have
left Facebook a long time ago a lot of
people who are on that increasing
incline right this very second for those
of us out there who have hesitated
because of the reason that we are
interested in interpersonal
communication like literally I've gotten
away from interfacing with it as much
can you use Facebook Messenger and
maintain those communication direct
lines without having to have a public
profile I looked into it I actually
looked into this like over the last two
weeks before even before like this whole
thing broke out just because I was very
annoyed by being on Facebook the answer
is no you need a Facebook profile to use
that but you can largely disable a lot
of the profile functionalities you can
stop people from posting stuff you
cannot go to dot-com
yeah you can just use yeah messenger
don't have to put your name out there
there was actually a Chrome extension
that is that makes it so that whenever
you go on like facebook.com it's only
messenger and event which is what I
would assume most people use it for now
anyway well yeah I've tried I've tried
just messenger and that's the only thing
I use like I mean I don't
for my own interactions with friends and
family I don't use Facebook very much
but I use whatsapp constantly I mean we
have to consider that it's not just
Facebook and not just messenger a
Facebook branded product there's also
whatsapp and Instagram Instagram being
the second biggest and yeah I've used
I've used Instagram a lot as a chatting
app instead to that and like group me
which is not owned by Facebook
also snapchat like group chats so there
are ways to communicate outside of
Facebook and whatsapp but I think it's
like them it's like the lowest common
denominator for like online like chatter
so a lot of people there there are
gajillion and a half different
interfaces you could possibly utilize to
supplement for Facebook we can talk
about some of them but the benefits to
something like a Facebook where you're
using your data plan instead of SMS to
me it's an appealing free quick easy
fairly efficient and organized method of
communication
I have only poked at whatsapp tell me a
little more about what's happened how
that could be used as a Facebook
alternative well I use it all the time
but the great thing about what's up is
that there are very robust competitors
to it like signal offered yes but mostly
to communicate with sources right yeah
so the thing about whatsapp is it's
basically just like instead of using
your text messages it's like that except
in a different program except Ivy
started using it because I didn't it was
before the days of unlimited texting and
it was a way to text with friends in an
unlimited way without having to worry
about you can also make calls through
whatsapp and it's encrypted which is
also helpful signal as well yeah that's
why Channel and whatsapp they're like
the biggest rivals with each other right
if you have a confidential confidential
'ti issue that you want to take care of
it's a good alternative for that reason
that's why I use it I use it so that I
can communicate with my family and my
friends on a one-to-one basis yeah my
parents are one too many yeah my parents
use it but I'm specifically not on it so
I don't have to talk so you have to be a
signed up user of whatsapp - yeah that's
with another what's happens yeah
automatically integrated being that it's
owned by Facebook No yeah so you don't
have to have a Facebook as far as I know
you don't have to have a Facebook
account because I actually I signed up
for what's up before it was bought by
Facebook but and so I don't know if I
was just grandfathered in but I there's
no there's no like it's an impermeable
barrier between my facebook and my
whatsapp there's no inter connection
except for the fact that both owned by
the same company shut up
shut up the syringe oi that a IM miss a
comeback on this one oh man i really
possible let's talk about some more
alternatives people are curious what is
signal I've never heard of that one
myself it's a secure chatting app a lot
of security like researchers use it and
you know a lot of like political
activists and journalists use it because
it's one of the most secure ways you can
chat with sources it's encrypted
end-to-end which means that like it's
encrypted like when it gets to your
phone while it's being transmitted and
then while it like the other person
receives it as well and it's not like
other encryption messages where you have
to give them this whole like PGP key key
kind of thing like you can really just
give them a phone number for it and you
don't have to use your own phone number
for it like you can set it up with like
a Google Voice number or some kind of
other phone number for it mine I use my
company phone number on it but I also
have a separate one with like a Google
Voice number on it as well mm-hm
so yeah it's one of the many secure
messenger apps that are out that's out
there and it uses data instead of like
your mobile line and the reason why it's
so highly regarded even though there's
so many of them out there you know
there's like telegram and then what's
happening their signal is that it's
lying I don't think it might be but not
as like signal is right but yeah the
reason why it's like so heavily like
touted or is you know it hasn't like
suffered and like any like security
issues that some of the other ones have
had telegram was making headlines
yesterday because they lost a bid to
like have to give up some of their code
to like Russian when the Prussian
government they're still fighting it but
there was like some like decision
yesterday I said like you yeah you have
to hand this over to us so signal has
avoided that issue of like mostly yeah
let's talk about some more alternatives
what about viber mix Alice wants to know
about viber I've never heard of that one
myself I've heard of it I've never used
it yeah I can't mix Alice tell us about
if you have an experience with that we'd
love to learn more is this an
opportunity for Google Plus to shine
Michael Brown is a big proponent of the
Google interface I've used it myself it
was many
ago I found it taxing to try to maintain
both the Facebook and the Google+ and
ended up defaulting once again to the
one where I had the most interactions
with people in my inner circle where we
can share our jokes and crap and where I
can filter out bad political stuff I
would say the most useful thing with
Google+ is it would be most useful to
replace Facebook as a authentication
login so yeah what the the Cambridge
analytical whistleblower was complaining
about say oh I can't log into tinder
anymore because I need to use Facebook
as like a Authenticator on that you know
how like some websites you don't want to
create an account for but it's like oh
you can write them with Google+ and
Facebook would you another reason a lot
of people are resistant to the idea of
dropping it but there's always options
that's a thing I've seen one that's
restricted to one never used Facebook as
an authentication for that because when
you do that you give that app permission
to login like on your Facebook account
which is how this whole Cambridge
analytic and got like all the permission
issues so I just did I did show after
all this news book I did go through my
personal Facebook and I like deleted all
the third-party apps
next to my account and it was amazing
how some of them that I haven't used in
years like a bizarre little game that
had jellyfish in it like how they acts
because you know and use your grievance
you don't pay any attention when they
ask you for permission
they like wanted ever they had access to
everything so Facebook actually has like
almost no info on me you know how like
you can check like how they target
advertisements towards you yeah they
have like almost no information on me
because 13-year old Alfred thought it'd
be edgy to not like anything just like
I'm gonna like anything I'll keep my
page empty and look cool I'll be like
mysterious and stuff and now I'm looking
back at like 10 years later and you're a
prophet hell yeah
not only was I edgy and mysterious I
also kept my privacy on there so there
you go I mean it's kind of a shame I did
like the aggregation aspect of Facebook
granted it got infiltrated it's been
compromised to say the least but I mean
I can go there and it is a single place
because I was using a lot of things like
Google Reader and feedly and event
the Facebook rendered all of them fairly
obsolete because I got that and I got
the direct line to the people that I was
like oh Alex would love this recipe or
you know look at the Avengers trailer do
I really need to share that everyone
already saw it it's all kind of
self-serving anymore I'm definitely
interested personally in finding
alternative these days from Facebook
itself yeah I mostly just go my group
chat to talk with my friends now yeah I
think the rise of snapchat that it's not
a like one de Mike you're not published
isin publishing your life to the entire
world on snapchat I think that's the the
rise of Facebook and sort of a reaction
to it is why snapchat had an appeal from
miksa list he says definitely try viber
out end-to-end encryption good PC
version it only needs your phone number
doesn't have stories props to that it's
just for messaging and calling and video
calling also wicker me is pretty cool
I've never heard of that one either so
definitely worth checking out we're all
on the hunt these days I think from the
watchful hunter is there a way to remove
Congress from media control over the
election process we took it we took a
turn here is there a way to remove
Congress from media control over the
election process listen I'm embracing
conspiracy theory Thursday's here ah
getting ready for it Wednesday my dude I
just had to bring it up let's talk to
sir enjoy do you think that an actual
breach proportional to the mass of yahoo
breach would be hurtful enough for
Facebook because I don't think the issue
would even budge the users well what
would it take to push you off Facebook
essentially I feel like they'd have to
have a like there has to be in another
competitor that could offer all of it
and then also everybody just happens to
jump on it at the same time cuz that's
kind of what happened with MySpace
they're their myspace really sucked but
there were like a lot of people still on
it and then Facebook comes along as like
oh here's all the things that like we
hate about MySpace that aren't on it
myspace is just ugly and clunky yeah
I'm dangerous times early yeah but the
idea was that you know they made a
better website and then it offered all
the features that myspace did so people
decided eh let me just go on that
instead and then people just started
leaving it one by one yeah I feel like
I'd have to take something like that but
Facebook has gone like so ingrained with
like people's like lives and you know
their culture and all this stuff that
you know it's that's that's like a
massive shift that would have to happen
I don't think a breach of Yahoo's sighs
I think there would be hammered toward
in the news and it would cause like a
large migration or like people leaving
but I don't think that it would like
essentially kill Facebook in the same
way that you know Yahoo's still going on
right now and you know people still use
Yahoo even after that like every single
user was breached and people still use
it so I don't I don't think that a
breach interesting is if Facebook has to
change itself either regulation or
through public pressure has to change
some of the things that have made that
have spurred its rise to begin with like
MIT like even just the fact that they're
focusing on this time well-spent thing
and they've shown so far that's shown
that that has caused a reduction in
amount of time spent on Facebook and be
interesting to see if there is
regulation that forces Facebook to back
off on some of the addictive elements of
it some of the divisive elements of it
yeah which are the things that make
people get like sucked into the begin
effect so most of the proposed
regulations have been on average
political ads yeah but they so the FTC
is reportedly like looking into Facebook
now for its violation I'm an agreement
that I made in 2011 which was mostly on
like privacy issues but that's not
regulated that's more like an FTC like
agreement that they had so they are
looking into that but like all the
addictive stuff that you were talking
about all like the psychological tricks
that they use to like keep you on
Facebook there's never really been much
chatter on that so I'd be interested if
if they you know if that was like a part
of it maybe interesting I never thought
I'd agree with somebody over this but
from i-tech you out
he says man I miss my space and I do too
at this point why I don't know the
security features because I was you know
such simpler days man oh yeah full house
Ian days and and Lincoln aider says
Facebook used to be so simple I don't
know what happened Mike Shaw followed it
up says you should have just banned
third party apps business happened
investments happened corruption happened
yeah they get they make a ton of money
off of the third party apps because it
takes in all this information that you
can use for advertising so yeah that's
probably not going away unfortunately
but yeah money happened that's a half
Facebook found a way to normalize and
centralize a lot of the communication
and efficiently organize it I'll give
them that much a lot of people say
hangouts is a great alternative hangouts
is a fantastic platform but my mom
doesn't use hangouts my mom's on
Facebook I also have everybody's text
and I'm number but I don't want to use
my SMS with dollars I want to use data
that is easier for me I don't know it's
that's that's why I'm stuck in Facebook
yeah maybe the downfall of Facebook will
be just because that's where all our
moms are maybe that I can't wait for us
to all be on some social network that
like our children are stuck on because
fuck right there's like man I really
want to leave pooper Nupur but my mom's
on it so I can't
Cooper Newport yeah that's my social
network joined pooper Nupur yeah I I
think I myself and personally quite
ready to just stop embracing the website
Facebook I'll exists on it but I don't
want to interface with anybody except
the direct messages to the people that I
care to share that inside joke with
anymore I think I'm ready to embrace
that I can old I don't care about stuff
anymore I don't know if it's just age
though I mean I don't know it's hard to
say because I'm also getting old we're
all getting old but I mean I pulled back
on how much time a nice personally spend
I made a conscious decision to spend
less time on Facebook and I was happier
for it just because it's like I mean and
I'm not talking about anything that
Facebook has done or anything but just
the fact that it's inherently something
that's based on getting you know getting
self worth and self gratification off of
these things that are ultimate
I mean that's a really philosophical way
to start looking at it yeah the last
post on my wall was from CES like I like
almost never post on Facebook anymore
all right it's bad times not very
bragging now is that yeah yeah I don't
post on Facebook
good he's mysterious I think we are just
about out of time this has been a really
fantastic discussion everybody and thank
you for all your suggestions I myself as
a social media user will embrace and
research these for my own personal
exploits and we're interested to see go
ahead and tweet at us if you do come up
with any other better alternatives
because Facebook seems to be just poison
these days yeah we'll say bye to you if
you're out there in the snow be safe be
well be warm and we'll be back tomorrow

an ice castle Alfred you want to take us
