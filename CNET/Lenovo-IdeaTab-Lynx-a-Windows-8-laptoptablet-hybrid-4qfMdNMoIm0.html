a look at the Lenovo idea tab links this
is another one of those laptop tablet
hybrids this is a tablet screen that
connects to this keyboard dock right
here and it's from the family of hybrid
devices that we've seen several examples
of that use Intel Atom processor which
is a low-power but very efficient
processor which means the computers not
as powerful as let's say a core I Series
one is but the battery life is generally
very good now you see this forms a very
clamshell like design when you plug the
screen which is about 615 hours into the
keyboard base which is about another 130
the keyboard base also includes an extra
batteries of you put the two parts
together
you should get very long battery life
the hinge on these there's always sort
of complex I'm not a huge fan of this
one it's got this big central button
here and it stays in very securely but
when you try to take it apart it's a
little sticky
you're really got to kind of work it out
like that and then you're left with this
11 inch tablet which is very light it's
kind of got a plastic back not the most
high-end feeling tablet that we've
looked at but for an atom tablet it's
perfectly fine and you can use it like
this this is where the CPU and the
battery and the memory is and then when
you're ready you can just plug it into
the keyboard base and then you've got
something that looks a lot more like a
laptop the big advantage of plugging it
in besides the after battery life and
the keyboard is the fact that the base
has a full sized USB port in it whereas
a tablet itself only has a micro USB
port and a micro SD card that's not
super useful unless you're going to be
walking around with a pocketful of
adapters and cables which kind of
defeats the purpose of having a very
portable tablet in the first place I'm
