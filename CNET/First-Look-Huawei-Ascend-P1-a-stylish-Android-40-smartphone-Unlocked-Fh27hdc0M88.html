we're going to take a quick first look
at the huawei ascend p1 this is an
Android Ice Cream Sandwich smartphone it
is unlocked we first got a glimpse of it
at CES and our team was definitely wowed
by the thinness it is extremely thin
less than four tenths of an inch in fact
and also by this great contrast of a
white back and a dark very glossy front
now I mentioned this is unlocked and
most of the time I would never recommend
to us users to buy an unlocked phone
simply because it's going to cost a lot
more it's not going to be optimized for
a network however it's always fun to
look so without a do we're going to take
a look at the 4.3 inch Super AMOLED
display it is nice and crisp bright
colors it's on a pretty high brightness
setting right now just so that the
colors really do pop like I said it's
got this really great design some
interesting angles and silhouettes here
on this phone so it looks good there's
an eight megapixel autofocus camera on
the back that does 1080p video capture
there's also flash unfortunately i
didn't think photos lived up to their
potential some of them were good some of
them just really weren't the color
reproduction wasn't always spot-on
there's also a front-facing camera on
here for self portraits and for video
chats is a micro SD card slot door which
I like for easy access processor wise
there's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core chip
in here to keep things moving along and
it does support hspa+ speeds up to 21 at
megabits per second now would be really
interesting to see the ascend p1 in the
United States unfortunately it is
unlocked the p by the way stands or
platinum series because Huawei's got
their diamond series their platinum
series their gold series and y for youth
series so hopefully this is just a
portent of things to come and hopefully
while we will get the recipe right and
some of the upcoming phones that we will
see I'm Jessica doll court for cnet and
this is the huawei ascend p1 unlocked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
