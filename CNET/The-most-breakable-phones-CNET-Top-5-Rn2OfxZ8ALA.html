phones we called in our resident
destroyer vanessa han doori honor to
rank which phones cannot take a fall she
wanted me to let you know that these
tests are not really scientific so your
mileage may vary let's get to it and
number five is the essential phone when
this phone was introduced it turned
heads with barely-there bezels and an
odd notch for that camera the company
said it used titanium is said of
aluminum since that material is more
durable when we drop the essential foam
from around three feet the frame scuff
at selfie height around six feet the
ceramic back and glass front were a okay
the frame got a little scraped though
what killed the essential phone in our
tests two trips tumbling down a tough
staircase practice ring but the ceramic
back survived coming in at number four
is the Samsung Galaxy s8 a three-foot
drop onto concrete created a small crack
on the back of the s8 but the screen
survived with an eye level fault the
metal frame had some dings and the back
cracked some more we tried another test
where we left the phone on top of an SUV
then drove away the back continued to
crack but the screen survived again and
number three is the Apple iPhone 8 with
its glass back it handled the hip-height
fog just fine with the eye level test
the screen was completely shattered for
our final test we dropped the iPhone 8
out of a fourth-floor window because why
not guess what the camera was busted in
the rear glass was smashed that brings
us to number two the LG G six the front
panel uses Gorilla Glass 3 while the
rear panel uses a griddle glass five the
three-foot drop test led to a hairline
fracture on the screen but the back was
fine at five feet the screen was cracked
some more the back was relatively
unharmed which is great except you
probably want the screen side to survive
instead and the most breakable phone we
tested with our unscientific tests is
the iPhone 10 the glass back cracked on
the first drop at 3 feet dropping its
screen side down the back cracked even
more the bottom of the iPhone 10 was
pretty damaged on the screen side Apple
said the new iPhone is designed to be
durable but not indestructible if anyone
is concerned about dropping their iPhone
and damaging it we
just using one of the many beautiful
cases available to protect iPhone I
remember when I busted one of my phones
my samsung galaxy s3 fell out of my
pocket while I was upside down on the v2
vertical velocity roller coaster at Six
Flags the entire front was shattered let
me know the craziest ways you've broken
your phone again big thanks to Vanessa
for her help Amaya Zack Cardinal see you
