basically because it eats into your
photography time so I'm going to show
you a way to combine both cleaning and
photography we're going to be doing
light paintings with robot vacuum
cleaners so for this you'll need
obviously a robot vacuum cleaner we're
using a samsung navi bot because it's
got some LED lights on the top but any
other robot vacuum cleaner you have
access to should be fine a DSLR and a
wide-angle lens for this tutorial I'm
using a 24 millimeter lens but you can
also use the kit 18 to 55 millimeter
lens that came with your DSLR just use
it around the 18 to 35 millimeter mark
you'll also need a remote shutter
release this is because you'll be
shooting in bulb mode and you're going
to need to release the shutter remotely
finally you'll need a tripod or
something sturdy to keep a camera on
while it's taking photos over the course
of a couple of minutes next step is to
set up your DSLR put it on the tripod
and find bulb mode on some cameras this
is found in your manual exposure mode
keep flicking the shutter speed dial
until you find a B on other cameras
there is a specific mode on the dial
that is denoted by B find this and turn
it on then you'll set your aperture you
probably want to set something between
f/8 to f/11 to get started with you want
to reasonably narrow so you're not
letting in too much extra light just
getting the light from the robot vacuum
cleaner then your shutter speed is
obviously determined by your shutter
release now for this particular how-to
you're going to be using a shutter
release where you can lock the shutter
button down using the remote now it's
time to turn off the lights and start
taking photos there's no particular best
time to leave your shutter try and
experiment around 2 to 3 minutes to get
started with and take a look and see
what kind of light trails your cleaner
is leaving if you're finding that you're
not seeing enough of the light trails
you might want to open up your aperture
so move it down to something like f5
points
or even lower if your lens will let you
now we've played around with some of the
effects that are given from using the
built in LED lights on the robot vacuum
cleaner we can get a bit more creative
think about buying a battery powered LED
now this is a little bit stronger and
you can attach it to the top of your
robot vacuum cleaner and let it go and
finally if you want to get super
creative and you've got access to two or
more robot vacuum cleaners think about
putting them both on the floor at the
same time letting them go and you can
even do some cool experiments like
putting colored cellophane on top of the
lights to give different colored light
effects so this has been how to do light
painting effects with a robot vacuum
cleaner hopefully you've had fun it's
made you think a bit more about the
tools you can use for light painting I'm
Lexi civilities for seen it make sure to
