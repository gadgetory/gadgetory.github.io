here but what's the difference between a
6s and a 6
well other than an S on the back and the
fact that you can also get this in rose
gold these are the key differences wait
the 6s and the 6s plus wait a tiny bit
more than the older six models but you
can't really feel that in your hand
they're made out of a sturdier aluminum
alloy that's similar to the Apple watch
and they have a more reinforced glass
screen 3d touch apples making a big deal
out of the pressure sensitive screen
that's on the iPhone 6s models you can
push in anywhere and be able to bring up
shortcuts
Piku taps and use it for games and other
functions down the road there's an
upgraded front and rear camera 12
megapixels in the back five in the front
with a front-facing flash using the
screen and there's a live photo live
photo is the ability to take gift like
pictures that capture audio and video
automatically and the video camera on
the rear and shoot 4k video this time
around every year there's a new
processor in an iPhone
this time the a9 should offer
significantly faster speed and graphics
and there's twice the RAM inside which
will handle multitasking better
always-on Siri already works on older
iPhones if you have it plugged in but
the new iPhone models will have
always-on Siri any time ask Siri a
question hey Siri where are you or you
can deactivate it if you've had enough
of Siri the touch ID fingerprint sensor
is faster than before
and there are new LTE bands on it for
faster web browsing those are the big
differences between the iPhone 6s and
the six before it for a lot more stay
tuned on CNN I'm Scott Steiner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
