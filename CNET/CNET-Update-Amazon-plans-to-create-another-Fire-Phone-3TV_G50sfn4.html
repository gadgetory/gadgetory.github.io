yet I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update the Amazon fire phone was a
major flop but it's not yet extinguished
amazon senior vice president of devices
has acknowledged that the phone was
overpriced and that amazon is learning
from its mistakes for the next release
so the fire phone will be back amazon
smartphone originally costs two hundred
dollars with the contract but most
people expected it to be priced cheaper
than the competition with reviews
complaining about a lack of apps
overheating and poor battery life the
fire fizzled fast in the US the price
dropped to 99 cents but Amazon seems to
be doing fine with its new streamer the
fire TV stick it doesn't even come out
until november nineteenth but shortly
after pre-orders began it ran out of
stock and it's now listed as being on
backorder until january fifteenth so
unless you were among the very first to
order don't count on giving one is a
holiday gift the blackberry messenger
app has a new treat hopes to win you
over you can now retract a message if
you send something you regret or you can
set a timer for how long a message can
be seen that's similar to what's popular
on snapchat now if you want to mask your
identity on the web and surf anonymously
you can use a browser called tor and
when you use tor your IP address and
location are hidden from any website you
visit before today if you visited
Facebook with tour the site didn't load
right but now Facebook has created a
special link for tor users so you can
connect securely and this can also be
helpful in countries where the
government restricts internet access
allowing more people to get on facebook
without revealing their identity sony
gave some PlayStation owners are good
scare a glitchy system update to the ps4
is causing crashes some users say that
when they enter a standby rest mode they
can't wake up the console there also
have been problems reported with
uploading game clips to YouTube before
downloading the 2 point 0 update check
if Sony released a fixed version and if
you already did download it while Sony
suggests booting the
so in safe mode to avoid problems a few
days ago you heard about the Taco Bell
app that lets you order your chalupas
and gorditas ahead of time for pickup
well other fast food chains are looking
into doing the same thing when it comes
to pain at a restaurant with your phone
Starbucks has the most successful app
but next year the app will let you place
orders ahead of time and some areas will
offer delivery so you won't have to drag
your body out of the office to get a
pumpkin spice latte that's your tech
