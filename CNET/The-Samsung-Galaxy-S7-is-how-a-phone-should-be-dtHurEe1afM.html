reviewing phones but when I was here in
London and Samsung sent me the galaxy s7
to review I did the only thing I could I
took it for a test spin around the city
as a tourist
the s7s 5.1 inch screen makes it small
enough to stash when I need both hands
and even though it pretty much clones
last year's s6 it has new curves on the
back that make it look and feel great
the major downside all those gross
distracting smudges what's up with that
Samsung anyway at least the lock screens
always on display is easy to love other
phones have this too and it's the winner
I could immediately see when it was too
early to call home and then I still had
plenty of power left now when I travel I
take it a lot of photos like seriously a
lot guys so I'm thrilled that the s7 s
camera delivers even in hair whipping
wind all of my pictures of springtime
daffodils came out sharp and focused and
those low-light shots they just keep
getting brighter and better selfies did
look a little plasticky from the
front-facing camera but I seriously dig
the makeshift flash that you get from
the screen lighting up autofocus is
incredibly fast too and the few new
camera modes are fun to play with
you
the s7s new gaming tools can record and
minimize the game so I could jump into
something else for a second I love that
Samson brought back the micro SD card
slot so I can store videos to watch
during my downtime same goes for the
water-resistant coating which is also
back and took the worry out of
accidental splashes and dents Android
6.0 software means that the s7 has tools
like built-in battery saving features
and this time Samsung has really cut
down on the bloatware the quick camera
launch returns - along with the
fingerprint reader and Samsung pays
credit card capabilities that was great
for when I ran out of local cash you'll
also see advanced features like split
screen mode wireless charging support
and new tweaks here and there a
disappointment I did notice that the
phone turns on in my purse when it
smashes up against other things and that
drains battery faster but other than
that battery life is monster big and
carried me through long days but I still
had to charge the phone each night I've
got to say I'm impressed with the s7 as
a portable camera as a communications
tool and as a hub of my digital life it
is the top all-around phone to beat this
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
