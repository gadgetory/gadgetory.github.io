cnet.com and we are at CES 2013 and
we're taking a look at this new device
it's called the basis van from basis
science now a lot of the news of this
show has been about wearable technology
and this device the basis band is a
perfect example this trend you may think
it looks like a ordinary watch but
actually it is a fitness tracker it
tracks your steps and also will track
your sleep patterns and additionally on
top of that it even will monitor your
heart rate as well as your sweat
perspiration and also the temperature of
your skin during your workouts and
another thing that's really nice about
this device is that it will connect to
Android smartphones using a companion
app as well as iOS in the future for
iPhones and let you establish healthy
habits to increase your health just
you're essentially your quality of life
to create a better way of living so one
of the unique things about the basis
band that separates it from other
fitness trackers is that it reports your
sleep automatically and you don't have
to actually kick the device into sleep
mode before you go to bed or turn it off
when you wake up now the basis band has
been shown here first at CES 2012 but
it's just start shipping so you probably
be able to get your hands on it for the
next few weeks but it will cost you
$1.99 so that's a little bit more
expensive than a typical watch but for
all the features it has it's certainly
worth looking at I'm Brian Bennett and
this has been a first look at the basis
band from basic science check back at
cnet.com for a full review
