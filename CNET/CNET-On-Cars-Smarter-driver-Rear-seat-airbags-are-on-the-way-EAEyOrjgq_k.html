of late-model cars but here in the back
you kind of get table scraps maybe one
of those side curtain air bags reaches
back this far and maybe one of the
recent and rare seat belt air bags the
shoulder strap is actually an air bag
housed within what looks like a
traditional belt but if there's an
accident
sensors determine when the inflatable
belt should deploy signaling the belts
tubular air bag to inflate with
compressed gas an IIHS survey found 12%
of people injured in crashes were in the
back seat an even more notable rate when
you recall that often that seats empty
so automotive industry supply our TRW
has now developed two rear air bags one
deploys down from the roof the other out
from the back of the front seat
now these vaccine air bags look a little
odd right but the dynamics that led them
to that shape were based on a study of
German car accidents from 99 to 2013 a
lot of years TRW found that the majority
of folks were injured in the backseat in
the crash either got hurt by slamming
into the back of this front seat
or because they only had a shoulder belt
on and nothing else restraining them all
the force was concentrated here and they
got a thorax or chest injury the airbag
seeks to distribute that force much more
gently in smaller cars TRW expects the
seat mounted airbag is going to work out
better in larger vehicles the
roof-mounted design could be a better
idea by the way a rear airbags are not
just about protecting people in the back
according to Japan's Institute for
traffic accident research and data
analysis serious injuries and fatalities
to front seat occupants declined by 25
to 28 percent when the rear passenger is
restrained because they in the front no
longer had this one or 200 pound
projectile in the back hitting their
seat and causing more impact airbags
back here would be expected to even
further reduce front passenger injury
due to rear passengers these new bags
are likely to arrive in Europe first
where some new rear seat crash standards
are rolling out soon the US has yet to
develop a framework for even evaluating
them but the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute is
working on that so why is it taken so
long to get rear air bags into momentum
like this well two major factors one is
economics our makers aren't really crazy
about jacking up the MSRP by adding
features even if their safety features
sometimes that are not going to be used
very often underappreciated and unsung
if you will secondly 14 states in the
u.s. right now don't even require that
you use a backseat seat belt so in many
ways this is the low-hanging fruit even
before we put some inflatables back here
it pays to double-check your States rear
seat belt laws the availability of rear
air bags in the car you buy in a few
years and regardless of either that your
passengers are using the restraints
they've already got in the back more
