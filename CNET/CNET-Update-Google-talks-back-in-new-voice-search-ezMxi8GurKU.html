Google I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that updates Google's
conversational voice search is now
available on your desktop through the
Chrome web browser so you can ask Google
a search question and it can speak back
to you to find the answer
Google demonstrated the technology last
week with how voice search is smart
enough to even understand follow-up
questions leaving us all thinking who
this is the Star Trek computer future we
all want to live in but don't get too
excited there Wesley because they're
still working out the bugs
there were times I got an error message
follow-up questions don't seem to be
working yet and I have to keep clicking
this allow button to give it permission
to use the microphone for every question
Google should be fixing that because if
I have to keep moving my mouse to click
an allow button it's just faster to
click on the link and get the answer
myself by reading it there are some
interesting gadgets coming out of the
CTIA Wireless show in Las Vegas this
week such as the quick-set Kibo
electronic door lock you don't need to
use your keys to unlock a door all you
need is to have your smartphone near you
and touch the lock with your finger it's
similar to the idea of a keyless car
entry when you have the key fob in your
pocket it pairs with your phone via
bluetooth and you can designate what
permissions to give other family members
it'll cost between 200 and 250 dollars
when it comes out this summer also at
the wireless show Walmart announced it's
working on an app that will be smart
enough to recommend what you should put
on your shopping list based on what you
normally buy and you could scan the
items as you put them in the cart for
faster checkout General Motors says it's
working on adding apps for its vehicles
in the second half of the year rather
than let smartphones power the apps in a
car
GM wants to get more apps built
specifically for its cars and Twitter
users can now quickly sign up for an
advertiser's offer or promotion inside
of a tweet now a company can collect
your name and email address through a
tweet without you need to fill out a
long form so signing up for something's
faster but only a few companies will be
testing this for now and here is a look
at a gadget that we don't typically talk
about here a wired keep
'lord accessory for the iPad here at CNN
we review plenty of wireless accessories
but Logitech made this wired keyboard as
an accessory for students it was
especially made for classrooms because
if you can imagine an elementary school
teacher trying to set up bluetooth for
30 students that's a lot of wasted
set-up time and bonus its spill
resistant this keyboard will be $60 and
it comes out in August but if you need
one to connect to the older iPad with a
30 pin dock that version comes out in
October
that's your tech news update you can
