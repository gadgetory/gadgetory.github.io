take the car that is the Prius and turn
it into the line of cars that will be
called Prius let's see how they're doing
as we drive the 2012 Prius V and check
the tech so what is a Prius V well I
think it's the Prius that most folks are
going to end up buying to be honest you
got a nice cargo box back here the
second row as you can see spacious it's
got a higher roofline here than a
standard Prius and by the time you get
to the front row it's basically standard
Prius stuff but all this brings you a
vehicle that doesn't print minivan
although in honesty it's really kind of
a mini mini mini van just palatable as a
car would you look at it and say I can
do a lot more with that now once you're
back up here in the cockpit things are
relatively familiar we've seen this
Toyota head unit before this is the
fancy one with a bigger screen you can
see we've got the upgraded JBL audio
more speakers and more importantly
better amplification this sort of
eyebrow display is one of the most
advanced of the business you've got your
power and charge indicator digital
speedometer and then of course various
sorts of mpg and other indications and
of course this touchscreen can also
default over to voice command which is
pretty good on these Toyota systems the
other way to control this head unit is
via these rather elaborate controls on
the steering wheel you've got a pad over
here for audio and one over here for a
variety of display trip computer and
HVAC settings an interesting mix on the
right bluetooth hands-free of course is
on here as well as bluetooth streaming
aux jack USB now these cars come in
different trim levels - is the base for
some reason three is the middle car
that's the first one that includes
Entune here under the apps button and
then under that apps screen right there
this is a way to get one app on your
phone that brings five apps to the
screen for the details on this make sure
you check out our complete tour of this
innovative new interface on CNET TV just
type in in tune
and the level three car also brings in
navigation based on a hard drive and it
also brings you satellite radio HD radio
and HD radio iTunes tagging now you see
we've got a nav screen here a color
screen not every Prius V has that you
got to step up to the top two trim
levels for that but they all have an LCD
for controlling vehicle functions and of
course there's the level five car which
is the top yeah I know they skipped a
couple numbers that gets you this dual
panoramic but fixed glass roof all that
has are shades that move and that level
five adds almost three thousand dollars
to the level three car and then on top
of that we have an advanced technology
package that brings us the JBL high end
audio a split screen nav system with a
bigger LCD and all pre I go through this
little dinky goofy little bejeweled knob
right here reverse neutral drive brake
is extra region for the battery and park
is a separate button up here then you've
got three drive mode buttons here evie
makes it run electric all the time as
much as it can
eco makes it do the least fuel
consumption possible and then power
moves it into the performance range
blending both sources for the best
response under throttle all right now
all Prius V's like all pre I have this
Toyota hybrid synergy drive motor
powertrain combination it's the big dog
in the electrified car business now it's
a 1.8 liter sidesaddle lean-burn
atkinson cycle for couple of an electric
motor 134 horse 105 foot pounds of
torque then add eighty more horsepower
from the electric motor and another 153
foot-pounds from that same motor for
some good numbers well ok numbers it
gets this 3400 pound car up to 60 in
about 10 and a half seconds remember
it's trying to sip fuel now those kind
of numbers could move this vehicle more
sharply but it's not programmed that way
it's a Prius afterall
instead of biases toward mpg 44 City 40
highway substantially lower than the
smaller Prius but of course you're
lugging a lot more around with this guy
aren't the Prius driving experience as
you can imagine is very familiar in this
vehicle although I find the rides a
little nicer I think it's got a couple
hundred more pounds on the hoof dampens
things out but all the noises it makes
and the responsiveness you get our pure
Prius visibility is really good though
because you got a higher greenhouse a
little bigger notch in the back where
you're looking at it's just a little
more pleasant car to drive all around
the other thing I know driving any Prius
of the current model year is twelve it's
been a really good job of handling these
power modes and getting them to operate
in ways each one of them that is kind of
grown-up and refined they aren't too
silly they don't have herky-jerky
distill them when you're in the power
mode of the EEV mode everything kind of
falls over very elegantly from one motor
stage to another they've done a very
good job on this okay here's the pricing
of the Prius V and here's how I'd play
it the base ride the level two cars 26:4
it's a little too sparked though go to
the level three that rolls in in tune
and some navigation now you got a great
tech package without going broke this
guy's like 37 because it's a level 5 has
all the tech that's get a little too
steep for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
