Friday it's april eight it is the 19th
anniversary of my bar mitzvah happy
barman is it to help me celebrate that
amazing anniversary are two other Jews I
could not tell you when my permits the
day is how do you remember that because
I have this like Rain Man thing we're
with birthdays and not personal date
yeah and I've yeah I feel like we've
upset people who maybe don't like Jews
well that's their best-ever diverse
artists starting art uh so I want it so
Russ is here as always and then to my
left uh for the first time ever a long
time in the making mr. Ben Fox Rubin how
are you sir the huge honor thank you
thank you so much for having me it's uh
it's it's mostly your pleasure it is now
I'm kidding uh tell us what you do here
at cnet.com / news ok yeah so I'm a news
reporter I mostly cover amazon ecommerce
payments that kind of thing so how
people are shopping how people are
spending about this chip card situation
it's kinda stupid and subtly people
don't leave their credit cards right the
thing anymore right why don't like it
and what do you talk you talk about that
little chippie yeah you notice we have
to stick it in and wait 10 seconds Oh
what really 10 seconds yeah it makes it
makes your transactions much more secure
I understand so that's that's a huge
benefit and that's why they're doing it
sure but um there's there's still very
much a learning curve I get yelled at
every single time ago right to Duane
Reade like no you took it out too fast
to get out too fast that should never be
a complaint technology from like the
1980s like that how is it like we can't
just do NFC to do this sort of sick you
can you can you can do Apple pay yeah
whatever and that's as secure right it
is it is basically the exact same
technical not built into my card why do
I have to stick it in like a jerk
because it's not uh it's not wireless
rice you're asking too good of questions
yeah it's that's what it is cuz the chip
in your credit card is not wireless
that's true it's got a BF c is here is
why early right it's
wireless but like hard the chip in your
car yeah it's on the right side of your
cart when you stick it in your touching
metal so it's just the expense of the
NFC chip that they don't want to pay for
it maybe I mean if this stuff if this
stuff was a little bit more
understandable to people like I think
that folks are just straight up confused
about how they're supposed to pay though
they go to the register and just like I
just want my stuff yeah but like am I
supposed to pay with my phone am I
supposed to pay with my wallet or my
scars no information out there like how
the hell's any was just very confused
it's all fragmented the whole thing
fragmented uh but that will change one
day the coolest idea that I've heard
yeah is that you just basically pick up
your stuff and leave and that's not it's
not a Fivefinger discount there's like
some sort of technology to DC I can't
take it off the shelf sure they know who
you are when you walk in or any just
walk out that's your quote-unquote
payment that's gonna lead to so much
more spending yeah why that which they
would love privacy presumably is the
concern there but yeah sure I'm fine
with that I me I think it's a great if
that's how you gonna get me to pay for
stuff where you can like you can
understand that I'm taking something off
the shelf right be my guest catch all
those fit four year old stealing condoms
yeah well you're gonna have to pay for
exactly dad's painful I think a
fifteen-year-old should be giving
condoms for free I agree I don't think
this you have to steal by amen uh so
what up so so you do a new podcast for
scenic called 359 yes and this is this
is a real like this is this is something
else that you actually want to highlight
this because the 404 is where you guys
you guys are well past 1600 had episodes
honey that's pretty accurate yeah cuz I
looked it up because we just finished we
just wrapped episode 24 oh so we're like
eyes yeah exactly well you know I
mention it because you know you guys are
we've done a book ups yeah i think it's
like 1650 something like that right yeah
so so it's called the 359 the reason for
that is is that you get the news of the
day in form under four minutes so I'm
gonna try not to talk fast because we
try to get to as much stuff as we can in
four minutes and we have like a clock
and everything so uses a big difference
you could take you what I like about
that
is that were five better than you guys I
like that nah nah bet it's true oh yeah
five more better five more better than
59 we actually we did one podcast where
we talked for like an extra 15 or 20
minutes and people bowed to Batman vs
Superman and I was like this is so
liberating I'll just talk no editing is
the hardest part of writing and
broadcast and creating content by far
keeping things short and it's valuable
like what you provide is a big service
cuz like obviously like there are people
that want to just hang out listen to a
casual podcast but like for the people
that have the four minutes or whatever
then subway stops that's an asset and
wilshire it's a lot of work to edit all
the information you have down to fit
into that slot unless you're just trying
to do the least now we're possible just
writing the exact amount of words that
would fit there and lastly the last
thing you said well I would one hundred
percent true so how does that work
though like being like you obviously
edit right you can't just you know that
you just try and do it in one take we do
it in one take yeah you try to do
because we do it so I know we do it four
times a week no but I'm saying how often
like how many takes how many times you
haven't really you have any sorry we
like were kind of crappy about it at
first and then and we had to do a couple
of takes right I had to slice and dice
and then since then it's just been
easier just to do it in one day and you
use your bullet points or is it a script
yeah yeah we do bullet point okay we
like blueprint if you don't blueprint
ahead oh you're gonna run out of ya
before you even introduce yourselves Wow
so yeah so all see ya you know but we'll
see I mean like do people one short
podcasts and I don't even know you I
mean the whole idea about my guess is
that there's no time limit I feel like
but I think there is an audience out
there that wants like the no
just give me four minutes borrow I'm
done yeah and I think that's a real
thing totally for sure we haven't been
cancelled yet hey there's where's that's
the posix good sized post and you're a
quarter century old that's been going
for like a month that's that's a big
deal we have three Twitter followers
that's not a huge one of them's my mom
k accounts you know you could follow
your own Twitter account and like Juke
battle on the other one so how do people
find the 359 podcast it's it's on CNN
right that's very vague what way that
could be we're not even it's so new that
they're not even promoting it that much
so you have to like you're probably
gonna have to go into the search which
is terrible Sharon cnet so but it's on
like we posted RSS or something yeah you
can find it on I too am i spelling out
359 or am i typing in the number it's
it's three and then Poland the colon and
I'm number three Cohen and then 59 yeah
so if you did the 359 like in Google
search yeah I don't really find some of
the newest ones or you could go on
iTunes um but yeah they're not they're
not promoting it that much so that's
okay I feel like iTunes is the safest
way to use excel and find the show yeah
it's been fun it's been alright and I'm
gonna get to do one soon right yeah you
want to come on on Tuesday I won't be
your Tuesday but maybe later next week
like thursday okay into it yeah yeah
we'll keep doing like Flintstones
Jetsons kind of stuff Oh perfect at rock
and roll I'm not sure what that means
but it's like when the Flintstones meant
the Jetsons yeah like a crossbow it's
also that was trippy yeah like the
critic Simpsons question what were the
circumstances of that was there a
time-traveling yes so there's an alien
named Gazoo who traveled back in vieques
ill and you he had like magic science
powers and was able to transport I
believe that I believe it was the
Jetsons that went back to the
Flintstones time it wasn't the vice
versa because the foot stones would lose
their mind yeah jump off the sky
building man that's like where's the
ground anyway I don't know anything
about it to be on yes you know why wow
you really saved me on that one I
remember when the Jetsons movie came out
there was something aesthetically about
the look of the movie they changed the
look of it that like blew me away it was
like more shading to it it just looked
like it almost looked computer-generated
maybe it did I didn't watch it but I
know you talking watch it either by
solidarity's there's no waves compute it
wasn't the late eighties night Jetsons
movie oh for sure it was like one of the
first movies I remember seeing that
there
probably france farmers movie
Transformers movie one of the first one
I saw I'm pretty sure surprised like two
or three sure had a popular course I
know out of like just how intense and
awesome it was it was what was the song
at the end when they were like killing
or on whatever dad I got the job yeah
you got the touch was that in oh my god
wow that takes my way back good job wow
we're we're checking all the boxes here
today we're really nerding out big one I
do want to mention before we move on
from movies yeah my brother is taking my
niece who's two and a half years old to
see Deadpool to see jungle book oh and
horrible idea right I was like there's a
scary snake there's a scary like Panther
creature and the bear well the Bears
friendly the bear it's blue the bear is
it was a pretty realistic looking bear
yeah but he sings and whistles probably
if the bear is fine i'm not worried
about the best so what do you worried
about all the other animals I don't know
people like orangutans yeah yeah have
you seen you haven't seen the footage I
saw the trailer looks terrifying I don't
want to watch it it's gotten good
reviews surprisingly what's it rated uh
it's probably PG I feel like you can't
take a Maya great you can't I agree it's
too intense right what do you think you
think you take a two-year-old I have a
three-and-a-half-year-old and I don't
think we've ever taken her to a movie
that she remembers like I remember my
wife used to go to like mommy baby movie
yeah yeah and and the kid doesn't
remember those yeah my niece has only
seen peanuts in the theaters that was
the only other movie she saw and my
brothers like you know you love peanuts
and I'm like that you can't there's no
deccan jobs all yet the jump going from
p well I guess Snoopy's flying and
killing the Red Baron so maybe oh my god
right yeah ruin the movie I haven't seen
way that's but like that sort of a
Snoopy thing he doesn't do that um I
don't know I think it's a really bad
idea it's yeah it seems really weird
when I was watching Deadpool a couple
weekends ago uh it was great that by
like see movies like two months after
they come out that's the best time to
see a movie kisses empty cuz empty yeah
and we're sitting there there's maybe 11
people in the theater and all of a
sudden like halfway through this
freaking dope comes in with like a very
small kid who like just learn to walk
yes great
way through the movie sog so he was just
like killing time being a dick whatever
I don't know what he was doing yeah like
who strolls in it's weird right that's
weird I heard this is like like a hyper
violent it's extremely violent it is
incur so hard-r nudity very hard hard
hard we got everything and they like the
guys like I knees like goes right on his
phone is let's all kid watch whatever's
gonna say because it's it's not my place
man what do you want me to be the world
if he's on his phone i would yell at him
oh it was so far away it didn't bother
me that stuff I just knew like uh he'll
get his hero something kid's gonna grow
up to be a bastard sorry I was just so
mad I was like in season I can't believe
it and I'm like I know yeah I know yeah
anyway let's move along okay my hand I'm
holding a box that I received in the
mail yesterday okay it is it shaped like
a phone box right so describe this
because we are no longer video vodka
right so it's probably five by three
sure 6 x 3 x x 3 x it looks like it
would fit a phablet yes right yeah it
looks like an iphone box okay guys white
box and it says it says apex it says
apex i've ever heard of this company
again x right so I'm like what is this
yeah this isn't unheard of i get random
 sin to me all the time Oh curse
okay yeah that kind of came out but sure
just you know don't just you know you
it's a privilege not a right poopy there
you go ijevin whatever bfr here uh so i
get a lot of random stuff yeah sometimes
it comes from chuck most of the time it
comes from China okay bazaar where the
origin we that's where that's where
that's where all of our stuff is made so
I open up this box and it's a posse it's
a phone and I'm like all right what the
what that's weird using my manual and it
looks like an iphone that's a pretty
nice-looking fun it looks like a nice
phone yeah right like like touch it it's
oh yeah ft right i mean you would need
giant hand I mean yeah it's a phablet
you had a fab you have right hands yeah
you got a nice big hand thank you well I
don't know about that so I'm like what
I'm like what is this stupid thing I'm
looking around
I finally turned the box over okay and
it says designed in North Korea huh what
wow that's a nice it's a nice twist
right there what I then also like all
right I said oh alright plus is found I
felt I felt very weird when you said
that I was like this is from like a land
that I've never liked you know I'm can
access how did it get out it's like a
bad phone to the dear leader there's
turn it on I be able to talk you for
using my phone I've been activated yummy
why not when I mean there could be
anthrax in there is a number of things
Wow I said that's a scary thought that
is very scary but mission accomplished
they got it in the country so i did i
was able to turn on yesterday and it's
like a really shitty android phone I
mean come on of course it was right once
you said North Korea you got the wrong
you got the wrong Korea to send you of
course the wrong Korea they should refer
to the North Korea's the wrong career
wrong in so many ways uh I turn like the
screens real bad and then I'm like what
is going on i'm looking at the bottom of
the box again okay and it says copyright
2016 deep silver why the plot thickens
so do you eat said I know tips over as
you might not know deep silver is a
publisher of video games yes they make
saints row did they sell saints row or
they I think they were the ones that
bought saints row yeah I think they
bought the pub they have the rights to
saints row among a few other homeland or
home front is another franchise 80
Oh got it okay it all just clicked for
me it's a PR stunt yes but it is oh
that's so lame i know i'm very
disappointed we didn't okay building up
the okay job was a very cool build up I
legitimately thought it was in North
Korea phones for a while first thing I
did was like i went to the twitter um
you know into the twitter handle that
the business card has on here apex info
at apex a phone there's a video and then
you've searched a little more and you
dig a little deeper and it's a home
front sequel promo okay I mean that's uh
I gotta give them credit that's a pretty
convincing cuz it's some rest more often
that they'll be like it'll be like a
little settle on the outside and then on
the inside it's like homefront awesome
blonde and this yeah I mean so here's
the deal right like my whole thing and
we talked about this on the be sketchy
my whole thing is like I wanted the path
to discovery to be more fun yeah like
all that happened was like i went to the
twitter thing yeah iced clicked on a
trailer and it was just a trailer for
the full share of no contact whatsoever
the only the biggest tip was the Deep
Silver thing right which is which is a
nice piece of subtlety I would have
liked it if they screwed with you a
little bit more well like I turned it on
and somebody called you on the readings
yeah right have been down been great
there's no sim card in here um so yeah
and and and the only thing on the phone
is a video a trailer for the Folger so
in the fiction so in the fiction of this
game North Korea invades the US and wins
whoa and this is like our north korean
i'm sorry wrong korean apocalyptic
future where we have slightly worse
phone if slightly sure sound so bad what
was us well yeah isn't that weird crazy
so I don't know we were less interesting
but crazy yeah but like I believed the
phone I bought it when you were when you
were explaining to me and you that you
showed the North Korea stuff I'm like of
course to like promote the fact that
they have like a technology exactly
whatever of course they would send
something out and it would be like
crappy but it would be like close enough
to being vaguely acceptable so you gotta
give points mailing yeah I could work PR
people you
we kind of had spent a long time talking
about home front so michigan right but I
play I mean I played the beta okay well
what there's like a believable logo yeah
give me a little context home front
first person shooter a black person
shooter okay so it's just like now you
know in the story like i said is north
korea wins you know what this logo girl
reminds me of is the new HP logo which
actually I like what do you think about
that you see the new HP logo it's really
cool yeah it's like it was like under
their nose this whole time exactly oh
yeah all they had to do was get rid of a
couple lines yeah well apparently they
did they use that logo or they created
that logo a few years ago and it was
like rejected they never used it and
then they were real to it yeah that I
didn't know cuz for a while they were
just like spelling out you a Packard the
worst brand on the planet right yeah
yeah that's what we want to do shout to
the heavens that your computer is super
lame but here now you have the HP it's
just like six lines and they're like it
looks like an H&amp;amp;P it's very clever what
were the lamest pc brands in like the
90s there were so many packard bell was
p yeah i'm bad at the cow one no that
was gateway okay is really bad i had a
ton of friends in college that gateway
see I think gateway had a good bread I
think the count out yeah okay yeah i
think people dug it it was like his mom
to death who is very dense computer
within 50 miles it felt like that i
don't know why it was it was smart I'm
sure had nothing to do with like
environment or anything like that but
they're probably they had like a joke
cow in the field in front of their
factory or the grass-fed computer yeah
right yeah that uh what else was there
compaq oh yeah I'm happy with you which
HP ended up swallowing right at some
point and you know give dell credit
they're still thing and they were like
weirdly now isn't lame in the 90-day
were like they were the brand and they
spent all that money on that your kid
right at the double are getting Adele
yeah but even before that I remember a
lot of people prided themselves on
having Dells because they were like this
is a business computer but I have it in
my house so I somehow in better right
way you could also customize it rat was
a big thing for sure that you could put
stuff up and say oh I want this origin
what I was that the only commuter
company that was like a dudes last name
Michael Dell right no they all are no
what if you're a hewlett-packard missed
out hewlett-packard stay okay as Apple
impacted always a Steve Jobs I knew it I
knew it well is Steve John baby I think
we have a show time uh yeah I'm trying
to think what else was there hmm I can't
remember that was it yeah who's not it
wasn't always pretty no much fun this is
this is my question to you so is that um
so I think that HP and Dell are both
coming out with much prettier laptops
this is assuming that you're even buying
laptops anymore after people are ya is
this something that would actually get
you guys to buy that stuff because
ranting I'm I'm just know they're just
they're better looking machines than
they use it I think trying to catch up
to Apple yeah they're sort of doing it
but i'm not i'm not exactly an apple
fanboy but I'm entirely in the apple
ecosystem so me switching over to an HP
or Adele even if they're really cool
looking device yes the only thing really
see it I haven't thought about it for a
while but but recently i would say in
the last six whenever that new windows
laptop was announced which a creek which
is a great computer and that was the
first time in a very long time that I
ever not that I was going to because I
just had a new macbook air but like with
that I was ever going to consider trying
a knot macbook laptop because that you
want to maybe play games under well it's
not even that it was just designed
really well and looked cool and and like
headers and hope teachers laptop yeah
which I don't care about but whatever
but some people are into it yeah people
love that surface man right yeah so I
think it's important like you look at
the thinkpad and it's like oh my god but
I think it's important there's a lot of
people that like want to just use a
windows laptop but the idea of having a
computer that looks like a thinkpad is
horrifying to them so I think there is a
demand for this it's tough though
because again like you know I think a
lot of these companies have lost a lot
of mortgage chair two tablets and an
apple and yeah it's kind of an uphill
battle yeah they just lost me as a
customer Oh
long time ago yeah so I don't I don't
know that it's kind of like you know you
see this really pretty woman you're like
oh my god like maybe maybe I should go
up to our like I'm not sure yeah
whatever in a while yeah it's been a
while but but you never actually do
right you know she's no I'm gonna I'm
gonna I'm gonna stick with the wife I'm
sticking with the white not gonna really
no see I i I'm I've always been very
balanced when it comes to like Mac
versus PC yeah and I've always sort of
felt like you know I'm a big pc gamer so
like Mac can't even hang in that arena
it's not even a thing yeah um I mean why
egg can play games yes physically it can
blow play games I could also put on a
ballerina dress and like try you're
actually wearing one right now I'm
wearing a tutu I could try my hand like
in Lincoln Center and like dance around
there would be like who is this asshole
yeah that would that would like I would
watch it sure except I wouldn't watch
that show it would be okay if we have to
make it out but you get my point yeah uh
and the more I use but I use both every
day and you know there's a lot i like
about Windows 10 man and I yeah you
shake your head but like just the other
day nothing changed on my computer it
was on I know for an hour ago and then
it decided there's no ethernet plugged
in there wasn't an ethernet plugged in
before that either it was just a USB
internet dongle yeah and for some reason
it forgot that I had a USB internet
dongle and thought I previously had an
ethernet plugged in that I had unplugged
screw your windows yeah screw you
windows how dope does Dark Souls 3 look
it does look and run really great but we
will mention that whatever there's not
windows accomplishment that's the game
company accomplishment of course but
they're not and wasn't running on OS X
now no it was not um I do want to say
something there's really no way to SEC
with this but it's important that I get
this out Oh what are you about to get
serious with us yeah are you leaving the
show no it's about the post office I
want to make sure we get this out now
before time expires because you that
that is a UH an age-old tradition on
this program crapping on the US Post
Office yes okay um I don't know when was
last time you guys were in the US
I post do you write yeah I mean because
I do ecommerce I sell stuff on eBay and
Amazon which necessitates me going to
the poet what is it wait but what why
you sell is like why are you doing that
you know you want to know about other
businesses work like these are the UM
all kinds of stuff do you sell
everything I let you borrow no no of
course not what do you sell like tell me
like old electronics and this is gonna
be embarrassing but I'm gonna do it
anyway because I feel like this go for
today's you type lapis is a safe space
okay all right my mom's old clothing
thats dark doings not know it's not an
object wait what hey wait a minute who r
us wanted to get into the post office I
just I just threw myself under the
butter okay give some background before
they get it because when you start when
you lead with that yeah if that's the
creepiest thing ever I think it is
actually it's not it's not nearly as
green I still my mom's clothes ok it
sounds creepy now now it's great explain
yourself ok so um men's used clothing if
there's no market for sure no resale
value yeah so ever who the hell wants my
old t-shirt with holes in it right now
women's use clothing all kinds of
women's use clothing has a resalable
there's a so you all kinds of women's
clothing has resale value like like
skirts dresses blouses okay like really
nice yeah we are now I should have never
admitted no no this is very good this is
so we are enjoying this a great deal
thank you for being so transparent what
the hell was so without people buy this
and yes and what's the deal like you put
on ebay like I got an old blast here
check it out and you hold it how does it
work that would be weird it's like you
have a mannequin in your house no but
that's a great idea yeah I was gonna say
there's a creepy idea but go ahead your

of it with tags whatever I mean if it's
brady have stuff krupa fighted you have
yeah well yeah it's yeah you crawled out
of the trench there it wasn't really
hard the second I said that I was like

terrible mess these guys are gonna jump
right on wow so so you make the money
yeah yeah back to her no that's what's
nice about how she just one is because
it's mom she just like your you got kids
it's time yeah exactly so you know it's
just it's just or whatever but Russ by
all means please I'll get back okay post
office so I don't worry embarrass myself
again I don't go to the post office very
frequently but I had to because I needed
stamps because I'm mailing my wedding
invitations so congratulate thank you so
much and I you know so I go to the post
office it's the middle of the day yeah
there's probably like four or five
people in line not super crowded
whatever it's it's very casual but I
walk up to you know they have the
automated tellers for buying stamps and
get buyings postage whatever it is go to
very popular post office uh it's popular
for my neighborhood but not popular you
know it's like one o'clock in the
afternoon it's not necessarily a pop of
your time yeah and so I go up to one of
the automated towers to buy stamps i
need like 200 shares yeah um so I i buy
them it makes the noise credit card etc
everything works fine but the stamp
still coming moving along so tweets
about there we go so I guess not happy I
get in line at the post office never a
fun thing to do but again the line is
not enormous it's like four or five
people right get to the front of the
wine I'm like Hayes here's my receipt i
bought these stamps at the post office
what's the story they didn't come out i
bought these stamps at the automate our
didn't come out she's like they didn't
come out okay one second so she walks
around the counter goes through the like
glass protective screen and comes to
meet me at the automated tower where I
didn't get the stamps and she's like
this was the Machine right instead of my
guilt she's like okay wait here for 10
minutes what and I'm like no I like just
I ordered them and I heard them and so
they're in there I didn't come in and
come out and just like yeah just just
wait here for 10 minutes they'll come
out what what are they may not like them
is it is it a modem like I'm trying to
fathom what is connecting to a mother
shits gonna give me access is there a
little man in there like hand drawing
each little American flag the
perforation it's just like no it'll come
out what at this point it's been five
minutes already so I'm like looking at
my receipt like I know the time of when
I initially bought them and I'm looking
at my receding like okay this is why
people hate the book like so I wait for
five minutes that's standing there like
a jerk she goes back she's like come see
me if you don't get him five minutes
pass obviously no stamps magically
appear I wait in line again but I like
get her attention cuz I'm not a schmuck
I'm not going to stand through the whole
line I get our attention i'm like yeah
what's up so she's like gives me like
the grumpy face and give me the one
minute comes around again she's like
timeout grumpy face like oh you want
what you paid for yeah is that what
you're upset about so she can didn't
know you were supposed to wait 20
minutes for you stamps she comes out
again she she meets me at the machine
yet again she's like first of all why
did you use the machine the line wasn't
very long wrong question I'm like
irrelevant I couldn't even respond it
was such a ridiculous question like
really why would I wait in line or get
something instead I have to deal with
you why do ATMs exist on the planet it
says people don't want to wait in line
at a bank right so she's like okay um
let me try something and she hits the
machine no with her fist she hits the
top of the machine stop it and she's
like well my super now supervisors not
gonna be back for a while actually let
me try something she leaves she comes
back about four minutes later here like
a half hour
it's been in like a half hour she comes
back about five minutes later with a
woman um she's kind of like I mean she
has a Russian accent uh she's and not
happy at me I'm just trying to make sure
am this is your stamp fixer yeah i
depress the person that's gonna get you
your stand yeah go to the basement again
Helga so she come up no I'm not making
donations over a simple but I am trying
to paint a picture a word picture if you
will you know the good stuff and she she
holds up the receipt she's like this is
you I'm like yeah yeah the stamps in
come out she says nothing else she walks
up to the machine she hits it as hard as
she she like does a double fist like
pound like a wrestler heavy attack Evie
attack on the top of the machine yeah
the stamps drop out no and I'm like I
would say you did like the Fonzie move
she looks at me like death incarnate and
storms off doesn't say a word to me and
then I pick up the stamps and I'm like
okay that is clearly a backstory yeah to
that what what's that stamp machine
slept with the both of those definitely
pissed them off that's amazing that
they're so mad she turned to the woman
who was helping you before be like they
take lunch break it was essentially it
was such an awful experience and it
really did typify like why people hate
bureaucracy and the government and
government organizations because it's
like they're basically going to take the
lowest bid for whatever crappy
technology that they want to get and
that's where you end up with is like
this ancient like ATM from 1985 that
can't print properly I mean at least I
don't have to wait in line but for that
and here i will come in at the end of
the conversation and actually sing their
praises a little bit okay I not the
experience at the post office that group
has always been and will continue to
always be dog sure but the the
service the actual shipping service like
trucks delivery that stuff yeah tracking
which they always used to suck at all
that has improved a great deal not only
because it's a less volume
mayhem yes it's like letters go what is
it what is it like 49 cents these days
or nights to send a letter to Alaska
yeah i mean i don't mean to sound too
hunky-dory about it but that's still
kind of cool it's male amazing it's a
small miracle it's a mate like if you
were the size of a grain of rice how
much do you think an airplane ticket
would cost oh that's well you're getting
met like weird but you understand what
I'm saying right we just get high what
just happened I think I'm still good I
don't know I don't understand the
question millions and millions of people
on a single airplane of course it's
cheap oh okay I'm fine but built
anywhere in the country no no I'm not
I'm not mystified at how they get all
the veil on the plane and like how they
make it so cheap I get that I think from
a logistics standpoint it's amazing it's
and even like the Fed because maybe like
beta testing it for 300 years of course
but the fact that like they have this
intricate system where everything's
scanned to ya like like I know where
this what can wear this package is going
to be I know when to expect it and the
fact that like you're able to like I
don't know I know how it's done they're
always lean they're always making the
service better more efficient where I've
heard these days you can go to the post
office you don't even have to wait in
line anymore you can just get your
stamps right an automated teller works
great it works it works amazing
overnight domestic shipping to me is the
most impressive thing we do by the
country as a society need you do that
the North Korea it's like their own
bodies for like an envelope it is don't
get me wrong like whenever we get games
in write it so it the distribution Joe
is in LA or well that's what else but
yeah sure and it's over night and it's
there and it's tracked and it's like
private company I get it okay I'm just
saying you and and the Postal Service
has gotten a little better with that
kind of stuff good for them I'm just
it's de niza group it's too like I've
just in third place sure but let's get
that straight yeah it's it's in the it's
in the back yeah only wanna give it a
bronze medal I don't wanna sit at the
podium yeah but that's that um you gotta
go soon so I want to get into some
voicemail Callister yeah we're doing
voicemails today kids
was in a very long time here's the first
one uh talking about my favorite band
Nickelback you know this hey justice
Brian Seattle and I just wanted to let
you know that every time I listen to a
nickelback song I think about how much
you despise them and sometimes they even
second-guess myself before giving it a
thumbs up or like because it would piss
you off so much wow just i watch enough
it's a showing fine this is a really
dark thing to say to somebody not me
he's like I'm just gonna do this to piss
you off well what's I'm more proud of
the fact that he likes nickelback in his
and is willing to share with the world
but he has to like through the ANA new
number of the internet he gave his first
name and his city ah that's enough ah
Jeff my problem with this is that what
it what are you crapping on Nickelback
you're the first guy to do yeah right no
okay this is this is a really hard you
know the Nazis and not so good right
area this is not a new thing this is a
legacy meme joke of our show so we've
been crapping on them since 07 so you
were the erratic we have ahead of the
curve we were the first podcast to
podcast and the first podcast to podcast
hatred towards Nickelback I I would like
to get some new york times fact checkers
on that beam is it up bi guest snopes
the hell out of it you'll only be
disappointed with the results fair get
there right what else I got a convincing
tale ah Marlon our buddy from Trinidad
uh called in about Billy ocean a couple
months ago I became obsessed been with a
music video from Billy ocean great music
video called going gets tough starring
danny devito Michael Douglas and
Kathleen Turner that sounds amazing it
was very spectacular mid 80s when they
were making all those movies together I
think there's Gemma the Nile was that
yeah but that wasn't the reason that I
forget the movie it was tight attack no
it was that we thought was the other one
it wound up being Gemma the not really
yeah anyway let's listen to what our
buddy Marlin has to say here from
Trinidad hey Jeff a rough swell up
player hey Marlon the guy me that
Jeff I realize that you've become a fan
of Billy ocean but now I have one
requirement of you every time you
mention him you have to see it again
born baby ocean nuna right born in my
beautiful island and we're all still
very proud of it even though it's itself
no going back but just remember again
Trinidad in fact of its way initial all
the way to do yeah that's amazing uh so
yeah it is say it has been written so it
will always be the Trinidadian right to
correct yes absolutely ocean and I and
it makes sense because he's from an
island and he's surrounded by ocean so
there you go right kind of know where
the Billy comes from but you're not sure
a lot of goats on the eye is tobago tied
to that Trinidad Tobago I haven't
watched the Olympics recently I don't
know that's a great question hey Marlon
if you're listening but can you can you
call us on you are the only human and
you've got all this free google well I
will always said together trinidad and
tobago tobago to bet you yeah they're
always like tomorrow always said
together but only during the Olympic
right the only time in the Olympics I
don't know that's the that's one of the
tank might be like a your cap fields and
McCoys resentment between the two yeah
is there like bad blood there no cuz I
feel like Marlins the guy on the ground
there he's inside but he might be
partial to the Trinidadian side is what
I'm saying like we might not get the
clear story I think it's one eyelid it's
one place I don't know so bad at one
place look look you're you're asking a
bunch of Americans geography question
right it's just gonna get messy the
Sienna be a problem to go to a strong
suit guy it quickly time out could you
find this place on a man yeah that's
right by Iceland right up there by
Iceland it's past New Zealand I swear it
it I was looking up where the
Philippines were the other
sure I know what the Phobians I knew
like the general area there's like it
goes philly philadelphia and it without
me i wreck it right next to each other
you just keep going west in sixth grade
our teacher got the entire class to
believe that the Philippines were like
just beyond Long Island really lean
we're like that's so weird and like our
teacher because I do that it's a bit
less funny and she like pull down the
map as teachers used to do in sixth
grade Alana in the 80s and like was poor
to get some nonsense is like Montauk
it's just like yeah that's the tropical
philippines right there and we're all
like it's so close why don't we ever go
there's definitely a pool in the
teachers lounge I was like what dumb
 like this and then sounds like your
ferry that goes oh my god she's like I'm
not sure maybe uh what a dick yeah you
just found this out though how well I
how long did she keep it going oh my god
the fur 10 minutes 15 minute she's like
