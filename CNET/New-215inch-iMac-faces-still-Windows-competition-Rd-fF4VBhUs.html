today we're gonna take a look at Apple's
new 21 and a half inch iMac this is the
entry-level iMac from Apple's newly
redesigned all in one line it costs
$12.99 and it has the 21 and a half inch
screen a core i5 CPU from Intel eight
gigs of RAM and a one terabyte standard
hard drive so over the most interesting
thing about this eye Mecca is its new
design you can see here from the front
it actually looks like the old design
but when you turn it you can see it has
a very thin edge here coming out to a
rounded display here in the back now a
lot the new design there's a few new
features that are worth noting
there's an anti-glare coating here in
the screen there's also a second
microphone here designed to help make
audio a little bit better when you're
doing video calling one negative about
the new design is that you can't change
the memory yourself anymore you used to
be able to do that on the old iMac and
you can do it on the new 27 inch version
you just can't do it here in the 21 and
a half model so in terms of its physical
specs along with those new features you
also get the same area of ports we've
seen in previous IMAX there's an audio
jack here for a headphone that also
works for digital audio output there's
also an SD card slot for USB 3 ports as
well as a pair of Thunderbolt jacks for
connecting monitors or other Thunderbolt
capable devices finally there's an
Ethernet jack and of course the system
also has a tow 2.11 B G and N wireless
now for the display it has a 1920 by
1080 resolution screen as well as an IPS
panel now that means you can view the
screen from pretty much any angle
without getting distortions in color or
other image quality defects and of
course there's a previous IMAX it also
comes with apples wireless mouse and
keyboard set so in terms of its
competition this is a pretty fast
computer relative to Windows PCs in the
same price range now if you're looking
at Windows 8 on one's in the same price
range you get larger screens as well as
more inputs including HDMI in and out
which actually is pretty nice it'd be
great if this system had HDMI inputs
because then you could connect a cable
box or a game console and use it as sort
of a standalone entertainment center now
they're definitely people out there that
you either need or one OS 10 or might
just like the look of this iMac but for
those of you that are OS agnostic and
let the most Hardware for your buck I
would probably recommend looking at the
windows side of the aisle
sorry much Brown this is Apple's new 21
and a half inch iMac</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
