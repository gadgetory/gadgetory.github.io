akhtar google i/o Google's developer
conferences produced some amazing stuff
over the years today we're taking a look
at the top five memorable reveals at
Google i/o they made us take note number
five is the introduction of Google TV in
the year 2010 it was a smart TV platform
that would run on a number of set-top
boxes including the logitech revue the
idea was to bring the reel web to your
TV since this was google we all dreamed
of something that could search to find
the best video to watch at any given
time unfortunately major providers like
Hulu and ABC blocked the google TV
browser Google TV didn't quite make it
but Google eventually announced android
TV in 2014 as another attempt to be your
living room buddy android has gone
through a lot of revisions at one point
it was a version for phones and another
for tablets in 2011 google announced ice
cream sandwich would change all of that
by combining the phone version of
Android called gingerbread and honeycomb
which land on tablets and Google TV this
change would make it easier for app
developers to make one app that ran on
whatever device and it also brought some
nice tablet only features two phones
like we sizeable widgets and better
multitasking abilities who could forget
this thing it's the Nexus Q and it made
its debut in 2012 it's more memorable
because most of us reacted to it like a
confused dog the head tilt it attached
the cue to your home theater system
instream google only services to it from
an android phone oh and it costs 299
dollars reaction to the Nexus Q was so
negative that Google pretty much axed
the device instead of releasing it to
the masses and 2013 Google effectively
replaced the queue with the chromecast
which cost a whopping $35 and supported
tons of apps including non google
services number two is the introduction
of the google nexus 7 in 2012 it was
google's first tablet and at the time
android tablets just couldn't compete
with Apple's iPad until this thing hit
there were rumors of a Google tablet
swirling for months it's official
introduction by Hugo Barra at i/o showed
Google was behind Android on tablets it
started at 199
so way cheaper than the Q and would be a
great way to watch content from the
google play store at number one is the
introduction of project butter no not
really but 2012's Google i/o is full of
memorable moments including number one
because of Project Glass as a demo of
Google's wearable the company had
skydivers on a live Google hangout who
then proceeded to jump out of the plane
while live-streaming the skydivers land
out of the copper center they've got on
bikes and rode in to meet sergey brin on
stage come on skydivers blast didn't pan
out but what an introduction questions
comments any kind of feedback at all hit
me up on Twitter on that is for more top
