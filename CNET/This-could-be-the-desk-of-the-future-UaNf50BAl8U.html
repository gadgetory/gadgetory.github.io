okay okay here we go
oh all right we are here with che vuoi
co-founder and CEO of look at what I
have behind me the alt desk station this
is nothing you've ever ever seen before
I've never seen anything like this in
che first of all can you tell us when
someone looks at this how would you sum
up something like this when they when
they first see this so talking about the
alt workstation so it is the entire
environment for working in your personal
workspace what we are trying to do is
develop a much more productive
environment for people that use the
computer as their primary professional
tool we have the standing mode we have
regular sitting mode we have
collaboration mode we have our reclined
focus mode so the first thing I want to
show because this is something that a
lot of people whoa whoa whoa what's
going on here how is this glued on
what's going on here this surface is
steel we put the magnets in the
peripheral so the magnets are relatively
small so they don't create very much of
a magnetic field and you have this
control system here once you find an
area that you really like you simply set
and there's your stand up memory
position I'm done standing up but don't
standing is at my butt now so this home
button if you push and hold this home
button the machine transforms itself
into the traditional sitting I was gonna
sit there with you but that's okay
doesn't that might be a little
uncomfortable right how about free
places I'm just messing a deal I know
you are okay here we go so I'm gonna sit
down here all right here's this like
workstation that you'd have at home or I
mean at work and are you this is a
sensation like you see everything moving
and then all of a sudden like who
wouldn't want to work like this like ah
and dude it's magnets man magnets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
