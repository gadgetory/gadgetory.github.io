Amazon echo smart speaker and a new
report from Bloomberg says Apple has
begun testing it in the homes of Apple
engineers what makes Apple's
voice-activated speaker different is
that it's said to have cameras with
facial recognition that can detect your
emotions so that means soon Siri will
know if you're not smiling oh goody I
always wanted artificial intelligence to
read my feelings and see everything I do
in my home back in May CNET was first to
report that Apple Smart speaker hub
would have a facial scanning camera and
Bloomberg's report corroborates that
reportedly Apple is working on expanding
series role for the speaker so the
assistant can read off things like
emails text messages and tweets as for
the cameras well bloomberg reports it's
only in some models being tested so it
is possible it may not make the cut
Google's answer to this is called Google
home it's gonna go on sale later this
year we're expecting to get more details
about its launch at an event on October
4th meanwhile Amazon just keeps making
more echoes this month the echo with the
personal assistant Alexa made its way to
Europe
and now it comes in black and white the
smaller echo dot also now comes in both
colors and it dropped its price to $50
in the US that's it for this tech news
