spoiler spoiler spoiler clear do not
what if you don't want spoilers don't
listen
earmuffs run spoilers who's awesome no
that would spoil it
no that would also spoil it
I love the last Jedi it is so beautiful
and so different that scene where the
the ship is exceeding half Hordern plows
through it wow that's gonna be up there
as the one of the top scenes in the
whole franchise the sword fight where
they kill Snoke was pretty epic there
are parallels to the Empire Strikes Back
but it doesn't feel like the Empire
Strikes Back character Praetorian guards
so I like Ray and I like the character a
lot I really liked Kelly Marie trans
Rose because she's so hopeful the poems
annoyed me after a while
hated him before the movie hate him
after the movie you can hate him it's
fine just hate him all day
I thought Benicio del Toro as the you
know hacker you know thief Mac I did not
like Benicio Del Toro's DJ hey I'm
swindler and I like to sell things and
secrets to the Empire perhaps or the
resistance whoever pays me more Oh
Laurie Dan's character I thought Laura
Dern is the noble general who's very
complex and very deep mad that thing on
her neck kind of really distracted me
when Leia is out there in space and then
you see like the moment where she's kind
of like coming back to life in space
like did Jedi's and people that have the
force you know are they able to breathe
in space like that wasn't explained I
think not just dad I've been wanting to
see Leia use the force because I know
you know she's a Skywalker but the way
they did it with her floating in space
and we've never seen anyone floating in
space in the entire Star Wars history
that was just kind of weird
I think it's it makes sense I mean she's
she has a force she's very powerful so
I'm not surprised that she survived up
there in space fire reflect off Captain
phasma suit as they battle seeing that
they had been bleeding up to that moment
where Finn is the traitor to the
stormtroopers is finally facing off
against his boss that he seemed to never
like it was really satisfying to watch
them finally come to blows with each
other
I love the battles I mean there's no
there's nothing like Star Wars battles
in space it's what he does the best
you should be prepared to rear ank all
your favorite Star Wars movies and I do
not play that ranking game it is a
dangerous game I consider it the force
awakens part - if you like the force
awakens it goes right next to the force
awakens everything else that's up to you
you and your crazy internet threads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
