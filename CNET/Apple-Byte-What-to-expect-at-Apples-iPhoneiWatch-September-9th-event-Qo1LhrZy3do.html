welcome to the Apple bite it's all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
the week before Apple's big keynote
event in a I'm all dressed up for it now
as we get closer more pieces of the
puzzle are coming together and it looks
like Apple is finally positioning the
iPhone to be your wallet
according to Bloomberg Apple is
finalizing the deals with payment
networks banks and retailers to be the
digital wallet I've been asking for the
agreement includes Visa MasterCard and
American Express and the report says it
will be unveiled at Apple September 9th
event the touch ID fingerprint scanner
was the first piece of the puzzle and
now Russian vendor Feldon Volk has
acquired the complete logic board for
the device that specifically shows the
rumored NFC chip from company and XP
that will support Apple's push into
mobile payments and for those of you
that haven't heard me talk about this
the technology has been working
flawlessly as far back as 2005 in Japan
when I had a chance to use it at am/pm s
movie theaters and arcades now when the
right pieces are in place it's pretty
amazing
you'll also need retailers to be a part
of the equation and bank innovation
reports that department store
Nordstrom's is in talks with Apple to be
one of Apple's early merchant partners
when it unveils their new payment
platform according to Nordstrom
employees in the report the department
store chain recently upgraded its mobile
point-of-sale terminals a few weeks ago
with hardware that will allow it to work
with the most recent iPhones see it's
all coming together people and just a
little factoid Apple already has roughly
800 million global iTunes accounts and
most of them are linked with some sort
of payment information and if anyone is
really going to push the digital wallet
forward in the US Apple has the best
chance to do it now I know you want to
see more of that iPhone 6 goodness so
here's the latest video from youtuber
rosette Kidd showing what looks like one
of the best-looking assembled iPhone 6
videos we've seen so far comparing it to
the current iPhone and also showing off
details like the metallic Apple logo
the other big thing we're expecting to
see at the keynote is their vision of
the wearable or little bird I watch if
that's what they caught every major
manufa
Nature has announced something in this
space and it's the big A's turn now
according to recode Apple execs have
discussed charging around $400 for the
wearable pricing has yet to be finalized
and all reports pointed to shipping next
year it's still not for certain if they
will announce the price of the keynote
but their sources say we should expect a
range of prices for different models
including lower priced versions and if
they're thinking of $400 right now a
lower price for Apple is probably 399
all right I know some of you are going
to say fanboy right now but this is
arguably the most exciting keynote with
the most buildup I've seen since the
first iPhone in 2007 we know Apple is
doing something but we have no idea what
this I watch wearable looks like at all
we don't even know what it will do and
I'm hoping it will at least tell us the
time on top of that add on the unveiling
of the new iPhone 6 if there's any key
note where Apple can regain their mojo
and be perceived as a real leader in
innovation once again this is the
keynote now there's also some curious
happenings for the September 9th event
that will be held at the Flint Center at
De Anza College in Cupertino this is
where it all began
when Apple unveiled the first Macintosh
30 years ago the iMac was also unveiled
here and there's really a sense of
historical significance around coming
back to the Flint Center that raises the
hype up another level on top of that
this a huge three-story construction
project that's been going on for several
weeks on the DeAnza College campus with
security surrounding the secret project
now it's most likely a staging area for
media members to check out the new
products but this isn't a tiny space
it's a big boy covered in white cloth
and maybe we'll see dr. Dre and a
concert or something like that and since
we're on the topic of Apple building
stuff check out this sneak peak at
Apple's spaceship campus in Cupertino
thanks to this awesome video by youtube
user
JMC min who used a DJI phantom 2
quadcopter to capture it all it's just a
really impressive and unique perspective
of Apple's campus you really get a sense
of the scale of this thing in the
building that will really be part of
Steve Jobs as legacy alright I know some
of you are saying what no bad apples for
the leak of celebrity photos from
Apple well the big a released a
statement that it was a very targeted
attack on the usernames and passwords
and security questions for celebs like
Jennifer Lawrence Kate Upton and ariana
grande but there was actually no breach
in any of apple systems including iCloud
or Find My iPhone the biggest issue here
is Apple's really lame security
questions to get access to an account if
you know the email address things like
the name of your first pet or your
childhood nickname people can find these
things out especially if you're a
celebrity so
Apple you can start fixing that aspect
do a little more and for everyone at
home stop taking compromising pictures
of yourself and then leaving them on
your phone which reminds me
okay delete that delete that yeah
definitely delete that all right and yes
a lot of attention is on Apple but they
aren't the only ones with the product
release IKEA is releasing their 2015
catalogue Anna it's kind of amazing you
know once in a while something comes
along that changes the way we live a
device so simple and intuitive you see
it fits almost there
introducing the 2015 yet it's not a
digital book or anything it's you know I
swear I've seen something like some
Apple product that kind of looks like
that before oh well alright that's gonna
do it for this week's show it's going to
be a big big keynote in will have all
our reactions from the product
announcements next week send me your
emails to the Apple by to see Netcom or
tweet me at Brian Tong you can even do
it during the keynote I'll tweet back
when I'm not streaming around like a
girl and an usher concert which I have
never done thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
