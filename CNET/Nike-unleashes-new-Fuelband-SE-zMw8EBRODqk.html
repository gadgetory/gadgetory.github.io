cnet.com and right now we're taking a
first look at the Nike Plus FuelBand se
II now this device costs 149 and goes on
sale right now for pre-order but also
will hit the market on November 6 so
basically this device is a follow-up to
the original fuel band fitness gadget
that became really popular from Nike and
has very engaging color LED screen here
which shows your basic fuel status how
many points you have in Nikes fuel
system so Nike also says that the Nike
FuelBand se is also more water resistant
so you can take it in the shower
and will also connect to iOS devices
only just like the predecessor
unfortunately there's no Android support
at the moment so what's really
interesting about the new platform for
the Nike Plus FuelBand se is that the
new app will encourage you to get
motivated and move every hour hopefully
five minutes out of each hour and
essentially ensure that you are active
throughout the day and that will
hopefully lead to a better lifestyle and
better health other things that are nice
about this Nike FuelBand se is that it
comes in four different colors it'll
come in black a crimson color an
electric blue as well as a green sort of
hue and it's all inside the band here so
another really interesting feature that
Nike has added to its latest fuel band
is the ability to log sessions or
activities for your workouts so
essentially what you do is just press
this button hold it down and that will
kick off the recording feature so if you
go say you play tennis or go to yoga
class you can just press that button and
record that activity and log it later
also you can log your sleep by doing the
same thing hitting that button holding
down right before you go to sleep
that'll launch a session that will begin
sleep recording and when you wake up it
just hit that button again and
you have recorded how long you slept
that night so the Nike+ FuelBand se will
sync over wireless Bluetooth connection
it uses the profile version Bluetooth
4.0 and if you don't want to sync that
way you can basically unhook the hinge
and plug in to your you know Mac or PC
using a USB port that's right here on
the edge of the band so there you have
it folks we've just taken a first look
at the Nike+ FuelBand se
