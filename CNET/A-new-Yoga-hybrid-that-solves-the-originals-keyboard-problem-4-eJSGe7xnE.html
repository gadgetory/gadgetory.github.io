at the Lenovo ThinkPad yoga this is the
next step in the yoga's evolution it
started out as a consumer laptop that
folded back and became a tablet or you
could put it up in kind of a kiosk mode
the problem a lot of people had with the
original yoga and the recent yoga 2 pro
was that when you put it into a tablet
mode the keyboard is still kind of
sticking out from the back kind of
brushing against your fingers even
though the keyboard was turned off you
know it just didn't seem comfortable as
a hybrid so for the thinkpad version of
the yoga what lenovo has done is
actually fixed that problem I it starts
off regular looking thinkpad laptop of
course the screen folds like this keeps
going like this you can put it down in
sort of a kiosk mode or even a table
tent mode like this but if you go all
the way then it's kind of a seen a
slightly thick slightly heavy tablet but
on the back even though you can still
see the keyboard the keys are actually
flat now with the rest of the body it's
not so much that the keyboard for tracks
it's that there's a special little layer
and the keyboard tray that comes up and
everything becomes flush that locks the
keys in place so not only can you not
activate the keys you can still feel
them but it's still fairly level and
it's exactly the kind of thing perhaps
the yoga should have had in the first
place and the kind of thing that we wish
every yoga had but right now it's only
in this thinkpad model now you may say
to yourself why don't I just get this
one instead of let's say the yoga 2 pro
that came out late in 2013 well this
model has a slightly smaller screen it's
12.5 inch versus a 13 inch screen and it
starts off at 1366 x 768 for your screen
resolution we've actually got an
upgraded 1920 x 1080 model that's more
expensive but you can't get that really
big awesome 3200 x 1800 screen that
comes in even the stock yoga 2 pro
models so there's some trade-off there
of course you get the slightly you know
less hip-looking think pan design you
still have that little red numbing in
the middle so if you want something as a
little more coffee shop friendly I still
like the yoga 2 and the yoga 2 pro
better i'm dan ackerman that is the
Lenovo ThinkPad yoga
