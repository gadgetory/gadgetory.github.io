committed major Japanese maker when it
comes to sports cars Toyota went off on
their long humorless period only
recently fixed
you've got hon it's canceled their
beautiful s2000 because it was too non
sober Subaru they basically make
Pendelton shirts on wheels until very
recently but the whole time Nissan's
been making the Z since 1969 let's drive
this six generation sample the 2013 and
370z and check the tatters now the Z
hasn't always been a car to celebrate
there were the great early years then
kind of the disco or Star Trek years
later came the punchy years but now
we're on to this 6th gen car that I
think has the most spiritual
relationship to the original Z quite a
different vehicle in the numbers though
2.2 times more horsepower than the
original car with just one point four
times more weight yeah it's quite a bit
faster spot the 2013 by the way by a
revised face and LED running lights
at the very least of the see you're
going to have am/fm CD and aux jack
pretty basic stuff if you don't try a
little bit you can get one of these cars
like it was made in 1995 luckily our car
is loaded up we have the Touring package
which along with the nav package brings
you all the toys the navigation we've
seen before I don't see anything very
different here in terms of this Nissan
interface it's old its tired but it's
functional and at least the colors kind
of match the colors of the instruments I
guess that's a win now if you don't load
this car up with at least a Touring
package you don't get Bluetooth
hands-free or bluetooth streaming that's
kind of a shocker the Touring package
also brings in Bose audio that's going
to take you from four speakers to six
speakers Bose processing and amps and
two powered subs probably overkill for a
car this size but you can't complain
about the thump now navigation is
separate on top of touring you've got to
have a Touring level car to even option
that once you do you get the nav traffic
whether the rear-view camera even with
the manual by the way but no around view
camera which Nissan Infiniti like you
just get a backup camera in a Z and that
nav package brings you the bluetooth
streaming iPod plus USB here in the
console and DVD playback here in the
slide
all right folks now in the front of your
Z you're gonna find the classic the
bread-and-butter Nissan Motor one of
their vq family v sixes they've been
making a living on these since 1994 and
for good reason
it's a great v6 this one is a 3.7 liter
no direct injection by the way and
naturally aspirated kind of an
old-school engine at this point but good
numbers 332 horse 270 foot-pounds of
torque
gets this 3,300 pound sports car to 60
in about 5.2 it's not screwing around
but deliver is kind of eat mpg for
today's standards 1826 let's go for a
ride
now the first thing you notice driving
the Z is it is not a dainty car all the
inputs to clutch the transmission
engagement the suspension response even
the steering are kind of heavy
mechanical nicely sort of weighted and
it feels like you're really driving a
machine as opposed to controlling a
computerized thing 6-speed manual in
this car which I like a lot great clutch
and actuation on the gearbox again feels
kind of old-school racecar C this S mode
button down here if I engage that I get
an S alongside the gear indicator and
now I've got rev matching when I put the
clutch in the computer automatically
sets the engine RPMs to match perfectly
with the flywheel so I can just dump the
clutch and step on and I'm not going to
have any weird hiccups it's kind of
training wheels though if you really
enjoy driving a car like this you know
how to do that or something close to it
so I think it's kind of a gimmick the
automatic by the way is a 7-speed I'm
sure it's a lovely automatic but it
doesn't make sense in this car this is
one of the last sort of really visceral
sports cars out there even though it's
not as light as I would like it to be so
that brings up an interesting point
when will Nissan really revise this
powertrain go to a smaller displacement
direct injection likely turbocharged
engine to take some weight off the nose
and to give me more shall we say violent
response to the throttle there's plenty
of power here but this car doesn't come
at you in a way that is really
outrageous and I think their market
would like that
another price of twenty thirteen Z coupe
base is about thirty three nine
delivered with almost nothing in it to
go seen that style you first want to
make sure you buy one in the Touring
level trim that gets your Bose satellite
radio Bluetooth hands-free and power
leather seats on top of that you want to
look at the navigation package nav
bluetooth streaming DVD rear camera USB
and iPod 2154 that automatic is 1,300
you're not going to do that so seen that
style about forty thousand seven and
you're on the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
