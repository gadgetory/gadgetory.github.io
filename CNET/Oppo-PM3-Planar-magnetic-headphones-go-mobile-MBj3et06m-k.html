pm3
a well designed over your closed back
headphone that sounds impressive for
$400 what's special about it is that it
features Planner magnetic drivers which
are usually found in even higher-end
open-back headphones open-back models
generally offer more open airy sound but
they also leak sound which makes them
less than ideal for using in the
presence of other people the PM 3 is a
sturdily built headphone that has
fleshly padded ear cups and is
comfortable to wear it's a tad heavy at
320 grams and it does fit a little
snugly so it helps to break it in a bit
but it is lightweight for a planter
magnetic headphone and much easier to
drive in other words it works just fine
with your mobile phone the headphone
comes with a 3 meter cable that
terminates in a 3.5 millimeter plug a
nice protective carrying case finished
in denim and a screw-on 6.3 5 millimeter
adapter for home stereos if you order
the headphones through Apple's website
you can select a bonus cable free that
has an integrated remote and microphone
for either Apple or Android devices the
PM 3 is one of those headphones that
makes most recording sound better than
you thought they could
it sounds rich but delivers plenty of
detail while its fuller in the bass and
sweeter in the treble that's strictly
neutral that isn't a bad thing if you
listen to a lot of less than pristine
sounding mp3s
everything goes down nice and easy but
when you play high-res music the pm3
sound really comes alive overall the PM
3 consistently sounded warmer and richer
than other top headphones which we
appreciate it
however if you crave a brighter more
detailed presentation the PM 3 may not
be the right choice there's no doubt
it's an impressive headphone but just
how impressive you think it is will
depend on your listening taste I'm David
Carr lightfrom cnet.com and that's the
oppo PM free headphones thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
