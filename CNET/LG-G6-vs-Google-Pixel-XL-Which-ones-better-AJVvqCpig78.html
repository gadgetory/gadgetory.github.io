Galaxy s8 isn't doing it for you there
are other great androids to consider
like the LG G 6 and Google pixel XL to
help decide which one is for you we
consider the phones in five different
categories to see which one is better
the elegant pixel and its glass shade is
a differentiator the really blue variant
is particularly eye catching if you can
get it that is the g6 is LG's best
looking phone to date it's barely there
bezels allow it to have a bigger display
while remaining physically smaller than
the XL but the g6 is ace in the hole is
its water resistance this durability
against accidental dunks or splashes is
a big benefit the winner if it were
purely aesthetics I'd give it to the
pixel but water resistance gives the g6
the ultimate leg up the g6 can take
wide-angle photos with a back and front
cameras meaning you could fit more
content in each frame the preloaded
square camera app also edits neat photos
that's perfect for Instagram aside from
a lens blur mode the pixel doesn't have
many camera tricks but then again it
doesn't need to considering it has a
fantastic camera especially in dim
lighting it takes sharper selfies and
record steadier video I'll be it with a
floating drone mic quality while the G
fixes wide-angle feature has its uses I
take the pixels low-light prowess over
that any day both phones are equipped
with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 1
chipset and on paper they're benchmarks
for neck-and-neck real-life usage was
also on par with one another and both
were fast when it came to launching apps
browsing the web etc as for battery
during our test for continuous video
playback on airplane mode the g6 clocked
in 13 hours and 21 minutes while the
pixel lasted 13 hours and 49 minutes the
pixel XL wins this round but only barely
due to its slightly longer battery test
time with both handsets running Android
7.0 and Google assistant built in not
much differentiate the g6 and pixel in
terms of software the winner here is
both and by both I mean neither since
they both have unexcited software
features
while both our premium phones the g6 is
consistently less expensive across
different countries and carriers barring
any crazy pixel deal I'm not aware of
the g6 is a better value for now
tallying up the score we have a Thai
hashtag sorry not sorry
hey are you surprised at least we didn't
say something cheesy like the true
winner here is you the consumer or
whatever
look if money were no object and I
considered both in a vacuum the pixels
camera and battery make it objectively
the better phone but the g6 is lower
price
not to mention water-resistant give it a
big boost ultimately a lot of what makes
a phone call M quote better depends on
you your budget and your priorities the
LG G 6 and Google pixel XL are grade a
phone whatever you go with you're
guaranteed to be satisfied</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
