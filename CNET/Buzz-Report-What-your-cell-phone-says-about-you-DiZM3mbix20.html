welcome to the buzz reports first the
gadget of the week it's the sandisk
sansa connect a media player with Wi-Fi
not the first but perhaps the first that
makes any sense you can wirelessly share
songs between sansa connects but most
importantly grab new music wirelessly
from a yahoo store without a computer
now the music gremlin and Microsoft Zune
both made a run at this concept but
tripped on their little LCD faces for
the most part so why are the sharing and
downloading for gig expandable capacity
and doesn't come in brown the Holy
Trinity and 250 bucks is not a bad price
for the latest ipod killer that won't be
now the news Northern California's
utility PG&amp;amp;E theorized a new way to use
a hybrid car they say plug it in during
the night when juice is cheap and then
sell that stored electricity back to
PG&amp;amp;E at a higher price the next day hmm
well these masochists were the same
folks who gave Silicon Valley the
rolling blackout so we just kind of
tolerate them like a crazy uncle an idea
I did like though was to use your hybrid
car to power your house during
electrical outages now tomorrow's
plug-in hybrids could actually do that
yeah they laugh when you bought that
little ugly Prius but they'll be
crawling up your driveway like a
supplicant when the big one hits and
you're the only folks on the block who
aren't eating cold soup served up with
stone tools an odd piece of pop
psychology crossed my desk this week
Nielsen Media Research claims they can
determine your personality based on the
brand of cell phone you own nokia for
example means your family minded
probably a middle-aged manager
health-conscious huh that's the life of
the party Motorola means fashion
conscious under 24 fun seeker yeah
they're the ones whose calls you always
have to overhear my treo 700p wasn't on
the list but I can tell them what it
means enjoy
dark blurry photos likes his tech bulky
and devoted to dying brands then there's
my producers phone also a motorola but
with a different motorola message it
says uses phone as a hammer doesn't know
there are new models since the first
gulf war really needs a raise remember
how great 411 information was before the
cellphone era when you would talk to a
human not have to repeat your request
seven times and not pay a buck and a
quarter for the privilege but google may
have just revived the good old days of
411 new service 800 goog 411 is a
directory assistance that is typically
google it works the voice recognition is
quite natural it'll connect you or say
the number or text it to you and it's
free check it out calls recorded for
quality experimental san francisco
california california what business
category cnet networks cnet networks on
second street text message now my only
concern is that disclaimer did you hear
it not may be recorded but will be
recorded period yep it's the world's
biggest most irresistible voluntary
wiretap but go ahead and use it what's
the worst that can happen you get ruled
out of running for office for life it's
not so bad i'm brian cooley this has
been the buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
