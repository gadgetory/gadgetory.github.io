looking for a headphone that sounds
equally well at home as it does on the
go this is a good bet I'm Justin with
CNET and this is a first look at the
sonorous 3 headphones from final audio
design you might not have heard of final
audio designed before but that's because
they're a relatively niche brand from
Japan known for the 10 their flagship
audiophile / ear headphone that costs 5
grand
now even they know that price eliminates
a lot of customers so final recently
came out with a sonorous 3 which is the
budget-friendly alternative to the 10 it
has the same attention to detail and a
similar sound but for a lot less money
instead of the aluminum and gold leaf
trim that you see on the 10 the 3 goes
for ABS plastic for the ear cup housing
and rail connection but that's not to
say that this doesn't feel like a
luxurious headphone the stainless steel
rails and the plush leather covering the
headband and the cups are premium
quality and even though they're a bit
heavier than others their cushion to
weight ratio really makes them feel
comfortable for long-term listening so
in terms of accessories you get a
detachable wide cable that locks into
place by twisting each side 90 degrees
I'm a little disappointed though that
the final doesn't include a carrying
case to protect it on the go or a second
cable with smart phone controls but
those are minor complaints and really
not that big of a deal so how do they
sound
well they deliver an impressive amount
of power even from a mobile device with
plenty of low-end texture and detail
that'll really make you appreciate your
lossless tracks but they also sound
great using Spotify on a portable music
player too with plenty of open space for
the titanium diaphragm to move around
the headphones have a very open
soundstage that really takes the music
out of your head and simulates the audio
qualities of a virtual live performance
so you can check out all the details of
this headphone in my full review on CNET
but that's gonna do it for this video
you just took a first look at the final
audio design so ngerous 3 headphones
