essential settings first let's get
something really important out of the
way keeping track of your Mac if it ever
falls out of your grasp or you leave it
in the library under some drunken
fatigue there is an easy setting that
will let you find out exactly where you
left it it's a good idea to enable find
my Mac like Find My iPhone the free
service lets you locate your missing Mac
from any other device by default it's
disabled so to turn it on head to System
Preferences then iCloud and check the
box next to find my Mac give it

your Mac okay with that safeguard in
place let's enable a few small but
important features that will make
getting around your Mac a lot easier for
starters enable tap to drag go to
preferences then accessibility settings
then head over to Mouse and trackpad

directly on your desktop for quick
access to do this go to the finder menu
and choose preferences then to the
general tab and use these checkboxes to
pick the items that will appear on your
desktop and one more setting you'll be
much more relaxed enabling battery
percentage there is no use trying to
figure out how much battery is left
based on this symbol so instead click
the battery symbol and head down to show
percentage

exactly how much power you have love now
if you want to be really productive on
your Mac get to know the gestures Apple
calls the trackpad the Magic Trackpad
for a reason it can do a lot more than
just Mouse around so for instance you
can use two fingers up or down to scroll
on any page to zoom double tap with two
fingers or use the familiar pinch to
zoom to navigate swipe left or right
with two fingers and to view all open
apps swipe down with three fingers and
pinch out with your thumb and three
fingers to reveal the desktop at any
point
finally if you have spaces or full
screen apps open use three fingers to
navigate between them now that you have
those essential tips down you're one
step closer to mastering your Mac
