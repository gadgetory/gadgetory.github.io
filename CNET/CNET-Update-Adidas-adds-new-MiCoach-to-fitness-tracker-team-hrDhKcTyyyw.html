Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update there's a new fitness tracking
gadget hitting the market adidas
unveiled the miCoach fit smart wristband
it measures your heart rate as you
exercise and with the accelerometer it
contracts steps distance speed and pace
it goes on sale August 15th around the
world for $200
now this isn't like other lifestyle
tracking bands that you wear all day
it's really just for tracking your
workout it comes in black and white and
the battery lasts 10 hours on a full
charge the display can light up in
different colors to show you how intense
your workout is and that can encourage
you to slow down or speed up and you
also get some vibration feedback this
data syncs up with your smartphone using
an app called the my coach train and run
that gives you coaching feedback
pre-planned workouts and weekly goals
it also supports 11 languages adidas has
been making smart fitness tracking
devices for years but the most recent
gadget the 2013 my coach smart run that
has more features like a GPS and a
touchscreen but it costs twice as much
as this new fit smart band if you need
something more than a watch to motivate
you to get fit there's a brand new app
that turns fitness tracking into a
competitive role-playing game the free
app is called fit RPG it's for ios and
android but you need a Fitbit to play it
pulls in the step and the sleep data
from a fitbit and then it turns your
activity into points so you can battle
friends or go on quests the creators are
working to make their apps sync with
other types of fitness trackers and
there's another type of wristband that's
making news but instead of tracking
Fitness it tracks your children LG
announced a new GPS bracelet for kids
it's called the LG kisaan it's
water-resistant it comes in bright
colors and it has fun covers with hello
kitty and that way you'll be distracted
from the fact that these bracelets are
massively huge on these little kids
wrists it's for preschool and primary
school children and parents can track
the bracelets location with GPS and why
by and get notifications on their
smartphone or tablet
LG didn't give a price but you can bet
it won't come cheap it'll be available
later this year the kids on also has a
built-in direct call button with a
microphone so with one push of a button
you can call a parent or guardian the
battery said to last a day and a half on
one charge LG isn't the first to come
out with kid trackers some come in other
designs like Trax that's a small clip-on
square that can be put in a backpack or
a jacket or if you don't have a kid you
could attach it to your dog's collar
that's your tech news update you can get
