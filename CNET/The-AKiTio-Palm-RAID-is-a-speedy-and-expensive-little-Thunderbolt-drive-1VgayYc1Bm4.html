read dry foam Ocotillo now palm be good
fit while my palm quite small I mean the
drive that is not my part of my palm
spot
red because the dry support rate now red
stand for redundant array of independent
disks and in this case the driver can
combine two internal drive into one
single volume for either very fast speed
in rate zero or better DISA Curie in
rate one so well two internal drive you
may ask well on the inside let me show
you all right here you go as you can see
that's not one but two M Saracens to
drive in here now M Sarah is a new
standard that is smaller than the
traditional 2.5 inch 9 is right here and
that allows the palm rate to remain
compact now each of these two drive here
has 256 gigabyte and that means the palm
bread had a total of 512 gigabyte the
Palmer here come with the all aluminum
casing which is very sturdy and so lit
and over here it has a built-in football
cable I like this design because partly
is very convenient just take out the
cable and you are ready now performance
wise this drive here can be really fast
fast and cutter fast depending on the
rate setup you using so basically with
the rate zero which is the default it
can be as fast as close to 500 megabyte
per second in rate speed but in red one
it can be as kind of slow as about 90
megabyte per second in grid and right
combo speed so basically if you want
something really fast in grid speed and
compact easy to use this is a good drive
to have as long as you are rich that's
right
because very expensive costing close to
$600 and it includes only a short one
year warranty so beware now for more
this one here check out my full review
as cnet.com ok now the main reason why I
like this design big car
see with the built-in cable you can
either lose the whole thing which is set
but you cannot lose just the cable which
is annoying and I would rather see you
sad they don't know as long as you are
not Illinois and set at the same time
and that's because I'm don't know who
always makes you happy and this has been
the first look at the harm rate drive
from ocotillo are you happy now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
