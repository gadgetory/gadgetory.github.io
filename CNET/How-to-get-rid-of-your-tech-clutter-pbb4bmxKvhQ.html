invading your space and holding your
peace of mind hostage very conda's
best-selling book the life-changing
magic of tidying up teaches the connery
method a technique that guides you in
getting rid of clutter by discarding
anything your life that doesn't serve a
purpose or spark joy after slightly
adjusting the technique I easily applied
it to the tech I own and to illustrate
the point I gathered some stuff from
around the cement office to recreate a
home so by following these steps you can
clear your tech clutter to first start
by visualizing your destination look
around your place few dusty old DVDs
take up most of your shelf space have
hell of boxes overflowing with cords if
you want your living room to be your
family's favorite hangout spot it'll be
easier to get rid of the stuff taking up
your space once you've decided to tidy
try to do it in a day or a weekend now
this is the fun part gather all of your
tech into one big pile or you know like
one general area then by category place
them into smaller piles
go to each separate pile and hold every
item if it has a purpose or makes you
feel some type of way put it in a keep
pile if it doesn't put it in a discard
pile the more you do this the easier it
becomes to decipher what to keep and
what to get rid of if you're keeping
things you think you'll use again
chances are you won't just dump it don't
feel bad about letting go either at one
point that device brought you joy be
grateful for the happiness it brought
into your life and let it go without
guilt after you wipe all of your gear of
any personal information decide if it
can make someone else happy if that's
the case donate or sell it if not please
make sure to recycle it properly
everything you keep should be easy to
find and put back the konmari method
suggests using shoeboxes to easily
organize things and I thought they also
worked well for things like cables hard
drives and other small items Marie Kondo
suggests that if you follow her
instructions to a tee you'll never go
back to your messy ways now I don't know
about all that but I do know my home has
never been cleaner
my tech never tidier both my real home
and this fake living room studio home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
