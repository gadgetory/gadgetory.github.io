is the Cree 100 watt replacement LED
this is a bulb that puts out 1600 lumens
worth of light from a power draw of just
18 watts that puts this bulb right under
90 lumens per watt which is very good
but not the best you can get we've seen
other competitors from GE and utility
tech get as high as 100 lumens per watt
and you don't have to pay dramatically
more for that like other creel edie's
this bulb glows at a nice yellowy 2700 K
that's pretty common of what you'll see
in the market these days but Cree also
offers a 5000 K daylight variety that
glows at a hotter whiter kind of whitish
blue light it's a nice option to have
not every brand offers that I was also
impressed with Curry's dimming
performance it worked fine on every
dimmer we tested didn't flickered and
buzz I think if you use dimmers in your
home you'll like this bulb quite a bit
all in all there's a lot to like about
this bulb I think it's a very good value
at twenty dollars just a few cents shy
of twenty dollars that's the same
approach that we took with its 40 and 60
watt replacements getting them down
below 10 dollars trying to break a price
barrier to stand out in the market and I
think it's a good buy if you need
something with a little bit of extra
brightness that said there are other
competitors that do a very good job - I
was very impressed with GES 100 watt
replacement this is a dollar more than
Crees bulb and it's more efficient plus
it has the same 10-year warranty that we
like about pre bulbs in my mind the cree
bulb finishes in a near virtual tie with
GE they're both very strong values they
both offer good efficiency and nice
warranties they cost about the same
really kind of comes down to where you
shop the cree bulb sells at Home Depot
or has GE sells at walmart and Sam's
Club so if you shop at Walmart feel free
to get the GE bulb if you're a home
depot shopper feel free to go with cree
can't go wrong either way thanks for
watching check out my full review at
