so what's in the box well we've got one
here there are three different designs
and three different types of boxes but
this is the Apple watch steel version so
it's that mid-range one and to compare
the size we've got an iPhone six-plus
just let you know the size we're dealing
with here it's kind of like the original
iPod boxing it's dense it's a big box
they want you to make you feel like
you've got a little extra here if you
open it up inside this kind of looks
like a router or a charger this is a big
plastic jewelry box and this contains
the watch so Huggle keepsake or a
storage box if you need that inside I
had to sort of stage this because our
review unit was actually unboxed when we
set it up we had to do that so I'm
showing you what it would look like kind
of inside is the steel watch is a 42
millimeter with the link band and it's
set up kind of like a watch you buy the
jewellery store and then underneath you
got all the Apple stuff here you've got
a little bit of documentation also
you've got a little pouch to hold extra
links that you can pop out of here to
size it and then at the bottom you've
got your charger looks like an iPhone
charger here for the plug and then
you've got this magnetic inductive puck
and it's actually a pretty long cable
this feels longer than an iPhone charger
you could run this I don't know all the
way across a room super long and it
attaches very easily at the bottom so
there you go and scout will passcode if
you're not set up at the phone that's
what the Apple watch looks like out of
the box I am Scott Stein stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
