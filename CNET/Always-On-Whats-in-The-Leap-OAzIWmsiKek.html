things are a lot more interesting
different actions like you know zoom in
zoom out rotate left for rotate right
tilt up till town can all really just be
one action this is David holes one of
the co-creators of the leap a small
rectangular device with the humble goal
of revolutionising how we interact with
our computers my face during David's
demo says it all it is mind-blowing you
look like a wizard you actually look a
lot like a wizard by of course and we
still like to do simple things as well
so in this case we're sort of doing a
normal touch normal touch application
and our software is not actually
communicating to this program directly
what it's doing is this time the
computer ok we have a touch screen and
here I'm actually touching the screen
right now I'm touching it there or there
so we can get really nice backwards
compatibility with you know things like
Windows 8 and all that new sort of
tablet stuff come into the computer so
that's kind of fun that's very clever
the leap became a geek sensation when
it's teaser demo on YouTube showcased
everything the gadget could do the leap
device will initially support Windows
and Mac and then Linux soon after the
company plans to ship in February 2013
for seventy dollars now that may sound
like a lot but it's less than some
precision gaming mice can cost this
device is part of a revolution in the
idea of input if the mouse changed
everything you can assume that the next
user interface is really all about the
user like Google's Project Glass which
would let you wear a device and share
moments as you're living them and then
there's Microsoft's Kinect the motion
technology that arguably started the
body control Trent previous connect
recently got expanded voice controls for
gameplay and menu selection so with you
know connect people have gotten used to
the idea of using your whole body or big
arm gestures are you talking about a
much more precise interaction absolutely
so we think that if this is going to be
a genuinely better way for people to
interact with computers then they have
to be very precise subtle nuanced
movements interactions and that way you
have all that power and this feeling of
connected
which we want to achieve but you don't
get tired so far the biggest question
about the leap is what's the tech inside
I was determined to find out so I know
you guys have been famously cagey about
the technology but I wouldn't I wouldn't
be doing my job if I didn't grab you by
the shoulders and ask you what now well
at the end of the day it's based on a
fundamentally new approach to motion
sensing it's never been used before in
academia or commercially totally what's
in there though odd it's it's Michael
please are you talking right now it's a
very technical problems obviously but it
tell me how a lot of technical know-how
like I said it's a fundamentally new
approach that's never been used before
okay so maybe like lidar though that one
people will find out soon enough I'm
sure that as soon as we as soon as start
shipping these in February people will
be ripping those boxes opens not not
light are not structured light really
nothing nothing that most people are
guessing I only have one question what
in there well some magical dust it
really is fundamentally new and it's
really exciting to us because we're at
essentially the very first stage of
what's going to be decades of innovation
and improvement on the snow bridge
there's there's there's plenty of room
to grow and the leaf is only going to
get better over time maybe I'm like
rotating wall booth even though the guts
are still a mystery the company says the
leap is for everyone they're working
with third-party developers for all
kinds of uses twenty-six thousand or
more developers have applied to create
content for the light expect an app
store that could let specialized users
like engineers use the leap to build 3d
models of cars or scientists who might
want to visualize complex protein
structures and of course the app store
will include important apps for you and
night you can I mean the possibilities
to man that's which I'm sure you know
if I have this and a simple piece of
software in a 3d printer like I own the
world yeah go ahead mostly out of the
air 3d print it bring it up behind you
and you got it boom I don't lose it
bloom your wizard yeah you can will
things into reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
