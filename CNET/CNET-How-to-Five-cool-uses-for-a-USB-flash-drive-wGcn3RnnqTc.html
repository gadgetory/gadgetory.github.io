have a USB flash drive it's probably
because at some point you needed a way
to carry your files and documents around
with you or if you're like me you have a
drawer full of drives you got from
marketers at conventions and events and
at the most basic level flash drives are
good for storing anything from documents
to photos and music but there are
actually a bunch of other cool ways you
can use these little guys and today I'll
show you a few of my favorites the
secret agent in all of us will love this
first trick which lets you use your USB
Drive to lock and unlock your computer
with the free program called predator
you can turn your drive into a key that
keeps your computer unlocked when it's
plugged in but when you remove it your
computer locks down and will deny access
to anyone who doesn't have the USB Drive
or your unique password more portable
than your tablet or smartphone your USB
Drive can run apps too you can carry
around programs like Firefox Chrome and
OpenOffice and use your drive to run
them on any computer just download the
portable apps platform from
portableapps.com to get started once you
get the software on your drive you'll be
able to choose which apps you want to
install on it there are many to choose
from like games browsers and a bunch of
useful utilities if you get hit with the
virus that renders your system useless
you can use a USB Drive to get yourself
up and running a gun first go to avg
comm on another computer and load the
avg rescue CD software onto the USB
drive then plug it into the crippled pc
avg will scan your computer for malware
and hopefully get you back to work in no
time with Windows 8 on the horizon you
might be wondering what's in store for
Microsoft's next operating system well
you can check out Windows 8 without
overriding your current operating system
by booting it from your USB flash drive
that way you can test drive Windows 8
and go back to your current operating
system whenever
you want there are some requirements and
a few semi advanced steps so check out
Seth Rosenblatt's complete instructions
in this how to video on CNET TV and of
course if all you want to do is use this
thing for storing data don't forget to
encrypt it especially if you have
top-secret information on your drive
TrueCrypt is a free program that will
encrypt or scramble the data of your USB
Drive and protect it with a secure
password only you know so if you lose
this flash drive your information will
remain secure so there you have it five
cool new uses for a USB flash drive to
find more detailed instructions for all
the ideas I mentioned head on over to
how to cnet.com and tweet me if you have
any ideas we missed for CNET I'm Sharon
