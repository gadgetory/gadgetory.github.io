wants to be the place you go to sell
your used stuff and to get you hooked
the mobile app now has a shopping icon
on the navigation bar that will take you
into a section called a marketplace it's
a place to sell all sorts of things
furniture clothes even cars and Facebook
does not take a cut of the sale well at
least not yet you may be thinking wait
this isn't new you could sell your stuff
on Facebook before and yes you are
correct Facebook originally launched
marketplace as an online classified
section in 2007 but that fizzled out
later on Facebook made it so you had to
join a special group for buying and
selling and you needed approval from the
group to join now with this new
marketplace section you do not need
approval to start listing things for
sale but with the new open marketplace
there's no one to protect you from scams
so buyer beware if you want to buy
something you'll have to arrange the
pickup and how you'll pay through
private messages with the seller there
are some restrictions you cannot sell
animals guns or alcohol but not only is
Facebook becoming a challenger to ebay
and craigslist it's also going against
this new surgeon these garage sale type
apps that let you post up for sale to
others in your neighborhood there's
offer up Yertle let go and close five
well close five is owned by ebay so even
eBay is trying to outdo ebay but of
course Facebook is the only one with 1.7
billion users that's it for the seg news
update I'm Bridget Carey you can stay on
