manager are now fixed security
researcher Matthias Carlson found a flaw
in the password manager LastPass what he
found was a bug that allowed him to get
passwords due to last passes autofill
function when you use the LastPass you
have an option for the extension to
automatically fill out your credentials
Carlson found that LastPass would look
at only part of a web address to
determine whether to fill out forms so
he tested it sure enough that top-level
URL did not determine whether the last
password autofill information the
password manager could be fooled if a
URL included other language in short a
last fast user could have their
information compromised by visiting a
malicious site if they weren't paying
attention to the address bar the
researcher reported this at last pass
and the issue was fixed in under a day
LastPass says that all browser clients
were updated and its users do not to do
anything to be protected Carlson
received a bug bounty of 1000 dollars
many companies reward people for
reporting bugs
for example google says it typically
pays from $500 to $100,000 for certain
bug reports related to its browser
chrome speaking of Google another bug
was found by a Google security team
researcher related to last passes
Firefox add-on this flaw could allow
remote control of a user's LastPass
account the company has already pushed a
fix to users if you use Firefox and you
want to check if your updated you can go
to LastPass calm slash LastPass FFX and
a word of general advice pay attention
to addresses in your browser that's it
