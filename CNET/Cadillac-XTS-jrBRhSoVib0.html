stretched the CTS every direction it
possibly can sedan coupe wagon v of all
the above now they've got to work on the
other end of the business the five
series or e class competitor and that's
what they're putting a bullet in the
head of the STS and the DTS and bringing
out this guy the XTS they talk about it
having a lot of room for grandpas let's
face it there still is an older demo
that loves Cadillacs in fact the cars
this is replacing we're almost a third
of their sales up until 2008-2009 the
automotive washout so it's not a sector
they can just walk away from this guy's
got exceptional rear seat legroom they
say good space all around but notice how
it doesn't print big it just prints more
substantial instead of the cars it's
replacing now under the hood Zaki story
we've got a 3.6 liter direct-injected v6
giving you 300 horsepower and 1727 or
1728 depending on the drive line as your
EPA MPG the technology is interesting
here they have cast in the exhaust
manifold as part of the head that does
two things it lets them say about 12
pounds on the engine and in a v6 it's
aluminum that's a significant savings it
also lets them optimize the exhaust flow
to get more power and better scavenging
out of the thing more efficiency and
it's going to lead them to fewer places
with a thinking break if you don't have
a manifold bolted anywhere that place
where it bolts up can't leak around the
bolts in the gasket and all of that so
they say they get several wins out of
that design notice this is going to be
the biggest Cadillac passenger car in
the line yet without a v8 option though
I'm sure that'll come later in the
v-series this car is also going to boast
the new Cadillac cue system the new
Cadillac user experience it's got a
screen that no longer pops up needlessly
like it does on current Cadillacs it's
much bigger it has a ribbon at the
bottom and a ribbon at the top that
steel from both smart phone and personal
computer practice also it's got a
proximity sensor so what's on the screen
will change as your hand gets near it
readying itself for control input same
thing goes for the instrument panel
about 12 inches across all LCD on a dial
in the stack
this guy hits the market in the spring
of 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
