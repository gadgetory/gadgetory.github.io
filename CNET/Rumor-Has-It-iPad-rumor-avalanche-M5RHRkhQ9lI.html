has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors you can vote
on what you think about the rumors too
in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week Google might
give a boost to its Google search
results and it's time to talk about ipad
rumors sorry let's get started first up
as part of Google's quest to more
tightly integrated services the company
might be experimenting with how music
videos appear in Google search results
according to the blog google operating
system the top search result for a music
video would be a larger preview of the
video itself in the style of a google
now card plus it'll have additional info
such as the artist's name song title
album name and the year the song was
released it's unclear though if you'd be
able to watch the video right there or
if it would take you to YouTube's actual
page as it does now this new way of
surfacing videos would save you about
five seconds so I guess that's good I
don't know when I fall into a YouTube
black hole I just look for Jolene cover
videos on YouTube itself rather than
through google search but I guess that
makes me old-fashioned I mean maybe
looking for that song it all makes me
old-fashioned anyway let's move on right
now it's highly likely that we'll be
getting a new iPad and iPad Mini soon
which could only mean one thing the iPad
rumors are heating up here's a roundup
of some of the rumors that have been
swirling around lately the latest
probably most important rumor suggests
that the ipad event will take place
october 15th so mark your calendars but
do it in pencil of course leaked videos
from the french text cite nowhere else
show what could be the next iPad Mini
now in a space grey color no thanks I'd
rather have the solid gold color
according to pictures posted by Sonny
Dickson the fifth-generation iPad is
pretty similar to the current design of
the ipad mini the case is narrower than
the ipad 4 has thinner bezels and has
edges that are a bit more rounded KGI
Securities analyst ming-chi kuo says
that the next iPad will be about fifteen
percent thinner
and twenty-five percent lighter than the
ipad 4 also a rumor that keeps popping
up and then getting shot down is that
Apple is going to release a larger 13
inch iPad although the company is
reportedly testing such a behemoth we
wouldn't be seeing one until at least
2014 what do you guys think will the
iPad Mini come in different colors like
the iPhone 5s will the iPad 5 be
narrower lighter and thinner than the
ipad 4 leave a comment and vote in our
