revamp the latest addition is called Sky
Q and right now we're going to take a
look at the new interface so that you
can see what you expect when you use a
new service let's check it out
so first let's take a look at the main
TV Guide because this is really the
bread and butter of the service this is
what you guys be seeing the most so as
you can see it's been given this iPad
esque redesign so now instead of tabs
across the top like old school sky you
now get categories sorted into columns
that stack over on the left side of the
screen it looks a lot more modern and it
feels very fresh let's take a look at
the new remote so this home button here
calls up that TV Guide you navigate
using this touch sensitive pad here now
this is quite clever because a quick
directional swipe moves you one row down
or up or left or right but if you slide
and hold
it'll keep moving on-screen so that
makes it easier to quickly move a long
way through menus basically everything
has been given a fresh coat of paint sar
only going to pick out a few new
features but one is the new treatment of
recordings so now you've got new ways to
sort through the things that are
actually stored and downloaded on the
Sky box you can see your most recent
downloads you can also sort by A to Z
and a feature that I really like you can
sort by size so if you're trying to
clear a little bit of space on your box
you can see which programs are hogging
up all your capacity if I move down to
sports another new feature I really like
here is that you can organize by the
actual sport you want to watch rather
than by channel so if you're really
interested in tennis you don't need to
put up with all those other boring
sports you can also see what's live so
if all you're concerned with is watching
some sport that's actually happening
right now it's easier to get to that so
I previously Sky hasn't been that big on
personalization and recommendations but
hopefully that's all going to change
there's this new tab here called my cue
if you tap into it it shows you things
that you are halfway through watching so
you can quickly get back to things do
you are halfway through viewing this box
also keeps track of all the programs
that you've been watching and it will
show you when next episodes of shows
that you're interested in are ready to
view on the recommendation side though
what's really cool is this for you
section now this basically shows you
things that Sky reckons that you're
going to like based on your viewing
history there's a lot more internet
infusion that there has been previously
as well there's this whole new online
video section which pulls in videos from
YouTube has got this rather neat
feel-good section which is essentially
cat videos and there's more internet
infusion as well in this new apps menu
so if you press this button here on the
remote you get this sidebar that slides
in and it lets you do things like check
sports results or the weather or the
news
one final nice to see is that if you're
already watching live TV and you want to
do a little bit of channel surfing to
see what else is on you can now get this
live picture in picture view of what's
going on on other channels that's all
for the interface tool for now but
there's a lot more to see on sky cube so
to check it out here to see Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
