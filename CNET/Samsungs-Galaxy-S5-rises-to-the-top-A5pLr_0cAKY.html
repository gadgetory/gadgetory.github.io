super phone with the Galaxy s5 samsung
once again reaches for the top with
high-flying specs like a 5.1 inch 1080p
HD screen a 16 megapixel camera Android
4.4 and pretty much the fastest quad
core processor around it also adds a
fingerprint scanner and the cell phone
world's first heartrate monitor so does
that make Samsung's Galaxy s5 the smart
phone to be you know not necessarily I'm
Jessica's all court for seeing that I'm
gonna show you around the phone the
Galaxy s5 certainly upsets game over
last year's model but with its familiar
plastic look and feel and only slightly
souped up specs it acts more like an
enhanced galaxy s4 than the surprising
ultra advanced phone that a lot of
people were hoping to see still there is
a lot to like and Samsung has changed
one or two things first let's talk about
the design the phone comes in white
black copper and blue but not every
market and carrier will have every color
or at least not right away the dimpled
back panel comes in a matte finish which
cuts down on a lot of the annoying
reflection that we saw it in the s4 and
the s3 just like the s4 this years phone
has a silvery rim and a physical home
button the s5 may be a little bit larger
than the s4 but it's pretty easy to
pocket and I can even jog four miles
without it dropping now take a close
look at the bottom of the galaxy s5 and
you'll see a flap covering the USB 3
port there's also a rubbery gasket
beneath the back panel and a coating in
the headset jack these together help
make the s5 rated ip67 for resistance to
water and dust in the OS Department
Samsung has included Android 4.4 KitKat
with a slightly revised TouchWiz
interface on top the changes are pretty
subtle like an on-screen menu button
instead of a physical one but they all
come together in the notifications tray
s finder and quick connect make it easy
to search your phone and transfer things
like photos and videos to other devices
the Settings menu also gets a fresh lick
of paint and you'll see that there are a
few new layout options besides if you're
into shortcuts turn on the new toolbox
feature its customizable and floats
around to get out of your way my
magazine is a news feed you can swipe to
four
the homescreen then there's the ultra
power saving mode which strips the s5
down to the basics and promises many
more hours of battery juice other small
but significant changes appear in the
camera experience the 16 megapixel
shooter takes really nice crisp
high-resolution photos and 4k HD video
the camera app itself has logical
on-screen controls including an all new
HDR toggle that previews the results in
real time before you take the shot the
camera settings have also transformed
into a tidy grid for turning features on
and off for your convenience Samsung has
repackaged some of the s4's modes into
shot and more you just take the photo
first and apply the effects later
selective focus is one new trick for
making the background or foreground of
your photos stand out and virtual tour
creates a 360-degree view of your
location and video are in stills moving
to the front of the phone the Samsung
Galaxy s5 has a 2 megapixel front-facing
camera that will automatically airbrush
you I personally find this creepy but
you can change it the camera also
records 1080p HD video which is a really
nice touch
Samsung has really talked up two of the
phone's features the fingerprint scanner
and the heartrate monitor now other
phones have had a fingerprint scanner
before and this one uses a slightly
different approach if you don't do it
just right
you're gonna have to rely on your
password backup luckily the heart rate
monitor is much more consistent its
highs into the revised s health app and
can track your heart rate over time you
may not use this on a regular basis but
it is a fun extra for fitness buffs the
galaxy s5 still does everything that the
s4 did and then some like there's a
download booster split screen mode a ton
of motion based gestures and you can use
the screen while wearing gloves alright
so here's my verdict I really like this
phone and for day-to-day use you can't
go wrong but it does leave a little bit
of room for the competition to muscle
through in particular I check out the
HTC One m8 this all-metal phone is
prettier has a similar caliber of core
hardware and it has some awesome
external speakers plus the m8 costs
about the same price for double the
capacity 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage instead of 16 still the s5
performs consistently well in every
category that matters it's a great
Android phone and definitely one at the
top of its class for even more
nitty-gritty specs and a breakdown of
the features I talked about today make
