cement I'm at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona Spain right now I'm looking at
indigo from artificial solutions it's a
personal voice assistant similar to Siri
or Google now but the difference here is
it works across different OSS that means
Android Windows 8 and soon iOS what's
the weather forecast in Barcelona this
week
this is indigo on Windows Phone 8 this
your interface you can kind of scroll
through and kind of see some of the
anything you have set like these are
some alarms notes some of your favorites
like you know tell me a joke some of the
things you say most commonly and then
your reminders it's got a neat that each
version of indigo is kind of tailored to
the OS it's running on it kind of kind
of looks like it looks like it looks
appropriate on the OS is running on so
you can change your gender so you can
have a female voice talking to you or if
you want you can have a male voice
reacting to your questions you can
change the color the backgrounds and
stuff like that this thing's pretty
customizable actually right now this
version is optimized for English that's
English English not necessarily American
English so it may be having trouble
hearing me and also it's very loud in
here right now but you can change that
you can change that easily through the
settings you can go in and change it to
US English and you can have the response
have a US accent or an English accent as
well kind of an example of its kind of
cross-functionality is that you can ask
it on android like tell me about
restaurants in barcelona it'll give you
a list of restaurants in barcelona sort
it from yelp and they'll give you like
the top eight you can pick one and then
switch to your Windows Phone eight and
just say give me directions there and
it'll remember which restaurant you were
interested in and give you directions to
that restaurant it's pretty kind of
pretty cool indigo is available now on
Android Windows 8 and on your browser at
hello - indigo comm look for it on iOS
in the first quarter of twenty
13's Eric Franklin again reporting from
