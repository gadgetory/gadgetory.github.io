espresso maker how about $3,000 right
behind me is the Philips Seco Grande
barista Avanti for $3,000 this machine
can make a virtual hit list of espresso
drinks and milk based cocktails things
like flat whites cappuccinos lattes and
you don't even have to get off the couch
or even be in the same room to operate
this guy you can actually connect to the
machine via a Bluetooth application and
Bluetooth radio that's built right into
the machine lets you command it from a
smartphone or tablet either using an iOS
or Android application the Avanti also
makes some of the best espresso I've
tasted especially from a home machine
that's sitting on your kitchen
countertop its creamy its rich has very
thick crema it's very delicious and
something that I think is actually
outstanding while this is a super
automatic espresso machine you do have
to do some maintenance on this guy we're
talking weekly maintenance of the milk
system of the grinding system basically
you have to clean it monthly you have to
get in there and open up all the parts
and get in down and dirty pretty
regularly so this is something that
you're gonna have to tinker with and not
be afraid of so it is definitely not a
basic simple manual product for $3,000
you're definitely gonna get excellent
espresso an espresso base drinks from
the Phillips Seco grande barista Avanti
but it is definitely paying the clean so
you're gonna want to think about well do
I want to invest all that time and
energy into this product you might want
to go with something that's a little bit
less complex and that might fit into
your life a little bit better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
