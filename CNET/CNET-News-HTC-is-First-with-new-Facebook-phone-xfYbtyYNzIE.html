HTC first so we are excited the HTC
first because it's a great opportunity
to bring mobile and social together even
more closer and the HTC first is the
ultimate social form because if also
combine the new facebook home and great
HTC design and is it would give you the
best facebook experience it's the only
form that has faithful home pre-loaded
and we're optimized that means you are
going to have unique experiences like a
notification for your emails and
calendar app updates right on your face
for home we are also excited to announce
that HDD first we'll have a full colors
now think of the HTC first as the canvas
on which the facebook experience rights
and it's simple and it's elegant it's
not designed to be the big phone but a
phone that feels good to you and I tell
you I have been I used a lot of phones
and I think this phone is the most
immersive engagement that I've ever seen
you saw the article this morning on the
wall street journal over twenty percent
of people are really engaged in facebook
way off the charts I don't know what
this number is going to do mark but it's
going to absolutely elevate it now what
I like about the HTC first is of course
as you would expect an LTE device so it
writes on AT&amp;amp;T s 4g LTE network which
I'm proud to tell you is the fastest 4G
LTE network in the country if
don't believe me go look at RootMetrics
last month they declared when they
surveyed all the carriers that AT&amp;amp;T 4G
LTE network was the fastest pure
download of any carrier that they tested
so we're thrilled to have this
opportunity to bring that vision that
mark first outline to fruition and I
dope it took a lot of people in this
room to bring it about but I think
you've done an exceedingly great great
job at it so you're now wondering okay
when is it going to be available well
it's going to be available on April the
12th for a great price of 9999
exclusively at AT&amp;amp;T and so this is
fantastic yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
