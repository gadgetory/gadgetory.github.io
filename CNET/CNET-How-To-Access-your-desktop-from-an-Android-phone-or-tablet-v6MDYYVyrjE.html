access your computer but Google has its
own solution that lets you view your Mac
or PC from your Android device the setup
is really simple first launch Chrome on
your PC and install Chrome remote
desktop
this works for Mac and Windows once it's
installed open the app and grant it
permission for remote access now you've
got two options the first is useful if
you're trying to troubleshoot a friend
or family's computer you'd want to set
this up on their computer if they're
constantly bothering you for technical
support the second option is good if you
want to access your own machine before I
can continue there's one additional
piece of software to install that will
give my Android permission to access the
computer remotely when that's all set
the last thing to do is to choose a pin
so that any random person can't just
access your computer if they swipe your
phone so choose a pin and when you're
done you'll be asked to enter it to
enable the service the second part of
this equation happens on your Android
device where you'll be accessing your
computer just install the chrome remote
desktop app from the Google Play Store
and make sure that when you're setting
it up you're signed in with the same
account you used for the desktop web app
choose the computer you want to access
enter your PIN and your desktop will
appear right away at this point you can
interact with anything on screen swiping
to change the view and using the usual
pinch gesture to zoom in and out
navigation can be a little awkward but
it helps if you use this option to make
it fullscreen
you can also use the menu button to
access control alt delete' or to
disconnect back on your computer and
alert box shows up at the bottom of the
screen to let you or the other person
know that the screen is being mirrored
plus an option to stop the session so
now whenever you're away from home or
you get that frantic call from a family
member there's an easy way to get remote
access if you have any questions or tips
of your own hit me up on Twitter and
