taking a look at the brand new 13-inch
Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display
now this is one of those products that
we knew was coming we didn't know
exactly when but here it is just in time
for the start of the holiday shopping
season now if you've seen the original
15-inch MacBook Pro with the Retina
display you pretty much know what the
deal is here this is a product that is
really halfway between a traditional
MacBook Pro and that smaller lighter
MacBook Air it's a thinner and lighter
than a pro but it doesn't quite taper to
a point away in air-duct so it still has
it sort of squared off MacBook Pro feel
even though it's lighter it's actually a
little bit dense and almost heavy in the
hand it feels a little bit heavier when
you pick it up then you think it you it
will just by looking at it let's take a
look at the retina MacBook Pro versus a
13-inch MacBook Air if you look at them
side-by-side you're going to see that
the pro actually has a slightly smaller
footprint than the MacBook Air it's
about the same thickness in the back
it's it's it's it's obviously thicker in
the front but the length and width on
the air is actually a little bit bigger
of course the air is definitely a little
bit lighter as well if you put them
side-by-side you're going to see that
again
the pro does seem like it's a little bit
small area if you consider how far out
it comes and it's got that nice two edge
to edge glass over the display which you
don't have on the MacBook Air but the
real selling point beyond all that is
this gorgeous 13.3 inch screen in this
case i think it's a 2560 by 1600 display
that's a little bit lower than on the
15-inch version but still miles beyond
what you'd get in any other Windows
laptop of any size now on the screen you
don't actually see that native
resolution you see an interpolated
resolution of either 1280 by 800 1440 by
900 a couple different settings that you
can pick so it looks like it's that
lower resolution but the image is much
crisper and clearer especially when
you're viewing text it's the kind of
thing that I'm sorry to say really
presents itself much better in person
than then online or on
you know you really do have to kind of
see a Retina display in person just like
on current generation iPad or iPhone
really appreciate it
like the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina
you've got some connections and ports in
here that you don't usually find it a
MacBook you have not one but two
Thunderbolt ports that both double as
DisplayPort ads and you've got HDMI
that's really great for hooking this up
to a bunch of external monitors at the
same time
you of course lose the optical drive and
there's no Ethernet jack so just be
prepared for that
now all this does not come cheap the
starting price on this guy is 1699 and
for that you only get a 128 gig SSD and
an Intel Core i5 processor in order to
trade up to a 256 gig SSD that's another
$300 and then a couple hundred more on
top of that if you want a core i7 now
there are a lot of people out there
trying to sell $1600 Windows laptops
right now we've certainly seen a bunch
of really high-profile Windows 8 launch
systems trying to hit that price so you
know there are a lot of people who think
that that there's an audience out there
for a 16 or 17 hundred dollar laptop
that does kind of remain to be seen but
if I had that much money to spend I
think that the these super high-res
displaying here is definitely one of the
features that you'd look for and that
would really justify that kind of price
that being said the 15-inch retina is
still probably the most universally
useful and practical macbook that Apple
makes right now and that 13-inch air is
still the most portable and still the
most easily accessible for mainstream
audiences especially because it's not
just dinner aligner but it's a lot less
extensive I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch model with
Retina display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
