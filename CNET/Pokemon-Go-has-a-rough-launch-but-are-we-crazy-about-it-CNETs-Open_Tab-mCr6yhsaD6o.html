dragon ball guy yes I couldn't you tell
everybody that's right just by looking
at him like my crewmen oh so poster do

I know is there was a story earlier this
week it was actually the first thing I
heard about Pokemon go was it the Darwin
police department in Darwin Australia
Northern Territory where have been to
yes everyone has struck has been every
one destroyed but um they said no but
they said that they issued a warning to
people saying you weren't allowed to go
into the Darwin police department or the
police station to to get your Pokemon go
characters right so if they appeared
there you weren't allowed in surely
they'd say you know don't go into
strangers houses or you know don't go
off cliffs has no don't go into the
police station yeah okay Australia
doesn't really have a lot of problems I
guess that's something that you know sir
surface to the top so here's what
pokemon go is it's a mobile game that
uses a are so amazed really augmented
reality which means you're holding up
your phone's camera in the world around
you and they're sort of like putting
their placing pokemon around areas in
the real world and you have to like
flick out the ball the Pokemon balls am
I saying that I know my someone go crazy
if they had a yokai yeah whatever that
is a joke I ok you need a yokai watch
this yokai right i forgot to get 10 so
that's so that's a thing a lot of people
are complaining that it doesn't work
though everyone's calling a pokemons
stop oh really yeah because like the
servers are having issues connecting we
were talking about today my buddy russ
was only able to hook into it like twice
not unlike set up a username and that
was it not enough money to keep the
server's going I don't know if that's
what it is but set a Pikachu broke you
