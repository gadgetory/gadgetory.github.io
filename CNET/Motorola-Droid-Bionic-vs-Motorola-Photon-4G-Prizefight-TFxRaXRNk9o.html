and this is a battle between two of the
best that Android has to offer its
surprise 5 punch out between the
motorola droid bionic on verizon and the
motorola photon 4g on sprint now our
judges for this fight our senior editor
Bonnie boom boom sha senior associate
editor Nicole killing me softly and
myself ring a ling a ding dong now we'll
take all three judges scores and abs
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final price five score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system it's five Rumble
tumblerounds first design the Droid
Bionic has an amazing-looking screen
that pops in all of its 4.3 inch glory
and it's also one of the chunky asst and
blocky owns you'll find but let's be
honest it's uber geek target market
probably doesn't even care the photon 4g
is easier to hold with its curved
backing and its 4.3 inch qhd screen
we're always fans of a kickstand and
even though i hate the cut off corners
it's not a complete turnoff for everyone
the droid Brown it gets a 4 and the
photon 4g gets a 3.7 next round is user
base both phones are Motorola's
offspring and they've toned on the
blurry you I from previous versions the
Bionic and photon 4g pretty much share
the same OS with subtle visual
differences both have the swype keyboard
option the Droid Bionic fields faster
overall and the photon 4g has a physical
shutter button for the camera but
there's nothing here that sets them
apart we're handing out board to both
phones this
and after two rounds the Droid Bionic
leads by one-tenth of a point next round
is features these phones are
feature-packed freaks of nature
dual-core processors 4G connectivity
voice to text and google maps or android
staples and web top capability and gives
them pc-like functionality with the
laptop add-on or docking station is just
the start the photons kickstand is a
differentiator and it's a dual mode
phone for CDMA and GSM networks while
the Droid Bionic can handle 1080p HD
video capture but it's a cdma LTE phone
only these phones have what counts we're
dishing out perfect fives all around
next round is web browsing a multimedia
web browsing is identical on both of
these phones with Flash content support
pinching and zooming is identical and
multimedia looks gorgeous on both
screens the Droid Bionic packs an eight
megapixel camera that shoots 1080p video
and it also includes the blockbuster app
for movie and TV content plus verizon
suite of V CAST services now the photon
4g has its own 8 megapixel camera that
captures 720p video at the moment and
includes Sprint's multimedia services
but its pictures weren't as bright or as
sharp as the bionics the drug addict
gets the edge with a five and the photon
4g gets up for boats averaged out four
rounds and the droid bionic moves by
three-tenths of a point this one's going
to be a close one and the final round
that decides it all is all call the
performance
these are excellent sounding phones but
the droid bionic adjust the touch of
background noise compared to the photon
4g with really sounded pristine and
natural performance wise the droid
bionic is just a hair faster of the
tooth when you're navigating the OS but
it's 4g data speeds were impressive on
verizon's LTE network and just crushed
sprint's 4g wimax in our own test this
one's just too close to call and we're
tied at four point seven points apiece
in the final round but to average out
all five rounds and in a prize fight
where the Droid Bionic took a lead early
and just held on to it a surge by the
photon 4g wasn't enough and the Droid
Bionic takes this battle 4.5 to 4.3 and
is your prize fight win this was another
great Android 4g battle and the Droid
Bionic lives up to its editors choice
title and reign supreme as a smartphone
champ in the prize fight ring i'm brian
Tong thanks for watching who catch you
guys next time to another prize 5
