song and this is a battle between two of
the best that Android has to offer it's
surprise 5 punch out between the
Motorola Droid Bionic on horizon and the
motorola Photon 4G on Sprint now our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Bonnie boom boom Shaw senior associate
editor nicole killing me softly and
myself ring a ling a ding dong now we'll
take all three judges scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final prize five score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system it's 5 Rumble double
rounds first because I'm the Droid
Bionic has an amazing looking screen
that pops in all of its 4.3 inch glory
and it's also one of the chunky as' and
blocky as phones you'll find but let's
be honest it's uber geek target market
probably doesn't even care
the Photon 4G is easier to hold with its
curved backing and it's 4.3 inch qHD
screen we're always fans of a kickstand
and even though I hate the cut off
corners it's not a complete turnoff for
everyone the droids on it gets a 4 and
the Photon 4G gets a 3.7 next round is
user base both phones are Motorola's
offspring and they've toned on the
blurry UI from previous versions the
Bionic and Photon 4G pretty much shared
the same OS with subtle visual
differences both have the swype keyboard
option the Droid Bionic feels faster
overall and the boats on 4G has a
physical shutter button for the camera
but there's nothing here that sets them
apart we're handing out force to both
phones this
and after 13 rounds Detroit Roenick
leaves by one tenth of a point next
round his features these phones are
feature packed freaks of nature
dual-core processors 4G connectivity
voice detects and Google Maps or Android
staples and web top capability and gives
them PC light functionality with the
laptop add-on or docking station is just
the start the photons kickstand is a
differentiator and it's a dual mode
phone for CDMA and GSM networks while
the Droid Bionic can handle 1080p HD
video capture when it's a CDMA LTE phone
only these phones have what counts we're
dishing out perfect fives all around
next round is web browsing a multimedia
web browsing is identical on both of
these phones with Flash content support
pinching and zooming is identical and
multimedia looks gorgeous on both
screens the Droid Bionic packs an 8
megapixel camera that shoots 1080p video
and it also includes the blockbuster app
for movie and TV content plus Verizon
suite of v-cast services
now the Photon 4G has its own 8
megapixel camera that captures 720p
video at the moment and includes
Sprint's multimedia services but it's
pictures weren't as bright or as sharp
as the bionics the dry browning gets the
EDS with a 5 and the photon floor G's
gets up for most average out for rounds
and the Droid Bionic moves by three
tenths of a point this one's going to be
a close one and the final round that
decides it all is all quality
performance
these are excellent sounding phones with
the Droid Bionic adjust the touch of
background noise compared to the Photon
4G wouldn't really sound a pristine and
natural performance wise the Droid
Bionic is just a hair faster of the
tooth when you're navigating the OS but
its 4G data speeds were impressive on
Verizon's LTE network and just crushed
Sprint's 4G WiMAX in our mold test this
one's just too close to call and we're
tied at four point seven points at PC
the final round but to average out all
five rounds and in a prizefight where
the Droid Bionic took a lead early and
just held on to it a surge by the Photon
4G wasn't enough and the Droid Bionic
takes this battle four point five to
four point three and is your prize fight
win this was another great Android 4G
battle and the Droid Bionic lives up to
its editors choice title and reign
supreme as a smartphone champion the
prize fight ring
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prize fight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
