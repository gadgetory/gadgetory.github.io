there's a rumor that the next Apple
iPhone will get rid of the headphone
jack that sounds insane but when you
think about it Apple does insane stuff
like that all the time
these are the top five times Apple
killed a technology at number five
floppy drives so that's save icon with a
rectangle with an edge cut off at an
angle it was a visual representation of
a floppy disk back in the day it was a
safe place to save your files in 1998
apple's imac dumped the floppy drive
entirely replacing it was a CD drive but
bring this number for optical drives yet
another thing Apple decided to kill off
the original MacBook Air was super thin
and lights one was introduced back in
2008 however it was missing something no
optical drive if you had CDs or other
software on this you'd have to use a
remote disc feature of OS 10 or get a
USB drive future laptops including the
MacBook Pro then dropped optical drives
that compromised made sense on a
portable device then Apple kicked out
optical drives on his desktops - why
because Apple kills things dead that's
why number three firewire Apple was a
big proponent of firewire otherwise
known as I believe 1394 this was a
really fast interface that connected
devices to computers the very first iPod
featured a full fire wire connector so
you could quickly get lots of music onto
its hard drive Apple also showed up its
products board for creative
professionals since many camcorders
featured firewire slowly but surely
firewire took a backseat
the fast USB 2.0 standard then a
backseat to the really fast and USB 3.0
standard then again to the really really
fast
Thunderbolt interface at number two
MagSafe ever trip on a laptops power
cable then watch your laptop skate off a
table and crash onto the ground that was
the problem
Apple's MagSafe connector tried to fix
the AC adapter attached to map books
using magnets you trip the cable comes
flying out and your laptop is safe Apple
then replace the original Mac safe with
the introduction of a thinner mat safe
to
however the newest and thinnest macbook
introduced in 2015
drops mags and tirely for apple's new
buddy the US
you see how long they stay buddies at
number one the 30-pin dock connector
remember this thing apples most
successful iPods and iPhones use a 30
pin dock connector lots and lots of
accessories supported plugging in and I
device using that 30 pin thing then in
2012 Apple said you're gonna want to buy
all of you accessories when introduced
this the Lightning connector now to be
fair Apple introduced the optional 30
pin to lightning connector adapter was a
nice gesture but kind of clunky that
does it for us check out more top vibes
over at top 5.2 Netcom I'm is actor and
we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
