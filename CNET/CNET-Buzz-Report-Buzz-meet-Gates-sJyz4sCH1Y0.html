report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
t-mobile Sidekick 3 now this is the
follow-up to the hugely popular sidekick
2 which is a favorite of party people
and celebrities everywhere most notably
Paris Hilton huge sidekick user the new
version has a smaller design a 1.3
megapixel camera bluetooth high-speed
data a built-in music player and even a
mini SD card slot it's crazy
but seriously aren't you just gonna get
it cuz Paris Hilton probably will I mean
who doesn't want to be like Paris Hilton
right or wait no are we not doing that
anymore well I wonder what phone Reese
Witherspoon carries and now for the news
now we're all still getting used to the
news that Bill Gates is going to be
leaving day-to-day operations at
Microsoft and I actually sat down with
Bill all by myself
and we talked one-on-one about those
changes here in a special buzz report
interview is mr. Bill Gates thanks so
much for coming in bill now Steve
Ballmer is going around telling everyone
that you're retiring what's up with that
I'm not leaving Microsoft really that's
um not really what I'd heard I'm not
leaving Microsoft okay wrong information
I got it
well then let's talk about some other
things how about your personal life
obviously Melinda your wife is a huge
impact on you tell us a little bit about
how you wooed her using the same
approaches we use at Microsoft ok so
ruthlessly crushing the competition
got it the dynamic is exactly the same
now how have those long hours over the
years affected your relationship with
Melinda I'm not as not as necessary out
I know how that goes well I don't really
but anyway mm-hmm are you sure you're
not leaving Microsoft um you're working
as hard as I ever have during these next
two years the next two years
gotcha bill well you do seem really
relaxed as you head into this transition
and you look good your hair maybe your
waistline mm-hmm I've had to lighten up
in
both of those areas I thought so so
let's talk a little bit more about
Microsoft are you worried about turning
things over to Steve Ballmer I mean he
seems a little crazy are you gonna try
to get him on some meds or anything
before you go Steve and I have had this
dialogue understood
well now that you're headed for
retirement bill when you start kicking
it with the hoochies in the bling-bling
starting immediately and one last
question does this mean Steve Jobs wins
no comment
well thanks so much for being here bill
and good luck with everything that was a
nice of him to come in like that don't
you think now back to the news after a
Massachusetts man contracted the measles
in May the state health agency attempted
to alert workers in the huge high-rise
building where the sick man had been
employed in order to spread the word the
health agency used a podcast
unfortunately the measles ended up
spreading a lot faster than the podcast
now obviously I'm a huge fan of
high-tech working here at scene that and
everything but in this case couldn't you
maybe gone with like a sign on the door
I mean you could have printed it in
color if you really want to be tricky
it's like maybe a little tape and now
for the second ever installment in the
editorial series that I like to call the
high horse let me climb on up here
okay the net neutrality battle is
heating up and representatives from the
telecommunications industry are
launching a PR campaign to convince
consumers that net neutrality
legislation will be a terrible thing
that would cause higher taxes this lower
internet and a dearth of online
innovation and you know their campaign
is really frustrating because it's
basically political fear-mongering that
doesn't admit that it's the telcos who
started this whole thing by proposing a
tiered internet structure that would
make content providers pay more to have
their content delivered reliably and
they definitely don't say anything about
how companies like Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are
creating their own internet-based
television content and so while they're
making Google and Yahoo pay more for
reliable access they'd be reserving
bandwidth on their own pipes for their
own competing content and they don't
even try to deal with the question of
whether the telecom industry itself is
competitive enough thanks to government
regulation decades of subsidies and more
and more mega mer
to give consumers legitimate alternative
choices in the advent of widespread
dissatisfaction with a tiered internet
structure I just wish that someone would
get into the meat of the issue instead
of making everything into a bunch of
partisan PR unfortunately I can't really
do that on this show it's just not that
funny I'm Molly wood and this has been
the buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
