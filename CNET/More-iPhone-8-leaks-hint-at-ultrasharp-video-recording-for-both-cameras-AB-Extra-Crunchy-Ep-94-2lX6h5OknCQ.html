where you are in the planet Earth my
name is Steven Meacham and this is the
Apple byte extra crunchy podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tong hey you better
not forget about the name of the show
dude I know you're like pulling a lot of
levers and switches but you cannot
forget the name of the show did I say I
said it you did it
you're like it's the in-between one of
the buttons I was about to press yes
it's you anyways everybody welcome to
the show
it is episode 90 foe 9 fo 9 foe it's the
Apple byte extra crunchy this is our
kind of complementary piece to the Apple
byte video podcast it's an extension of
everything
new news happens which it has with the
latest iPhone leaks so this is the show
where we talk about everything and you
guys and gals can all be a part of it
the number to call I can't remember I
have to look at all the time one one
eight hundred six one six two six three
that is how you call into the show we
missed your name where you're from and
then just get right to it your questions
your comments your thoughts keep it
under a minute I think we have like 10
phone calls and we couldn't use a lot of
them that are just too long we had a lot
of people just talking and talking and
just jabbering and jabbering which
Jabbar is okay can be cathartic but if
you're also gonna do a product review
we're probably not gonna oh we had a
full on product review appreciate don't
get me wrong
yeah all right so you guys and gals know
the number that's it we're also
streaming live on live stream periscope
and YouTube well we do this or you can
listen to us as a podcast like a lot of
you all are just after the fact or on
your commute or even I think someone
called this time he was like showering
while he's listening in the shower yeah
I'm not happy about that I think that's
sexy thank you whoa all right sexy you
know it's been kind of a lull with the
Apple news lately but this week was a
treasure trove every day it got deeper
and deeper with more revelations about
what we can expect from the iPhone 8 but
let me just kind of set the stage up
because a lot of people know what it
roughly is looks like which is confirmed
by you know the renders and a little
icon but this is let me tell you how
this whole story started
we started so basically apple
accidentally and this was an accident
released the firmware for the home pod
over the week and I think it was on
Saturday
somewhere around Saturday and I know
it's always been a week now the key
thing about this is Apple has already
released developer versions of iOS 11
the home pod runs on iOS so it's using
the same operating system the key thing
here though is that the home pod
firmware that was revealed by Apple
again the home pod is expected to come
out sometime in December we don't know
exactly when but the version of the
firmware that came with the home pod for
iOS was iOS 11 point 0.2 that's two full
versions ahead of what has been released
publicly and a lot of people like oh
this is not an accident they did this on
purpose I can guarantee you this was not
done on purpose like to me there is no
neat Apple you know the hype is already
an all-time high some people are saying
oh they released they leaked this
accidentally because of their earnings
were coming out their earnings results
which they did very well we'll talk
about them later were a result of the
growth from last quarter it had nothing
to do with these leaks and so we're
gonna jump into all of these leaks right
now but I think this is a this was
straight-up an accident we know that
Apple has talked about doubling down on
secrecy for years with Tim Cook and I
just find it really funny that the
actual company that has given us the
most concrete details about the iPhone
eight to date is yours truly Apple you
know I'm gonna play conspiracy theorist
here for a second and maybe they did
maybe this wasn't like wasn't an
accident when that dude got but he like
left an iPhone in the bar or something
that was an accident that was a stunt
that was how about this let's that's
also in context back in those days this
was the I think it was the iPhone 4 yeah
that was left on a bar in a bar right
it's like guy walks into a bar loses the
iPhone 4 right sounds like a stupid joke
but at that time we didn't really know
much about it
Apple was Steve Jobs wrote a letter
directly to was it
his motor Engadget I feel like it was in
dad
yeah can you feel it was gadget that was
able to make contact with a person who
was like this isn't a normal iPhone this
is before the days where people were
everyday we hear a leak about the iPhone
now this is just the fact or a rumor or
something back then it wasn't like this
and so it was a big deal
Steve Jobs reached out to them to try
and recover the phone they didn't want
to do it so you knew that if Steve Jobs
directly reaches out to you to get that
phone back they didn't do that on
purpose yeah he set the Apple police to
their house - yeah yes yes it was a big
big deal
so this is this is like they released
some code or something yeah and so
what's interesting is when I say oh it
was 11-point 0.2 which is two versions
ahead of what's out there a lot of times
when Apple releases a firmware developer
beta they scrub it so that there's no
references of you know what's coming in
the future this was not the case so
let's just jump into all the good stuff
that was in here the number one thing
was an icon based on what the new iPhone
is expected to look like it was this
blue to outline it pretty much verifies
a variety of things one thing and beat
him in the first article you can scroll
down and it's in that first article it
verifies that there will be no actual
physical touch ID button on the front
glass panel first again this is we've
known these in rumors but this is an
actual confirmation from Apple so it
removes that the notch on the top where
the sensors are for the actual camera
infrared sensors though that there is a
notch there that everyone has talked
about that from the start and from the
rumors that I've seen I was always like
man that's that's just bunk that just
looks ugly to me so those those are two
of kind of really the big things that
are immediately confirmed by this leak
now other things happen you got to give
props out first of all developers
Stephen Chow Smith there was another guy
jail herm Rambo they dug into the code
these are the reason why we know all
this is because these two guys were
really the first ones that realized okay
this doesn't this is
not a firmware we've seen before they
dug in the code they searched for
different terms like the word face they
searched for everything you could to
kind of like try and connect the dots
and they've really given us a lot of
information one of the big things is
that in the biometric kit right we know
Apple kind of names a lot of their
utilities for developers like their
sirikit there's homekit biometric kit is
typically where things like touch ID is
stored well guess what there is a new
term or what a method that's gonna be
used in the biometric kit biometric kit
called face detect what does that tell
us we've heard all these rumors about
how Apple without the home button and
without everyone thinks that they're not
gonna actually be able to even do the
whole touch ID through the screen sensor
this time around face detect pretty much
is everywhere in the biometric kit which
indicates to us at least in some way
shape or form that were that this new
iPhone will have some level of facial
recognition we don't know exactly if
there will be ice-skate iris scanning in
combination with that that was some of
the rumors that were thrown out there
and stories that were reported by
Bloomberg and others but at the very
least this does confirm that is going to
be some kind of facial recognition
implemented into unlocking your phone
and yes again no touch ID button and
then that lip on the top so that I mean
that those are three huge concrete facts
that you can't deny and no they would
not have leaked this on purpose they
just wouldn't I'm already having stress
over like when I'm snowboarding or
something how am I gonna unlock my phone
to take a picture wearing sunglasses
there's so many pictures about this face
detect you know like how many how is
this gonna work you know I'm curious
yeah and what about okay what about
touch ID with your with your glove and
your finger like did you have gloves
like I mean well you could take you know
take off the glove it's like I do have a
hard I do have a solution for you that
we're gonna talk about more of these so
every day there's been new information
and I love when I put out the Apple bite
video they're like oh you're a week late
I'm like dude it's a weekly show sorry
sorry but every day new stuff has come
out so we're gonna talk about kind of
some of the latest stuff that has just
dropped within the past
24 hours one of them being is that the
iPhone 8 according to these again people
digging into the firmware that was
leaked according to I helped BR a
Brazilian site the firmware suggest that
the iPhone 8 may record 4k video at 60
frames per second with both the front
camera and the rear cameras that would
actually be a first because on the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus it's able to capture
4k video at 30 frames per second this is
saying that it'll capture 4k video at 60
frames per second not only on the rear
camera but the front camera as well we
know that right now in the 7 the front
camera is only a 1080p camera as well so
you're talking about better FaceTime
quality you're talking about better you
know selfie videos we know how important
that is that's gonna be a big file man
that's that's a lot of information
that's pretty awesome on both sides too
that's that's what I'm saying
yeah that is that's a great news
actually so um that's all that's always
always good news um another thing that
was really interesting that was just
recently released as within the past 24
hours the home pod firmware also shows
kind of a new smart camera feature think
of it as like a system for auto
detecting different things and we'll
talk about why this is important but
first of all according to the firmware a
smart camera feature that has been found
again suggests that the camera app is
gonna actually be able to detect
different types of things like scenes or
photo conditions anything from pets to
children some of the scenes that were
referenced in the files include like
fireworks you know how hard it is to
take pictures of fireworks oh yeah
alerts blurry July 4 fireworks so things
like that's gonna detect your home pod
will detect fireworks outside your home
pod your your your iPhone camera these
were found capsule files yeah so all
this all this treasure trove of data was
found from a home pod firmware release
but these are all related to the iPhone
so no no no sketchy camera in this in
the whole pod yet but things that it can
identify that were listed include things
from fireworks foilage pets
a bright stage sports sky snow these are
things that if you remember even way
back to the day on your like Canon s
1000 point and shoot cameras you'd have
kind of some of these modes that were
selectable on your cameras you remember
that yeah different yeah you still have
some really old school cameras that have
that like here's a flower take a picture
of flower mountain for macro right but
like honestly most of those scenes you I
would never switch it I just keep it on
auto back that's literally what we do
with our phones today so this is just
talking about some of the different
things that this smart camera
functionality will have in addition to
that another kind of list shows
confidence metrics and it hits on the
ability of maybe this smart camera
feature to be confident in what it's
looking at so it had you know it's going
to have different identifiers or image
recognition metrics that it looks for
when it sees a season sees an object
that it wants to take a picture of so
there's things like pet confidence baby
confidence QR code confidence document
confidence these are all built into this
smart camera feature to be able to
detect these different things so that's
that's someone kind of the cool stuff
that we can expect to see in the camera
and we know that it's always gonna come
down to the image quality of the camera
I mean phones are our cameras for most
of us unless you you love that DSLR
action and we still aren't at the point
where we're gonna get there but I
thought what was really interesting
about the ability to recognize these
things is we know about the bokeh effect
on the iPhone 7 plus where it blurs out
the background and it was kind of Apple
was kind of first testing out I think
the fact that this smart camera lists a
lot of different things or items or
seams whether it's a baby or a pet or
things of that nature would probably
relate to that bokeh effect to be even
more accurate and better
I like pulling things out Apple never
officially said it was for like objects
or for animals they did say was for
people and people tried taking pictures
of different things that it did work a
good amount of the time but for it to
actually maybe get even better
recognition to separate those objects
from the background and give us a better
you know a field of death I think
that's gonna that's gonna be really cool
yeah cuz things can get kind of
camouflaging your house I bet yeah like
that
maybe we'll see we'll see if we'll see
we can determine if this shirt is a
plant or not my palm trees come on let's
just jump into more stuff again this was
a treasure trove of things that came out
from this firm where the other thing is
kind of some smaller details about the
iPhone I've always been complaining
about that notch that we saw at the top
of the camera the newest firmware and
again Steven Troutman just digging deep
into it he found out a few new details
one of them is that he said according
this tweet and this for what it's worth
I've seen nothing to suggest an
ultrasound under the display touch ID
here so he believes that it looks like
not this year we will not see touch ID
integrated into the actual display
he says quash that one so at least based
on the firmware he has for eleven point
0.2 there is no indication that the
actual screen will be able to detect
your fingerprint
we know that Samsung had issues doing
that that was their goal for the s8 they
were unable to do it people were kind of
skeptical that Apple would be able to
get it done in time and we saw a lot of
those different renders of maybe a
fingerprint scanner on the back which
obviously had to be one of Apple's
options people are like no I don't want
that I'm like if it works it works but
there is no indication of anything of a
touch ID integrated in the screen he
also found in here some interesting
things related to the status bar where
that sensor sticks out the new status
bar seems to me more complex and
powerful in design it might be even
interactive and in some related strings
Geoffrey gozman had found that the
actual status bar has some kind of level
of a a.split system so or split options
for the UI of the SAS bar and that
actually makes complete sense because it
means that we could see you know Wi-Fi
or your battery cell signal or your
Bluetooth signal on the sides of that
actual notch on the top what's the magic
of that oh LED screens give you true
deep blacks if they
can match the black of that top little
notch to the black of the screen it will
pretty much look like a seamless bar
across the top which really come on
everyone believes and wants them to do
that so we got a split status bar as
well and then another thing is um tapped
awake is a feature that we've seen on
Windows Lumia phones that is believed to
be coming to this iPhone so remember how
your time out well what if I'm skiing
and then some like I'm one of my gloves
what am I supposed to do like that fine
it won't have actual touch ID to share
finger but a tap to wake and then the
fact that you're looking at it with your
face might we'll see how fast that
actually works but hopefully it's gonna
I mean right now if a touch ID is so
fast I don't know if they're gonna be
able to beat the speed of touch ID and I
think if they don't I think people are
gonna be a little annoyed by that you
know yeah you have to be able to get to
your phone quickly in order to take
pictures and do everything you want to
do but um yeah I just you know we will
see when it comes out but it sounds like
it might we have to we might need to
learn a new behavior how to unlock our
phone which I'm sure will be a big
headache for a lot of people yeah
the thing is that if you weigh the
benefits of and depending on the speed
of the face unlock if it's not as fast
but fast enough I think most people are
like I'm glad I have an even bigger
screen that's an OLED screen I think
people might overlook it to a certain
degree they'll be annoyed at first I
think getting a larger OLED screen might
outweigh that but we'll see again it
comes down to speed on the last part of
this of digging into all of this and I
know there's so much stuff um in regards
to the home button Steven Sean Smith
also found references where the virtual
home button right there's no physical
one but there will be some sort of a
virtual one seems to be called the home
indicator so it looks like the OS really
is not gonna hide this it could be like
a space or a virtual space around the
home button he even references that
there could be things like full screen
apps and videos that you could plan that
lower part but it'll be more interactive
so we'll see about that I think that's
really interesting because it leads to
kind of this last part before we jump
onto other news and again so
much iPhone stuff that the next iPhone
could even be sharper than Apple's
Retina display away yeah that would be
pretty awesome man
so what they found in the code is that
according to guess who the man of the
week Stephen Crown Smith really I mean
we should call this well he's digging
deep into the developer code he's just
searching for terms and just hunting
like we should call this the Stephen
Straus Steve's trounce MIT extra crunchy
this is his show according to him
there's also references in the code for
an upcoming iPhone with a functional
resolution of 11 25 by 24 36 and why why
is that why is that a big deal right
it's hard to really figure out what that
means but um in this article by the
birds they kind of show what was rumored
a while ago Ming Chi quo popular rumor
slash news Apple News guy had basically
put out this idea that the top area
there it will be a 5.8 inch OLED display
and we have a picture up here for those
of you watching it will have a 5.8 inch
OLED display but there'll be an area
that is dedicated for the screen and an
area that is dedicated for this virtual
home button obviously if you're watching
video it'll fill up the entire screen
but he reported months ago that that
upper area that would be about five
point one five inches would make up this
24 36 by 1125 resolution again the same
resolution that was just found in the
developer code now why is that crazy is
because the current Apple Retina display
has a pixel per inch density of 326
pixels per inch which is actually if you
compare that across the industry is
really low it's actually pretty weak
compared to what Samsung is putting out
compared to what Google is putting out
compared to pretty much what everyone is
putting out but then this new OLED
display with this higher pixel density
would bring it up to roughly 521 pixels
per inch so you're getting extremely
higher quality higher resolution display
with the iPhone 8 I think that's gonna
make a difference because people ask oh
what's gonna be the difference between
the
iPhone 7 in the seven plus or sorry that
7s and 7s plus whatever they end up
calling kind of the standard phones
about people will buy it's gonna be
discreet it's gonna be discreet
yeah so um yeah it's getting closer to
4k on the screen too which is great it's
nice it's nice we're getting a lot
closer like Apple is getting closer all
right I mean look the the Galaxy s8
phones resolution is 29 60 by 1440 like
it's cut it's it's kind of beast yeah
just in case you didn't know if you ever
pick it up you don't even you only have
to know numbers just pick up the Samsung
Galaxy s8 and look at it and you're
gonna be like damn my phone doesn't look
anything like this right now I'm just
keeping it real
don't get don't don't don't shoot the
messenger all right should we um should
we take a little breather to stay a
little word from our amazing sponsor go
for it all right check this out the
single router Wi-Fi model just doesn't
work for our increasingly high bandwidth
world what you need is a distributed
system called Eero now for those of you
that don't know arrow was really one of
the first kind of these mesh networks
that came out so whatever your Wi-Fi
needs our arrow has the power to
seamlessly blanket your home fast any
other combination now simply set it on a
flat surface plug it into a wall an
outlet to expand the coverage in your
room think of these as like they have
the main router and then these
additional beacons here's the new
improvements that they did they've put a
third five gigahertz radio antenna in
them so it's now a tri-band which means
it's twice as fast as its predecessor it
lets you do more on your home
simultaneously they've also added a new
thread radio what thread is is it's it's
been in other routers but it allows you
to connect to certain smart home devices
key locks what else we have like smart
cameras things of that nature it's not
really popular or widespread yet but
it's kind of future proofing it for that
also their beacons are half the size
again it's a wireless mesh network if
you're living like a single bedroom
apartment you probably don't need this
but if you live in a house with multiple
levels of floors and everyone always
planes how do I get my Wi-Fi everywhere
you gotta go Eero we know that there's
other solution
but this is their new products and they
were kind of the first company to start
to get this all kick-started so again
check it out we have a killer deal from
the Apple byte free overnight shipping
if you visit eurocom you can even select
overnight shipping as the option and
guess what
just enter in the code Apple byte at
checkout that's ero calm spell er o comm
offer code is GE r o e 0 yeah I actually
need one of these because I am one of
those people that has a two-story
townhouse and our wi-fi's downstairs in
the living room and up in my kid's room
if they're trying to watch iPad or
something the Wi-Fi is a little slow so
I can definitely use one of these and I
guess it's like really easy to set up to
it's like really simple yes it's not
happiness is what we call is nice so
check it out
eurocom use the code Apple byte for free
overnight shipping ok there's still more
to talk about brooms a lot man I was
looking at the rundown I was like whoa
my mind is blown I'm trying I'm having a
hard time keeping up and being honest
it's alright alright just just sleep I
mean I'll just talk about you sleep I'll
push the button okay check this out um
the funny thing about this let's just
get out too quick
iPhone stories related to this all this
iPhone treasure trove of stuff
Samsung OLED production lines dedicated
to iPhones are ramping up to full
capacity what does that mean right now
well basically according to reports
Samsung will be ramping up their own
production increasing their output by
700 percent its iphone time baby yes
iPhone time this is a numbers record it
reported by et News so get ready for
that that's probably a good indicator
that a new iPhone is coming very soon
I'm still thinking a lot of people like
is it gonna be delayed or not I still
expect us to at least get announcement
in September sometime I don't know after
the Apple earpods debacle and all that
stuff I really think they're gonna
they're gonna try really hard to get
everything on time so the 7s e issues
remember that rose gold one that no one
could get like they've had years and
years of like little misstep so I feel
like they're gonna really like this
is their tenth anniversary - this is the
big but this is their badass I mean
there's a lot of demand for this yeah so
I feel like they're gonna really be on
point this time get on point also on
another iPhone related story could talk
about the SE Apple may give the iPhone
se a speed boost early next year that is
according to rumor reports over an Asian
newspaper outlet reported that we could
see that an a nine ship being changed
out for in a 10 ship that the iPhone 7
uses um we might expect to see this
sometime early next year okay um let's
talk about the home pod because it was
actually the home pods firmware that
revealed all these secrets but there are
a couple kind of cool things coming from
that we can find out about the home pod
from the firmware the first thing is
that the LED screen on top the kind of
that glowy thing that Apple shows off
really the only screen on the home pod
that kind of has this cool moody colors
based on digging into the firmware it's
believed that the LED on the home isn't
just like a single big LED it's an
actual LED matrix when I say matrix
thing right an array of multiple LEDs
that have formed that top screen so what
could be an option is for the home pod
to display things like temperature text
weather icons on that small LED screen
but the thing that I thought about right
away is like okay that's cool it has a
screen but you have to be standing
directly on top of it looking down to
see it you have to be like this to look
at the home pod screen I there's gonna
be a lot of people doing that but it's
fun it's like a fun maybe they can make
a light show out of it in the future who
knows ya knows right so dance party and
then this other cool thing about the
home pod dug deep by Avery Minotti the
beach there's like a youtube link that
you can jump into but there's some
unreleased home pod UI sounds things
that we've never heard on to any Apple
device so this first sound is a alarm
I'm going if I hear this I'm
going right back to sleep that's gonna
be a slight alarm it's a kind of
pleasant alarm yeah so I'm going right
this ain't waking me up man I'm sorry
okay next one lighthouse what about this
I'm gonna feel like that sounds like
yeah the lighthouse feels like I'm in a
sub in North Korea's shots fired so
there's some setup number I think very
gentle I'm sorry
well hey based on a home pod
technologist spacially figure out your
house layout is it supposed to optimize
that sounds like that was the one that I
gets me all groovy and everything that's
my favorite so anyways there you go just
a little bit of the home pod sounds that
were revealed UI sounds that revealed in
there okay
let's also get to other big news
normally it's like the biggest news of
the week would have been Apple or
earnings if Apple didn't freak and
accidentally leaked out that firmware
but here we go Apple had a killer killer
recorder this is their third fiscal
quarter for 2017 it's really the
calendar year it's the second quarter
but just remember that fiscal quarters
start whatever it is the October
November December is technically q1 for
the fiscal quarter so let's kind of
break down what Apple did in the
calendar year
sorry calendar quarter - but fiscal
quarter three all right so they had a
revenue of forty five point four billion
dollars net quarterly profit of eight
point seven billion dollars those are
all good numbers larger than the year
before but here's where always the proof
this is putting look at how their
products laid out slight edges but
everything was up across the board
Apple's told 41 million phones during
this quarter compared to last year which
was at forty point four they sold four
point two nine million Macs
from 4.25 the year before and then iPad
sales iPad sales which have been
declining and have not been positive for
the past thirteen quarters so think
about that three plus years we have not
seen positive gains in the I this this
quarter the iPad family rose sold 11.40
for two million units compared to nine
point nine five million last year so
iPad sales jumped up so they figured
something out then I pad sales jumped up
15 percent year-over-year they figure
something out it's called the iPad pro
baby they figured out how to market it
they figured out how to sell it so good
foot acts it's funny because um it
actually we'll talk about in a second
the iPad pro was part about it really
came down to them having a lower cost I
should just talk about now that it
really came down to them having a lower
cost iPad because although iPad sales
units grew 15% their actual profits grew
two percent which beams that they were
selling a lot of low-cost iPads which is
which is fine it's just that you would
have expected a higher profit increase
than 2% if they're really selling you
know a more expensive iPad so I think
that 9.7 inch that they released a
little while ago that was kind of a more
budget-friendly one helped them and then
obviously I mean I'm I'm the biggest the
iPad pro is my favorite apple product of
the year so far
nice like I love that thing it's
freaking badass so Apple did great
across the board they're also kind of
some other details from the earnings
report we talked already about the iPad
not entirely driven really by the I've
had pro but more about the nine point
seven inch iPad also Apple watch Apple
said that the units of the Apple watch
jumped up fifty percent compared to last
year it's the number one selling
SmartWatch across all brands in the
world but they still chose not to reveal
their sales units of the Apple watch so
like that's no curious to me like
there all this time they still refuse to
tell us how many Apple watches they've
sold and I think the number is just not
that great now we have some supporting
data here a recent report from Strategy
Analytics revealed how many Apple
watches has have been shipped this is
not sold but shipped since launching in
2015 according to their numbers Apple
has suppressed surpassed shipping a
total of thirty million Apple watches in
total that doesn't mean that's how many
they've sold but that's how many they've
shipped so obviously there's still some
on shelves I don't it's it's their
largest jump they said from at least
this quarter they shipped 2.8 million
Apple watch units versus 1.8 last year
in the same quarter so they are shipping
out more I see more and more in the wild
but I just don't know how many I can't
get a grasp on how many people actually
have bought an Apple watch it may be
they're just waiting for you know a a
keynote address or something when
they're you say we've sold 50 million
Apple watches like they're just waiting
for like one big square number but they
can brag about yeah I mean I think it's
a good point but even just telling us
that they've sold 25 million in two
years it's still pretty good
I mean it's 30 million shipped that's
that's pretty that's a lot shipped but
again I imagine how many were bought in
stores like in person and you know other
ways that's that's pretty huge other
earnings numbers Apple services that
makes up like Apple pay Apple music
iCloud things like that and yes they do
get a little percentage off of every
transaction from Apple pay Apple
services revenue for this year was 7.3
billion dollars why is that a big deal
Apple services division itself is now
the size of a fortune 100 company that's
crazy they have somewhere around roughly
1.5 million subscribers paying
subscribers to Apple music the last time
I think that's the last time I heard
actual paid subscribers I know they have
more users but paid subscribers around
1.5 million from what I recall just off
the top of my head so that business side
of theirs is growing air pods Tim Cook
address that he said that they're
increasing their ear pods production
capacity but still are unable to meet
the man
still the wait time on the site is like
six weeks like still when I see people
wearing them I'm getting more and more
jealous like I think I need a pair well
I'll tell you something I'm gonna keep
it real with y'all I bought a pair for
my lady I bought a pair for Shauna she
wearing like all the time like when
you're home not all the time but I think
as a woman because in general I'm not
gonna make a broad statement in general
girls have long enough hair that it can
kind of cover it it actually doesn't
look that bad for them right you're
always gonna see you're always gonna see
the d-bag with them but guess what who
if you don't it there's again I said
they're very very very good like I think
they're really good product they're not
like high tier great but they're just
there they make a few tweaks like that
I've talked about there'll be a really
badass product yeah but they're really
really good I got some like I want a
contest and I got some wireless earbuds
but they're not they're not Apple
earpods or whatever and they hurt my
ears so much man and I start like pining
for the you know the Apple earbuds
because they just hurt my ears so much
and I'm like if I just had the Apple
earpods my everything would be solved
here's the other thing like as a guy who
loves you know who's historically bought
some like the first versions of products
like I have the first iPod I have the
first g4 tubes still in my possession I
have the first Mac McIntosh to se I have
this is not bragging I'm just talking
about like why it was important for me I
have the g4 cube like I have a g4 cube
at home right Wow yeah it's one of the
dopest designs ever it was probably one
of the it was like way ahead of its time
it was too funky it was too expensive it
was hard to service back in the day but
I thought that was like to me that
epitomize kind of like Steve Jobs
thinking of like let's do something
crazy let's put it out there it's gonna
be a good product it may not be the
greatest but it's gonna be like damn my
mind just got blown by the form factor
of that machine I think it's beautiful
right and so I have one it's got as a
historian and so to have a pair of the
first Apple earpods and see what they
look like moving on forward I think it's
kind of cool just to have totally
totally I wish I don't have my first
iPhone just to like oh I saw these I
hope I still have my first I felt - and
when I see that I'm like this is amazing
like this
is amazing so you know just being just
being like a nerd like that it's good I
mean I'm wondering like for people that
are watching like what do you guys have
any of your original products still and
if you do just throw them out there I'm
just curious what they say because it's
like there's there's kind of a little
you know people that are watching the
show that listen to Apple byte stuff
there's a there's a fanboy nostalgia
although yeah we can be critical about
them because we should there's a lot of
people right that that have that felt
like that nostalgia built inside only
imagine you like held something like you
know you haven't seen something like
that for 10 or 15 years and someone
hands it to you you're just there's
gonna be a thrill Factory and I'd be
like whoa look at this thing it's crazy
like this is where it started that's
kind of a deal Safran on a the periscope
like iPhone 3G mine blew up and like the
battery exploded inside my really yes
with a camera with a video camera okay
we have a night to watch this all
flossin original iPhone 3G four or five
so he keeps all his phone's basically
that's cool that's cool that's pretty
sick that's fun it's like the museum the
museum so you can actually I mean go to
ebay you can find some cool stuff I have
the original iPod my own personal one
but I think on eBay you can find one
there's some that are like in the
original box like that you know do you
got people that buy them and keep them
sealed
they're like around I think 600 to
thousand bucks in the original packaging
still sealed that's awesome Apple Apple
Asif II I in our YouTube chat has an
iPod shuffle first-gen it was the white
it was like the white looked like it a
pregnancy testing the first iPad iPad
shop I thought it had like a lanyard and
it it had you know the physical controls
it looked like a pregnancy test oh yeah
yeah so it's totally long yeah that's
cool plus means a boy - means girl I
don't know
pretty cool okay I'm also another final
comment from the earnings report Tim
Cook did talk about how the apples kind
of foray into autonomous vehicles and
how that was doing because we know that
that was kind of like a focus focused by
Apple so he had some really interesting
comments to say about it give me a
moment to just pull this up because I'm
gonna get to his quote he said Tim Cook
in terms of autonomous systems what
we've said is that we are very focused
on autonomous systems from a core
technology point of view we do have a
large project going and we're making a
big investment in this from our point of
view he went on to call it the mother of
all AI projects and he added that
autonomous systems can be used in a
variety of ways a vehicle is one but
there are many different areas of it and
I don't want to go any further with that
so they're like totally thinking of like
an out-of-the-box way to use autonomous
vehicles then huh or just an autonomous
system period I'm just curious like I
don't know it got me thinking I was like
where are you going what are you going
with this Timmy did you hear about those
AI bots that learned that taught
themselves their own language and they
were like oh my gosh that scared the
crap out of that is freaky and then they
shut it down right so like like who'd
use Facebook yeah yeah it was Facebook
and they learned their own they learn
their own language they're communicating
like behind the backs of the developers
and stuff so when I'm hearing Apple talk
about autonomous vehicles doing other
things I'm like huh could that be well
I'm glad you brought that up because
this is kind of a cool tangent we can
touch on briefly I know it's the Apple
bite but really what the root of this
was is Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg
we're kind of getting and getting into
it you know arguing through
communicating through proxy of the
internet and Eli must have saying you
got to be careful about this stuff like
this is serious stuff and Mark
Zuckerberg is like oh come on you're
making this a big deal why are you
raining on our parade why you'd be
negative about AI and you know almost
like I'm not there's just concerns that
you have to be aware of and what you
just talked about Beach is that Facebook
has like their chat box that they're
trying to teach how to you know
basically an AI to talk to us
as humans and they found it wasn't even
in any it wasn't even in English these
chatbots were actually communicating to
themselves
yeah with a language of their own that
like a rule but don't big laugh
something yeah yeah that the developers
have never seen and they immediately
shut it down like because they were like
holy crap yeah that's how quick that
these robots can figure stuff out and
you know a another thing that's worth
mentioning is like this is happening on
Twitter right now like there's tons of
robots on Twitter and I bet you right
now there's probably a million people
arguing with artificial intelligent
robots on Twitter right now yeah I think
did I already say this in the show last
week maybe but it's kind of the same
thing like you know they're these things
are on Twitter and they leave stupid
comments or whatever and then people
will leave a comment back to them to
argue but nine times out of ten it's
probably a bot so it's just very
interesting what's happening in our
world right now you know well I'm gonna
tell you some of the people that I
interact on Twitter um they're really
smart BOTS based on the language they've
been using with me yeah big important
words they big four-letter word big real
complex ones too well ma'am we're gonna
we're gonna meet Apple AI pretty soon
that's gonna be just as scary all right
two more quick stories we're having a
very meaty podcast so I hope that you're
all still rolling with us and enjoying
this new emojis are coming out in 2018
it is always a lead story in most cases
but not this week yeah basically the
Unicode consortium which proposes the
new emojis that will be coming out
sometime in 2018 include because we all
need this a sad face pooh pooh OOP
routing pile of poo is proposed for 2008
see like come on so what I had a good
poop I had a bad poop like this is bad
like why do we express in on a pile of
dung you know there were some guys in a
meeting and they probably had a
whiteboard and they're like they're drew
the poop on the whiteboard we're like we
need a sad one is there a brainstorming
session this is it
other things include
extinguisher a test-tube even different
people events this needs of different
hairstyles a party face a cold face I
like the I like the love heart face I
mean people are gonna be using that tons
of times when they're trying to cupcake
their boo on on instant messaging and
stuff like that I do they like what the
hearts in the eyes that's what I do I
know you totally do that I do I do a lot
of the eggplant eggplant squirts that's
like that's one of our signature things
I'm showing plant squirt squirt squirt
kids don't don't
all right I like to do with the shades I
wide trying to keep it cool trend is
that when how do you what in what
context you use the dude with the shades

you know getting back to someone and
just being like okay cool I just put the
deal with the shades you didn't respond
to my eggplant splash splash splash last
night really disappointed seriously you
should have just dim in the cool face
back right back thinking about you okay
last story the show before we get to the
awesome phone calls this one is great
thieves stole five hundred ninety
thousand dollars worth in iPhones from a
moving truck this is like straight out
of fast and furious about a week ago
according to you know reports from the
Netherlands five Romanian men average
age 33 to 43 and there's even like a
little video clip in there that you can
kind of the style that's not from the
actual heist but it's a way that they
have this is actually a known method I'm
stealing from cars so basically they put
the car behind the big van or the big
truck with the goods and they pretty
much right up to it and a guy will the
guy will climb on top of it like oh yeah
totally
so they believe this gang is responsible
for up to 17 similar highway heists
this is just insane but they were able
to throw up to a car I don't I don't
know
cut out of the top of it or they open
the back doors but either way they stole
five hundred ninety thousand dollars
worth of iPhones that's a good chunk of
change man that's a and you can sell
that stuff there's overseas on eBay
easily yeah you wonder how do you got an
iPhone for 200 bucks sealed and packaged
Jack that's that's why the Buy It Now
button worked some dudes were like
chasing a truck on a freeway it's
amazing all right so we get so we get to
our lovely calls just reminder for those
of you that are watching to be a part of
the show Apple byte nation you can call
us at 1-800-695-1418 to the iPad just
curious what your thoughts are on that
thanks a lot enjoy the show you know I
could be wrong but and I was first you
know I think if they they should have
put if they were able to get the tech
right and the biggest issue was that
putting 3d touch on a screen that large
was the obstacle but as I've used the
iPad more and specifically with iOS 11
the thing is that I always wanted the
iPad to do more but iOS 11 damn like the
iPad does more and I don't even actually
think about 3d touch on it and I just
think if it's gonna cost them so much to
do that they should just forget about it
on the iPad
and then really the next evolution of
the iPad screen will be when and if they
go to OLED on it which will be a while
because it's really expensive but my gut
tells me that they aren't gonna do it in
the iPad and they've kind of just said
oh we're gonna it is easier to hold in
one hand and just push down with your
thumb because that's really how you use
your iPhone
I could be wrong but I don't think I'm
gonna put in the eye I don't think they
have plans to integrate it in the iPad
and that was one of the reasons why I
was also frustrated out 3d touch cuz
it's not a standardized function across
all their touch devices which it should
be but something tells me if they
haven't done it by now and they're
working more on the true tone screen
over touch ID or sorry over 3d touch we
won't see in the iPad that's my gut all
right TriCaster kind of crashed on me
there for a second so are we operating
for yeah I think we're okay now just
when I'm gone so I caster I know we need
a new one up in here I do a freaking
professional show here okay all right
semi-pro semi-pro original xcall hey
what's up Tongan Beach this is Adam from
Utah recently moved here I'm loving it
in Utah but listening to the last
episode while I was in the shower and I
was getting really weird about all these
people complaining about the price of
the iPhone 8 I think it's gonna be
called the iPhone X but whatever you
want to want to go with on that here's
the deal there's two reasons why the
pricing is not gonna affect the sales of
the iPhone eight one we live in an era
now where it's payment plan everything
whether you go for the iPhone 8 upgrade
program through Apple or you do it
through the carrier people are already
paint making payments they don't
ultimately most people don't care what
the actual price is there's gonna care
about how much it is per month and
that'll be you know 5 10 bucks more a
month and we gonna blink an eye at that
all right what do you think about that
Brian yeah I mean I think he's right on
the money we've said it before that when
you break down a payment plans you don't
you know I I actually wonder how many
people actually realize how much the
phone they
the last phone they bought actually cost
like that's that's a good point yeah the
the payment plants are good but the
problem is in the in the long run you're
paying even a lot more for the phone you
know yes sir so that is something to
take into consideration the interest
rate yeah so you know I think that it's
yes all to that so I don't think it's
gonna stop people from buying it I
really don't but you know the 7s the 7s
and 7s plus if that's what it's called
I think there's still gonna be plenty
people that buy that the the crazy thing
about the earnings is that remember
Apple was complaining earlier in the
year that all these rumors were slowing
down the sales and Apple although
slightly they were and everyone still
has an iPhone Apple was actually
positive and up on sales with the iPhone
before compared to last year so this is
before the iPhone 8 comes out dude it's
gonna be big it's gonna be gangbusters
for sure it's gonna be big yeah
all right next call number three here we
go hey guys this is Garrett here from
Dallas Texas I just had a quick question
for y'all for the iPhone 7s what do you
all think the features that Apple is
going to bring to the 7s and the 7s plus
there's been a lot of talk about the
iphone 8 and what's going to come to
that but people are still gonna buy the
cheaper option so nobody's really
talking about you know what features are
going to come to that the lower-end
models I guess you could say just wanted
to hear y'all thoughts oh also the other
question I had was what do y'all think
of Apple having a lot of issues getting
the iPhone 8 into production
I mean Samsung whatever they came out
with the Galaxy s8 if we didn't really
hear this many problems coming from them
whenever they had to get the phone into
production so I just wanted to hear your
thoughts on that
thanks love the show so let me I guess I
will address first about the getting the
iPhone in production I mean we just kind
of talked about earlier story of how
yeah Samsung is ramping up and
it's gonna be pretty good to go so I
don't I don't I don't really see any
major issues that I think part of it is
the only reason we hear about that stuff
all the time is cuz the rumor mills are
so all up in it right like rumor mills
they could hear someone's story one week
we're behind and in the next week they'd
be like oh we're back on track cuz
that's just how production lines change
it's it's not like just cuz one thing
happens doesn't mean it don't in many
cases you know when you build a product
it doesn't mean everything's gonna stay
delayed for that whole time you can
sometimes pickup time and other spots as
well in the process so that's the only
reason why we hear a lot about that what
was the other part of the question
I forget the second half of it actually
I think I think what we talked about
earlier look I think the big difference
is going to be the screen above
everything else
but as I'm as time has gone on look we
haven't even really seen many leaks or
rumors about the iPhone quote-unquote 7s
I think it'd be interesting if what if
Apple just kept the 7 as is and really
the 8 became the flagship and if you I
don't know if it serves again I could be
wrong I'm just I'm because we've talked
about this in every single permutation
what if they don't make a 7s and a 7s
plus and they just keep the 7 as then
the second tier phone they used to do
that in the past they want everyone to
focus on the iPhone eh yeah I could see
that happening again you know we don't
know for sure but look and also all the
rumor guys they're going after the 8
because that's one that everyone wants
to talk about right now so more than
anything though it'll still have a touch
ID button and it'll have a screen that's
not as good and then we'll see about the
camera the camera will most likely stay
I'm gonna guess it would stay the same
as it is on the current 7 and 7s because
they're gonna try and push everyone to
get the 8 as much as possible because
they're gonna make the highest margins
on the 8 even someone like me who
doesn't like a big screen phone is most
likely going to go for the 8 to cause
left hey guys it's Nick from Alameda hey
I just wanted to
touch base with you and tell you guys a
horror story that I had with my beta
upgrade one year whenever we moved out
to the Bay Area I went ahead and
downloaded Mac OS CRS I think it was and
it ended up frying my external hard
drive and the software that was on my
iMac so after a thousand bucks later I
had to go ahead and hit the hard drive
looked at and upon that they were able
to recover all my family photos and
everything but you know it still cost me
a thousand dollars so that's why I do
not and I will never update to a beta
again so thank you have a good day good
advice I would I would say his condition
is not normal you know what I mean like
using older stuff right yeah and just
just the fact there's like a beta
actually frying your hard drive I mean
it really doesn't happen that often but
it's always kind of a lesson where look
I'm never going to install a beta at
least if I can well actually take that
back I totally went all balls the wall
with the iPad pro beta this thing is so
amazing oh you know at least from an
Apple product that one I know I'm the
first to tell you that the surface pro
does more but man that the iPad pro now
feels like its own thing which is kind
of like really cool it doesn't feel like
even like a an older tablet it feels
like a new thing that it can't do what
others do although yes the surface pro
does more it's just fun to mess around
with so okay anyways to my point
whenever I'm putting a beta like Mac OS
beta I have an extra I have a I have
actually a hard drive that externally
that I use so oh that's cool yeah okay
the last call it's only 20 seconds long
and it's a good one so thank you for
calling here we go hey and I was I have
an iPad at first Jean is it worth to
upgrade to upgrade to the new iPad that
came how are they even the high
and Pro Brian Tom please help me man hi
Steven Beecham thanks Jerry yeah Jerry
Jerry Jerry love it um so is it worth it
- how about this the new I think it's
like priced at 3:29 than you and 9.7
inch that's not bad no no it's really
good um it's it's worth upgrading you
know I'm gonna check that before I
actually first-gen man that thing's
still kicking yes the first iPad air
that is the second gen iPad based on if
I recall right that is the second gen
iPad but I'm gonna tell you you know
depending on what you what you have out
yes depend on what you got there you're
gonna it's gonna be a world of
difference if you get the new 329 iPad I
was right about that there's so many
numbers in my head that the the new nine
point seven inch iPad is 329 but I love
the iPad pro the ten point seven inch is
the sweet spot it's if you I don't know
whether you use the pencil or not a lot
of people have told me I don't really
use the pencil I'll tell you why you
might start using the pencil I got um
that app affinity photo and I use
Photoshop all the time and I didn't even
it's it's not laid out exactly like
Photoshop but there's things that are
very similar I straight up edited a
photo from my Hawaii trip where I
plopped myself my family took a picture
in front of the shave ice place in Oahu
it's called why ollas you better get
your butt out there and we didn't have
anyone to take a picture so I took a
picture of it and then I had my family
members move and then I put myself
because I wanted at least the same
lighting the same general framing I put
myself where I'd want to be in the
picture and I never I didn't bring my
laptop with me at all which would be a
lot easier but I did it straight up with
a funny photo using the Apple pencil and
just kind of digging around and then it
was like I was like damn and when I sent
it
people didn't know I wasn't in the
original photo I got a slice photo man
that sounds amazing and so I just did it
through affinity photo for the very
first time it was you know it's not as
tight as I'd like it to be but for most
people there they would have never
blinked it
they didn't and I was like photos the
new Photoshop that they announced at the
last keynote right
Freck so affinity photo is not is not
from Adobe it's there it's a separate
product a company that made their own
photo editor that has have everything
from you know editing layers opacity
masks everything you can think of that
Photoshop does it does it for this and I
was like damn that was so sick I was so
happy about so um I'm just saying
there's another video there's video
editing apps that are out there the more
I I've dedicated I said in the next
month I'm gonna sit down to all the
tutorials and really learn how to use
this on my iPad because then I feel like
I'll really be getting value out of it
like a real value out of it super cool
man so I would say you know what anyone
who has a first or second gen iPad is
looking to get one go iPad pro get the
ten point seven inch you'll love the
true tone display you'll love the 120
Hertz rate if you want to use the pencil
you can but it's it's a beast it feels
so fluid like when I play on the iPad
and I see how fluid the screen moves and
stuff it's like man my desktop doesn't
even do this so it's this called first
world spoilage boilage not even problems
just straight up spoiled just stupid
stuff like that but we are blessed to
have all these crazy things around it so
um yeah I think I think it we're good
I'm good for the day music so man I
think we are done did we hit an hour I
think we hit an hour we had to kiss I
think our last show was last Tuesday so
you know this is kind of there's a lot
of news that happen in between then and
now so gonna make it alright everybody
