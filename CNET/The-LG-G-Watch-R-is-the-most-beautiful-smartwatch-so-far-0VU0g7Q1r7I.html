a SmartWatch so they won't be ashamed to
wrap around their wrists it's called the
LG G watch R and it's the most visually
striking of all the android-based
smartphone is absolutely the reason to
be excited about this watch unlike
almost all other smartwatches this one
actually managed to look like a regular
watch and an attractive one at that the
body is round rather than square it's
made from black metal there are numbers
and notches around the race rim to help
tell the time and it uses a real leather
strap I think it's the best-looking
SmartWatch we've seen although it's
chunky angular appearance won't be to
everyone's taste
there are various watch faces to choose
from and these really helped make this
watch look great many of the faces mimic
classic analog watches we've slender
silver hands ticking around dark
background some of the faces are so
realistic in fact that you need to get
quite close up to tell that it isn't a
real watch some faces also give extra
information to Fitness one for example
it shows a tally of your steps rather
day while the hiking shows a compass and
your elevation the crown on the sides
acts as the home button there's a heart
rate monitor on the back and it's
waterproof to 1 meter for up to 30
minutes selects designer size this watch
is functionally identical to every other
Android wear SmartWatch as the software
remains completely unchanged when
connected to your Android phone the
watch will display card show
notifications or other information which
can be dismissed with a swipe you can
perform searches or reply to emails
using voice commands and it's here the
watch rather falls down although asking
will I need a jacket tomorrow quickly
brought at the weather forecast
dictating email replies frequently went
wrong
although the LG G watch art is the most
beautiful SmartWatch we've so far seen
it's basically just a prettier wrapper
for the same disappointing software
Android wear can perform a few neat
tricks but it doesn't yet provide
anything that's essential or even
particularly exciting and even the
things it can do don't work as well as
they should if you're a dedicated
Android fanatic and are itching to put a
SmartWatch on your arm and G watch R is
the best of the current crop to go for
if you're after the device that will
usher in a new area of communication
you're still in for a bit of a wait I'm
Andrew Hoyle for C net and this is the
LG G watch
