seem to be long enough ever isn't it
I've received so many emails for your
guy asking me how to make it longer and
by 8 of course I make the Wi-Fi range
and well today I have something to
extend just that and this is the XY's
LPL our 4 to 3 100 megabit per second
powerline violence and extender that's
right it's quite a mouthful but hey it's
with it if the long name indicates how
much more Wi-Fi range we'd get out of
this now the sizer here it actually a
two-port power adapter meaning if you
have a power light reading network at
home you can plug this into another
power socket and then you can add two
more white devices to your network on
top of that is also have a built-in
Wi-Fi network that means you can also
add other Wi-Fi ready client to a
network to now this device come in a
step on design but it's not exactly
compact that means when you use on a
power socket
it will likely block the access to other
sockets nearby it also doesn't come with
a pass-through socket this means you do
not want to use it at the far corner
where there's only one won't suck it
because you can apply anything else to
that socket but in that case though it
still worked as a Wi-Fi device so it's
not completely useless it will be
however completely useless if you use it
in a home when there's no other power
adapter so make sure your home network
has at least one powerline adapter such
as this one from action tech here before
you get yourself this size L device over
here you can see that it has a WPS
button this mean it can quickly copy
existing Wi-Fi network and make that
aviso so if your home network support
WPS is very easy to set up the size l
otherwise it's quite tricky because you
have to figure out how to get to is web
interface in my testing desire here
actually turned out to be pretty good
with this in Wi-Fi range but it could be
a much better device if it come with two
more things Gigabit Ethernet and
dual-band Wi-Fi each support neither on
top of that is quite expensive costing
some $100 to find out more if it's worth
your money make sure to check out the
food with ESL comm and when you're there
follow me on Twitter Facebook or Google+
you'll be glad you do because in find
out that I am the only person of whom
the Wi-Fi network is just perfect not
too long not too short
that's because I'm don't know and this
has been the first look at the size LPL
our blah-blah-blah-blah Wi-Fi extender</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
