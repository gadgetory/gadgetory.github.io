once you've mastered blowing away
zombies alone you can work together in
local co-op multiplayer with three other
players for Team survival action both

think both are worth every penny if
dual-stick shooters aren't your cup of
tea check out zombie highway this unique
and deadly driving game challenges you
to drive as far as you can along a long
lonesome highway while ferocious zombies
try their best to make you crash to
drive for the longest distance you'll
need to tilt your iPhone to steer around
wrecked cars sideswiping them to knock
the zombies to the asphalt a stronger
zombies appear touch the red arrows on
screen to control your unseen
gun-wielding passenger another source of
damage against the relentless zombie
horde once you pass certain milestones
in the game like driving a specific
distance for example you'll unlock
weapons for your backseat passenger that
you can set up before each run with your
passenger properly equipped and a little
luck you'll stay alive on the zombie
highway well for at least a little while
zombie highway is a one-of-a-kind
driving game in the app store and goes
for just 99 cents well our first two
zombie game picks will help prepare you
for the coming undead apocalypse the
last game might be required playing for
lasting on a zombie infested world call
of duty world at war zombies gives you a
graphically intense first-person shooter

lift barricades to open up other areas
