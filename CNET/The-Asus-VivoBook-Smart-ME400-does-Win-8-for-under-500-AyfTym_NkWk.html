a look at the assistive vivo Tam ME 400
yet another in a seemingly endless line
of Windows 8 tablet slash laptop hybrids
like a lot of the other recent ones
we've looked at this is an Intel Atom
system which means that it's got a lot
less power under the hood than a core i5
to have it like the Microsoft Surface
pro but it's also a lot less expensive
like most of the Intel Atom tablets
we've seen the base unit here which is
just the tablet the 10 inch touchscreen
tablet starts at 499 and then you can
add accessories in this case it's this
detachable keyboard it's actually just
totally detached it doesn't even clip on
and a little cover that kind of folds
the tablet in together so when you put
those two on that's another $130 which
means that you're spending more than
let's say entry level for an iPad but
you do get the full Windows 8 operating
system since most of these windows 8
Intel Atom tablets perform around the
same it really comes down to which
tablet style you like and what sort of
keyboard you want some of them have clip
on keyboard some of them have totally
detached ones like this some of them
don't really have custom keyboards
available at all I really like the
concept of the separate little super
thin keyboard with a touch pad and the
little Smart Cover is a little confusing
to figure out at first but then I got
the hang of it this cover folds up here
almost origami style you take the
keyboard when you're done with it you
slip it right on top of the screen it
matches right up and then you fold this
up here and then you've got a nice
little package ready to go with you now
when you're ready to actually unfold it
again you put it down open up the cover
take your keyboard out this is where it
got a little bit tricky for me you fold
this back here and then you have to
figure out exactly the right way to fold
it it took me a couple of tries now I
think I finally got it down so it makes
sort of a stand for the tablet and then
you just push your Bluetooth keyboard
right in front of it now these Intel
Atom processor tablets they're not going
to play games they can do HD video
streaming just fine apps that are really
designed to work well with the atom in
Windows 8 like IE 10 and Netflix tend to
work fine the big trade-off you're
making is less processing power but more
battery life we got
eight and a half hours out of this guy
which is certainly enough for a full day
although with the small 10-inch screen
and the low 1366 by 768 screen
resolution this may not be enough muscle
to be your full-time every day all day
computer this is more of a secondary or
travel system I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the assistant vivo tab m400</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
