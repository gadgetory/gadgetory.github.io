a first look at Windows Phone version
8.1 Microsoft adds a whole slew of new
features in this update including live
tile backgrounds a whole new column of
live tiles on the Start screen and of
course the star of the show Cortana a
voice assistant to rival Siri and Google
map right off the bat you see a
difference on the Start screen with 8.1
there's an extra column of live tiles so
you can fit more of them on the screen
you can have one wide tile and one large
tile side-by-side or six small tiles in
one row you can also set a wallpaper on
your home screen which will show up in
the live tiles that use your phone's
theme such as your settings and the
camera the wallpaper Scrolls as you
swipe up and down on the Start screen
Windows Phone finally gets a
notification center and 8.1 it's called
Action Center and you swipe down from
the top of the screen to reveal it at
the top you can toggle on and off common
settings including Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
brightness and you can even customize
those options in the settings menu below
that there's all of your notifications
grouped by app you can swipe away each
apps notifications individually or clear
all of them at once
the next star feature is gesture typing
where you can swipe your finger around
on the keyboard to type it's faster than
pecking the keys and just about as
accurate now for arguably the most
interesting addition to 8.1 Cortana like
Siri Cortana is a female voice assistant
who can help you search the web set
reminders and directly call anyone with
just a few commands call mom you can
enlist her help by tapping the search
key on your phone then either type in
what you need or tap microphone to speak
it you can talk back and forth with
Cortana for more complex commands such
as creating a new calendar event she's a
bit more witty than Siri and Google now
and has a good dose of personality
what's the meaning of life I've heard
from a reliable source that the answer
is 42 but still no word on what the
question is the operating system also
adds a bunch of smaller features
including separate volume controls for
ringer and notifications and media and
apps we get Internet Explorer 11 and
Wi-Fi sense what
automatically connects you to open
public wireless networks Microsoft's
latest update to Windows Phone brings
the mobile operating system closer to
iOS or Android but it still has a ways
to go before it's going to lure
customers away from either platform for
a full look at the new features check
out my review on Sina comm I'm Sarah
