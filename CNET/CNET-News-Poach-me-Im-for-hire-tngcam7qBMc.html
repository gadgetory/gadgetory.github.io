like hacker news and dribble they got a
lead to check out job poacher calm a new
free tech oriented website where job
seeker enters very basic information
like tidal current salary and desired
salary on Everett kradin is a full-time
software engineer who created job
poacher in his spare time as an
alternative to the traditional process
of uploading a resume and cover letter
back to the guys in San Francisco
through job poacher they connected with
Carlos Rose Kia's and Tijuana Mexico I
looked at the site very low barrier to
entry no credit cards anonymity you know
it felt like Craigslist for jobs it
basically said you know I am a designer
earning ex who wants to earn y and x and
y were within our range as interviewed
by paul with circle and the rest is
history within 10 days carlos quit his
job to telecommute for Circle C I in
California so far I absolutely love it
job poacher calm has been online for
only six weeks but already more than
three thousand users have uploaded the
profiles in San Francisco I'm Kara
