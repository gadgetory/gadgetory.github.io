keys your wallet or even your phone then
you may want to invest in something like
this
I'm Jessica Valcour for CNN and this is
the nokia treasure tag now this is
simply a Bluetooth tracking device that
uses Bluetooth Low Energy and NFC for
pairing if your phone has that that you
don't need NFC on your device to use it
in fact you don't even need a Windows
Phone or a Lumia it also works with
Android or iOS so it's small and square
there is an optional loop that you can
take off it's got a button in the center
and you will press this to find your
phone on the other end your phone has an
app that controls the device so if
you're disconnected for example you can
see where you were last on a map you can
also press a button in the app to find
the device so it works both ways if you
know where your key is you can find your
phone if you know where your phone is
you can find whatever else this is
attached to although it's pretty small I
found it was actually a little bit big
and chunky when I attached it to my keys
can't fit in your wallet so Nokia does
have a smaller size the treasure tag
mini that's half the width I personally
would hold out for that one it's a
little bit smaller and it's gonna fit
into your life a lot better
I'm Jessica Belcourt for CNN you can
read all the pros and cons about the
Nokia treasure tag including how to set
it up and use it at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
