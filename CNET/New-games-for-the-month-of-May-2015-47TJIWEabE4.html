finally here spring is in the air the
weather is getting warmer and summer is
right around the corner but forget all
that crap because you want to be with me
inside playing video games here's what
you can look forward to playing in the
month of May damn not
up first on May 5th is a standalone
prequel to last year's fantastic
Wolfenstein reboot the new order now the
prequel is titled the old blood and it
will let players once again take on the
role of BJ blaskowitz in two separate
campaigns as he infiltrates Castle
Wolfenstein and kills more Nazis more
dead Nazis that's great project cars
will hit consoles and PC on May twelfth
and aims to be the ultimate motorsport
simulation game that's been entirely
community funded on May fourteenth PC
gamers will finally get access to axiom
verge which is a 2d platformer that's
already out on PlayStation 4 nearly any
computer can run axiom verge I love that
game and make sure you play it I'm going
to preview the witcher the next
installment in the open world RPG series
The Witcher will be hitting consoles and
the pc on May nineteenth in the witcher
3 wild hunt the witcher 3 is set to be
30 times larger than previous Witcher
games and twenty percent bigger than
Skyrim that's insane and finally on may
29th the wii u will finally be getting
some love in the form of splatoon which
is a team-based third-person shooter
which encourages 4 on 4 multiplayer
matches players compete to cover a map
in their teens ink before the time runs
out

mention your most anticipated game for
May we'll just yell at me on twitter at
