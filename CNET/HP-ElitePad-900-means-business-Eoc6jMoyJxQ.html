look at the HP elite pad 900 this is
HP's business focused Windows 8 Intel
Atom powered tablet now of course we've
taken a look at a lot of these Intel
Atom tablets that all run Windows 8 you
know they've got touchscreens they're
all fairly similar slates what makes
this one different for business users is
that it's got some security stuff built
in that your IT department will be
interested in interestingly it doesn't
have a USB port or an easily accessible
SD card slot or anything apparently
that's a concern for for corporate types
sometimes for security you don't want
someone to be able to I guess slip an SD
card in or USB stick and steal your
company data right away you can however
get all those connections on various
accessories and jackets and dots and
stands that you could buy with the elite
pad and that's probably the most
interesting thing about this system
versus other Windows 8 atom tablets that
we've seen is that there's a really nice
ecosystem of stuff you've got the actual
tablet itself I've got a dock right here
a nice weighted dock that has some ports
and connections in the back including
HDMI and VGA and then you can also get
this sort of jacket right here and
that's got some connections on it also
and even a panel where you can put in a
sold separately battery and make it kind
of a battery pack to give yourself a you
know longer time away from the plug and
there's also a keyboard case they call
this one the productivity jacket and it
folds up kind of like an iPad keyboard
case does and then you slip the tablet
inside and it's actually got a very nice
hefty keyboard right here and some ports
and connections in the back the one
problem I had was when you have the
tablet in this productivity jacket too
great keyboard experience but there's no
little touchpad like on the Microsoft
Surface pro the no little pointing stick
like lenovo has on one of its tablet
keyboard stands so you're basically
stuck with using the keyboard and then
your finger as a mouse which that
doesn't really work that great for basic
productivity I actually ended up pairing
this with a standalone
pad but you could do that with a mouse
and that works also but I really would
have liked to see that built-in another
thing that's a little bit different
about this particular tablet is that it
has a sixteen by ten aspect ratio screen
instead of a sixteen by nine screen
which is what you see in most consumer
products that gives you a little more
vertical space to work with a lot of
business laptops are actually still like
that and of course the biggest
difference is in price this starts off
at $6.99 for 32 gig version this is the
$7.99 version you do get a mobile
broadband antenna for that and then when
you add all of these different
accessories that cost anywhere from
seventy nine to two hundred dollars if
you got all this stuff you'd be spending
about twelve hundred dollars which is
frankly enough to buy a 13-inch MacBook
Air or the Microsoft Surface pro which
has a Core i5 CPU or a lot of other
different types of laptops or tablets
that really means that for consumers
this kind of guy is only worth getting
if you have a company IT department
willing to shell out for it for you I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the HP elite
pad 900</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
