the both of us this is the open a
challenge of experience over youth I'm
Veronica Belmont and I'm Tim Moynihan
welcome to the first annual 2007
parallel park off we're here in downtown
San Francisco at the beautiful tehama
parking stadium and our competitors
Wayne the cunning Cunningham and Kevin
Maserati Massey will be trying to park a
2007 mini cooper s in an ever-decreasing
Lee sized spot yes whoever hits the
cones first will be immediately
eliminated so let's go talk to our
competitors yes so i'm here with wayne
cunningham so Wayne tell me what is your
strategy today well I've already
limbered up with a few you know steering
stretches you know get those arms
limbered up and now I have a bit of a
tough question for you how do you think
your reputation has suffered since the
great Lexus automatic parking debacle of
a couple years ago I mean you know I
think a lot of those allegations people
have forgotten that by now you know sort
of a tempest in a teapot well we won't
be using any kind of resources like that
today will we there's no devices allowed
no parking devices allowed this is pure
hands on the wheel pure parking
adrenaline all right back to you Tim
thanks Veronica now Kevin you've been
training pretty hard for this their
reports that you were actually training
with a Winnebago with no steering wheel
how did that work out yeah that was that
was the ultimate kind of crest of my
true my training I up I've been in
pretty constant preparation for this
since release the beginning of the year
most mornings at 4am it's all about
focus for me i'm just going to be
looking at the road look at the mirrors
this is also a mini you know from my na
from the UK so i'm pretty confident that
that with a machinery now how about the
steering wheel being on the other side
is that is that a extra challenge for
you oh I didn't realize the steering
wheels on the other side okay well yeah
and I will push on through and out and
that's going to definitely be a
challenge great should be a great battle
looking forward
so that was the end of round one or both
our contestants are still in the running
let's go talk to Kevin from now on I
think it's all going to be mental more
of a more of a mental game mental game
all right well the cones have been moved
in a foot so let's see how you do in
round two
we're here with Wayne round two is
completed pretty look pretty easy for
you out there yeah you know I think I've
got a good measure the space even though
that was you know foot tighter than our
first attempt and good good idea of the
size of the car too
he's coming in at a very sharp angle woo
very close to the cone they're very
close to the cone so it looks like he's
a little bit of trouble here what if he
tried to pull the car all the way out in
murray park it at this stage well that
would actually be a disqualification
once you make your entry you're done so
what is the actual legal distance that
you have to be from the curb or within
that range well the regulations state
that DPT goes by this too is it 18
inches from the curb as a legal sports
park I see a sweat breaking out on
Kevin's forehead here oh down goes
Massey oh he has hit the front cone man
you know I was just exhausting it they
got me in the end steering was was
killing me in and the the forward and
back motion was making me a bit dizzy so
you know it's just a it's a it's just
tough you know it's a cauldron in their
pressure cooker all right so kevin has
hit a cone that means you have to
parallel park this one in order to be
the champion yeah I'm not going to
accept the tie here just won't do it all
right well this is for the championship
good luck thank you
but congratulations Wayne you are this
year's parallel park off champion thank
you how do you feel I feel good you feel
really good yeah a lot of training paid
off just a gritty performance from both
you here at tehama parking stadium do
you have any parting words for the fans
out there well you know just from my
perspective I want to thank my team and
I'm a coach a lot of people who
supported me through that through the
training and the end playoffs or the
park off so I guess there's a good
challenge Kevin yeah well thank way
alright well we'll see you next year at
the annual parallel park off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
