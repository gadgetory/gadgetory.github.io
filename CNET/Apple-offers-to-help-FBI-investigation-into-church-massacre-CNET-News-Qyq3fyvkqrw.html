regarding the recent Texas Church
shooting on Saturday November 5th a
gunman opened fire at the First Baptist
Church in southern Springs Texas he
killed 26 people and injured 20 others
the gunman died later that day due to a
self-inflicted gunshot to the head
on Tuesday the FBI held a news
conference saying it had obtained the
gunman's phone and was sending it to the
FBI crime lab in Quantico Virginia
because law enforcement located in Texas
could not unlock the phone while the
model of the phone was not disclosed
reports say it was an iPhone a source
tells Reuters that knew the FBI nor any
state or local enforcement attempted to
contact Apple during a crucial 48 hour
period if the gunman's phone was an
iPhone and it was locked using touch ID
the phone may have been unlocked using
the gunman's fingerprint within 48 hours
of the last time the person unlocked his
phone this also requires the phone was
not restarted or powered off if a
fingerprint is not used to unlock the
phone after that 48 hour window a
passcode is required to unlock the phone
Apple issued a statement saying our team
immediately reached out to the FBI after
learning from their press conference on
Tuesday that investigators were trying
to access a mobile phone we offered
assistance and said we would expedite
any legal process they send us the FBI
and Apple had issues in the past when
Apple refused to comply with a court
order to decrypt the phone belonging to
the shooter in the 2015 San Bernardino
