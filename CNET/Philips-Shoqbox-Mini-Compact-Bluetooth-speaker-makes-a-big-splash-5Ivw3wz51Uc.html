first look at the Philips shock box mini
due to the speaker if you're shopping
for a small speaker to pair with your
smartphone well you've probably noticed
that there's no shortage of options just
right here I have the Logitech X 100 and
another the Philips flex so these are
all well under a hundred bucks but the
Philips sets itself apart with its IP X
six certification which protects it from
splashes of water and rain that means
you can put it in the kitchen or even
bring it with you into the shower and
you won't have to worry about water
getting into the circuits so on one side
you'll find volume and playback controls
and on the other a water-resistant
gasket covering a USB port and an
auxiliary port here you can recharge the
device which is rated at five hours of
battery time kind of short for a
Bluetooth speaker you also get an open
three-and-a-half millimeter jack to play
music from a hardwired connection
there's no USB cable in the Box though
so you'll have to get your own the other
big cell on the shock box mini is an
internal limiter circuit that monitors
your music and keeps the audio signal
within the range of the amplifier so you
don't have to worry about your music
distorting even at the highest volume
now it didn't play quite as loudly as
the Punk did but it does cost about ten
bucks less and you get that extra
durability you can read more about this
speaker including comparisons to others
in my full review on SEANET but that's
going to do it for now
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the Philips shock box mini thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
