its phone release timetable it
officially unveiled the LG G 7 at a New
York presser overall the phone looks
similar to its g6 predecessor but here
are the five biggest changes in the g7
first and you can't miss it but there's
a notch popularized mostly by the iPhone
X the g7 has a notch sitting on the top
of its screen like other Android phones
including the Huawei P 20 and upcoming
one plus six the notch makes room for a
thinner bezel and houses a front-facing
camera and in your speaker if you don't
like the notch you can add black bars to
the sides for a more traditional look
second the g7 s camera has a few new
tricks but one standout feature is its
emphasis on artificial intelligence now
companies use this term liberally and it
includes a lot of different things
depending on who you're asking but these
features fold into LG's whole thin queue
smart devices branding the camera can
identify more than a thousand objects
and images and recognize scenes and
apply different photo settings depending
on the situation so if you're snapping
photos of a person a plant a sunset or
whatever it'll recognize it and adjust
accordingly keep in mind a lot of
cameras and phones already do some
version of this technology
speaking of AI the g7 has a hotkey on
the left for Google assistant similar to
Samsung's bixby button on Galaxy phones
the g7 is a first phone to have its own
button for assistant and it's not
customizable just like the pixel 2
phones when you squeeze their sides only
assistant launches there's a headphone
jack unlike a few flagship phones that
are ditching it the g7 still has a jack
for your wired headphones
lastly LG upped the g7 audio quality
though there's only one speaker the
inside of the g7 s body acts as a
resonance chamber and LG claims that the
phone's audio is 39% louder than the
Gees
during our brief time with it we found
that the volume levels were indeed
louder but we'll know more about quality
once we get our hands on a review unit
and that's the lowdown on the LG g7 for
more info including specs and photos
