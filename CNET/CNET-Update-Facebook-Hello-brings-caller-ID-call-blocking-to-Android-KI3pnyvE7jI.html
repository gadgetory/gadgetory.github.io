ID I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
CNET update Facebook is entwined in too
many facets of our digital lives but now
the social network is weaving itself
into your phone calls Facebook launched
a caller ID app for Android phones it's
called hello it tells you who is calling
even if you don't have that number saved
in your phone
that's because Facebook has a massive
database of phone numbers from its users
and it can match a phone number with a
name a majority of Facebook's billion
plus users share their phone number with
Facebook
however this app will only tie your name
to your phone number if in your privacy
settings you allow people to look you up
by the phone number you provided to
Facebook and by default that's turned on
for everyone now when Facebook matches
the name and number it also shows other
information such as where the person
lives their job and how many friends
they have in common with you the details
are based on what you're allowed to see
if you visited their profile if you to
look up a restaurant and if that
restaurant is on Facebook it'll show you
hours and directions along with caller
ID Facebook hello lets you block calls
from commonly blocked numbers these
calls go straight to voicemail
Facebook is growing its mobile audience
and that includes separate apps a tones
like Instagram and whatsapp 300 million
people use Instagram each month
800 million use whatsapp and 600 million
people are using facebook Messenger
Facebook is making lots of moolah on
mobile 73% of its advertising revenue
this past quarter came from mobile ads
and a majority of people are checking
into Facebook every day on a mobile
device now as Facebook expands its
mobile reach Amazon is expanding its
delivery reach by delivering packages to
the trunk of your car as if getting a
package to your door within an hour
wasn't easy enough next month Amazon is
testing a way to put your junk in your
trunk
the test is in Germany now with DHL and
the German automaker Adi when you check
out you tell Amazon the location of your
audio card and when the DHL delivery
person gets to a set GPS location
they can digitally open your trunk for a
moment without the keys the package goes
in and the trunk is closed
yeah I'm looking forward to learning how
this won't be used by car hacking
thieves and speaking of deliveries the
Apple watch will begin to show up on
doorsteps Friday for some of the very
first people who pre-ordered two weeks
ago but another SmartWatch is also
arriving soon the LG watch urbane is
going on sale in the u.s. next week in
the Google store it's the first Android
wear watch to have the latest software
feature that lifts at work on Wi-Fi
without your phone nearby that your tech
