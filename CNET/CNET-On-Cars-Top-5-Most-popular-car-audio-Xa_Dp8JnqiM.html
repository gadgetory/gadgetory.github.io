AM radio FM radio and a couple of tapes
that usually broke today we have a lot
more choices and a lot more preferences
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
things we love to be entertained by in
our cars now this list is according to
some recent research done by Edison and
Triton digital number five is online
radio streaming radio only about 6%
early days and among those online radio
sources Pandora still crushes it with
more preference than the next four
competitors combined number four
satellite radio at 11%
Sirius XM here in the US reached only
about half of its once lofty projections
of some 50 million customers it was
banded around back in the mid 2000s but
it is nearly ubiquitous from the factory
in new cars Winnebagos and even Harley's
I'm told it runs a hundred to two
hundred dollars a year which is kind of
steep compared to the ever decreasing
cost of mobile data and the streaming
services that ride on it number three is
your mp3 player at 13%
yep folks are still playing music off
their iPods probably because they own a
perfectly good one that refuses to die
and B they maybe found that it's nice to
separate music playback from all the
other chaos happening on your smartphone
number two is the venerable CD but down
at 15% yes the digital laser compact
disc because it was introduced almost
too much tech to absorb in that phrase
without sitting down back when it
debuted in 1982 today it just represents
so little music on such a large object
with so many tracks you have to buy that
you hate this year 2014 was the first
year we saw a trend toward automakers
starting to leave out CD players Lexus
offered the last cassette deck in 2011
who won't turn out the lights on the CD
slots number one as you might imagine is
am/fm radio at 58% and check this out
among those who say it's important to
stay up on new music am/fm comes out
even stronger with 75% preference but
then look at 12 to 24 year olds
and that's where it drops down to third
behind YouTube and at a tie between
Pandora and those young uns friends this
is the same group that gets their news
via tweets and social radios problem is
not today it's tomorrow more top 5 list
to wait the car lover go to see net on
cars comm click on top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
