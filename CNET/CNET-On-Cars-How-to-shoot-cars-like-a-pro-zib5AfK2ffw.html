and a dove gray Porsche 356 outlaw
pretty good toolkit for Michael Alan
Ross to use as we do a photo shoot today
I'm here to look over his shoulder for
you to find out what technology he uses
and more importantly what tips and
tricks we can use and the snap shots of
cars we take the back end of this car is
so unique with the louvers on it yeah
and I just love the way those little red
so it's a little simple red lights look
right now so what I'll do now is I'll do
some full shots of the rear of the car
do it in two different angles and then
what I'll do is they'll put the long
lens on and I'll actually go in and
compress all these little images around
from the headlights to the tail lamps -
those are your details on my little
detail stuff get that out of the way
interior is absolutely stunning so
Michael what are you doing now what's
this what's this current kind of
shooting at this hour you know in my
line of business you're always dealing
with the light so you have to work when
the light is right and that light is
either right first thing in the morning
or at the end of the day most people
think about a long lens for when they
can't get to the subject you can get
right to that car but using a long lens
what's going on yeah the reason I'm
doing is I'm compressing the car a
little bit compressing the image it'll
really bring the focus in on the car and
eliminate everything else it'll really
make that car pop out because everything
else becomes soft and everything else
becomes not that important an automobile
is reflective I wear dark clothing all
the time you told us as we were coming
out here
no white sneakers no like clothes I
never thought of that
everyone goes to like a car event you
know they're taking pictures of cars how
many times you're trying to get rid of
that white sneaker you wore the guy next
to your war or those khaki short right
there on the door
yeah cart it you have to realize you're
shooting a big mirror why so many shots
it gives the art director a little bit
of variation gives them a much broader
scope I kind of do it the old way I'd
like to see all the images in small
thumbnails on the screen no matter what
if whether it's digital or film that is
still the same if it looks good this big
and imagine what it's going to look like
last pic so I'm going to switch to 70 to
200 to eight-inch stabilization lens so
that I can utilize this light that we
have right
now so pop this one off first thing I do
hate dusts so I try to keep my lens down
even though there's there's you know
sensor cleaners here and here all that I
still do it the old way where we make
sure that the body is open as little as
possible you're using flash now for the
first time today what are the tricks to
make it look good
uh less is more direct it in another
direction use it bounced off of
something else if I had a white card
here and bounce the light away from the
car into the white and then have that
fill the whole thing evenly you know
most people would put the flash in here
but with this I take it up not only take
it up but I'm angle it if it's too much
I just swing it the other way what guys
do all the time what does any car person
do you know they oh let me see it look
under the hood how do you make this sexy
that's that's the that's the thing
everything's so precision like in there
and I want to bring that out a little
bit and and show you how beautifully
simple it really is I'll do everything
nice and crisp and then I will go in and
do some shallow depth-of-field thing
works better against the red I think you
look for the right car and you look for
the right photographer and the right eye
there's just there's all those sorts of
things that's all the technical and then
there's just a feeling and some of that
is captured in the moment with good with
good equipment and a good eye but also a
lot of its now captured after the fact
in post-production Michael is one of the
few who applies treatments that work for
me it's basically like a chef in there
gravy you know or you'll show us a few
of these steps but there'll be a few
ingredients you leave that of course I
can't give you everything Brian and you
know it's I say typically what do you do
to most shots the greatest hits for me
in terms of touch-up
I usually crop in the camera as much as
I possibly can but a lot of times there
are little things that you miss it's
always better to have more and be able
to come in and to be too tight and it
miss something so first thing I'm going
to do here is I'm going to go in and I'm
gonna crop this little piece out that I
don't like tour crop there's our crop I
don't like things that are centered your
eye has to start somewhere and it has to
go on a journey
if you start in the middle where do you
go let the mind to take a little journey
and then come back and arrest we're so
used to hi-def television and
everything's really popping right now so
a lot of times I'll take an image pump
up the blacks a little bit by pumping up
the blacks we're actually making those
other colorful pieces pop out even more
undressed exactly all these little
details around the window that's gonna
get a little bit darker all of a sudden
that blue starts to come out a little
bit more another look that's really
popular right now if it's kind of cars
got a little bit of an edge to it bleach
it out make it really a little bit
different now I've got an attitude there
I've lost the the blue line here I've
lost the color but I've got a real kind
of interesting a little effect it's
really about the mood I've seen you take
some shots and kind of just around the
perimeter on the very edges kind of
bring a little bit of a shadow a little
vignette a little vignette you don't
want to go too far where you notice that
yeah I did yes I never want to do
anything that makes it look like oh the
photographer did this yeah I want you to
look at the photograph and go wow that's
cool and not notice any of that that's
that's the key to it not go too far now
you may not be a pro shooter but with a
few tips from guys like Michael Ross you
can shoot cars like this pretty damn
well and the nice thing about vehicles
is that they're the best piece of moving
tech we encounter every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
