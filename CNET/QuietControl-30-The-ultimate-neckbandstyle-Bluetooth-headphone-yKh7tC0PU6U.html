this is the Bose quiet control 30
wireless bluetooth headphone with active
noise cancellation it ships this
September it is essentially the wireless
version of the QuietComfort 20 the
companies in your noise-cancelling
headphone that I really like now you've
probably seen plenty of people wearing
these neck band style wireless
headphones which LG pioneered with its
tone series but think of the QC 30 as
the ultimate neck band style bluetooth
headphone with impressive sound and a
$300 price tag to match it's premium
status not only is the build quality
really good but the headphone fits very
comfortably with an open design by open
I mean that you don't Jam the earbud
into your ear
thanks to boses stay here plus ear tips
which come in three sizes the bud sits
loosely in your ear yet remain securely
in place the only downside to an open
design is that ambient sound leaks in
and normally a headphone like this
wouldn't be good for noisy environments
but that's where the noise cancelling
comes in even though the design is open
ambient noise gets muffled and what's a
little different from boses previous
noise cancelling models is that you can
manually adjust the level of noise
cancellation by pressing a button on the
integrated remote or through boses free
connect app for iOS and Android devices
battery life is rated at 10 hours which
is decent for this type of bluetooth
headphone and a protective carrying case
is included elbows doesn't advertise the
headphone as sweat-resistant it is and
is suitable for gym use and maybe even
running if you don't mind the feel of
having something around your neck while
running QC 30 was designed to be used as
a wireless headset and it's a really
good one it muffles ambient sounds like
wind and crowd noise so colors can hear
you better and you can hear colors
better there's also a side tone feature
that allows you to hear your own voice
in the headphone as you speak so you
don't raise your voice while talking
this isn't the only new wireless
Bluetooth noise cancelling headphone and
boses lineup there's also the flagship
quiet comfort 35 a full-size wireless
model with best-in-class noise
cancellation given the choice between
the two
my personal inclination would be to wait
for this one but the QC 35 has its own
appeal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
