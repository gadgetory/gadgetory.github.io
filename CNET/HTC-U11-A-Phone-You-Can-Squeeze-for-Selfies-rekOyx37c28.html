won't break it what you will do is
launch an app like the camera of the
flashlight the voice recorder even
Facebook or the dialer the u11 is the
first phone that has pressure sensors
built into the frame you can set it up
to open two different apps this way for
example a short squeeze might open the
camera give it another quick squeeze and
you can snap a picture a long squeeze
can turn the flashlight on and off you
get the idea it's interesting and
innovative for sure and a handy way to
launch the camera not good for taking
steady shots though I do like that you
can program it to open just about any
app while squeezing to open an app is
the phone's flashiest feature it's all
the other high-end stuff is going to
make you want this phone like it's crisp
5.5 inch screen the very latest Android
software and the design that makes it
look like a pool of melted glass warning
it's extremely reflective and easy to
smudge in addition to that the U 11 has
Qualcomm fastest processor there's a 12
megapixel camera on the back and a 16
megapixel wide-angle lens up front and
guess what they're both pretty great
there's a micro SD card for external
storage and the phone is water resistant
for up to 30 minutes in a meter of water
or in other words three feet you'll get
a fingerprint reader but no headphone
jack sorry you'll have to use the USB C
port to plug in your wired headphone the
u 11 also has HTC the artificial
intelligence software on board which can
learn your habits and make certain
recommendations based on your schedule
and in addition to Google Assistant it
will incorporate Amazon's Alexa soon so
is the U 11 worthy of your hard-earned
cash
definitely but you'll want it because
it's a good phone not just because you
can squeeze the side
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
