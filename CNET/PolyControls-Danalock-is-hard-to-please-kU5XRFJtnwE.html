appliances standing here in my hallway
next to my front door with the Polli
control dana lock this is a $179 lock
that has bluetooth and z-wave
capabilities that means that as you're
getting close to your door it will sense
that you're getting close and unlock if
you want it to you can also use Wi-Fi
through your z-wave hub to access it
remotely using an internet connection
the data log is similar to the August
smart lock we recently reviewed in that
it retrofits to many existing dead bolts
so you don't have to really deal with
the guts of your lock you can just fit
this on top of your existing set up I
tried to install this lock first at our
office using a test store we had and ran
into a few problems first the base plate
didn't really line up with the hardware
of the existing deadbolt and it didn't
actually work after I got it set up so
altogether it took me about 20 to 30
minutes to set this up at home so the
beauty of a smart lock like this one is
that you can use the app to extend
virtual keys to friends and family for a
short period of time or for a long
period of time you can also get alerts
based on who's coming and going you can
make configurations remotely all kinds
of different things and also obviously
lock and unlock your front door from the
app we saw that functionality work out
really low at the August lock but it
didn't really work as well with this
lock it took quite a while for the
Bluetooth functionality to actually kick
in and communicate with the lock and do
what it was supposed to do this log also
has a knock to unlock feature which is
exactly what it sounds like you would
tap lightly knock on your smartphone or
whatever device you're using and it
would unlock the door for you i
triple-checked my settings I checked
troubleshooting but I had absolutely no
luck getting this feature
work so the most success I had was
really just pulling up the lock or
unlock buttons on the app and manually
pressing them which isn't all that
different than just grabbing a key and
inserting it into the keyhole anyway so
while I was really excited about the
dana lock it's a great price point one
hundred and seventy nine dollars for
Bluetooth and z-wave compared to the
August lock which is two hundred and
fifty and just has bluetooth the dana
lock ended up disappointing in the end I
really think the glitches I saw outweigh
the benefits so I would probably stick
with August for now if you want
something that can retrofit to your
existing deadbolt thanks for watching
