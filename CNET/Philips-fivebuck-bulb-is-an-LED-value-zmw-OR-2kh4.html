with the new Phillips 60 watt
replacement LED and this is a very
inexpensive bulb just five dollars off
the shelf at Home Depot and here at
launch for the first 90 days you can get
it at 241 pricing so kind of a heck of a
deal if you've been holding out for good
led pricing even at that low price point
it's a pretty strong performer it puts
out over 800 lumens of light at a power
draw of 8.5 wats giving it an efficiency
of 94 lumens per watt that's very nice
stacks up well against the competition
and I turn it on here you can see a nice
yellowy 2700 k color temperature and I
also like that the bulb is nice and
round has plenty of downward light
projected so if you're using this in a
bedside reading lamp that'll do the job
just fine now some of the downsides here
this boat does have a shorter lifespan
than a lot of its competitors many of
those promised to last 25,000 hours
that's about 22 years at three hours per
day that this one will last you 10 years
at that same rate also Phillips makes no
promises when it comes to dim ability
they rate the bulb explicitly as non
dimmable saying just don't even bother
trying to dim it we did and actually
found that you can dim it using both new
and old dimmers but your mileage may
vary sometimes it flickered sometimes
it's strobe even so if you want
something for a dimmer switch I'd go
something else the bottom line though is
that this is a pretty outstanding bulb
at less than five dollars a piece if
you've been waiting to try out LEDs if
you've been holding out to switch your
whole house over this might be the right
time to get in thanks for watching and
be sure to check out the rest of our
light bulb coverage at cnet com foresee
that appliances I'm right Chris
