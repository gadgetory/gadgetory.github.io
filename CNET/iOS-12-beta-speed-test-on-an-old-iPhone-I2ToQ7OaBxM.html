performance improvements over I Oh s11
especially on older devices you'll see
that apps launch up to forty percent
faster the keyboard can come up up to
fifty percent faster and you can slide
to take a photo at up to seventy percent
faster those tests from the WWDC keynote
were from an iphone six-plus
but we're gonna see how it performs on
the older supported phone that runs iOS
twelve the iPhone 5s we have two phones
both factory reset and we've closed all
the apps one is running iOS eleven point
four and the other is running the iOS 12
public beta this is not a scientific
test and given this is beta software
performance may change between now and
the final release of iOS twelve in the
fall let's start by launching some apps
for some like mail and Safari there is a
difference in load time
but others like maps and weather is
hardly noticeable opening the keyboard
for messages is a full second faster on
iOS 12 and launching the camera from the
lock screen is also faster with the
camera focused and ready to go about
half a second before iOS 11 apple claims
bringing up the share sheet is 2 times
faster when the system is under load and
it is significantly faster on iOS 12 as
you can see here as the series she
completes your command about half a
second faster on iOS 12 but for start-up
time iOS 11 pulls ahead with a good 9
seconds on a newer system so there is a
big improvement in some areas for the
older phone running iOS 12 but it's not
a clear win in every category and as
always performance is subject to change
in the final release</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
