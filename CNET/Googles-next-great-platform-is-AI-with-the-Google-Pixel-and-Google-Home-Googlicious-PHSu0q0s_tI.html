welcome for everything google this week
on google ish asst and really it's more
like last week sure it might be a little
late but i was on assignment with the
Nike mags in new york and yeah it was
awesome but it's never too late to
digest what we saw at google's latest
keynote with products galore now let's
start off with the small stuff and then
we're going to build up and dig deeper
from there first up the chromecast ultra
isn't going to shock the world but it's
a solid upgrade for sixty nine bucks the
support for HDR 4k and dolby vision
content and it's almost twice as fast
now this will make a great gift for your
tech obsessed friends and family and
it's available in november next up
google Wi-Fi is going to be a great home
Wi-Fi setup especially if you're looking
to build a single network that spread
over a lot of space the best feature its
network assist transitions you to the
best Wi-Fi point and channel that has
the least interference without you
lifting a finger like where have you
been all my life i'm talking about the
google Wi-Fi and not you so sorry if you
got confused now a single one is 129 and
a three pack is 299 pre-orders in
november available in december next up
google's daydream view vr headset is
made of fabric it's only $79 its thirty
percent lighter than most of its
competition and its controller fits in
the headset plus it works with the
google pixel which we'll talk about a
little later in the show now this isn't
a must-have for me I really like
Samsung's gear VR but it's $79 it's a
pretty cool holiday gift for someone you
know who's a techie and you don't really
know what to get them because they
pretty much have everything and they
happen to also have a pixel phone so
that doesn't sound like too many people
but I'm kind of lukewarm on it right now
okay now it's time to get to the big
boys Google home is their answer to the
Amazon echo and being an owner who loves
the echo himself I can't wait to match
them up against each other the biggest
advantage for google is there a Google
assistant and it's arguably the most
complex say I we've seen in a consumer
product along with the pixel phone now
that's where this is going to shine with
its complex ability to handle more
natural conversations queries and really
the power of the Google search engine
for information Alexis no chump but you
can already tell the Google assistant is
just smarter but then
and you'll still have to learn what it
can and can't do and what it can and
can't support just like the echo now
check this out amazon dominates when it
comes to hardware partners for smart
devices and partnerships with apps and
services right now when I say dominate
Google's home works with big hardware
names like nest samsung smart things
Phillip light bulbs in the chromecast
but literally that's it for now now
Amazon's echo works with hundreds of
thermostats smart bulbs fans light
switches outlets the list is ridiculous
and yes services galore so Google home
will need a catch up but it has a great
start and it will be interesting to see
how both of these companies push each
other to be better home costs 129
pre-orders start now and it comes to
stores November fourth and really this
artificial intelligence home assistant
is one of the most exciting areas in
consumer electronics right now but you
can never sleep on a smartphone and
google has finally put its stake in the
ground with a phone of their own with
the help of HTC it's the first google
phone called the pixel and pixel XL
finally hardware and software working
together a la Apple but in a google
phone now I'm not here to go spec
digging you can do that on your own
early reports claim the iphone 7 is
faster in benchmark testing but the
truth is that these phones are already
fast enough I look at these phones more
from the experience above all things so
check this out pure Android fans you
know you're going to love this phone
that's always been the case but now
we're talking about the smartest phone
on planet earth with the best AI in a
phone that we've ever seen artificial
intelligence is a platform and google
has the best one to date see it's
hashtag not a iphone get it AI like a i
phone something that Apple is
desperately trailing in compared to the
goose now this phone has the highest
rated camera ever on a mobile phone by
dxomark ensure it doesn't have that
fancy portrait mode effect but it has
the highest rated camera ever on a
mobile phone and even if you only
purchase this from verizon in the US all
you have to do is swap out the SIM card
and it will work with all the other
carriers now everyone is going to choose
their platform based on ecosystem and
preference but when you talk about
what's the next great thing on our phone
it's not the wallet or the camera it's
AI and even if you don't care
this one right now when you look back
this is going to be a key moment where
artificial intelligence made its first
big jump in the consumer space beyond
just a voice assistant on your phone now
the pixel starts at 649 it comes in
three colors quite black very silver and
the sold-out really blue I'm going to
get one is my work phone but not my
daily phone but come on we should all be
excited about where artificial
intelligence is taking us or extremely
scared because you know we're staring
right into the eye of a terminator to
future all right that's going to do it
for this week you can always email me at
Google issues at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong I love to hear about what you
think about Google's announcements
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for some more about
google issues google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
