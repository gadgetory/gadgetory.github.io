room or you just want to reclaim your
desk back from a clunky old printer well
this could be the new printer you're
looking for I'm Justin for CNET this is
a first look at the Epson expression xp
for 30 multifunction printer this is
another printer in Epsons line of super
compact devices the company calls them
small in ones which means it combines a
printer scanner and a copier all-in-one
the paper trays both fold up and out of
the way when it's not being used and
you'll be able to squeeze it into a
space that's roughly 15 inches wide 12
inches deep and 6 inches tall this one
is an upgrade to another already popular
model the XP 420 except this version you
get a slightly larger color screen on
the front and you get four of epson's
new cartridge models that protects your
prints from scratches and water this is
also a completely wireless printer and
the setup takes minutes if you already
have your Wi-Fi password handy Epson
takes care of all the connectivity
features you'll ever need including
Android and iOS apps for printing
snapshot pictures remote printing
through Apple air print and Epson zone
web app and also Epson email print which
lets you send jobs to the 430's unique
email address I'm pretty satisfied with
the output quality and print speeds of
this thing but like a lot of
less-expensive printers you're going to
end up paying a little more overtime if
you factor in the cost of ink refills
cartridge prices for this guy are about
average but you'll have to click over to
the full review to see how it stacks up
to competing models in the same price
range and that's going to do it for this
review you just took a first look at the
Epson XP 430 multifunction printer
