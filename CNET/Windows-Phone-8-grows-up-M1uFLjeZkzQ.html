beautiful and now it's also much closer
to stealing customers from iOS and
Android
I'm Jessica Dahl court from CNET and
I'll use this HTC Windows Phone 8x to
show you just what I mean now Windows
Phone 8 new Start screen gives the
mobile operating system a fresh lick of
paint the Live Tiles extends all the way
to the edges and you can cycle through
each one to change its size to small
medium or large just like Goldilocks huh
the result is more space for the tiles
you look at most and while you're at it
there are more theme colors to cosmetic
change comes also to the lockscreen
you can program it to give up
information like a Groupon deal of the
day Facebook Alerts and today's forecast
have you ever handed your phone to a kid
and worried that they might get into
parts that you don't want them to or
reset your keyboard language just for
laughs
well Microsoft execs have - they came up
with the idea of Kids Korner which is
like a second lock screen for the tykes
in your life you control which games
apps and music they see and they return
the favor by never accidentally calling
China NFC support is a major new feature
to come to Windows Phone 8 and tap and
send is probably how you'll encounter it
most you'll be able to use tap and sent
to share all sorts of content like
contacts photos Word documents and song
IDs it'll even work with some non
Windows Phone devices I was able to
share a URL with an Android Samsung
phone for example it's really neat to
use and saves you having to email
attachments and links to share with
others who have the same OS as you
Microsoft's wallet app is an offshoot of
NFC if the carrier lets you and if
there's a compatible point-of-sale
terminal at the store then you could
enter a credit card and tap to pay for
stuff but you can still use it anyway to
store credit card information and
details about other loyalty cards to the
phone's wallet also stores the info to
use on purchases you might make while
using the phone like to the built-in
music subscription service or an app
store and yes you can password protect
the wallet in fact I'd highly recommend
it
the Bing Search app gets a few more
extras too you swipe to see top
headlines videos movies and local deals
the local Scout app which is sort of
like Microsoft's version of Yelp now has
an extra column where it suggests places
that your friends liked or spots that
are popular one of the most innovative
features in Windows Phone 8 is the extra
camera lens functionality in the camera
basically you can load on-screen
controls built by third-party developers
to do things with their app the CNN app
for instance gives you an interface
where you can shoot video from the
street and submit it to the network as
part of a citizen journalist newscast
less sexy but definitely practical is
all the cloud syncing that goes on
behind the scenes if you decide to sing
things like photos and documents you can
view them from other Windows Phone 8
devices like your tablet or PC sinking
even more stuff like your text messages
helps restore the contents of the phone
if you lose it or it all goes kablooey
believe it or not the most useful new
features are buried deep within the code
Microsoft software allows phones like
this 8x to use multi-core processors a
high-definition screen and expandable
memory slots if the manufacturer wants
to use one this phone has the first two
but not the last the bottom line is that
Windows Phone 8 helps make really
gorgeous devices like this fast sleek
and highly desirable the OS isn't
perfect and there are still things that
Microsoft can do to even the sport like
integrating turn-by-turn voice
navigation for instance Android will
remain king when it comes to flexibility
and iOS still reigns when it comes to
simplicity but Windows Phone 8 is
starting to rise as a stronger third
option that has an edgy and powerful
smartphone personality all its own now
there's much more to see and for all the
details you should read my full review
I'm Jessica Dahl chord and this has been
Windows Phone 8 OS on HTC's Windows
Phone 8x smartphone
