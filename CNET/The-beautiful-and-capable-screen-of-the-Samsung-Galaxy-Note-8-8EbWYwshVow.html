entry in Samsung's note line of tablets
and tablet phone combinations and just
with the others you know it comes with
the S Pen Stylus stylus takes the place
of your finger allowing you to navigate
the interface tapping and swiping your
way through but since it's a pen instead
of operating away at a software keyboard
you can write your search queries or
email messages on the screen and have
the tablet translate your scrolling
prose into something intelligible it's
not one hundred percent accurate but as
long as you're making an effort to write
legibly most of the time it has no real
problem translating one of the coolest
things about the S Pen is that you can
grab a screenshot of pretty much
anything drop it in the S note and have
your way with it the note 8 takes design
inspiration from the note 2 there's a
menu button a home button and a back
button on the bezel there is a 1.3
megapixel front camera and a pretty
decent 5 megapixel back camera microUSB
is included as our dual speakers a
microSD slot headphone jack and ir
blaster the note eights body is thicker
in a bit heavier than the ipad minis and
while the mini is reinforced with an
aluminum back you know 8 is mostly made
of plastic it's comfortable to hold
however the face buttons are a bit too
touchy and I found myself pressing them
by mistake a bit too often I think it's
something I'll just have to get used to
though after a little bit of use multi
screen lets you run two simultaneous
apps splitting screen real estate
between them as you see fit however only
small few apps are currently compatible
with this feature there's also watch on
Samsung's TV and movie watching software
that lets you find the control movies
and TV shows from your tablet on your TV
or watch them on your tablet as well do
you know it has one of the best looking
screens I've ever seen on a small tablet
with crystal clear text and high
brightness and rich colors political
game is run at an acceptable playable
frame rate but
nothing beyond 2d games harbour look
gorgeous on the screen HD video content
as well benefits from the tablets high
ppi and rich colors the note 8 is a fine
continuation of the note line it has a
comfortable design beautiful screen lots
of useful software features and the
s-pen stylus is even put the better use
here than it was on the 10 inch version
check out my full review for pricing
info i'm eric franklin and this has been
a first look at the samsung galaxy note
