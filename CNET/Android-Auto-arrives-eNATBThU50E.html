phone and that combination normally
means some hodgepodge Bluetooth
connection this new Sonata as we believe
is the first production rollout of
Android auto in an affordable car it all
starts down here you cable your Android
phone into the system as if you were
gonna charge it let's say it's not
wireless right now then you lose the
phone look up here on the dash that icon
just changed to Android auto when you
press that you're about to enter the
world of your phone but on the dash for
example right here your home screen if
you will it's kind of a Google now look
at things you've done or looked at
recently or irrelevant to where you are
right now your round home button you
recognize that from your phone your
phone icon your nav icon hears music and
here's a return to main screen if you
get over here to navigation you
recognize that interface that's Google
Maps your google search box and this is
live and connected through your phone
plus the voice command to do that
beautiful freeform search that we love
that goes through the steering wheel
AT&amp;amp;T Park San Francisco here is AT&amp;amp;T
Park the beauty of this is that i can
get to my google voice command just like
on my phone i do it by doing a long
press on the voice button of the wheel
very much the way siri integrates in
some other cars and of course the
routing and traffic calculations the
same ones you have on your phone this is
just reflecting what's on your phone but
notice it's not literally taking the
whole screen and putting it there it's
artfully translating it to the
automotive experience and limiting it to
these main hints of apps calling is very
straightforward again touched a call
nice big clear button interfaces as well
to get things done on the touch screen
over here under music it goes to your
last streaming source from several on
your phone and if you want to get to
other choices it's got a drop down next
to it here are some music services with
more to come and here is a screen that
right now holds nothing more than a
return to the hyundai interface button
but that's kind of a playground where
other sorts of marriages of the car
maker and the phone and android system
can come together android auto is being
installed in all the remaining 2015
sonatas coming off the line as long as
they have navigation but you can also
down low
from my hyundai calm and as long as
you're 15 Sonata has navigation you can
update it also have Android auto and the
cost is nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
