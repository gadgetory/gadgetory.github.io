cnet.com and I'm here with the Philips
Fidelio headphones this is an on-ear
model it lists for around $200 but you
can get online for closer to a hundred
and twenty dollars so it's a pretty
decent value for what it is it's got a
nice design Philips is known for having
decent industrial design and it is a
pretty sleek headphone seems well-built
it's very comfortable it does have
memory foam in the ear cups the
headphone cable is detachable it doesn't
attach from ear cup however it attaches
from the cable itself so there's a
little bit of cable that dangles out of
the bottom if you do detach it that
court is cloth cover and there is an
integrated inline remote and microphone
that remote is a one-button remote but
it does allow you to advance tracks
forward and back as well as answer and
end calls when you're making cell phone
calls I did like how these headphones
sound they offer clear well-balanced
sound you're not going to get a ton of
bass out of them but they do offer
relatively natural sound one of the only
small drawbacks about them is they do
seem a little bit recessed the sound
isn't incredibly open with these
headphones but otherwise they're a good
sounding pair of headphones so all in
all a recommendable headphone I wouldn't
say the greatest sounding headphone for
the money but they are certainly decent
sounding and they are very comfortable
and that comfort level certainly counts
a lot when you're wearing headphones day
to day I'm David Carr noise and those
are the Philips
Fidelio m1 headphones thanks for
