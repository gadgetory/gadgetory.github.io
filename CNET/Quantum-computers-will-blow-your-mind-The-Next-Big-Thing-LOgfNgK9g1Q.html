this is wonkey but stay with me you know
how we're used to things getting smaller
and smaller faster and faster in
electronics what's about to happen with
quantum computing is going to make the
past look incredibly slow welcome to one
of our quantum computing labs IBM
recently announced a breakthrough in its
ability to store data on a single atom
now that atom can just represent a
single one or zero which may not sound
like much of an accomplishment but
that's the basic building block of every
file in the world right
CNET Steven Shanklin reports today's
best technology uses about a hundred
thousand atoms to represent 1:1 or zero
hundred thousand fold increase is pretty
impressive now you're probably thinking
right now great my USB thumbdrive
getting a hundred thousand times smaller
I'll never find it this isn't really
about driving smaller things in consumer
products complexity and power are
today's computers relatively big horsey
bits can represent either a 1 or a 0 but
atomic quantum bits called qubits can be
both a 1 and a 0 based on the particles
magnetic state often compared to the
direction of a compass needle on top of
that orientation is a layer of
probability of that orientation which is
in itself another form of information on
the same bit and when you gather an
array of particles with such rich
information their density of storage or
of computing power scales exponentially
that can lead to machines that can
actually make calculations models and AI
learnings that are impossible today the
weather forecast might become a
guarantee or cancer detection a
certainty many researchers feel quantum
computers don't so much replace today's
classical machines but pick up where
they're about to peter out you see we're
fast approaching some physical limits of
Moore's law which has been driving these
convulsive increases in processing speed
and data storage density that's because
these little tiny microscopic
connections you see on an integrated
circuit are actually in the way quantum
computing goes to a whole other level
where those are no longer a hurdle idea
of putting quantum computing on the
cloud it is the beginning of something
in truly important now don't start
thinking this quantum computing
technology is coming to your phone or
your laptop anytime soon it's being
envisioned largely as cloud based
machines that can store incredible
amounts or do amazing calculations but
that of course begs the question where's
the pipeline to then deliver that
performance down to the end user
be it an individual or a company or
organization 6g anyone to know what's
next in the world of technology go to
