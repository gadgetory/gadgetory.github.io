becoming compatible with a little-known
technology called USB on-the-go or USB
OTG it lets you tune your phone or
tablet into a USB host and connect
standard USB accessories like flash
drives hard drives gaming controllers
keyboards and more by now I'm sure
you're wondering how the heck you're
supposed to connect a USB device like
this into a micro USB port like this
well the secret is this 2 dollar USB OTG
adapter you can find it online at a
place like Amazon for a few bucks or
less like I mentioned though it's not
compatible with every phone and tablet
and in some cases only handful of USB
accessories will work with your phone
but the Samsung Galaxy s3 coupled with
the OTG adapter works with an impressive
number of USB devices
why don't I demo a few starting with a
USB flash drive when you plug a flash
drive in the phone will immediately
display the contents from here you can
play back or view any media you have on
the drive you can also move data from
the USB drive to your phone's SD card by
tapping and holding the file you want to
move other storage devices including
memory card readers will also work with
the adapter so in theory you could shoot
photos with your digital camera and
quickly transfer them to your Android
phone for editing and uploading on an
app like Instagram if you do a lot of
typing on the go you'll be happy to hear
that with the adapter you can connect a
keyboard to your Android plug it in fire
up a notepad and you can start typing as
usual you can even use shortcuts like
control a and control Z but what really
surprised me is that when you plug a
mouse into the USB port even a wireless
mouse a pointer shows up on the screen
from there you can use the mouse just as
you would your finger you can swipe
through pages select icons and more I
can't think of any practical
applications for this but it is pretty
cool ok this one is crazy and awesome
you
connect a ps3 controller to your Android
and not only navigate the interface like
swipe through pages and apps but you can
also play games just plug the controller
into the USB port and launch a game like
Super Sonic not every game works with
this so you'll have to do some testing
to find out if your favorite games will
work but in Sonic for example I can use
my ps3 controller the way I would a
psycho controller running jumping all
those actions work swiftly with this
setup from what I hear the Xbox
controller works too but I haven't
tested that yet so those are just a few
ways this $2 cable can make your Android
device a whole lot more useful and fun
my advice is to try other devices - like
a USB microphone or even a MIDI keyboard
for you musicians
if you discover any cool uses please let
me know on Twitter and check out my blog
on how to see Netcom for the complete
guide to the USB OTG adapter for C net
