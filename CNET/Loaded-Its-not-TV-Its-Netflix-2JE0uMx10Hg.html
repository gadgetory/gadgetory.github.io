Morris and it's time to get loaded
Netflix may become a production house
like HBO and Showtime the company is
said to be close to acquiring the rights
to a TV show called house of cards the
show has been created by the same person
who directed the Facebook movie David
Fincher Netflix has not yet won bidding
for this show but they're said to be in
the running for 100 million dollars
t-mobile announced the sidekick 4G this
is the first sidekick that's an Android
phone it still has what they call the
pop tile hinge that opens to a qwerty
keyboard
it also has group texting and something
called cloud texting which you can use
to text with friends or groups across
platforms it comes out this spring you
can learn more at psychic t-mobile comm
you can now watch live baseball on
Facebook last week the site had its
first movie rental and now sports the
Major League Baseball Facebook fan page
started streaming preseason games this
week you can watch one game for free but
if you like it you'll have to pay $120
per year for MLB TV to continue to watch
on the site google may be planning to
test a mobile payment system in the next
few months using near field
communications short-range wireless
systems customers in New York and San
Francisco will be able to use their cell
phones to pay for goods with retailers
who have specialized readers this has
not yet been confirmed by Google but you
have to think it's not too far off
Google is going to update blogger later
this year screens of the revamp site
were announced this week at South by
Southwest it's supposed to have a
cleaner interface and new publishing
tools Kindle and no customers can now
share books with a site called ebook
fling it's sort of like a dating site
for ebook owners you post a book that
you want to share and then you find
someone who wants it you'll end a book
by sending an email invite to the
borrower and then you earn credits for a
successful borrowing transaction if you
don't have credits you can pay $1.99 to
borrow the book you can now use Twitter
in a more secure way twitter added the
option to use the Site in HTTPS mode
permanently you could use Twitter in
HTTPS before by going to http
twitter.com but now you can make this
year
by going to your settings menu and
checking always use HTTPS it might slow
the site down a little but it's worth it
we suggest that you do it and finally we
fail to mention earlier in the week
Microsoft Unleashed Internet Explorer 9
the update to this popular browser
launched on Monday at South by Southwest
in Texas it's supposed to be faster and
more standards compliant and its
features compared to those of Firefox
and Chrome it is also well reviewed here
on CNET it does not work with Windows XP
though which is a burn considering
between 40 and 50 percent of the world's
computers are running XP that's your
news of the day remember
