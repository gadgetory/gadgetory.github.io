entrepreneurship at Stanford for four
years but now thanks to the web his
classes aren't confined to one room and
they can enroll 17,000 students or more
got students from all over the world
Korver is part of a growing number of
professors at respected universities
teaching massive open online courses or
MOOCs which students can take on the
internet often for free it's a lot of
online education you're seeing the video
of the professor you're taking multiple
choice tests that's the most boring
parts of the educational experience so
Korver decided to work with novo ed an
online education platform that
emphasizes student collaboration and
teamwork in this transition from
brick-and-mortar to online learning you
shouldn't strip away the social
experiential or collaborative aspect of
learning Nova heads co-founder says
that's the key to Student Success if you
look at massive open online courses the
completion rate is typically low in
single digits I novo at the completion
rates are significantly higher typically
two times or three times the normal novo
ed students range from teens in Ghana to
Silicon Valley entrepreneurs aspecto via
a recent Spanish course attracted a
hundred thousand students from around
the world students select their courses
watch recorded classes and team up on
group projects depending on the
structure of the team sometimes the
students meet in person sometimes they
use google hangout or skype and
sometimes they just use you know email
communication their work is graded by a
computer fellow students or a teaching
team once they complete the class
students receive certificates that can
be added to their resumes and online
profiles Stanford has spawned several
other MOOC providers that have attracted
millions of users including the popular
Coursera and Udacity but these courses
haven't always made the grade San Jose
State University suspended its
collaboration with Udacity after more
than half the students failed the online
classes
democratizing access is not equivalent
to democratizing success something Nova
wed hopes to change with its team spirit
