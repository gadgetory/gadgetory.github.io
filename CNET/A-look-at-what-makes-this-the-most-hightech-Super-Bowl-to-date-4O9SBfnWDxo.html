heart of Silicon Valley and the pressure
is on to live up to the area's high-tech
reputation luckily it's being hosted at
Levi's Stadium the most high tech
football stadium ever built with 400
miles of cables almost 700 security
cameras and a Wi-Fi box under every 100
seats so you couple the Wi-Fi
infrastructure with our dad system are
distributed antenna system where all
five mobile carriers are on that system
we feel like we can get 70,000 people
whether it be on Wi-Fi or cellular to be
able to use their phone for the first
time for a Super Bowl CBS the parent
company of cnet will incorporate eight
pylons containing 16 cameras in the end
zones it's a field selfie camera that
looks back at a wide receiver who's
about to break the plane of the goal
line and there are upgrades to the 36
camera replay system called I vision 360
that lets CBS freeze and rotate the
images on the sidelines teams will be
using microsoft surface tablets to look
over plays despite trouble with the
system during the AFC championship game
we will have Microsoft services in place
on both side lines and the stands fans
can tap the super bowl 50 app to order
food for pickup and have drinks
delivered to their seats even fans not
going to the big game can have a high
tech football experience with
interactive games and exhibits at the
NFL experience and Super Bowl city it
was amazing there's a 40-yard dash where
you race against a virtual player and a
photo booth that transforms your picture
into a Hall of Fame bust fans were also
seen football in a whole new way with 3d
virtual reality gives the ability to be
literally standing on the line of
scrimmage on the sideline of the field
and have the experience of being there
the entire game technology brings fans
even closer to the action in San
Francisco Ryan tongue cnet.com for CBS
