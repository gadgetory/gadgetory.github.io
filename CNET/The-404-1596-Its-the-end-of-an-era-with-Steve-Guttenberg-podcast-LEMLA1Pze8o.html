404 show on this very special day the
end of an era it's Wednesday December
what 17th yep all day
Rouge our today is okay December 17 2014
this will be the last official video
version of our podcast video thing that
we've been doing for a few years it's a
little sad but I think it's gonna be
okay it's gonna be a wreck
good that's gonna work out for you maybe
not someone for everyone else joining us
to send us off Steve Guttenberg who
better there and then the sphere himself
to be here wearing his corn on the cob
sure right like I know it's pretty loud
you could probably hear that on radio
you might be able to hear it over there
Aya's Akhtar as always and then filling
in for Arielle whose last video show was
yesterday Richard Peterson Jen the
channel in the control room filling in
thanks for doing that Richard appreciate
it so this is it you know and I guess
it's sort of like a bittersweet thing
you know how do you feel about it I know
you like you sort of here almost since
the beginning right so so the first time
we asked you to come on video it was
like I feel like you were a little
apprehensive about this yeah because you
know the thing about radio or audio
podcasts is that it's very intimate
right but this not so much and this is
less so yeah it's weird a tribute the
other way around
I agree even see it but actually if the
connection is stronger with just audio
yeah we've been doing it I've done two
audio only episodes in preparation for
the time off we did one with Giant Bomb
that'll go up on Friday talking about
games and then we did a show yesterday
with two TV Guide editors talking about
the TV shows of 2014 and I and I like
got back into the groove a little bit oh
yeah you know it feels right it just
feels right and I know there's a lot of
people who've written into the show and
they've expressed their distaste with
our decision
but I mean look you know it's we know
what the deal is and we knew that some
people would be upset and rightfully so
they've stuck with us and they've earned
that you know right but it's just
something we kind of just gotta give it
a chance
what I was upset a lot of people running
like we like seeing your face we were
like seeing everything well like that's
you're gonna see us in another videos
you know we're gonna be part of a lot of
you can apply those faces well anything
when Howard Stern was only on the radio
and when he started doing TV things
change I thought it diluted it yeah it
changed yes I was when it was more of
the theater of the mind thing right you
could imagine more and when you just saw
him and you know was weird about seeing
how that you never got on the radio that
when he was doing all these horrible
things to people yeah he was smiling
right right good so when you saw it you
didn't imagine that he was smiling when
he was berating what's his name how
about Bowie right but when he was like
basically laughing as he was saying
things it kind of diluted it right
because it just lifts the veil on this
sort of magic factor right so when it's
just audio it's better yeah I mean you
know everyone's like oh the future is
video like yes that's exactly why we're
doing this because we've been filming
the future is texting like people can
talk and they don't even talk they just
text that's you know I know if they
heard about this invention it's called a
telephone they could talk well you know
what I'm sure there's like I'm sure
there's conversational purists that
would that call the telephone a tool of
the devil you know how dare you be able
to speak to someone terrible that they
interrupt your life he met there's no
other technology that literally will
like ring a bell in your in your home
you right now you will pay attention to
me right as opposed to being I guess the
doorbell would be the other one below
but at least they came to see you think
they visited and they're there and
they're like oh hang on you're here and
I know you're hanging out with you my
house hi person who's just ringing and
invading my home it's just so weird when
I think the phone call still happened to
this day with that aren't scheduled
right I'm out like why are you calling
without an appointment a notification
otherwise I'm like what is happening do
people do that to people text can I call
you
yeah well I think it's a I think if it's
not urgent it's it's a semi polite thing
to do you don't agree
so just barging in calling them
unannounced is ignore someone's house
and like hi Here I am
look I understand where you're coming
from it's more like generate comedy kind
of thing but at the same time you got to
respect like everyone's kind of schedule
you know especially you know you work a
lot you're a busy guy you don't always
have time to shoot the on the phone
right well those twenties are values
like your thumb up and just hit that
preset - I'm sorry I can't talk yeah you
could I don't have to have direct
communication something really important
that's usually what happens with phone
calls that's why it's like why are you
calling because somebody's dead it's
like could you just call me say
everything's fine
I never happened yeah bummer anyway
speaking of bummers it's the end of an
era today it's okay
show is not going anywhere it's you know
it's going way together it's just going
literally seven feet you know West is
what's happening you're gonna get that
like chill back West vibe I'm gonna when
I come back for the audio only I think
it's I think you're really gonna pop
then it's gonna you're just gonna shine
yeah I've always said like man he's not
out there enough whenever he's not I'm
gonna get out right now
all right so man so lead us off so I had
a dream last night and you know
sometimes you have a dream because
you're thinking about something that's
happened during the day share
anticipating something you're nervous I
was anticipating this you know I was
anticipating sitting here talking to you
oh we're the last thing you think of
before you go to bed on this case no I
wasn't thinking about it but in the
dream I was okay so the thing is you
know this is one of those
hyper-realistic dreams okay I'm I'm
cautiously something new right now yeah
exactly the second time this is but
here's question question real quick yeah
we were talking before about your site
uh-huh
are your dreams in focus you know that's
intense right
but you can't tell in a dream cuz a lot
of people don't even dream in color they
sing I think almost nobody dreams in
color right so it's not a it's not a
one-to-one relationship what's weird is
like what you see in your dream is not
necessarily your remember about a year
ago I talked about my dream where I had
perfect vision because I was robbed
don't know what unnerving vision is no
no but in the dream I did I fantasize
that I was killing people remember when
I was killing people I was dropping
people off a building and dropping
bluetooth headphones on people's heads
and watching them explode yeah so I was
like 50 stories up right now you can see
perfectly and I could line it up and hit
them every time what a mind
f that is to like understand inside your
head you've never seen perfectly you
simply don't know what that is and then
in your own head through your mind's eye
having a dream where you believe it to
be perfect vision well cuz I was doing
something I couldn't do it right because
I couldn't see well enough to line it up
anyway we digress back to yes so back to
masks so in this dream here's because
it's dreamlike right that's not a real
thing it's fantasy it's fantasy so in
this dream I'm talking to you
but I'm in your dream yeah you're in my
dream but you are somehow conflated into
being Bill Maher okay and we're on
teleMed at that we're we're on you know
HBO on his show on Zuma litical II
incorrect which is not his show anymore
he has real time I'm sorry okay so
alright so now I'm so is it a world
where I'm I've taken Bill Maher's place
or not I just like more mess you look
like Bill Maher you because not just
Bill Maher it's Bill Maher right but you
but so where do I come in to play them
because I still love connecting somehow
you and Bill Maher in this photo of him
up on the screen you know all right so
we're on TV there's a studio audience
right cool gun I am dressed in basically
like a bathrobe with sequence like
glittery
shiny like a boxer
all right like a boxer that's the
perfect anyway yeah and we works we're
we're like this actually but we're like
directly facing each other okay and
we're talking slash arguing about
vegetable juicers and your and your
guide you don't drink right you don't do
it rug no you're sober is a priest from
for many years and and you just this is
what happened yes so we're arguing we're
discussing and it's very heated
discussion over vegetable juicers I your
wife I am very into vegetable juice and
the entire audience it's riveting
riveting yeah I think there's some cat
calls the thing is they're carrying on
like you call out a vegetable juice and
someone's like ow
oh yes slow juicers especially that
really that got a rise out of the
audience when they're slow juicers and
faster search knowledge did you think
that the Bill Maher Jeff Bakalar combo
guy had or could he was into it okay so
I was reciprocated yeah information okay
no I was saying slow juicers or this can
I say yeah he said there's a
yeah and he's like no no fast juicers
you know high-speed juicers there's like
the thing you identify if this is a
faster slow start so so we you know so
we're getting into this yeah and then I
bring up the thing that when you when
you juice and you're really healthy
you're doing a lot of juice you have
incredible sexual powers like super PAC
super power no just extra ordinary super
absolutely good super powers okay thanks
and I and so I said you know enough talk
bill let me just demonstrate my prowess
is that wearing a robe yeah that's why
I'm wearing a robe all right careful so
then these beautiful women come out and
disrobe me know
this is his dream but it's my dream
alright well hopefully your dream is
like pg-13
yeah well the visuals okay right yeah
all right go on so I stand up and you're
completely nude what is the bill Jeff
thing doing it and I'm just like okay
alright I'm like man hurry all right
said that we move this way yeah there's
a bed it comes out of the shadow it's in
there
it's part of the set of course of course
it okay and you know there's a woman
there waiting for me was just ready to
exciting ready to accept yeah and I
proved to Belmar and the studio audience
with great like cheering and everybody's
really into it like more more and even
Bill comes over yeah you know he's like
okay we've got it you proved your point
right right and that and then after that
it gets kind of fuzzy as most dreams
just as mother screams there's more and
I really try to remember I started
taking notes when I wrote what woke up
this morning because I knew it was weird
the dreams I can't remember the most
like immediately started writing him
down but anyway so well it was like is
it really good and sounds gonna be here
today that I had that tree and this
because of slow juicers that gave you
these matters right Oh 84 RPM
interesting good to know wow you you've
seen faster there's the ones that why
are you putting things in there see
that's the best juice that's a fast
because that the vets book goes in it
just gets obliterated and it gets
chopped up into little pieces and then
it flies out against the strainer which
by centrifugal force forces the juice
out gotcha so the faster it's going the
more juice is extracted so that's a
slower juicers going those are going at
8,000 rpm slow juice was going at 84 and
it basically has a go
corkscrew inside and it just slowly
grinds up the vegetable and then presses
it against the strain of the the stray
there's a lot of sexual innuendo with
pressure yeah well I'm not sure how
you're gonna top that one then way to go
out on top it's a big show today alright
there's more let's watch I mean I start
with my biggest thing yeah that's that's
the key you always start with your with
your clothes that I build that's what
you do that no cuz you told me many
times I shouldn't do these things late
into this show right no start start with
the finesse he may not be able to now
when I start talking about like who
knows what the drop-off title the second
half of this story the ends as you break
it up there you go okay then the juice
just shows up and then I'm going to talk
about the Scooby continues the sequel
will be at the end of the show dream
number two all right what else you got
this is basically your show so we're
following your lead I don't even have a
frickin computer today I know I'm just
calling practically naked practically
naked he's getting the vapors my oh my
so I want to be of my powers yeah you
know here's one actually does sort of
segue so I had this guy from this
speaker company and has a weird name you
should sort of find this it's called k
VAR t cavort cavort and ampersand and
bol GE now i don't know i did a blog
about this guy what's his deal so he
made this crazy speaker it's really
skinny okay it's an aluminum - it's an
aluminum - but the tiny little driver
and you know he contacted me about he's
emailing me saying i want to review my
speakers right and then he just kept
bugging me so finally I said okay send
me the stupid speakers so he sends me
the speakers and had a lot of stuff
going on
they're weird they look like air
purifiers in a weird way well your face
shows up when you go to Cove art and
bulge there
Stevi family so so anyway so he says Ben
speakers but a lot of the stuff Connie's
emailing me and calling me like the
speakers you know I will I will I will
so one day I just had them in my
basement so go down to my basement I
opens realize he's missing my partner
Billy I have a locker my oh that's cool
okay so I go and I open up the speaker
as soon as I open up this trick and I
take a look at this thing yeah you know
this could be cool because the hole it's
a skinny little tube and it's wrapped in
what looks like Kevlar weave okay right
these are really good I'm really glad
this guy you know was bugging all the
time to do this because she's a very
unusual present Lisa chronology very
interesting definitely an exceptional
speaker for $280 right so I do the
review and suddenly he's giving order
he's getting crazy amounts of orders for
a guy who just you know making these in
his kitchen yeah so and the result of my
review he saw I think two hundred and
eighty pairs of them know highly
unethical go on but then had a
conversation with the other day and he
said it's too successful I can't I can't
make this business yeah he's the his his
wildest dream came true right but now he
can't do it he can't make them fast
enough to fulfill all these orders so
what does he do so what are you gonna do
I mean he was asking me I thought it was
asking me what I should do I have no
idea but he actually came up with the
solution he's gonna stop making them and
then start a Kickstarter thing that
always got to be the answer well in this
case it is yeah it does sound like the
organic perfect calling for it yeah like
he can't make them right I already have
a successful product right I know it's
gonna do well right just help me out
right all right cool I mean I I don't
like it when established companies do
kickstart no it's a guy in his kitchen
anything so that's that's great that's
good so are you gonna be like a
testimonial I got to find out if I can
do that yeah and I don't think you
should endorse it to the point like I
think you should buy it and
but I think maybe it'd be appropriate
for you to be interviewed about your
review I think that's I think that's
John so anyway I'm really excited about
that every day somebody you know if you
don't hear about these like organic
Kickstarter's you always hear about like
a good a great idea in a salad exactly
this guy's got a legit product that
sounds great it's good it's selling well
and you simply cannot meet demand yeah
good for him yeah so another really
unusual speaker that I had a hand in
making successful is this yeah it just
sounds like you're I don't know it
sounds like you're just like is it
kingmaker responsible for crowning I
hear it see that I have a lot of I reach
a lot of people when I blind unusual
products differ except someone or
another people hear about and they start
buying them right it's not my ego it's
just the luck of being here ya know okay
so your trends how should i how do i
parse this am i missing so no no no no
and I'm not and I'm not saying you're
what you're doing is unethical it's not
good saying like it's it's interesting
that you're the way you sort of led into
the thing their entire revenue to me
well not entire yeah just a good chunk
of it yeah all right but they make
really cheap good stuff right much
deeper than the Kivar actually so I have
this new speaker called the Dayton b45 -
okay
thirty dollars a pair what is this the
tiny little thing and pull this up here
get it for the last time ever pull it
get up of visual aid trying to get the
speaker so they're thirty dollars okay I
check a pair yeah okay there's a little
bookshelf it's a little bookshelf
speaker I get it and what's really
interesting about it is is that it's for
this little tiny thing it makes a
mammoth amount of bass okay and it's
it's good not great sounding speaker but
the fact that they can you know make
something that inexpensively that can be
that exceptional right it's definitely
something so they can do this for $30
for a
then why the hell is not every single
manufacturer doing something like that
greedier their great is that it I mean
but there's crap out there like you can
get a $30 pair of speakers that sound
like ass but these guys seem to they
really do because though that this
speaker that I discovered from them
originally like two years ago was the
b65 - right and that has like turned
into a whole phenomena because that one
is now $39 a bigger it's like this big
and that's a great spot it makes
speakers man know I can only write about
my campaign but anyway so it's fun to
find you know cuz I have to go through a
lot of crap to find ones that are good
sure most of time people send me
speakers telling me how great their and
they're too expensive the tower speakers
only 40 bucks it's like the tower
speaker that's it six five - yeah that's
a buck spare that's that's still if you
like it it's gonna be good it's pretty
amazing I vote I mean people always like
you know they write in and I call Steve
does he really know what he's talking
about for sure you know what I
understand about being a reviewer yeah
essentially you're saying in my opinion
mmm this is good whether it's a movie or
a restaurant or a speaker right yeah
just because I think that it's good
doesn't mean that you'll think it's good
writer it's a movie or free wine there
any heretics that you know because
people write in and say in your opinion
who gives you the right to say that this
is good it's criticism right it's not
necessarily right or wrong uh-huh it's
an it's definitely an opinion it's
definitely subjective but you know after
a while I think you earned the
reputation of pleasing a the only thing
that I have is that I've heard literally
thousands of speakers right life right
been a big part of my life for a long
time and I can write about and what
cause I will claw face anyone to be an
expert on anything like Roger Ebert Wow
was he an expert Roger like the movie
didn't mean that I'd like it exactly
maybe we hated a few of my all-time
favorite
I always said with with with with
reviewers it's like if you find a
reviewer you tend to agree with with
movies right well then when he likes him
or she likes movies I like it you know
right which other than that what if it's
just reviewers like this movie doesn't
mean that it should be a placebo effect
to like Steve Guttenberg likes it I must
like it that's they just fell under my
spell
right and you've clearly figured out
some sort of dark magic sort of sorcery
that people have been able to be
transfixed by oh definitely right
whatever work it's the writing X I think
so it's my prose it's your prose
mesmerized with the words yeah you old
wordsmith so I had this friend okay I
heard is he dead no very much and he was
my Photoshop teacher right and he was he
came to my party time x' and heard my
story I was 100% disinterest in it and
then about a few years a couple years
ago he wound up buying a turntable okay
and suddenly he became much more
interested in audio and I find getting
better stuff so I hooked him up with
some speakers and everything and over
time he just keeps going and now he he
took this big plunge and bought these
$4,000 speakers and this happened how
did he go from the end I really care to
now I gotta get to speak something happy
something clicks in people with audio
yeah we're like they here for the first
like the first time I ever heard even
like a flack album in really good
headphones and heard things that I have
not heard before heard you know the like
the the bass like the kick on the drum
that squeaking oh yeah like the pedals
squeaking stuff where you're just like
oh my god
like this is real people using real
instruments in a room somewhere right
for me that I like the way you describe
because that is it and you feel like
that connection
you're closer to being there that's
really important music to you for sure
that counts for a lot
and now like I only really care about
flack like I only want to hear a new
record in flack if I hear it in like 320
mp3 I'm like all right I'm like I'm
halfway there maybe well I need the flat
you gave my segue to my next thing on my
list right now title have you heard
about title now let's tie can hook you
up with Tyler is flack streaming flack
streaming 24 1 yeah wait if I go so 4
people don't know flack is an
uncompressed right do you know what
lossless digital music format it sounds
amazing right it's the huge files like
one songs probably gonna like a
three-minute songs maybe a couple
hundred megabytes right a lot right so
these guys are gonna be stream they are
and it sounds really good and now I'm
very interested in this what is it
what's the what's like the you know the
library looking like it's good not
everything now it's not everything but
III mean I'm looking for weird yeah
fine a lot I don't find everything but I
find a lot of things you've probably
said that sentence a bunch in your life
you walk in the store yeah no I'm
looking for weird so tied up here is
there is a catch oh it's not free yeah
obviously that's not a catch okay
because everybody wants it for free they
want they want it's not supported so by
you so when you say you can hook me up
with title I can get your freebie all I
just want to try it out can I try it
right for free cuz that's all I was on
my holiday guy right so it's $20 a month
after you get past your free
subscription that's that's a lot of
scratch
you just said you can't listen to can
you catch for offline later or not can
you download it for later no you can't
see you actually you might I don't I
don't use it that way but I think you
you might I want to try this right now
right now like when we're done okay
right now all right so
come t idea that was there a separate
app or you have to go to the website you
have to go the website you have to
and there's get the free thing right I'm
free through free trial and then the
cern app and then there's an app I
believe I don't know is it on my
computer at home gosh so there's a we
call when it's on your computer at home
and it's an app as well I think it
sounds phenomenal all right and since I
buy music I not wacky I know you're
caveman so when I find music on title I
like so you so people are paying 20
bucks a month right then no they don't
buy it I buy I like the weird other
bright no there's still people who do it
I told you I got a buddy who still buy
CDs inexplicably I just don't get any
buy CDs from Amazon which if that if you
think why is that a bet
well the inherent sort of life you can
just buy additional right there you know
sometimes the CD is cheaper than the
down yeah I've seen that yes is that
about well how are the ones and zeros
more expensive some records okay
you know I discovered this do you like
James Brown at all I don't I don't
dislike him I found the best live James
Brown concert ever
yeah and it was $4.99 for the CD on
Amazon right $8.99 or $9.99 past three
years right and it was great it was on
my Christmas holiday guide question for
you just black audio how does that
compare to CD audio is it the same
theoretically it's the same
theoretically it's the same mm-hmm cool
usually it is the same all right what do
you have anything like in in well here's
another one yeah it's it's sort of like
title it's called Murphy Murphy yeah
Murphy calm it's another black it's not
if I think well I don't think is so
Murphy is you take your CDs that are now
oh they're discussing their cluttering
my apartment yeah the ruining put them
in a box you ship them real shipping to
Murphy and then you can sell them online
but the cool thing about Murphy is they
sell downloads in flack
anything you were stuff of yours a
that's not cool
how could you before that how does it
how could I be for it but how's that
okay to do why is that not okay to
because they're they're ripping CDs and
then selling them and they're you know
what I mean like then they then they
destroy the seating oh they do they say
they did that's a weird thing is it not
it is it's a cool thing and you can
stream from them so you can take you or
you cannot sell them you can just send
them and stream them but only you get
access and only you get access to it's
weird right I'm just like why wouldn't
just do your self I guess your
collection if is large and yeah but yeah
i mean i proofed myself and have it
accessible like through my phone anyway
home server so it's weird ever ever
since I fell in love with flack I've
become underwhelmed disappointed with
the way the world treats audio in like
normal application like say your car
right so I have a car I have a Subaru
Forester 2014 and yeah why is that Wow
new car so again the car and and I want
to plug into car smell still does and I
wanted to plug in a USB Drive so not
only am i limited to 16 gigabytes which
is ridiculous like how come every car in
the world just doesn't have like a
terabyte sitting in between the freaking
that's next year no it's not there's no
one is doing that no one like there's no
maybe a Tesla has a terabyte hard drive
in it their terabyte hard drives are
basically free for if you bought them 1
million SSD in your car the price
difference should be pretty tiny to you
you think of right it would be like it's
like 200 bucks you know like give you if
you got a terabyte SSD how much more
with the car be for me 30 bucks like
let's be honest you can get it you can
get a half a terabyte SSD now for $200
so I'm just like why is that not it in
there regardless all right it only plays
mp3s and that's it Wow and it can't
thing about 320 first it was Ebola now
this is this is worse than Ebola I think
you can hack your car if we can have to
play flak well yeah why not you tell me
there's no possible way that there is
some kind of interface oh there's an
interface for called was it obd2
underneath your steering column then you
can like access everything do you not
know about this is it time to hack my
car
aside from hooking my phone up to the
car which plays flak just fine instead
of me like under you know the car with
wires hanging out potentially bricking
not the red one you know Princeton come
in a brick the red wire is the green
wire exactly like I'm not trying to do
that but maybe I don't know it's
interesting I'm curious if people
because I know I remember when I first
got the car there's ways to hack like
the interface you can change the
typeface you can change the color you
can just make it do what you want and
I'm curious to see if there's a way to
do that there's it's it's pretty cool
what you can do
alright what other stuff do you have so
the iconic dead right we knew that but
now this file fi IO x1 okay that I
reviewed it's it's it's not as it's not
as easy to use as an iPod and playlists
and stuff like that it looks like an old
iPod but it's fen it's phenomenal and
it's a hundred bucks just play flag and
it plays flat that's all I care about
now box how big it's smaller than I know
but how out of capacity
oh it doesn't have any of you put in SD
cards micro SD to 128 128 that's pretty
cool it's really if and it sounds really
really nice so these headphones my
headphones today that I'm wearing today
right kept secret under the corn sugar
yeah always have that's crazy that
they're always the tips that come with
it but this is a company called aura
Sonics okay these are called Rockets
cool they're made I think in Nashville
you know they're titanium earpieces
they're really tiny this part I don't
know what this thing is but that's the
actual earpieces really tight you're
like these things are great yeah how
much 250 bucks
these are awesome for the headphones
just the tips
just the tips are you got anything else
that's not audio um or no no no I got
the cookies oh my god you want cookies
yeah this is like our send-off yeah I
know oh my god thanks man my wife makes
these thank you these are a yearly
Guttenberg tradition
mrs. Guttenberg slaves away yeah cursing
banging pots and pans burning herself an
accident
it's amazing what she's able to put
together in a beautiful little package
so uh Happy Hanukkah and Christmas and
New Year and fester and Festus and all
that good stuff
thank you thanks so much appreciate it
oh good you know wrapping it up I think
was good at the beginning though no a
sec can you tell that part again kidding
thanks so much for being here man this
has been great this has been fantastic
good I'm so happy I'm here for the last
video 1 as as are we it's it's the end
of an era but certainly not the end of
having you on the program
thank you for sticking with us all these
years and for just really a 30 first
appearance that's it I don't know for
just freaking us out on a somewhat a
consistent basis so what did we do the
one that was about the Big Lebowski we
didn't know it was entire was me Justin
and um you and maybe I don't know
because I remember Justin I didn't he
wasn't into the movie as much right do
you remember that yeah we're not doing
that this year
we're not doing like a lot of those but
uh yeah that was a good time anywhere's
know this uncompressed when you compress
no see that's dope okay that'd be
hilarious in one episode like a 700 game
yeah anyway files every breath that's
the thing that's ridiculous about
podcasting is like the key in podcasting
is getting the file as small as you can
spoken words by the way you're okay with
Marc Maron's podcast sound
odd kiss oh my god it's awful doesn't
sound good no and I don't know if that's
because he'd have better lately though
right maybe it's like better compression
no I mean the sound I mean it guests
alright ok did you listen to the Jenny
slate

being her all these years we look
forward to seeing you in 2015 and thanks
