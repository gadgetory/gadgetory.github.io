we've got the dates for apples next
events we're breaking down everything
we're expecting to see right here on the
apple core the first date to look out
for March 25th now it does seem a little
bit early to be getting invites for our
March event but according to BuzzFeed
sources this is when Apple is set to
hold its next big event at the Steve
Jobs theater in its Cupertino
headquarters just know then until we see
those invites I for one I'm taking this
one with a grain of salt we've
definitely been expecting a spring event
from Apple so this should come as no
surprise especially considering last
year's iPad event was on March 27th so
right around the same time but what is
surprising is that this year's event
wouldn't feature any iPads or Hardware
of any sort for that matter according to
the report the headliner for this event
would be Apple's news service again
another one we saw coming this one is
supposed to be a monthly subscription on
Apple's news app of about $10 a month
which would give you access to a bunch
of different news outlets the Netflix as
news as it's being referred to the New
York Times Washington Post and Wall
Street Journal have all been rumored to
be in talks with Apple to be part of the
service but according to a Wall Street
Journal report this deal may go south
because apples asking to keep 50% of the
revenue which doesn't really seem like a
very good deal for the actual content
creators but even if they're able to
reach the agreement and launch this
thing by March 25th there are a few
other things that seem a little bit
suspect to me starting with the fact
that the 25th is a Monday and Apple
tends to favor Tuesdays for its big
launch events more importantly why would
Apple host a launch event based solely
on an extension of Apple news now a
standalone launch event would make more
sense at least to me if they were to
bundle it with their big video streaming
service announcement which apparently is
also a possibility according to this new
Bloomberg report or maybe if they were
to couple it with some of their product
launches which is also rumored to be
happening
right around the same time a sketchy
report their words not mine
on a Greek blog site discovered by 95
Mac seems to suggest Apple will unveil
new iPad's air pods and that air power
mapped on a march 29th launch event
Friday suspect now the latter speaks for
itself that wireless charging mat that
Apple's been teething since 2017 but now
let's talk about the other two products
those tiny little air pod sequels might
just be the most anticipated Apple
product of 2019 well for many of you at
least judging by the comments so it's no
surprise there's been plenty of rumors
about them over the last few weeks last
we'd heard we were gonna get the full
makeover complete with the biometric
sensors noise cancelling new colors and
wireless charging case before the summer
but a recent tweet from longtime Apple
leaker at all makes suggests we may only
be getting one of the above the wireless
charging case the rest of the features
aka the actual air pods - wouldn't come
until the September launch event this
year alongside new iPhones and an Apple
watch which is kind of a bummer but he
does go on to mention he's not a hundred
percent sure he can vouch for his
sources so there may still be hope to
get those brand new ear pods sooner than
that
the other product that's more matter of
when at this point is a new iPad or in
this case multiples there's clues hidden
in the iOS 12.2 code and there's the
fact that Apple has already registered
them in the Eurasian Economic Commission
we're expecting a cheaper 10-inch iPad
that would replace last year's nine
point seven inch and the iPad Mini five
which has been forgotten for years
a report from Mac o Takara VM Mac rumors
suggest the new mini would have the
exact same design and dimensions as the
previous models so no face ID and those
barely there bezels but yes to the
headphone jack and lightning port and an
updated processor either the a10 chip or
the a 10x chip also rumored to be making
a comeback
a new 7th generation iPod but seriously
if you had to choose one which one are
you most
excited about iPad Mini iPod air pods
air power mat or Apple News Service for
that matter I'll be chiming in with my
pick on the comments section below and
on Twitter so feel free to join in on
the conversation next on the calendar
WWDC Apple's annual Worldwide Developers
Conference which apparently also has a
date as of this week again no official
word from Apple yet but Mac rumors seems
to be fairly confident this year it will
begin June 3rd at the McHenry Convention
Center in San Jose and I for one would
have to agree given that it always falls
on that first week of June and the fact
that there was mention of it on the city
of San Jose's Office of Cultural Affairs
events calendar which has since been
removed
oops just do me a favor and don't book
your travel until registration opens
likely around mid-march just in case now
this is where I would have thought that
Apple would have announced all its new
services but who even knows anymore what
we are definitely getting is new
software updates iOS 13 with that
rumored dark mode on the iPhone those
230 new emojis we talked about last week
along with updates to Mac OS watch OS
and TV OS beyond that we have the
September launch event which will we all
know by now new iPhones maybe an Apple
watch Series five and those air pods -
and that's not even the end of it
needless to say we're just getting
warmed up that does it for our show
today but as always you can keep up with
all the latest Apple news and rumors on
cnet.com and subscribe to our channel to
get more apple core also I'm gonna take
a little break next week to go cover the
Samsung event I know I'm a trader but
we'll be back in the week of the 28th
with our usual programming see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
