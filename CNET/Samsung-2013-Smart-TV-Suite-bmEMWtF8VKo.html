with Samsung's new 2013 Smart TV this
Smart TV suite will be featured in all
of the company's smart televisions this
is the high-end model behind me with a
new touchpad remote I'm gonna go through
the features of this smart television
experience when you first press the
Smart Hub menu which is sort of the main
menu button on the television you get
this screen behind me which is a
recommendation screen it's kind of
designed around the channel surfing
experience you can see you've got your
live TV right there you've also got
along the side on the right a list of
programs that the recommendation engine
realizes that you might want to watch
and actually tells you how much is left
in each of those programs along the
bottom you have upcoming shows so it
kind of looks at all the programs that
are available on your cable box and it
can use any sort of cable service you
just put in your zip code you figure out
what cable service or satellite service
you're using it can use that and control
your cable box to go to those channels
and recommend stuff kind of on the fly
depending on what it thinks you might
want to watch now I'm going to jump to
the next screen here you can see us a
little like a smartphone it Scrolls from
screen to screen on this one is the
video on demand services which include
Netflix blockbuster and a couple of
other Samsung's partners it actually use
this screen to choose from a bunch of
different video on-demand services and
again it looks at what you've looked at
at the past and recommends new things
down there so at the bottom you have
favorites featured movies TV shows all
these things are categorized is sort of
a cross-platform search for all those
video in demand services again a pretty
unique service compared a lot of the
other Smart TV things out there onto the
next screen you have all of the local
content and also the DLNA this content
from your hall share all of these
devices that can bring together your
music photos and video onto one screen
that's files and that sort of stuff that
could be streamed from around the home
or via media plugged into the TV itself
now true to smartphone form the next
screen the fourth on the list is the
social screen if you're on Twitter
Facebook or YouTube any of these social
networking services you can get that
stuff right on the screen you can also
tweet from the TV itself and that's a
lot easier if you buy Samsung's optional
keyboard of course that doesn't come
with the TV itself if you want to do
some quick tweets you can do that using
a virtual keyboard built into the TV
itself and finally there's the app
screen last year we called Samsung's app
selection the most comprehensive
available that's still going to be the
case in 2013 as
with a 2,800 apps available you can
organize them to your heart's content
dump them into my apps the one that
Samsung stinks you might use the most or
Upton recommended so you could choose
from any of these apps and also download
a whole bunch of new apps to the TV
itself
finally we'll talk about their mode this
is Samsung's redesigned touchpad remote
I can tell already it's a lot more
sensitive than last year's model which
was a big problem this has a lot fewer
buttons than a typical remote control
Samsung does not include the multi
button remote unlike last year you got
to use this thing but it's actually a
little bit easier to use we found the
past that's very sensitive you can use
these scroll bars on the side to help
navigate there's also dedicated keys for
channel volume you're gonna have to call
up a special menu for searching and
adding in channel numbers however
there's also a couple other functions
that require these on-screen menus so
there is a little bit trade-off and
functionality but on the poll it's
really nice if you like to use this
thing especially for the web browser and
a lot of the other Smart TV functions
this is included on the 7500 series and
up as well as the 8000 plasma also if
you have a 2012 Samsung TV and you pay
for the evolution kit you're going to
get one of these remotes in the box so
that allow you to upgrade the TV
completely to Clews brand new processing
this new Smart TV system and the remote
