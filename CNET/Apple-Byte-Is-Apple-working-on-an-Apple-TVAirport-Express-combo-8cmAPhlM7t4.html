to the Apple buy for all the good of bad
inside the world of Apple and believe it
or not this show will not contain a
single recycled iPhone rumor that's
similar to something you've heard two
years ago alright let's get to the show
and the Apple TV is really on my mind
after recently was elevated to full
product status with its own section next
to the Mac's iPads and iPhones on the
main header of the Apple store page a
report from 9:00 to 5:00 mat claims
Apple is making progress with the next
generation of the Apple TV that's said
to be a full set top box instead of a
standalone television set that's likely
to be released in the first half of 2014
let's just call it the Apple not a TV TV
now I'll and reports that Apple is
preparing an update that will add game
and support sometime in March the Apple
TV has continued to get new partners for
content and the idea of apps or a game
store has been rumored for a while but a
new focus on gaming utilizing existing
iPads and iPhones and iPods as
controllers is expected now the latest
reports claim that Apple is considered
combining the Apple TV and Airport
Express products with versions of the
new Apple TV including an integrated 802
11 AC router for improved video quality
and stability compared to the current
Apple TV's 905 Mac also says Apple has
been testing versions of the Apple TV
with a built-in TV tuner component
giving it the ability to control your
existing cable boxes and TV stations now
we've seen products like this like the
failed Google TV and even the Xbox one
is similar but the idea would be putting
an Apple design user interface on top of
your existing setup through the Apple TV
so there's lots happening behind the
scenes with Apple TV and we'll see how
it all shakes out now Apple recently
announced their earnings for the first
fiscal quarter of 2014
posting a record quarterly revenue of
fifty seven point six billion dollars
and a quarterly net profit of 13 point 1
billion Apple sold a record 51 million
iPhones a record 26 million iPads and
Mac's were up selling four point eight
million units compared
the same quarter last year but Wall
Street still wasn't happy enough with
the growth you'll always get a few good
nuggets of info during the Q&amp;amp;A session
and when questioned about new revenue
from new product lines CEO Tim Cook said
Apple plans to launch new products in
categories where it currently doesn't
operate and that the company has no
issue coming up with new projects to
work on cook also expanded on touch ID
and when he was asked about mobile
payments he said mobile payments in
general is one that we've been intrigued
with and one of the thoughts behind
touch ID we're not limiting ourselves
just to that but there's a big
opportunity on the platform now a Wall
Street Journal report says Apple is
planning to allow customers to purchase
physical goods from other retailers
through an iTunes account using the
iTunes account as the transaction
middleman and touch ID to authorize
transactions and it's still a long ways
out from happening but I've always been
a huge fan of the cell phone as a wallet
since I use it in Japan in 2005 and I'm
just waiting for it to really get here
and some cool Apple news Apple has
granted a patent filed in 2010 for a
laptop with a two-sided glass display
housing it would have the usual screen
on the front face but the rear side
would hold photovoltaic cells for solar
charging a secondary display and sensors
for touch input just think of point in
the back of your laptop to the light
source to power it or I like to call it
booty to the Sun the patent says the
rear could be made of electrochromatic
glass it's a material that can change
States from translucent transparent when
voltage is applied across its surface
and touch controls on the rear side
could unlock a magnetic latch mechanism
or be used for media control or other
software inputs and it's just one of the
cool ideas Apple has been playing with
but it doesn't mean we'll be seen at
anytime soon the big a was also awarded
patents for attaching lenses and camera
modules to portable electronic devices
it includes magnetically attaching a
camera module that would fit on
something like an iPhone and aligned
with its camera to extend its
picture-taking capabilities the external
lens would have moveable parts allowing
it to do things like zoom autofocus and
resist shaking now there's already
several third-party lens attachments on
the market and again it doesn't mean
Apple is releasing this but it's
something they've been cooking alright
