coming to you from San Francisco and on
the Skype with me is mr. Brian Tong host
of the Apple byte extra country podcast
what up everybody welcome to the show
it is episode 82 that was a more kind of
warm casual introduction that was a
weird one yeah I like two of them have
been kind of weird but you know I'm okay
with it you're running cuz you're in
another place so I'm used to saying
we're here I know oh I'll get you hyped
up next time I'm back in town alright
everybody welcome to show it is episode
82 of Apple white extra crunchy this is
again our complementary piece to the
Apple byte video podcast and the reason
why we do this show people are like oh
people that are complaining on video
about this with some show this is an
audio podcast it's actually meant to be
audio we just put it up on video just
because we can so all you haters shut up
shut up shut up okay that's not very
nice to me let's get to the show and
again it's all about you all call us be
a part of this contribute your thoughts
your opinions whether you agree with
what we say or not or just what you
think in general
to run a variant of iOS in a following
supporting report from Sonny himself
they also said that the design of this
could kind of look like the Mac Pro
which makes sense huh that a
cylinder-shaped charger okay yeah
Apple echo type looking right right
doesn't that make sense though
yeah totally they all they all kind of
have a round everything looks like a
thermos now like all these speakers they
all look like thermoses it's weird like
you can drink drink fluid out of them or
something I don't know we're in the age
of the cylindrical long device in other
reports like the information is really
what kind of started the information
which is a website a tech website but
you do have to subscribe to get into its
information huh the website itself said
act Apple is actively developing the
product that would compete with the
Amazon echo and Google home
citing their sources with direct
knowledge of their plans it says it
would include again a speaker a
microphone that could be used for
features like we know about this
listening to music getting news
headlines and more things like that in
addition to that this is kind of a big
thing and they really need to do this
Apple is planning to improve Siri by
opening the voice assistant to outside
developers for those of you that are on
iOS they've been very specific with the
partners and third-party apps that
they'll allow to access Siri and use it
it's not like hey everyone
go and get Siri that is one of the
reasons why the Amazon echo was so
successful they straight-up put out
their api's let developers jump in to
let Joe Schmoe whoever that is that
created that Amazon app where I can just
listen to oh Sh in music like the
ambient sound some somebody just did
that because Amazon will let them do it
that's not like Apple but oh my gosh
when we went to CES Alexa was in
everything it was in like every speaker
you could see you could think of it was
everywhere was in cars it was in you
know media players like it was it was
everywhere so hopefully the same thing
happens with Siri they're even doing
more integrate
like appliances right the overlap oh
yeah we refrigerators so the information
report also says like Apple plans to
require developers to use the tool
responsibly translation we are going to
specifically control who we allow to use
this device whenever it comes out so the
SDK the developer kit most likely will
be introduced sometime
it's got to be WWDC if you ask me apples
already almost two years behind on this
smart speaker although some of the
reports were like hey Apple has been
working on this before the Amazon echo
well not only did the Amazon echo come
out before it it's already a damn good
product oh yeah and the biggest thing
that you know you could say oh where's
the Amazon echo behind it's not with
third party partners it's just the fact
that the Google algorithm exists out
there that is smarter than anyone and
then also Google just updated their
Google home to support up to six users
with different voices so it can identify
the voice and match that with your
profile so now you can do things like
hear your own personal calendar right
that that never that doesn't exist on
any device other than that Google home
right now so I think not only does Apple
have to catch up in that space third
party partners apps which let's be
honest amazon skills or I think they
have somewhere around like 10,000
something crazy right if Apple's gonna
be this controlling they're not gonna
have that many third-party partners
right out the gates and the biggest
thing is Siri has to get better yes Siri
Siri is pretty slow right Siri isn't as
smart it's just not as good it's good
enough don't get me wrong but it has to
be smarter so when I look at hearing
about this and I want to hear what you
all think remember this is a show that's
all about you if you can write your
comments in the live stream right now or
call us at
what else what other than maybe being
linked to your Apple ecosystem which is
a little compelling what other than that
is going to make it that much better you
can tell it you can ask it where's my
iPhone and then it'll it'll like beep
your iPhone for you or something that's
going to be the bell and whistle that
everyone wants so check this out you
want me to tell you something let me
tell you something cool good there is a
skill using um the IFFT or the IFTTT
platform if this then that yeah and an
Amazon uh echo that will actually send a
call to your phone to find it ok ready
now it's not find my iPhone where if
it's turned off an alarm goes off but
they've even someone's already come up
with something like that you know again
it's not directly linked to Apple's
because Apple would never let anyone get
direct access like that
but I I'm just curious I mean Beecham
what what would they have to do do you
have an echo you do yeah I have an echo
I use all the time mainly just to turn
on lights play music timer timer stuff
like that stuff like I would do with
Siri but now you know I do it with the
echo because I don't really have to
touch anything or reach em you don't
have to reach for your phone it's just
there yeah yeah like I have to turn it
off before we do this podcast otherwise
it's gonna go off totally so yeah I mean
I don't know what they would do they'd
have to really do something compelling
put some sort of feature in there that
makes us all want to buy it but right
now I'm not and not at all interested in
the Apple thing until I see it and see
what it has to offer you know I mean
other hooks that they could do look
there was this idea of thinking that
they should have just made something
like their Apple TV box an echo slash
Apple TV box but all the reports are
indicating that it's just going to be a
echo like speaker that that would have
been really compelling because but look
this new Apple let's just call it the
Apple echo for now just for poops just
for shits and giggles the the Apple echo
like guy if it could link to some of
those apps or the the watch now happens
you could say hey I want to watch the
flash and it turned on your TV jump to
that show you know stuff like that would
be very compelling definitely
just literally don't say turn on my TV
and then navigate it just say your TV's
off Apple blah I want to watch the flash
and it goes directly the last step stuff
like that could be interesting but again
prices in a consideration
are they gonna make it cheaper than the
echo no most likely not know like I
really love the echo yeah that goes cool
like if they can marry all those things
together video music voice commands if
they can marry it all together then that
would be very compelling cuz right now
have a chromecast for different things
and then I have the echo for different
things and it would be cool if the echo
I think actually Amazon does make
something that is like echo for video
right I think so I might be wrong
someone will someone will correct me but
if they could do that that would be
awesome so again it like we've always
said it comes down to the ecosystem the
power of the ecosystem means something
right yeah it just it we we are married
to these things and it takes a lot for a
person no matter how amazing the device
is it still takes a lot for person to
then say I'm going to change over so
we'll see what happens I mean there's
even reports that a new echo is coming
out really soon with an actual built-in
screen like a video screen yes and
curious what that's gonna be like yeah
and it could be on deck for next month
um it's codenamed Knight and it could
even be used for video chats like we
have our phones but there's there is
something again I don't know what that
doesn't sound super compelling to me but
it's interesting because because echo
has created this new space and really
put a name to it a face to it and people
are buying it so I'm always curious with
what they're doing the one thing though
that kind of threw me off but then I'm
gonna I'm tell you I kind of like this
in a sick way you saw did you see that
echo look product that they just
announced yeah yeah totally I would
never put that in my bedroom
never ever okay so here I'm thinking
about this okay I'm gonna keep an open
mind so for those of you who don't know
the echo look is basically another
iteration of their echo platform but
it's a a camera basically that has all
of echos functionality so it's it has
that speaker capability but it has a
full
large it's like a rectangular overly
pill shape it stands vertical and as a
camera and what you can do is it you can
stand in front of it it blurs out the
background like kind of a bouquet effect
not as good and then you can take
pictures of your wardrobe and then log
it like every day and select favorite
outfits and then maybe sick oh I like
that combo remember that I first yeah
the ad that they put out the video has
like 80% looks like four women and one
guy but I'm kind of one of those guys
because I have two that might that might
I've never done oh TD but this could be
my personal OTD without anyone knowing
yeah you know OTD right yeah I don't
know actually tell me what that implies
no if you hashtag OOTD it's outfit of
the day a lot of letter weights you into
themselves
do you have tag OOTD because they think
they fly
that is funny no I just see like so many
security risk was with this you know
like there's a camera in your house
taking pictures of you you know it can
get hacked Amazon Oh creepy Amazon
engineer can get ahold of it maybe who
knows what happened DGM I want to see
your OOTD makeup soda will just give me
props on my shirt my hook Landis shirts
oh that's a that is dope shirt oh look
and local brand logo baby no no no no
full body oh oh TD Stephen Beecham I
want to see it hahaha people that are
listening or like what I'm gonna just
describe it really quickly so we can
move on with the show
Heather dark heather gray shirt with
this cool Oakland ish logo blue jeans
form-fitting around the ass area and a
pair of black black bands
form-fitting with baby hit socks with
white socks if you look anyway closet
it's mostly black t-shirts but we've
gone on it semi tangent but echo look is
a legit product in almost you think it's
like an April Fool's joke but it's
interesting because echo Amazon is so
ahead of this now because they've seen
how people are responding and using the
like they have so much more data and
information than Apple doesn't I wasn't
even released anything yet you know what
I mean yeah yeah
so he's like look judging someone was
like making comments on Twitter like it
was judging your outfits or something it
doesn't do anything like that it just
kind of locks what you wear right it
logs what you wear you can set favorites
and then also if you want to it has some
some feature that analyzes what you're
wearing and make suggestions so I think
it may be let's judge you
yeah well it's Judge edgy I mean you
know let's be honest there's some people
that choose not to match their clothes
in any way shape or form because that's
actually a style I don't know if this
will work with them very well I'm sorry
but this is just gonna like make the
morning routine a little bit longer and
I'm not I'm not for that right I have to
get to kids dress take them to school
you know get myself dressed take myself
to work it's already more different
aminal I'm not gonna be taking pictures
all morning you know you know it's
almost like we should do a different
podcast about like the other stuff
outside of app okay know right teaser
maybe I don't know okay down let's get
onto the show back to Apple back on
track
Apple cars this is picture just came out
from Bloomberg although you may not see
it that's fine but this is Apple's cars
that they're using a do their Ted
they're testing for their self-driving
car technology they're using a Lexus RX
450h
that's kind of like the I don't want to
call it a mini SUV it is kind of like
their mini SUV Bloomberg has Bloomberg
has photos of it because someone
basically tracked the cars emerging from
an Apple facility this week to identify
what cars they're using it has an array
of sensors a the person that took this
photo and provided it to Bloomberg said
it included a Velo dine lidar tanks
top-of-the-range 64 channel lidar it's
it's kind of that rig that's on top two
radars there's camera sensors on the
side of the car one on the front very
similar to some of the stuff that you
have seen in these self-driving cars but
Apple is testing them out in the wild
and Apple spokesman the client to
comment this also comes on the heels of
two weeks ago the California Department
of Motor Vehicles gave Apple clearance
to start carrying out trials with three
vehicles
earlier this month this is part of their
project Titan for those of you that
remember we had talked about this a lot
but Apple was working on an autonomous
car project at first they were trying to
make deals with car makers like
Volkswagen AG BMW AG they were clearly
kind of taking a taking a lot more than
they anticipated like a lot of car
pundits really said they're like it's
not that easy just to build a car when
you have no experience whatsoever so
Apple changed their plans Bob Mansfield
who formerly was their head of VP of
hardware for a while over Apple came out
of retirement that's right yeah they
recruited or the leadership um in April
of last year for the project Titan um
he's kind of refocused what they're
doing it's now looking to be developing
more of an autonomous driving software
platform and not an actual car so this
is something that Apple could still
license out but all reports indicate
again no car the physical car project is
dead and that this is all about
autonomous driving software platform you
know maybe they can integrate it with
the iPhone down the road obviously with
carplay there's those are easy hooks but
if it exists or is built into specific
car manufacturers down the road that's
obviously what they're hoping to be
right D they're trying to be the iPhone
of car systems but it's not that easy
yeah especially when cars manufacturers
are invested in their own platform again
Apple is really not done a platform
where they're just software
it's very rare typically right their
software and hardware that is how
they're able to marry the two and be
able to give us certain things that are
unique to it but this car project is not
that it's totally different yeah and I
also think it ties in to the story we
talked about last week about the
satellite internet you know like what if
what if the Apple cars or this Apple
software only talks to that satellite
internet it's like exclusive to that you
know that would be a huge thing a
definitely a huge selling point for a
lot of people and I would be on board
for sure
because I love satellite radio and
satellite internet would be killer
you know so I don't like my phone
dropping its signal everywhere I go and
people were quick to point out to me
they're like hey dude satellite internet
exists I mean I know directly orders
like what I'll Europe but we're talking
about a the next generation of it
basically yeah yeah you know beyond what
exists today
so yes you all right the well actually
is correct if you're not like well
actually you know the it does exist but
we're talking about kind of taking it to
the next level next generation stuff you
know in line with 5g LTE gigabit LTE
whenever that comes all right moving
along with kind of other project app
projects Apple is dipping their toes in
we had heard a while back that Apple is
potentially working on you know they
have either Apple pay platform Tim Cook
a long time ago made a quote about how
you know Apple pay will replace cash in
like I can't remember how many years he
said did you say five or ten years he
you know threw out some bold thing like
it's going to replace cash okay we'll
see I think the funny thing about is
after he had said that admittedly Apple
has had said publicly that the adoption
rate for Apple pay has been slower than
they anticipated but what they're doing
now according to recode is flirting
again with building their own money
transfer service which appears to be
back on who knows what they'll call it
some people are throwing around the term
Apple cash because which seems kind of
opposite because it's like I thought you
wanted to kill cash yeah kill Akash
don't call it Apple cash the reporter
says the company has recently held
discussions with payments industry
partners about introducing its own venmo
competitor according to multiple sources
the service would allow iPhone owners to
send money digitally to other iPhone
owners now they expect the new service
to be announced sometime later this year
another person caution that the
announcement and launch date
have not been set at all this is this is
how I look at it right if Apple was
talking to banks even back in 2015 to
get this rolling
didn't take up I'm sure Apple in a way
almost wants to be their own bank right
like look there's so many competitors
out there there's PayPal there's
obviously venmo there's square cash so I
get that and they already work with my
phone yeah I use all three of those
right right all this don't use them all
the time great right now today for all
of you listening and watching
would you stop using it would you just
jump over to Apple pay
just cuz and use it primarily like I
think again when when you're late to the
game you have to offer something so much
more compelling than what's there and I
think when I see what's happened with
the iPhone they haven't yet maybe the
iPhone a will be it
they haven't offered something super
compelling as a you know but because
they've established a market but this is
what they used to do they would come in
later and create something really
compelling we talked about earlier an
Amazon echo like product I don't know if
they can make something super compelling
from a market that's already figuring
itself out what about Apple pay well if
it's just for Apple to Apple like
iPhones to iPhones yeah that that does
nothing for me when when you said that I
immediately thought they're shooting
yourself in the foot if they make it
just iPhone to iPhone because you know
there's so many competitors out there
they have to make it they have to open
it up wider for that work on everything
like is Apple uh when we've talked about
like Apple losing their focus are they
trying to be a bank like really come at
all don't be a bank this is not your
expertise like you have what is it
something like how many hundreds of
billions of dollars right like it's not
hundreds of billions but I think it's
around two billion two billion dollars
of cast they're sitting on don't choose
to be a bank that this is not this is
not your your expertise and you're
losing your core audience by doing some
of this stuff sometimes yeah we have
plenty of banks we don't need any more
banks especially an Apple Bank you know
I don't know it just seems funny get
your Mac's right you know get your
iPhone right get your Siri right well
like one way they could get me if they
do create an app or some sort of Apple
cash service is if their fees are
cheaper or you know free you know like
squared they take out a fee every time
you use you charge a credit card if you
punch in the numbers you know by hand it
takes an even bigger fee PayPal takes a
fee if you're doing you know
transactions with people unless it's
like friends and family or something if
Apple makes it where it's completely
free all the time then maybe that would
be compelling but then how do they make
money you know so exactly targets right
it's hard thing to get into Tim Cook's
mo is to make money he actually has
shown us it's about making money for him
specifically not coming out with the
best product out there I'm sorry but I
say seriously right now right then most
completely free you it's so easy to just
you log into your bank account and then
boom you're set up it's like the easiest
thing PayPal is really easy it's getting
complicated sometimes but uh yeah and
PayPal is free if you do friends and
family so yeah and you always should
choose friends and family whether it's
from a family not exactly always I
always tell like customer upall yeah
yeah friendly Sam so again I don't know
how it's if it's gonna really be
different fine
but you make this just an Apple to Apple
platform I don't really care
I really don't yeah and I don't see it
be you know like you to your point Beach
making it absolutely free uh yeah I
wouldn't it would be a nice idea right
it's nice right what are they gonna do
put advertisements in the app I don't
know I don't I don't they make money I
don't I don't understand
all right talking about other services
Apple is looking to work with or
actually partner with this is again
another report from recode musically you
know musically beat tell me you know
musically I don't actually know okay
don't know this is good this is good let
me talk about the story a little bit I I
didn't think you did only because you're
kids aren't that age yet but musically
is syncing up with Apple music in an
attempt to get a kind of expand its
reach as a marketing partner this is for
those of you who don't have kids that
are like let me guess there may be like
7 to 16 ish is kind of like the sweet
spot because I have nieces and nephews
that are like all about this although
the older one is just kind of like over
it now that allowed you it's actually
really cool it allow you to
trait these like quick fun music videos
where you lip-synch to the top songs
directly from your phone at effects slow
modes
people do things like where they're like
imagine like singing and then they open
their mouth like you're going to their
mouth and then the Edit cuts and then
you're somewhere else like stuff like
that
clearly I know way too much about this
right I think I'm putting stuff like
this on you know people that host videos
on history I do like a lot of like hand
tutting and motions like while they're
singing they're like oh and it like
speeds them up too I said that a lot yes
there's even I think I put a link so you
can even watch some of this while we're
talking okay
Apple is a linking up with musically we
talked about how they let users create
and share their own music videos with
snippets of songs so starting Friday
Apple music will be one of the services
that supplies the actual songs they're
still working with music distributor 7
digital Apple will be another partner
with them but it gives again Apple like
this new channel for marketing it will
promote Apple's paid service to its own
users and will allow Apple music
subscribers to listen to full songs
within the app so it's just kind of
weaving these two things together oh I
think that's the Apple music this isn't
it I just put it up for musical effect
oh for musical effects sorry about that
so anyways there you go musically
three-year-old Shanghai based company I
mean it exploded there I can't tell you
how much my niece's would use this app
but again Apple getting involved with
them so we'll see how that plays out
cool cool I'm in other music news you
know WWDC is coming on the corner and
maybe while I'm talking Beach you can
kind of think about maybe what's one
thing or a feature you want to see in
iOS 11 you know it's kind of hard
because we're going to the point where
like our phones are doing so much but
this is a report from Bloomberg Business
Week and it was really a profile about
Jimmy Iovine
one of the heads of Apple music kind of
more on the creative side and former
record label executives with all these
artists Apple may include a new videos
feature in Apple music we've heard about
the carpool karaoke the dr. Dre
documentary but they're looking to have
10 original series planned for this year
10 series so
they're trying to make this not only a
music platform but a video platform
around music based content they things
like there's been a lot of rumors that
point to Apple doing a documentary about
Bad Boy Records
I like this out be awesome I'm down with
that P Diddy yeah that's the first
that's the first video shock me that's
the first show that you mentioned that
I'm interested interested in watching oh
no totally fascinating what about Cash
Money Records
Birdman Henry yeah Lil Wayne I'm not
really a little Wayne fan juvenile back
that a pup back that out you know that
do people even know that song now I hope
they do baby gotta back that app up do
you look good won't you bag that app or
they don't say app though yeah okay so
anyways they're working on documentaries
like that one about Clive Davis that's
recently Apple acquired the documentary
rights to do this so that looks like
that's on the docket as well I mean P
Diddy announced that they're working on
this documentary about it's gonna be
called can't stop won't stop a bad boy
story it's I'm gonna watch that yeah I
want to see that too man a long term
there they want to do additional content
with a music focus it the report talks
about partnering with JJ Abrams Brian
Grazer if any of you don't know who's a
sensational producer but currently as a
producer behind a couple shows Empire
which used to be amazing and then this
new series called genius which is
documenting like a 10 part series about
Albert Einstein and all the things that
he went through during the rise of the
Nazis and and also just his
relationships it's it actually is pretty
fascinating I got to see a little
screener of the first episode so it's on
National Geographic so they're working
with high-level cream of the crop
producers to create content that they
hope to start rolling out by the end of
the year in in Apple music again I'm
it's got to be so good that I
I put money down I know I know here that
still is so weird like why not Apple TV
I mean that that makes sense you know we
already argued about we didn't argue
about it but we talked about this before
I was just weird Apple music seems like
a strange place to put all this content
you know well I will tell you you know
being out here and talking a lot of
different people that there's this new
wave of individual companies now looking
for place to create their own pay for
on-demand channels with exclusive
content behind that and we're talking
about like $5 services right them so for
any of you that are familiar with like
the nerd the Nerdist stuff right they
have like this thing called the Alpha
Channel alpha which is their pay for
platform it's like five dollars a month
Vimeo is getting into it to start
training exclusive content I don't
exactly know when they're going to
launch it they just made an announcement
other other companies are doing the same
stuff like okay five dollars so what's
gonna start really being interesting is
a not only does that content have to be
amazing but how many how many companies
am I gonna be giving $5 to oh wow right
right like everyone's doing that right
now it is out of control
almost yeah those are just a few the
companies I mean there's at least 10
more that I I can't remember off the top
my head that are doing this kind of $5 X
video there's the Comic Con HQ is
another one of those so there's a lot of
people that are trying to figure out but
again Comic Con HQ has this like show
with Mark Hamill Luke Skywalker hanging
out with like super fanboys but I'm not
gonna pay $5 a month to watch that no
way no way I'm just not there yet it has
to be ridiculously good so um Apple
putting all this content behind Apple
music an interesting move we'll see how
it goes but at the same time Apple's
subscriber growth uh you know I think it
hit I think it was around did they hit
the 20 million mark or I know they're at
least at 15 I don't know that and
they're still trailing a lot behind by
Spotify Spotify has something around 50
to 60 the last time I I'm just taking
this off the top my head from what I
remember so but they're they're trying
to make it happen and if you're a
subscriber if this is what keeps you
locked in and maybe they're making
enough revenue from their subscriber
base already and with their projections
they're like you know what whether or
not we get new ones or not we're making
a lot of money to make this more
compelling I could actually see
how that supports that yeah totally also
they do like exclusive performances or
something like titles doing that to IC
titles like launching concert
performances on their site you know that
would probably help a lot too but uh who
knows what they're gonna do yeah you
know we it's a it's an exciting it's
always exciting times in the tech space
where there's so many different you know
disruptive things that are going on
disruptors there's so many disruptors
like you don't you don't know what how
it's gonna play out but everyone's
trying trying to corner these spots so I
just think it's pretty fascinating okay
Beach did you if if there is there one
feature in iOS 11 this next iOS that you
hope they would do or maybe something
that you hope that they do better I'm
just even saying just one yeah I mean
just I've said it probably 50 times on
this podcast but just make I Tunes work
in landscape you know music working
landscape mine I met it's like the
simplest thing they could do and it
would solves a lot of problems so you
know that's one thing I want even their
uh their the phone itself now has
speakers on both ends for a more stereo
effect like shouldn't we be able to
navigate our music collection in
landscape especially because of that now
yes please please that's all I'm asking
for Apple that's I mean everything else
is great I used my phone I have no
problems with it I just when I'm at the
gym I can't turn my phone side where I
do I put it sideways but nothing you
know it doesn't tilt or anything so shot
in the dark
very annoying shot in the dark si on
periscope is asking for iTunes VR how
would that work I'm with I don't want to
know oh yeah you know what you know what
iTunes VR is gonna be is I put on a
headset and look and we'll just play the
visualizer yeah and sorry that that's
what iTunes VR is gonna be like yeah we
all like acid trip maybe yeah alright um
one other story kind of before we get to
the calls this is a story you know what
give me a second cuz I actually have to
look it up because I accidentally closed
it you know how you know how people do
that but this is a story about we know
about the antenna issues that Apple had
with
iPhone 7 I'll I jumped on that really
early because I felt right when I
started using my phone the antenna just
didn't work nearly as well as my iPhone
6s and then we started hearing the
stories about how there were two
different antennas in the iPhone 7s one
was a Qualcomm base one one was an Intel
based one and the Intel base one
actually didn't perform as well and then
in addition to that Apple report
allegedly throttled or changed some of
the performance or you know affected the
Qualcomm base ones so that they would be
a little more on par with each other
although people with Qualcomm base one
said yeah I got better signal in these
areas or you know better performing
signal like I used to so now Apple and
Qualcomm are going back and forth in the
quartz but here's a new development
about just this upcoming iPhone 8 I
stayed away from iPhone 8 stuff this
week because it's all the same crap
right now right it's like hey look at
this render hey look at this plastic
shell that may or may not be the iPhone
7 there's a vertical camera there's may
or may not be rear touch ID like I think
a lot of you that listening this you
know about all this stuff already right
so we want to talk about different stuff
it makes the show more interesting but
this one I did find interesting
according to Roger Chang our own from
CNET the iPhone 8 may miss one key
feature already in the galaxy s 8 and
that feature is gigabit LTE now for the
record gigabit LT is not here yet you
know it say okay fine we may not be
getting a gig of data via LTE but it's
going to be pretty darn fast
according to reports t-mobile will be
rolling out their own gigabit LTE and
promises it by the end of the year if
you're wondering why this gigabit LT
even matter okay in speed test run by
open signal based on an average speed
posted by t-mobile and Verizon right
these are you know these again our test
to give you an idea but based on these
tests gigabit LTE was 18 times faster
than the average speeds posted on
t-mobile Verizon based on what we are
what we use right now how that is asking
times
so what the issue here is that Apple is
still expected to use a combination of
Qualcomm and Intel antennas inside of
the iPhone 8 well guess what the current
Intel modem that will be consumed that
we available for consumers and
commercial ready doesn't have the
ability to hit gigabit LTE speeds no
wall comms can and if you yeah right
yeah so if you think about this Apple
could potentially again potentially this
is all speculation right let's get that
out of the way could it could mean Apple
might end up maybe slowing down the
Qualcomm modem to ensure that iPhones
are on the same footing like this is
what happens when you have two suppliers
in unfortunately this is also what
happens when you have one of the world's
most popular phones that you can't keep
up with the demand that you have to
start looking at multiple suppliers so
that you can still sell hundreds of
millions of phones yeah I mean they've
done it once before they they're
probably gonna do it again you know that
that's what that's what you know that's
what I would think of you know is are
they actually repeating history I think
another thing about this is if this
iPhone is going to be the next like
flagship iPhone right the iPhone eight
like they're their 10th anniversary
badass phone and then it literally
doesn't have and we've seen this in
other phones don't get me wrong when the
first iPhone came out it didn't have 3G
3G was actually readily available it had
two G on the original iPhone gigabit LTE
not on this iPhone 10th anniversary but
it will be flipped on switch it feels
like kind of almost like deja vu right
yeah and they have proven that they did
this before with the iPhone 7 so I
honestly if it takes them time or maybe
this is an issue that won't time won't
fix itself because if they're using
Intel modems or using Intel modems
alongside Qualcomm modems it's kind of
something that people can point out like
your phone is literally not even is 10
times not even 18 times slower let's say
it's a difficult day and everyone's on
the phone your phone is 10 times slower
than mine that's a lot yeah
that is a lot and basically throttling
themselves right apples I always
complain about 18t throttling me after I
get to like 20 gigs of data since I'm a
grandfather unlimited data guide but now
we can complain that apple's throttling
the phone their own phone yeah it's
basically the same thing right am i
wrong no it's it's it's it is ish and
yeah I mean also Samsung's Galaxy s8 the
chip inside it that are Snapdragon 835
processor and the modem that they're
using hits gigabit LTE speed so arguably
the top rival phone that is out today
will have gigabit LTE support and that's
to me that's that's a big deal you don't
want that you want to be on the equal if
you want to be on this you want to have
the same at least specs in general but
will they still sell tens of millions
hundreds of millions most likely yes but
I think it's important when Apple is
trying to play a lot of catch-up it more
and more every year it feels like
they're behind they need to stop being
perceived that way
totally like you're saying they need to
stop being perceived that way someone in
the chat room
evarin Malpica just said apple is always
in caps behind so that's their
perception now you know yeah it is so
there you go we'll see how it all plays
out but that's I thought that was a
story iPhone story we're talking about
all right you want to go check out who
gave us a colleague call on the phones
you want to do the last the last story
just cuz I had something queued up the
oh you did the marmots are you go ahead
why not okay all right so check this out
uh Wow Beechum's like more content more
content this just yesterday I have got
fired up about this and I should have
brought it over here but Apple on on
Apple's iOS is worse for iPhone and iPad
they released this new app it's called
Marvell color your own okay yeah why is
this important I I'm a fan of the iPad
pro I'm that dude that wants to use the
iPad pro there's adult coloring books
not like my wife uses yeah but they're
like they're actually like you know
really good to relax your mind and
things of that nature yeah that's that's
what they that's what they do right so
I've been for the longest time I'm like
come on like Marvel and DC put out adult
coloring books where I can color in the
actual comic because again I'm I got the
iPad pro because I freaking read comics
all the time every week right I have a
rotation I want to be able to like be at
the airport to be like oh hey star-lord
like yeah like this right oh hey
Deadpool what would you look like with
yellow highlights like stupid stuff like
that will they put out this app now it's
a harv in color your own it's
straight-up adult coloring book I got to
get this for my kids I'm freaking freak
out color get Iron Man and stuff but you
have to have the Apple pen right no no
you can use you I believe it works with
iPhone though also it does cool yeah it
works on the iPhone so here's here's the
catch cuz like all things are catch
Marvel's not going to give their entire
library of just inked versions without
color of the comics for free but what's
cool is there are at least I think
there's around like 10 different
properties in there there's like Civil
War Gardens the Galaxy Avengers Doctor
Strange and they give you at least two
pages that you can color in and again
these are gonna take you hours if you
really want to do them right if your
kids just gonna play with them they can
but there's also like basically a
subscription service okay for it to use
it monthly so that you can get access to
all of the content if you I put a tweet
out and I got it on Twitter and it it
has my screenshot of it but if I recall
right um let me just even pull it up so
I can relay this information at least
over the podcast so in this this service
you can there again like there's a
couple that are free for each of those
comics but it's called ultimate access
feature you have a free 7-day trial
other than just coloring the ones that
they made available it'll put like some
watermark on it but if you really wanted
to be your own
um it's $7.99 a month
oh god that's another one other thing
that I got yeah and then I'm here click
on the middle the on the right hand side
there's three images click on that mid
one more down okay go to the next one
here you go
$7.99 a month if you want to use it for
the entire and unlock all the pages to
color like there's it's pretty amazing
but
it's $39.99 a year and that's 50% off
Wow
50% off that's raising so again I get it
they need to make money because they
shouldn't they really shouldn't just
release their entire collection of inked
pages and let people go to town but wow
that's a lot of money that is a lot of
money but again I love it so I'm gonna
take my time and color the free ones
that they have um but it's it is pretty
expensive right definitely
what if we were just complaining about
five dollars a month now this thing's
like seven dollars a month crazy I mean
that that's a lot of my but yeah it's
like x-men is part of that a lot a lot
of good stuff in there cool right on all
right well I'm glad I'm glad we finished
the news on a high note so let's go do
some voicemails yeah for your wallet
okay here we go let me get my voicemail
system set up here number one call
thanks for calling let me turn off this
uh hang on a second
I had the Marvel theme going and now
jungle jamming yeah here we go yo Brian
what's up with the UH the 12-inch
MacBook they usually come out March
April no update this year what's the
deal man I like always this is like it's
like oh man like what what he's alright
that's real he's keeping it real I wish
I wish he dropped his name but thanks
for calling you know what the MacBook is
is like a product that is like their
their sleekest sexiest device but it
just doesn't have enough power and I
think because they put so much again
when Apple is too much attention on so
many other things they put all their
attention on the touch bar MacBook Pros
that's all they did for the past two
years or so and that's why and the
MacBook isn't a top seller but it's
there sleekest X design it is expensive
because it's like their design I
remember the MacBook Air which was kind
of the MacBook that you see now before
it came out right it was the super sleek
one that was below an iBook and and a
MacBook Pro and they'd it took two years
for it to actually have enough speed to
compete with some of the others and
that's when I bought it I see it the
same way with this MacBook just a
beautiful proof-of-concept piece they
know that
Apple loyalists will buy it it is
ultralight it is ultra sexy it is
functional but it doesn't have enough
power to hang as like a a hardcore
multimedia type machine it's just really
like an expensive entry-level MacBook
that's it you know what I mean just pace
on design so I do expect them to update
it normally it's around actually more
like the August September timeframe so
hopefully we see something with that
it's just gonna be most likely just new
processors and whatnot but um
I do not expect to see them putting a
touch bar in the MacBook just the size
of it they're not gonna be able to keep
it that thin so to stay posted if you
have one already and you wanted a new
one I can understand why you might be
frustrated but I don't think they've
updated it fur feels like a year and a
half or so I should double-check that
but we will um we'll find that out we'll
get go get to the next call and see if I
can find it while we're listening all
right next call here we go hey Brian I'm
Steven this is Alex from Colorado and I
wanted to piggyback on Brian's comments
about I works I wrote my entire
dissertation in pages because at the
time Office for Mac didn't render the
right-to-left scripts correctly pages oh
nine wasn't great with right-to-left
scripts like Arabic but it was more than
functional compared to Office for Mac
the pages 60.0 update a few years ago
drastically improved that functionality
and as a result I stuck to I works even
though Microsoft on Mac is getting
better with the right cost scripts okay
take care thanks guys legit see this is
why okay so I kind of I think I kind of
started a storm because when I said like
who uses pages like people definitely
let me know that they use pages but they
were cool about it you know cuz I'm on
it I want to know so that was an awesome
call using it for your dissertation I
had another writer um and his name was
Sam so cool he has a verified check on
his name too but he's like I use pages
all the time plenty of you told me that
but I thought was interesting cuz you
never hear about pages but like I think
I almost like poke the bear or something
like everyone's like dude I use pages so
I'm gonna hold back because I don't use
it I'm not I shouldn't be judgmental
about and I'm not I'm just always
curious Ike who actually uses pages
because I'm always just using Google
Docs or Microsoft Word but those are
legit reasons and I'm glad people are
using it that's cool and it's
that it's free now yeah and a big reason
why we use Google Docs to is because
it's tied into our work email so we're
kinda that's true kind of like almost
forced to use it you know that's super
true that's super
so yeah we're not on not being judgey
all right judge judgey judgey okay we
have one more call cord cutter update
homie and Alameda my neighborhood here
we go hey this is Nick from Alameda hey
I just want to give you a cord cutter
update DirecTV now has gone and pushed
back to features that they had
discontinued for a couple months
one is a rewind feature on certain
channels for shows so if you missed a
movie or you're catching the tail end of
it you could hit a button and it will
take you back to the beginning of that
movie which is awesome definitely worth
its weight in gold and then the other
one is a 72-hour rewind feature for some
channels so let's say it's Friday and
you miss the episode of your show that
happened on Wednesday you can rewind
that channel all the way to that day and
time and then watch the TV show so hey
thanks a bunch just figured I'd give you
that update and the last podcast I was
on man my wife's got a kick out of how
you guys called me out for Mickey in the
Roadster racers why I was going off of
the premise that you guys had or Steve
had children so you know I was just
throwing somebody a bone but it was all
in good fun talk to you later bye
yeah yeah it was like Mickey what racers
miklusak roaster racers man way to get
it out can you say Mickey roasters
racers five times really fast do it
right he's roaster racers Mickey's
roaster racers Mickey no I can't do it I
didn't think so
that's art decides I wanted throw out
there just a quick follow up on some of
the calls the last time they updated the
MacBook was just a little bit over a
year ago so they're actually kind of on
track with that it's around like 370
days or so so I just want to let people
know that yeah and also also
because of my judgey judgey on apple's
pages i will accept a bad apple a bad
apple brian bad apple Hey what he was
talking about the rewind at the
beginning of your show
I guess DirecTV there's a lot a lot of
products have that amazon has that but
the 72-hour saving your all of your
favorite channels in the cloud or
something for 72 hours that's pretty
cool I but it's not rid of that before
the thing is with the AT&amp;amp;T service
though although that is cool for the
direct now service look I use Play
Station view and it keeps shows that you
missed that you DVR'd up to a month oh
wow
and it's in the cloud but what he was
saying it just sounded like it's an
automatic thing like it just saves the
last 72 hours of like that Boston you
were watching yeah it seems kind of new
it's just like a backup like an
automatic backup kind of thing that's
kind of neat I mean I got a it's it's so
layered that it's hard to just do one
that's simple but I got I should do a
comparison about like all four services
just like that be like a 20 minute video
no one's gonna be able don't even want
people don't even watch this for five
minutes so a couple people do I know I
know there are there actually there's
good amount all right so I think we're
good Beach that's it yeah thank you
gonna wrap it up all right thanks so
much everybody again be a part of the
show call us call me out we do want to
