standing next to sony's kdl 65 s 990 a
this is the world's first LED based LCD
TV with a curved screen now we've seen
curved OLED TVs in the past from Samsung
and LG this is Sony's first curved
screen but it's not an OLED it's an LED
based LCD the same as all the other LED
based LCDs out there it's got edge
lighting this time on the top and the
bottom of the screen with Sony curved
the screen itself and also curved the
edge lighting this is also a 65 inch TV
so the curve is going to be a little
less aggressive and in person it doesn't
look quite as curved as those TVs it
also has a somewhat wider angle a degree
so all told the curve it's going to be a
little bit less noticeable and in my
quick opinion a little bit more
enjoyable than those curves otherwise
this TV is very similar to Sony's past
dynamic edgelet LED TVs the high-end
models another nice thing about this TV
is that it's actually shipping now it's
not a concept piece this is going to be
available in October for $39.99 that's a
quick look at Sony's edge lit LED based
LCD with a curved screen 65 inch or I'm
