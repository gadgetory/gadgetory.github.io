Carey and this is your CNET update the
Apple watch will come in several styles
one of which is solid gold but it seems
it's not made of ordinary gold it's
magical Apple gold in an interview with
the Financial Times though watch's
creator Johnny I've said that the
molecules in Apple gold are closer
together making it twice as hard as
standard gold well it does sound far-out
but Ars Technica points to a patent that
Apple filed back in 2014 regarding a
method for forming a gold metal matrix
composite that's part gold and part
ceramic it could be two to four times
harder than normal 18 karat gold if
that's the case brace yourself for that
special Apple Gold to be at a special
eye popping price we're also learning
that Apple had some very tight
restrictions for the first watch apps
bloomberg reports that Apple has a
secret lab for select companies to test
out their apps before the watch launches
no one can bring in anything from the
outside into this lab not paper or a
phone the lab has no internet access and
code written in the lab cannot leave the
building Apple is also encouraging
developers to design apps that are used
for no more than 10 seconds at a time
after all the point of the watch is to
glance at information quickly otherwise
you just use a smartphone and the 10
second factor will help with battery
life Apple needs great apps to convince
people to buy the watch I mean sure
there's gonna be people who will buy it
no matter what but to reach success
beyond the fans and to convince people
it's worth more than $350 the apps need
to add value to your life in a way a
smartphone alone cannot count on the NFC
sensor inside to be one of those ways
letting you transfer data open hotel
doors or make payments with a wave and
top of your wristwatch Apple will fill
in the gaps to our questions at an event
Monday streaming live from San Francisco
at 10 a.m. Pacific 1:00 p.m. Eastern you
can be sure we'll hear about Fitness
related apps as health is becoming a big
selling feature Fitbit is one of the
leaders in the fitness tracking gadget
space and the company just acquired the
app fitstar that's an app that creates
custom exercise video programs for
users with the two becoming one now
Fitbit users can sync data with specific
workout video programs in other app news
Shazam is expanding beyond identifying
music the mobile app can identify what
song is playing around you and it also
serves as a portal to buy that song but
a Shazam executive told Reuters that the
next step for the app is to identify
products in retail stores by pointing
your phone's camera at the product scan
the DVD case and you can get a link to
the movie soundtrack but it could also
go beyond music scan a cereal box and it
could show you the nutritional
information that's your tech news update
and you can dive into more at cnn.com
