devices is the biggest sibling of the
Lumia 640 bumping up not only the screen
size but also increasing the battery and
popping in a better rear camera as well
I'm Nikki Lee senior editor for cnet.com
Lumia 640 and 640 XL a termed Microsoft
devices range of affordable handsets the
small size 640 costs just $299 in
Australia and 120 pounds in the UK it's
still on its way to America 640 XL jumps
up to $399 Australian 219 pounds and 240
dollars in America but you're getting
quite a bit of bang for your buck the
5.7 inch screen has a 720p IPS display
same as for its smaller stablemate which
means slightly for your pixels per inch
259 vs. 294 it's still more than fine
for YouTube videos and viewing your
photos speaking of photos the XL offers
a 13 megapixel camera with a carl zeiss
lens a big jump up from the basic 640
the battery is also larger with 3000
milliamp hours a bit smaller than saying
the Galaxy Note 4 but nothing to be
sneezed at the processor remains the
same as the 640 that's a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 but
the XL feels more than fast enough when
you're using it the 4G LTE modem is of
course the other big bonus with the
excel particularly great here in
Australia where 4G networks are being
expanded and developed all over the
country the 640 XL unit we have has a
matte finish to its removable back this
is the single-sim version of the excel
there are variants that include dual SIM
and one that's even 3g but this is the
only one you're gonna find in Australia
while the plastic finish can't match the
metal feel of phones like the HTC One m9
or the Galaxy s6 the price makes the
Lumia 640 XL LTE a great option for
anyone after a big screen phone with 4G
on a budget I'm Nick Healy for more
