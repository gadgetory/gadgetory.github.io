booth in Mobile World Congress 2014
we're taking a look at this it's the
Kazaam tornado 25.0 an optical
smartphone from a small uk-based company
that wants to take on the likes of
Samsung let's take a look so let's talk
a little bit about the hardware that you
get with this phone
the tornado 25.0 has a 5-inch display
with a 720p resolution
it looks quite sharp to me it also packs
a gigabyte of RAM and eight gigabytes of
storage if I flip it around that's an 8
megapixel camera on the front there's a
2 megapixel camera now I mentioned that
optical chip it's a 1.7 gigahertz
mediatek processor I think you'll
probably be hard pushed to really
exploit all those calls and use that
processor to its full capacity but it
certainly feels very slick to you so I'm
excited about its performance potential
this isn't the fanciest version of the
tornado - there's also a 5.5 inch
version that has a higher resolution
screen more RAM and 13 and 5 megapixel
cameras gazhams phones are mostly in
sale around Europe they're not in the US
yet the company knows it's an underdog
doe so it has some cool customer service
policies to try and tempt you for
example if you break the phone screen in
the first year you can get it replaced
for free the first time it happens you
can also have a rep remotely access your
phone to do any troubleshooting there's
no fixed price yet but I don't think
that this coin is going to be too
expensive we're expecting to see it
somewhere around the 300 euro mark it's
interesting to see what these underdog
companies are coming up with and I think
Kazaam is definitely one to keep an eye
