the second generation iPad so what is
iPad 2 what have we learned what can we
improve well it is an all-new design it
is not a tweak design it's not got
marginal improvements it's a completely
new design and the first thing is it's
dramatically faster we have a new chip
we call a 5-hour chip wizards have come
up with this and it's great its
dual-core processors alright two
processors inside and so we get up to
twice as fast on CPU performance but
we've really gone all out on the
graphics performance up to nine times
faster graphics the graphics on this
thing are wonderful same low power as a4
we don't want to give up any of that
legendary battery life and even though
others are starting the ship I think
this is going to be the first dual-core
tablet to ship in volume so a5 is a
really a quite an achievement and is
going to give us something that's up to
twice as fast on CPU performance up to
nine times faster on graphics and the
first iPad was no slouch so a lot faster
with a five second we've built in some
cameras for video we've got a rear
camera out the back and we've got a
front facing camera out the front we'll
talk more about that in a few minutes
we've also built in the gyroscope that
we have in the iPhone and the iPod touch
now having built in all of this stuff
one of the most startling things about
the iPad 2 is it is dramatically thinner
not a little bit thinner aford thinner
33% thinner
that's what it looks like so if you look
at the numbers when you look at the
numbers go on from thirteen point four
millimeters down to eight point eight
millimeters thick it's dramatic and for
those of you that have iPhone 4s the new
iPad 2 is actually thinner than your
iPhone 4 so we're incredibly happy with
this and when you get your hands on one
it feels totally different and all these
other tablets are coming out most of
them even thicker than the original iPad
nothing even approaching this in
addition to thicker it's lighter as well
going from 1.5 pounds down to 1.3 and
you might not think that's a lot but
when you get down to 1.5 pounds a tenth
of a pound is a lot and it feels quite a
bit lighter and it's got an all new
design it's just beautiful so this is
what it looks like it's really thin and
it comes in two colors black and white
we're going to be shipping white from
day one
and to give you some scale this is what
it looks like again you can just pick
this thing up it almost floats black and
white black or whites here now in
addition to having both colors we also
have models that work with both AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon 3G networking from day one and
you would think that we would have to
give up some of the iPads legendary
battery life but our engineering team
found a way and we have the same
legendary ten-hour battery life as the
original iPad with all this extra stuff
in it and yet dramatically thinner and
again that's over a month of standby so
ten hours of battery life again a lot of
these other guys are coming out with
substantially less and this has been
tried and tested by every reviewer iPads
get 10 hours of battery life so we're
really happy to keep that and never let
that go now in addition to preserving
the battery life when we add all this
stuff we've also preserved the price and
so we're going to keep the same exact
prices starting at just $4.99 same exact
prices is the current iPad yet with all
these new features a dramatically
improved product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
