Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the Xbox one game console has a
code of conduct policy that has upset a
number of owners there's this new tool
called upload studio it leaches save
edit and share a short clip of your game
to show off to other xbox users and you
can include your own audio commentary or
reaction captured from the Kinect camera
but if you use profanity and swear in
your audio commentary it violates the
xbox live code of conduct and it could
result in a suspension of privileges on
Xbox Live the punishment includes being
blocked from using the video chat
service skype for 24 hours or more some
xbox users had no worrying about this
potential punishment they just
discovered that they couldn't use Skype
with a poorly written message on the
screen that said they couldn't use the
program because of past behavior as of
now a user has no indication of what
they did wrong or how long they're
blocked these upload studio clips can be
posted to a player's xbox live profile
and shared with friends or the full Xbox
Live community a Microsoft spokesperson
didn't answer detailed questions on
exactly how this profanity punishment
works but here's the funny thing about
it all it appears that players are not
getting in trouble if they upload a clip
of a mature rated game like Battlefield
4 where the characters in the scene are
cursing up a storm and showing graphic
violence rather it seems Microsoft is
just punishing gamers who don't keep
their language clean and in other xbox
one news for the early buyers who got a
broken console that cannot reduce
microsoft is offering a free launch game
download to anyone who reports the issue
to customer support and goes through the
Xbox one advanced exchange program to
get a new machine there's been some
drama over YouTube's new comment system
in which it ties into Google Plus and
has seen a rise in spam but the YouTube
team has announced it launched three
updates that can combat the spam and
have the system recognized malicious
links and impersonation attempts it's
also changing how long
comments are displayed next up YouTube
will work on a way for video publishers
to moderate comments in bulk and I'll
leave you with something to chew on this
holiday while many in the US are
enjoying thanksgiving dinner with family
the nasa astronauts aboard the
international space station will be
enjoying their very own thanksgiving
meal out of bags in a video sent from
ISS we learned that there will be
irradiated turkey thermos stabilized
yams and freeze-dried green beans not
exactly how mom used to make it but it's
something that's your tech news update
but you can find more details on the
show blog sina com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
