with the 70 inch vizio yi 71 ia3 this is
a relatively inexpensive 70 inch LED TV
right around 2 grand right now and we
consider it probably the best value
among large screen LED TVs there's also
a 60 inch version I deal with that in
another review but it's a equally
excellent value this vizio TV delivers
all the features you'd expect including
smart TV it also has pretty slick
styling and of course the picture
quality really decent so we'll get to
all that in a little bit let's start
with the design though the framer on the
edge of this TV is really thin so when
you have it in a room it looks almost
all picture and that's pretty much a
good thing with the TV this large it
tries to be as understated as possible
the bezel here is a little bit thicker
along the bottom the stand is not swivel
the TV of course seen from the side is
extremely thin as you'd expect from an
LED TV so all told pretty discreet for a
70 inch shirt we mentioned Smart TV
Vizio suite has excellent content that
includes Amazon Instant Hulu Plus
Netflix all the big players are there
and there's also plenty of audio
including Rhapsody and Pandora so really
one of the best content selections out
there among smart TV Suites the
interface itself does seem a little
dated it pops up along the bottom you
can only see four at a time so it's a
lot of scrolling if you have a lot of
apps installed another nice thing about
the vizio is if you flip the remote over
you get a QWERTY keyboard that allows
you to easily enter two searches and
other information to the smart TV and
really eases instead of using those
on-screen keyboards found on most other
Smart TV Suites the downside of the
QWERTY is that you have to keep it aimed
straight at the TV because it doesn't
use bluetooth it uses infrared instead
around back there's plenty of inputs
there's four HDMI is a PC input and a
component video input as well as a pair
of USB so nothing really missing picture
settings on the vizio not quite as
extensive as some of the other TVs out
there though you do get a massive number
of picture presets based on sports the
advanced settings only include a two
point grayscale there's no gamma or
color management system but on the flip
side the TV is pretty darn accurate out
of the box as long as you select the
movie picture mode the picture quality
on the video compares well with a lot of
your LED TVs out there although it's not
among the best one of its weaknesses is
a relatively light black level so you
don't get those deep inky blacks we've
seen on some of the large screen plasmas
and some of the very best LED TVs on the
flip side it does a very accurate color
so we really appreciated that the color
does fall apart a little bit in the dark
areas but all told it's really nice off
angle performance again not a huge
benefit to this television it does wash
out significantly when seen from off
angles but of course the larger size
does help ameliorate that a little bit
if you sit back TV also has a nice matte
screen so again with a large screen you
like to have matte to kind of get rid of
some of those really bright reflections
in a room so all told in a bright room
this video will perform very well of
course you can't spend a couple hundred
more at 65 and 70 inches to get a lot
better picture quality but if you're
fine with the decent picture and you
really like the videos styling and smart
TV it's a superb value that's a quick
look at Vizio 70 inch e71 ia3 I'm David
