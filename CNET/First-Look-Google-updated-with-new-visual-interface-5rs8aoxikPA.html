update adding a new feature that just
might make you get more involved with
the service if you're not already hi i'm
jason parker and this is a first look at
the latest update to google plus verizon
Google's social network has struggled
somewhat because many people are already
on Facebook and Twitter and wonder why
would they want to join yet another
social network with the new version of
google plus for iphone a new feature
edition could bring more iphone users
into the fold stream is the lifeblood of
google+ showing you a feed of shared
links videos and messages from people in
your circles in the new version for the
iphone google has incorporated large
richly colored images into stream that
load smoothly as you scroll through
improving the overall browsing
experience you can add your plus-one to
a post and stream by touching the number
in the lower right or you can touch
anywhere on the image to see a preview
of the post make comments and add your
plus-one there if you approve with the
new look stream almost feels like a blog
feed showing stories and post
chronologically it's very
straightforward and easy on the eyes it
might be the interface feature that
makes Facebook users start to want to
spend more time on google+ one drawback
to the new look is that you can't read
comments in stream without touching the
image and going to the next screen
forcing you to switch back and forth on
every post while it adds an extra step
the new look definitely gives the a
better feel so we'll have to see how
iphone users respond it's important to
note that there is still no version of
google plus that is made for the ipad
but you can use the iphone app on your
ipad with pixel doubling well functional
it doesn't look nearly as good so you
may just want to stick with using google
plus on the iphone you can get the
latest version of google plus right now
for your iphone and the itunes app store
or by updating the app on your iphone
i'm jason parker from cnet and this has
been a first look at the latest version
of google plus pariah thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
