energy these days but its efficiency
could use a boost enter this Sol bot a
new robot that can increase the power
output of a single solar panel by up to
40% by some estimates
nature is our mother of our inspirations
so when the sunflower follows the Sun it
does that because it wants to get the
maximum amount of sunlight on it
so in order to get the maximum energy
out of the Sun you have to follow the
Sun exactly traditionally these dual
access panels are outfitted with costly
motors and controllers to do the
rotating but now the rugged Sol bot does
the heavy lifting just like a physician
goes from one patient to the next and
monitors the patient and you know gets
their chart the sole board goes from one
tracker to the next and is able to
monitor everything about that tracker
and send it back to us here's how the
Sol bot works okay so the Sol bot is now
approaching and it will pull up and
align itself to the station these
Pistons will stick out and engage the
dog ears to the system the computer on
board knows exactly where the Sun is and
it can adjust the azimuth and elevation
to point right at the Sun and then this
all that moves on to the next line just
keeps doing the rest of the array it's
about five seconds per array - Sol BOTS
will work every track and they'll
alternate well one is adjusting the
panels for 40 minutes the other will
charge in a docking station just like
this in that 40 minutes one Sol bot can
manage up to 200 panels or 300 kilowatts
of energy our system is so scalable and
it's designed in modules that you can
build anything from 300 kilowatts to
multiple megawatts from this system this
Sol bot is compatible with all types of
dual axis solar panels and is designed
to withstand extreme temperatures
efficient and inexpensive to deploy the
engineers at cubics are banking on this
bright idea and San Mateo I'm Kara
