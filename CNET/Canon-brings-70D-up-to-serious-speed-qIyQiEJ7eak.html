version of the Canon EOS 70d for about a
week now and while there's a lot that's
improved in it including the new
autofocus system I hope Canon can tweak
the video quality before the camera
ships even in its early state the
cameras fast the new dual pixel CMOS
sensor based autofocus system is
responsive and reasonably accurate
combined with its seven frame per second
burst rate a quick design for changing
auto focus area settings and a decent
viewfinder it's really quite nice for
action shooting not pro class but not
too shabby for a twelve hundred dollar
body video the touch focus works well
for racking it snaps decisively but not
unattractively fast from subject to
subject the camera has the roughly the
same body design as the 60d with some
important tweaks the mode dial is more
streamlined with fewer auto options the
articulated LCD has canons very nice
touch screen with its excellent
interface and the lock button for the
multi controller is better my one
complaint is about the multi controller
it's smaller than before and even harder
to precisely manipulate also the 70d
only has a single SD card slot compared
to dual slots in the nikon d70 100 it
does have a reasonable if not stellar
Wi-Fi implementation as well my only
significant issue with the camera in its
current state pre-production is the
image quality part of that stems from
canons default color settings which I've
never liked that will probably live
through till final production and you
certainly have the ability to change
them to something more natural and less
crunchy JPEGs look fine through iso 1600
pretty comparable to the d70 100 but
even in RAW files there doesn't seem to
be a lot of preserved highlight detail
in high contrast shots and I couldn't
bring up shadows without introducing
more noise than I liked that said the
still photo quality remains pretty
competitive however based on my testing
the video quality still needs some work
before the camera ships even in the all
I codec at best it looks the same as the
video from the t5 I it displays tons of
edge artifacts ringing alias
Moray and crawling edges but more
disappointingly poor detail resolution
and limited tonal range well light video
is exceptionally noisy if Canon can't
improve at least a little bit before
shipping that will be sad it would be
ashamed to tie such a great autofocus
system to such a minute video I'm Laurie
grinning and this is an early version of
the Canon Yosemite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
