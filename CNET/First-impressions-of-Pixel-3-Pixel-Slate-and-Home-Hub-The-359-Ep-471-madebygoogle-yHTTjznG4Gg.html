with me our special guest Dan Ackerman
and Jessica dull Court hello Google had
a busy day adding three new products to
its Hardware family let's dive straight
into the pixel three first just what
stood out most for you what stood out is
really a lack of what stood out this is
definitely the most refined of all the
pixel devices it looks kind of the same
this bar shrunk on the back a little bit
that glossy like they called the
two-tone yes the colors are pretty
neutral it kind of looks more like an
iPhone it's running the Android
operating system the latest one which is
Android Pi so that's really interesting
to see because of course pixel
represents Google's vision for what an
Android phone really should be at its
best so it is interesting to see that
there I have some problems with the
operating system
one thing that's notable is there are
two cameras on the front yes and it's
taking a leaf out of LG's playbook and
that's so you can take like group
selfies we took one last night that
actually had 13 people in it so it works
notably is that there is one camera lens
on the back when you buy companies like
LG and Huawei that are putting three
cameras on the back so I'd say what
we're looking at is a refined iteration
and it's got the hardware specs that you
expect for a flagship phone but there's
not that one killer feature or as some
would say maybe a gimmick oh that's
interesting to me that the the larger XL
was the only one with a notch and they
kept with the standard you know the
standard smartphone designed for the
smaller version is it because they're
made by two different manufacturers
again like they were last year who's
making these two I talked about well it
should be their in-house team they
brought over from HTC you heard of that
deal last year it was was HTC LG LG yeah
well I talked to them about sort of the
hardware build and they said it was just
a matter of not being able to fit the
components into the smaller version and
making the knotch look fine look you
know work I guess cuz if you notice the
the notch on the bigger phone it's it's
a lot bigger than some of the other
notches out there so part of the reason
why is because it's making room for
those two front-facing camera lenses
exactly and still no like you know 3d
face secure face and like unlock like
the iPhone has right alright moving
to the pixel slate which is kind of like
a surface Chrome OS powered it even has
an expensive keyboard accessory Dan what
do you think uh yeah it's a Chromebook
meets a surface pro from Microsoft they
had an expensive thing last year the
pixel book which was a very nice
high-end Chromebook but high-end
Chromebook is a bit of an oxymoron and
people think of those as cheap laptops
but Kim you could make a case for one
the problem with this guy is if it's the
slate and then you clip on the keyboard
but just like the surface just like the
iPad pro they show it to you with the
keyboard right and they give you a price
but then you got to buy the keyboard
separately
it's like $200 that's crazy it's a
keyboard when you route it all together
you've got even like the surface surface
has the same problem for Microsoft but
if this thing is starts at 6 for the
keyboard is 2
it's a 33 it's a 1/3 premium to add the
keyboard Wow plus 100 bucks for a stylus
I don't know my style this is from
everybody or $100 it seems crazy to me
all right lastly there was the home hub
we saw we just saw the Facebook portal
as well as the echo show coming out two
weeks ago those two touted video chat as
a core service but this one interesting
way has has no camera I'm just curious
what you guys thought about its
obviously so you can put one in the
bathroom right yes in the future devices
that don't have cameras that's going to
become you know a bullet point feature
no camera because no one actually enjoys
video chatting I think one person on my
phone or my tablet where I can move
around uh-huh we still have laptops oh
yeah people still use Skype you know I
think what's interesting about it is of
course that it's bringing Google
services into the home in a way that
obviously is meant to destabilize Amazon
and the big wins that amazon has you
know won so far the gains they've made
the other thing I want to do less than
talk to be on the phone is video chat
with people well there you go for our
full coverage and all things Google took
us on CNET our mother Jane Jessica Dahl
card Dan thanks for listening
why do we have to say our own names I
always find it very awkward and remember
this show originated as an audio podcast
it's don't listen to it so to be
identified it's no vilified ribbing did
you actually just turn the audio off
yeah video to get out so in the meantime
it's time for you guys to send in your
questions and comments about the event
and our takeaways from everything we saw
yesterday and will continue to see
throughout the week I think the thing
that everybody wants you to talk about
is more about that much when did we
decide that was like a cool thing to
have what Apple decided I really not the
first made it cool well I would say the
essential just sort of came and
disappeared really really quickly people
are still buying it for like 255 what
the essential yeah up until recently
yeah because the price slashed anyway
we're not talking about that essentially
but you can't okay of course we first
found out at the nod to GU about the
knotch
support from Android at Google i/o yes
they first introduced the what would
become a high the beta right so that was
first introduced and everybody freaked
out and why is android supporting
notches now and so that led to a lot of
speculation about with the pixel you
have it google's
response was well we want to support all
of the Android manufacturers because
they were going ahead and they're
creating not support anyway right Huawei
LG you know Xiaomi like tons oboe and 1
plus like Titleist goes on different
manufacturers we're already using the
knotch there were these different
designs that Google supported as well
because that was a developer build so
you have the knotch that you see on this
phone which we all thought looked huge
it looked exactly like that so then
there was also a corner knotch
you know for phones like xiaomi makes a
phone that has oh yeah the camera facing
camera in the corner like you could put
a notch there right and
and so the double notch the top and the
bottom a little bit of a lip on the
bottom so it's not the next generation
we're not more not just everywhere man I
just I hate this notch max I hate it so
much that's all it is to it this is just
a fad until they come across the next
thing so screw you Apple for initiating
well look it is definitely like I think
it's a kind of a bridge feature or not
feature but bridge it's me don't you
dare call that a feature it's a
simulation of a feature created to give
you the appearance of having a larger
screen yes until they get like the
technology of the glass know how they
market it wait so was there an actual
question or are we just talking we're
just talking it up I'm diggin out more
questions and they're all about the
distinct and not why are they really
let's take a real question from
priority-one he says i'm a camera nut I
used to own a DSLR time to change back
to Android from iOS iPhone 10 on the
basis of photographs alone in the pixel
3 he's pretty much asking like what was
your response to the camera on there now
they both did a really impressive
photography session there at the keynote
yesterday and I actually thought that
was really kind of fun and cool and how
they did the magazine covers and
everything there so what is our gut
feelings on this bold brave a single
lens camera absolutely um well so what
Google is basically saying it's
basically thumbing its nose and every
other manufacturer that has multiple
camera is saying with our software and
our AI and our machine learning it is so
advanced we can do better or at least
the same with one lens and you can with
your three let's point out that what a
lot of what Google is doing is behind
the scenes and I also want to say that
our review is underway so we have taken
some photos but not we're not at the
point where we're doing the deep camera
comparison dive against the others
Google phones the pixels have been very
reliable for taking low-light shots that
low-light shots tend to
have a lot of contrast they tend to have
a lot of details they're not the
brightest like Samsung they're not
artificially bright right so this
processing is going to change they could
become a little bit brighter but in
terms of like less noise and sort of
what you want to share I would say that
that there's that reputation and it's
been earned and it's the same thing with
portrait mode for selfies you know I've
taken selfies with other phones and the
pixel to was like the only one that
correctly identified my curly hair and
didn't blur it into the background so
the software is working and I would say
that you know everything Google has told
us is very iterative you know when you
look at the presentation you're like oh
wow a night sight this new mode and
you'll never have to use a flash but
when you stop and think about it it's
kind of the same promise as every other
pixel just probably a little bit better
right and and that's sort of what
Google's been doing it's just been
making everything better well my
question is how much of this is hardware
versus software and if it is all
software in terms of making the photos
better and adding all these extra
features how easy does have to port to
other phones either other Android phones
or whatever I would say I mean given the
fact that it is a single camera it's
probably software have yeah there's just
point like the use of a I machine
learning like picture recognition
software specific it may be more it may
be more difficult to like I support
those features over other Android makers
because I think a lot of those other
OEMs fine-tuned their camera experiences
to their own specifications so I think
it'd be tough and Google probably
wouldn't want to it's already providing
the base platform it's up to these other
you know phone makers to differentiate
and one of the ways that they do that is
with all of these cameras or with their
own software you know because they don't
want to be just like the dumb phone
right they want to offer something to
you and it's interesting to consider LG
or the Huawei what's unique about a
product that's hardware based versus
what software based and suffer is easier
to at least copy yes and and and clone I
think in this case first engineer in
this case it may be a combination sure
yeah hard to replicate elsewhere that
might be built into Android I think
you're perfectly right there is one
feature I wanted to talk about that was
the camera is the top shot no it's not
top shot it's such I was pretty cool
cool what we have the iPhones have that
burst mode yeah that's why we choose the
no the call screen feature that's
awesome I'm down with that duplex
basically having someone answer the
phone and then a transcription of that
I'm gonna hear the call live with my a I
assistant are you want you yes
smack-talking
yes you were - laughs hello who who are
you state your business we are from
goodbye can we choose different accents
for whoever supposed to be like nine
voices at least with the original Google
assistant edition of nine voices John
Legend is supposed to be one of those
but I haven't but that was pretty
consistent undecided but with duplex you
know you could presumably like Jews like
they're the same voice right duplex so I
don't think it has to be but but duplex
is basically like the script that is
written right it's like it's the
platform for understanding that kind of
conversation and being yeah the voice is
just sort of like file1 file2 because
the key is to let you record your own
voice reading various thing it's like 20
minutes and then it knits together you
answering the phone that would be super
creepy at some point we'll just we just
like completely offload our phone
conversations to duplex like there's
nothing take this fun honey I'll be late
love you I don't think anyone who knows
me would be inconsiderate enough to
actually voice call me on the phone well
there's that too but yeah given all the
robo calls we get the closing numbers
okay this is actually one of those fears
of like wow I wish this was on every
phone will that be on the iPhone 11
probably not anybody else smell a reboot
of the Jerky Boys coming with the Plex I
that's that's a sponsor deal I'd be on
board with I'll bring my glasses and my
shoes I got them what questions do you
got let's take a few more from syringe I
will
Google+ app have not support when I away
more relevant to evil from CERN joy any
further information about duplex since
you guys were on the topic anyways
besides specifically what we saw just at
the keynote no we didn't see much of
what we saw at the keynote was a really
great application that existed outside
of what we saw at Google i/o I would say
it's like the first real application
that has made sense to me
absolutely and didn't necessarily creep
you out because you kind of want to
creep out the robocallers
well part of what the creep out factor
was at Google i/o it was a lack of
information they weren't communicating
exactly like were you right how it
worked and the fact that it would
identify itself and like when you would
use it so they just kind of gave you
like the high level was your benefit and
then I also think the whole like
identifying themselves that whole came
up it was creepy ahead of time I hear
they're trying to show off this random
nuclear launch codes over to do planes
now so we have nothing to worry about
yeah so yeah I thought that was cool I
want to see that in action that's
something that we haven't tested yet
maybe well of course but I feel like
that's something you don't want to force
like you just want it to happen
naturally right and then monitor let's
take a couple of maybe slights or
criticisms here Jerrod Glenn says I wish
I didn't see the Niagara Falls of leaks
that was cherry on top the Google troll
video I would have enjoyed the
conference so much more Hughie egg says
Home Hub is not being released in Canada
and it's causing a bit of hate to our
neighbors to the north as much as
Canadians are capable of hate being so
mellow tempered usually I mean they
apologize for it but so let's let's talk
like that let's talk about the keynote
and the days leading up to it overall
the the the presentation was was okay
they they flubbed a little bit you had
your little Google home pod
oh yeah she's rising out of the displays
right in front of you right
in front of me yeah like a front row
seat to it I was heal it I was reaching
for seconds like I probably shouldn't
try to take it and just run we were
gonna give you one in like an hour
anyway
Wow yeah so that's why I agree about the
Niagara Falls of leaks comment yeah
definitely yeah I mean and they came out
they're like here they are now we're
gonna backtrack and talk about design
and bore you to tears I'm super in faith
I mean first of all do you think these
were deliberate leaks well I'm pretty
sure the Engadget wasn't even a leak it
was just sold to them not sold but it
was available for sure yeah why are we
saying we want to lock it down we want
more information I want everything to
leak early and I want them to just come
out and say fine for any guy watching
these press conferences it's not fun
I'll tell you that everyone is so stiff
I do not enjoy it I prefer just get a
press release with the name of the
product and some photos and the specs
that's why I drink I I mean they could
cut down the time they spend on this by
75% and just get to that I love that
they got to the products first and then
there's a lot of blah blah blah but LG
does that oneplus does well yeah way too
much information they let all capsule of
all bags I mean they're trying to hype
it up louder the thing and then you get
there and you're like wired
yep I don't even care dude this was the
issue with the LG event last week
everything was leaked not leaked they
were releasing the information
themselves hang time then they spent
half an hour talking to two mountain
climbers about dying every stop it don't
do any of that so you know that that's
the alternative if that's it's filling
space because I think every company
feels the need to have one of these grin
that's doing that thing they need to
fill time on those events right just
make better products I don't need a big
event yeah I want to change if I want to
show they hate the guys in the Dockers
reading off the teleprompter who clearly
don't do that a regular basis and the
overtime very awkward turtlenecks let's
bring out the token woman I was at an
Intel event on Monday and everyone on
stage they're also reading off their
teleprompters was dressed in like a
button-up shirt and a blazer and jeans
and I had to
I I said to Laurie who I was like I
really got to re-examine my fashion
choices here because I was rocking the
exact same thing I could have been on
stage yeah I dare you to sneak on stage
next time you see what happens
just have some car area or something
you'll be good guys let's talk about
frame rates let's not do that
Bryan what's her well there's a second
question was there yeah that was a
two-part question
it was the Niagara Falls of leaks it was
the second question
Oh Amazon will ship went up there what's
in it feels like a really weird omission
and when that Google could possibly it
could also be back on it could also be
just because distributions being set up
that they're starting with the US and
they'll go to other countries later
assuming people buy this I feel like
there could be a very lucrative border
store you know like a grassroots if you
want me and Polly sells the home hub
nothing else if you want the hub email
Jessica's ship went up to you for a
small processing fee it's all terribly
bad maple syrup you have to you have to
that's I can pay I only I only accept
Vermont maple syrup not Canadians and
Dan have I got all right more questions
we got about ten minutes left in the
show let's see how many ways these we
can slam through I'll and and coolly
related to Brian is the rumor about the
software true that you are forced to use
the gesture mode instead of the classic
three button Android well let's take a
look-see
I mean that's kind of what I did use I
have some issues with it I don't
remember seeing so that could be display
why don't you go ahead to the next
question and I'll do a little okay see
if I can get a better shot on that we
will also accept payment in I mean we
did just easy yesterday we haven't fully
tested or anything like that we're still
cause I didn't display but I wasn't
specifically looking for changing it can
I say while she's looking at that I
really like this you like the one is
that a nice little standing charger and
stand very simple well may yes very well
one issue
nevermind they don't like that hold down
imagine you're trained to carry this
with you on vacation again also what we
realized is that unless you're really
sliding it in right angle also man they
don't come with I mean the cable here
the cable cables here you got a rope in
the cable at the bottom right yeah
that's nice though if you if you break
that cable that's easy to replace with
like any Rando mmm-hmm yeah otherwise
thank you I like the design the design
is nice it's very clean and there's no
like branding mmm-hmm I say it just
needs a little lip on the bottom like
Jessica said to keep it from slipping it
does it does something I like that
better than the tabletop once you lay it
down flat this does have a bit of a lip
in it just a little more and a little
more more of a lip already print a
solution for that there we go Jessica
we'll send you that long update here
payment accepted in loonies so there's
no setting okay in display there's no
setting in accessibility and when I
search settings for navigation nothing
shows up so that's that's the research
I'm doing right now that's not plugged
in nevermind no okay why did my phone
charge
next question from Tammy and hiking er
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that
right so apologies if I'm not will saw
well some of these software updates
we're seeing becoming retro actively to
the pixel too and if not what new
software is still being developed for
the pixel 2 and earlier right um they
did mention one and I can't recall off
the top of my head but I think that it's
a fair assumption to say yes some of
them will be bad words compatible to
pixel and anything that they add to
Android 9pi or you know future versions
of it will also be backwards compatible
so Google never really stops developing
and yeah and some of those I think that
some of the photo tricks as well as a
call screening feature are coming to the
older musil's I think either next month
I'm like me what it was yeah yeah I know
call screen for sure because I had a
long conversation about that with Google
and they they assured me that was coming
to older pixels that's that's unique to
pixel I mean that's a killer app right
there it's for me
from Riley Sullivan do you have any info
on the new security chip I didn't see
any info on pixel through product page
the Titan M yeah the 10 M it's basically
a secure Enclave for your biometrics
personal information Finance iPhone has
something similar I think it's built
into the a12 Bionic chip but this they
Google says this is a first because it's
it's own separate chip this is what they
use in their servers to secure their
data centers and I guess this is a M is
the mobile version of this so Qualcomm's
8 snapdragon 845 tip that is in this
phone also has the same kind of secure
space so it's possible that Qualcomm and
Google worked it's probable that
Qualcomm and Google worked together
because that chip is in there right so
they may have kind of fine-tuned it
specifically for gusta maybe they have
two different places in the phone well
the observation the the t1 and the t2
they started out in phones and now
they're in MacBooks right so when you
have like the the fingerprint reader on
your macbook pro now that's all part of
that secure Enclave yes qe eggs asking
if the pixel will still fit in the stand
if it has a case it depends on the case
but still charged let's see yes yeah
fine
beside a pixel but it's a phone with the
big ass compatible so it would work
right and it would work got it that's
wait does it work this way can you do
all these things you can view it on that
side too perfect but nobody's gonna put
it on the stand like that I don't know a
little viewing angle there yeah why not
all right
next questions coming in from Joseph
Gauss what is the main difference
between the new third-generation
chromecast and the second-generation I'm
looking into the chromecast
what are your thoughts on it we have the
chromecast in in our offices we haven't
actually
and there's a gift box talk about all
our when we do we'll have David Katz
Meyer on a fan-favorite of cats Meyer to
talk about the chromecast damn it I
think it's matte instead of glossy first
of all or gloss you said it's matte one
of those two every bit maybe colorize a
little differently really case but it's
definitely 4k and HDR but I don't know
if the last generation was okay okay
yeah like oh yeah there's a chromecast
all right back on the phone let's talk
about the stereo speakers Clio or kilo
sorry kilo is asking about the stereo
speakers on the pixel three well there
there how do they sound can you put some
on right now I mean we're not gonna be
able to do it much justice because it's
just it's you know here coming down I
can tell your phone to both models have
speakers let's see how loud it gets at
least so we have tested so the Samsung
Galaxy S nine note 9 does have stereo
speakers and those are really loud
sometimes too loud sometimes you
compromise the richness and then the
razor phone and we're expecting to
possibly see the second generation of
that actually tonight that also has the
front firing speakers because that's a
phone aim for gamers so that's really
essential in gameplay if you're not
gonna have headphones so this is
something that phone makers are really
picking up are you doing with that first
thing I get it online if there any yes
that one no nor Wi-Fi either online
sorry I think you meant on like it's
it's signed in le it's not signed in but
it's it's past the setup page all right
in the meantime while we're trying to
get sound to play out of this a deep
Aditya Aditya
would you prefer the LGV forty over the
pixel three XL as both as they both
boast themselves as camera phones front
and center and they have fairly similar
price points okay I love that you asked
that because I just wrote about this
obviously we haven't reviewed the pixel
three yet so we can't make that kind of
final determination buying it
but I wrote a story called pixel three
XL versus iPhone 10's max no nine and
LGV 40 I have a complete spec breakdown
there I think if you're only buying it
for camera alone we know that the LG v
40 takes really good pictures and with
the three cameras there's this like
trick you might call it gimmick where
you can take one shot from each rear
camera simultaneously so we haven't been
able to test that but I think that
there's more to buying a phone than just
the cameras I think at this level every
photo like every expensive phone is
going to be able to produce really good
photos and I think you should think
about things like storage right you
should think about things like security
updates and how important it is to you
to be up-to-date with the latest
you know Android version a one thing
that I called out in this comparison is
the storage capacity because I have a
fascination with like which phone is
actually cheapest for storage
you know people store a lot of pictures
what are you going to do with them what
are you going to do with the video that
you take if you keep RAW files how
quickly is everything going to you know
build so you've got the pixel three
phones don't actually have expandable
storage capacity and that you have your
64 gigabyte version in your 128 gigabyte
version the LG v40 starts at 68 you
can't get higher than 68 so you have
your one option but you can expand your
64 so but you can expand your storage
capacity to 512 which is pretty much the
highest card that you can get right now
so actually if you look at total
possible storage the pixel 3xl or pixel
3 is 128 gigabytes of storage that's the
highest right capacity model that they
offer whereas the LGV 40 you can make up
the difference by buying a card and then
you have a total possible 576 gigabytes
of storage so you know yeah and those
photos and videos definitely add up the
LG when I tried to send a shot which is
this idea where it's still photo but
there's bits of motion and those files
are pretty large yeah so yeah that
storage
is pretty important so great question
but I think you should wait until we
have the full review and then of course
you know we love to do our camera and
deep dives they take a really long time
but I think they're really worth it if
you if the camera is the most important
thing and you want to get really
granular just some stereo speakers
alrights do it dad it wow they're
thinking they're so great dad geez man
what anyway we can at least say that
they are impressively loud yeah melody
wise we're not to be able to represent
eight or represent that here accurately
i like representing yeah in a review go
my god yeah and i think what's also
important as i said it's not just a
volume but it's also the richness
sometimes like music richness is
different than vocal richness as well
like if you're watching a movie yes
video i will say i'm not really a big
fan of having that speaker at the bottom
because it takes especially on the excel
cuz it takes away forever you're gonna
say you know got rock the the fullscreen
design is true but samsung has one and
is it the microphones and speakers down
there and I constantly somehow I get up
from the bottle oh and then too because
this is my song that's all the way up
we're gonna get sued by you I wrote this
for a Jew of logic the vs. story so I
can shut in the show notes take a look
