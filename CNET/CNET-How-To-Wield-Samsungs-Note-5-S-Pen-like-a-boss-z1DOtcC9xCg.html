features in its s-pen that is the smart
stylus that clicks into the bottom of
the phone I'm going to show you few of
my favorites the first one is called
off-screen memo it means that when your
screen is turned off you can still pull
out the stylus and write yourself a note
you do not have to turn on the phone to
do so so when you save the memo and you
open up s note your memo will be waiting
for you feature number two is the
redesigned air command wheel that's what
this thing is called and this basically
gives you all of the controls for your
s-pen so you click that open and you've
already got tools for action memo that's
like a little sticky note smart select
that's kind of like cropping and screen
writing so that's taking a screenshot
and writing all over it but you can add
three of your very own shortcuts you can
choose what they are so I'm going to go
for Chrome and Facebook and the gallery
app so the next time you open it up
you've got your three customized
favorites and the other three my third
tip has everything to do with the S note
app itself I'm going to show you how to
download an extension pack that is going
to give you a lot more tools to make s
note more powerful to work with you go
into the more menu and you select more
features and here you're able to
download an extension pack some charts a
different way to sketch out your ideas
and a widget so for the extension pack
for example you just go ahead and you
install that after it downloads and
installs you're gonna see this little
orange button here that gives you a lot
more ways to create notes including a
photo note adding voice recordings text
and an action
and then within an actual note itself
down at the very bottom of the screen
you're gonna see something called shape
recognition mode which means that you
can draw in a circle a triangle a square
and the Apple transform your chicken
scratches into actual recognizable
shapes which is very useful for
diagramming you've also got magnified
mode down here in the bottom which lets
you zoom in on an area and helps you get
really precise when you're drawing
something very fine the note 5 is
definitely one of the most powerful
phones you can buy for even more tips
