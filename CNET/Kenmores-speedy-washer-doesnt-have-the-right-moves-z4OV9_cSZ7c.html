know it's a brand exclusive to Sears
that relies on design templates from
other manufacturers to build its
appliances that means this $1,000
Kenmore washer is actually designed
after LG's wm3 575 CB a machine we
recently reviewed that fell short in
several areas
unfortunately Kenmore's model was
roughly the same the right side of its
display looks kind of cluttered the
Kenmore Connect troubleshooting feature
was even more confusing than LG's as
enabled version and it didn't remove
stains all that well not great news for
an appliance made expressly for that
purpose I did like that it had a 15
minute Express wash option but
ultimately it had fewer cleaning cycles
and it's LG counterparts making it a
little light in the features Department
it did perform slightly better than the
LG washer that inspired it but I still
wouldn't recommend it over most of the
other mid price front loaders we've
tested today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
