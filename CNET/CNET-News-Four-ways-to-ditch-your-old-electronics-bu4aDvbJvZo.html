and digital cameras do you have laying
around get rid of the dead weight and
put your old electronics to good use
here's how first recycle the broken
stuff so what do you do if you've got
something so broken and so old that
nobody else will take it well
electronics have a lot of toxic
chemicals in them so you never want to
just throw them away instead you want to
find a local e-waste recycling facility
in your area you want to take your
products there in the San Francisco area
for example we have green citizen green
citizen collects 2 million pounds of
e-waste every year people drop off
anything and everything technicians
refurbished some electronics to resell
on eBay but other items are stripped for
parts businesses also use green citizen
services ok so this is a hard drive that
one of green citizens business customers
once destroyed for safety reasons right
yeah so how are you gonna destroy us so
essentially the whole process takes
about 30 seconds it's not gonna take
that long I'm gonna turn on the machine
put it in
press that one button hmm down it goes
I'm gonna turn it off all right well
then that would be a damage here this is
pretty so it looks like there's this
whole chunk missing from the back I'll
dig quite puncture through it but
there's no way anybody's getting
information off of this use sites like
you sell by my Tronics and gazelle the
cell working gadgets
don't forget about eBay and Craigslist
too another thing you can do is sell
your electronics in person for example
smartphones tablets and mp3 players I'm
here at the ecoATM they're around in
malls across America and this is Ryan
cooter accused the director of marketing
for ecoATM can you walk me through this
process of selling your smartphone
tablet or mp3 player sure it's really
simple you bring your phone you place it
in the ecoATM the machine determines
what kind of phone you have and what
condition it's in for example this one's
got a cracked screen you got a cracked
up iPhone 4s here it determines what
about what condition the phone is in and
then it pays you cash on the spot for
that phone even old broken and
completely bed phones will get you at
least $1.00
we accept over 4000 different types of
devices naturally the newer smartphones
are going to be worth more than your
older flip phones but if we can
determine that it's a phone we'll take
it some retail stores like Best Buy for
example will let you trade in your
gently used electronics in exchange for
store credit or you can also just
recycle all the bits and pieces these
kiosks every Best Buy has a collection
bin for batteries bags cables and
remotes but you can even trade in your
video games for a little touching blue I
like to trade this in all right you'll
get more money of course for products
that are in better condition it's like
we got no water damage here so let's see
so for this fear foam with the condition
you looking to be a $150 best I get
partners great you can walk away with
cash if you have your original fest buy
receipt otherwise you'll be getting a
gift card you can also donate used
electronics to charity turn to
nonprofits like Hope phones and keep an
eye out for collection drives at your
local shelter or VA hospital for CNET
I'm Jessica Dahl course
