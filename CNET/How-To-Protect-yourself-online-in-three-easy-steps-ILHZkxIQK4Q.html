times but there are concrete steps you
can take to avoid the villains hi I'm
Seth Rosenblatt for Cena and today I've
got three quick and easy software tips
to keep you safe online first off get
yourself a security suite there is a
vast free or BitDefender total security
if you prefer to pay for one both of
them just one editors choice awards from
cnet there's actually though about a
dozen decent security suites out there
go with the one that you trust you'll
want a separate manager because they
give you more options such as always on
access mobile integration and secure
note-taking third make sure that you do
your mission-critical browsing such as
financial transactions in a separate
browser from your casual web surfing
this is so that exploits and other
nasties out there wind up having a
smaller chance of affecting you
personally i use firefox and chrome it
doesn't matter which two browsers you
use as long as you're comfortable with
them and like i said you keep your
important stuff separate from your
casual stuff also a very quick non
security-related browser tip if you're
using Firefox Chrome or opera you can
set up sync to make sure that your tabs
preferences bookmarks and other
important browser data doesn't get lost
in the case of a computer crash it's a
great way to make sure that crashes
don't affect your browsing ability
browse safe and remember to keep your
software updated for seen it I'm Seth
Rosenblatt
