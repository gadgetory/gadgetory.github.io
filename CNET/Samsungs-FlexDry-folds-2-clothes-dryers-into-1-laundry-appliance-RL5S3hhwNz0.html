laundry and one of the biggest pains is
having to dry different items at
different times the new Samsung flex dry
is built to make life a little easier at
least in that regard
this machine is essentially two dryers
in one a main drum sits down below and
handles regular dryer duties up top
those where things get interesting here
you'll find a smaller compartment
designed to dry delicate items which
can't be tumbled the Flex dry has Wi-Fi
connectivity too so you can monitor and
control both units from your phone and
as you'd expect there are plenty of
dryer cycles to choose from plus steam
and D wrinkle modes it's a solid
performer as well not the speediest
dryer we've tested but it's still a lot
faster than many you can't deny that for
a dryer the Samsung flex dry is unique
and innovative unfortunately priced at
$1,900 it's also very expensive between
its two compartments it has a total
capacity of 7.5 cubic feet that's less
than the eight or even nine cubic feet
some other large dryers offer you also
can't stack it on top or below another
unit to save space still if you have
lots of money to spend in a big laundry
room this is a very attractive and
capable option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
