examples for the headsets that you guys
have tried out what I want some
headphones that are like on the lower
end a little more affordable that would
be compatible compatible with a phone
like the iphone 7 or the Moto Z that
doesn't have a headphone jack but it's
still wireless and would be easily able
to connect to multiple devices David's
been testing a lotta well this one this
one I just got yesterday it's just
coming out now from from ifrogz it's a
sports headphone its water resistant has
a little magnet so you clip it onto your
shirt and it gets better a little bit
better it gets better battery life
because it you can put everything here
so gets about 10 hours of battery life
and then you you would either clip it
onto your shirt so hope my stay secure
that way i can t shirt and then you put
it you know you then you put it in your
ears and they fit pretty well they're
lightweight $35 you might seem pretty
good even a little bit cheaper um they
sell they sound pretty decent so i think
um there's going to be a ton of these
types of headphones hitting the market
you're talking about 25 $35 there's
already a bunch of Chinese wireless
headphones out there these are the
ifrogz summit it's a sports model they
also ifrogz has a bunch of other ones
they sell a lot of headphones in the you
know Walmart the drug stores you'll see
these cheap head they sell a lot of
cheap headphones in places you you know
not best buy not the apple store so
these are going to actually start
sounding okay and work pretty well for
very little money I think the advantage
of some of the other ones that David
brought to he brought the dash here by
braggy and that's version 1 they have a
second version coming out pretty soon
too but the advantage to get by not
buying the air buds is that a lot of
these third-party manufacturers have
wireless earbuds that also do more than
just listen to music these also have
fitness features built-in right yeah
there's n the higher end then these are
three hundred dollar yes yes for cheap
ones I give him some cheap ones but
they're these actually fit really well
and with the issue with Bragi there's a
German company when it first came out
the some of the features didn't work so
well they didn't they weren't staying
connected well and they roggies come out
with a series of software updates and
now they're good uh so and then they're
coming out with a less expensive model
just called the headphone they start on
Kickstarter yeah I mean they're there
this this took a while to come out and
if you know there were delays but it is
now a very good truly wireless headphone
the other one I've been playing around
with is this company called Erato and
they make these muds here I put the
wings on them they're also totally
wireless then these are totally wireless
and they fit they fit well and you're
the key again is they stay the wireless
connection between them is reliable they
stay connected they sound pretty good
and they'll stay in your ears and they
slip into this case and i haven't lost
yet i've been using for a couple weeks
and then you just jam it in and this is
also it these these come with their own
charging cases like the apple so there's
power inside of the case as well it has
a battery and it can charge it a few
controls you said to these a lot of
these headphones are only about three to
four hours of battery life but when you
put them in the case they start charging
they turn off automatically pull them
out these actually have a little control
on me on the bud themselves and then
there's that one of the original ones
also was these another company called
ear in I reminds you of the men in black
camera we're gonna flash it extrapolate
enca that so those are earbuds you pull
out yeah and this is a swedish company i
believe this does not have a microphone
in at the both of Bragi and the arado
have a microphone for making calls but
this one hasn't gotten as good reviews
but it definitely has a sleek design and
if it my ears and it's it's probably
going to come down in price a lot of
these because of the air pods you know
these were these are two 279 dollar
all our headphones but with the air pods
I would suspect they'll start having to
come down more towards $200 some of the
premium models but they're that the most
important thing is basically that they
stay connected to your phone and the
buds themselves staking it don't drop
out there with Bluetooth you Zoe you're
always going to get some dropouts the
brog ease use a new job we're coming out
use actually some a technology that is
found in hearing aids that communication
that doesn't they the actual connection
between the buds as a magnetic
connection is not via bluetooth so
there's some point we're trying to
figure out how Apple is doing its
connection to the iphone they made they
may be doubling up on the Bluetooth
connection for each but some of these
headphones are using actually hearing
aid technology to make them work do you
find the ones that come in cases they
fit well in our pockets i picked it up
says it's sort of like the size of a
lighter in a way a little thicker than
that yeah it def amin i was a little
worried it was gonna slide out if I was
in a cab or something like it out and I
dropped on the floor I'm grabbing it it
was definitely a little slippery roggies
pretty big i don't know if people yeah
this is that in your pocket all the time
yeah that's that's that's a you know
definite first gen product but i suspect
the their new model which i don't really
like the name the headphone way to
compare it to this other one and then
here is an iphone 6s plus that we happen
to have on set it's pretty pretty chunky
if you had these like lined up in your
pocket but they were coming in all
different shapes and sizes yeah i mean i
mean obviously the case also one would
assume would have a bigger battery and
if it's a little bit heavier so you know
I think you'll see it coming all all
shapes and sizes and just inform a
couple of heads up that you headsets you
tried out I actually wanted to show this
one off it's not wireless at all but
this is another way to
put really good quality sound from your
iphone 7 even though it doesn't have a
headphone jack obviously d
three-and-a-half millimeter to lightning
dongle comes in the box but if you want
to bypass the DAC inside the phone and
get really good quality sound out of
your iphone 7 you can buy this it's by a
company called audioquest it's called
the dragonfly it's about the size of a
USB key and when you pop off the cap
hear what you have to do is buy this
it's a hundred bucks but then if you
plug this into another adapter which is
the iphone camera adapter it's lightning
to USB plug this into there is that this
has a I think that was thirty bucks cod
bought it this week and it has a
headphone jack on the other side and
when you combine those you get a
slightly larger dongle than you know
what you would get with that but i think
the audio benefits are excellent you
convert it to 24 bit it's a saber DAC
inside of this thing it's really small
and compact so for the audio files out
there that still want to output really
good sound from your iphone 7 i think
this is the best solution there are
there are also smaller versions of that
a lightning cable with it a smaller DAC
in it so that that's a little bit clunky
dunno there's actually a lot smaller
than most of the headphone amps that you
have to bring around a lot of them no
but not the vid eyes and put its alien
bone and they come with a rubber band
that you have to attach the back of it
so if you're looking for a portable note
i would i would leave the room now and
get the 1i have them on my desk it's a
Kickstarter but it basically I think
it's called I amp but it's the amp is
built into the remote control yeah
notice the small it's a smaller I just
think when you start having you know
that's actually design to plug into your
laptop is right right it's sort of a
hack that me and ty put together for the
iphones so there was there will be other
deck and some companies are already have
lightning cables for their headphones
but i think that
we will see all kinds of accessories</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
