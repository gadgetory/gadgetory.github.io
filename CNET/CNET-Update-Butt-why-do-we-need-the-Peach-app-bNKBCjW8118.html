you more junk to scroll through I'm
Bridget Carey this is your Cena update
just as CES began to wind down a new
social app launched Friday getting
techies worked up it's called peach and
there are only two reasons that got so
much attention when it went live reason
number one it was created by the founder
of vine which is a collection of looping
video clips run by Twitter that's a hit
with all the youngins and reason number
two and the icon of the peach looks like
an erotic but the peach emoji has
transformed our digital communication to
represent a butt and this is a very
buddy looking peach so maybe you will
feel inclined to use this network to
post butt jokes or photos of butts or
you can also share doodles doodles of
butts if you so desire I figured that
this is the key to appealing to a
younger generation another perk of
peaches that is more private for just
sharing with people you know to follow
someone's feed you have to know their
user name or phone number but once your
network starts to grow its suggest
friends of friends you may want to add
this reminds me of path it was a network
that was just supposed to be for people
you know and it failed there are some
secrets to peach which is another
appealing feature for young people who
like to think they know more than
everyone else
to access some features you have to know
the key word type D to send a drawing
type H to show your location
J brings up gifts search W lets you
share your local weather you get the
idea I'm just disappointed that B
doesn't bring up more butts but let's
move along shall we I want to make sure
I give you a well-rounded news report if
you or someone you care about uses the
internet explorer browser
pay attention older versions of Internet
Explorer ie 8 9 and 10 are no longer
supported by Microsoft that means if
there's some security bug or other flaw
it's not gonna get patched so make sure
you're using IE 11 or Microsoft's edge
browser both have lowercase ease for
their logos so it can get confusing but
edge is a little more streamlined and
modern about 20% of all web traffic
comes from the out
explore browsers so there are plenty of
people that need to upgrade and don't
let tech keep you up at night if you're
a night reader there's a new feature
coming to iPhones that could help
according to Apple's developer site the
update for iOS 9.3 may include a setting
called night shift that changes the
display to show less blue light if
you're reading before bed
several studies show that the light from
our tablets and phones can make it hard
to go asleep it's because the blue light
from LED screens are slowing the
production of melatonin and that's the
hormone that tells our brains to go to
bed now that's it for this tech news
update and you can sleep easy by
catching up on all the latest news at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
