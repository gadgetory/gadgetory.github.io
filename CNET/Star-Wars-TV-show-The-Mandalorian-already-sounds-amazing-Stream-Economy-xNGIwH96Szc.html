dive into movies TV shows and games
obviously the biggest news of the week
it is officially official the
mandalorian has a full cast I'm really
excited to talk about this guys way back
in March of this year we learned jon
favreau would be executive producing the
show but we didn't know the title or the
timeline or the cast until the second
half of the year so let's break down
what we know and then have a little bit
of fun speculating here is what we know
we know the timeline this show is going
to take place in between the events of
return the Jedi and the force awakens so
it'll be right around the time where the
Empire fell but the first order hadn't
quite established itself which I would
imagine is it extremely tumultuous time
in the galaxy we also know the wear of
the Mandalorian at least kind of
Lucasfilm says that it'll be taking
place along the outer reaches of the
galaxy which we'll get to this in a
second but we got to talk about the cast
of this show because my friends it is
stacked Pedro Pascal is playing the
Mandalorian I assume because he is the
star of the show and he was fantastic as
the red Viper in Game of Thrones except
for that whole getting his head popped
like a grape thing no I can't watch that
again please don't make me watch that
again god I still think about it at
night also joining him is Gina Carano
who played angel dust in Deadpool and
looked totally badass doing it many got
this guy the one and only Carl Weathers
the og Apollo Creed and rocky and my
favorite chubs from happy gilmore on top
of that you've got award-winning actor
Nick Nolte coming on board
there's Emily swallow who's known for
her role as Amara on supernatural
they've got Omid up tahi who plays
Saleem in American Gods and also a role
that we're gonna have to talk about in
one second Giancarlo Esposito the man
himself Gus Frick and Frank from
Breaking Bad were my favorite villains
of all time and last but certainly not
least is German director Werner Herzog
wow this casting rumors
true that is so weird and so awesome
rounding all of that cast out is
executive producer Dave Filoni you'll be
working alongside Favreau if they're not
familiar with Fulani he's the mastermind
behind the Clone Wars and Star Wars
rebels and he'll be directing the first
episode of the show so who's playing
what and where might it all take place
well now we get to have a little bit of
fun and speculate so based on the first
hero image that Jon Favreau shared
earlier this year which is this and
lucasfilm's assertion that the show
would take place in the outer reaches of
the galaxy I have some ideas here is a
map of the entire Star Wars universe
it's a lot but the outer reaches of the
galaxy my friends already has a name
it's called the outer rim and guess what
system is in the outer rim Mandalore
right in this area
how convenient how convenient for all of
us now if they do decide as they have
said that they are following a lone
gunfighter it's possible we may not
actually need to visit Mandalore all
that often so what are some other seedy
locations in the Star Wars universe that
the show could take place let's take a
look at what is nearby Mandalore
so just north of Mandalore you've got
Dathomir and then north of that you've
got down to in and just a little bit
farther away you've got Korriban which
you might recall from a little game
called Knights of the Old Republic - now
those locations are all up in this area
but my money is going to be on this area
of the outer rim right here
better known as Hutt space what space is
probably experiencing a bit of a chaotic
time at this point when the Mandalorian
takes place particularly considering
Jabba the Hutt was recently choked
chained to death by Leia when this show
kicks off if I don't see Nar Shaddaa on
this show I will eat my hat friends I
had a hat to eat I would eat it oh and
remember that actor Omid obtained
remember how I said he had an
interesting role well he played a
character in the Clone Wars who was
being groomed for Mandalorian leadership
maybe he's playing a similar character
or the very same character all grown up
and speaking of characters all grown up
is it possible that either emily swallow
or
Gina Carano could be playing somebody
related to the famous Sabine Wren from
Star Wars rebels she was a super cool
Mandalorian warrior in that show so it's
not impossible that she might return as
a grownup I would not be surprised one
bit to see her make some kind of
appearance even via whispers in the show
and if Dave Filoni is the person in
charge of this or even co-managing it I
mean this guy loves to bring back
characters from previous Canon that he
created just take a look at thron
everyone's favorite blue cheese and
Commander Rex who popped up years after
the Clone Wars to help Kanan and the
crew fight in Star Wars rebels as for
Giancarlo Esposito I mean seeing this
guy is a villain I loved seeing him as a
villain so I'd love to see him as maybe
like an alien villain I think that'd be
really cool
Werner Herzog though I may be an old
sage like Mandalorian who's sort of
retired lives in the Outer Rim kind of a
shady dealings I don't know I don't know
what he's going to do I'm looking
forward to it so much whatever it is
though as for Nick Nolte and Carl
Weathers I mean I really don't know what
Nick Nolte's character could be but if I
had to guess it will involve some sort
of moral gray area and especially if
they're going to places like Nar Shaddaa
seems like a guy who'd be hanging around
there you know I'm saying as for Carl
Weathers I mean Carl Weathers just has
to be a good guy right peace Apollo
Creed this show is going to launch in
late 2019 so we have plenty of time to
speculate put out our fan theories I'm
dying to hear what you guys think about
the cast the location all the different
details like what's your perfect the
mandalorian I'm dying to know the only
thing that I am cranky about I will
admit is that I'm going to have to pay
for yet another freaking streaming
service when Disney Plus launches next
year um by the way hey Cyril aren't you
like some kind of Werner Herzog fan this
what do you think I can't even get my
daddy man even though that's another
Star Wars Hank been made for no goddamn
reason at all they make too many Star
Wars things look one wish
so always everyone except Star Wars last
year though which is the best Star Wars
movie is the Mandalorian is going to be
north it's gotta be good come on man
well not Hill Zog it's got heavy hit
stop everything I hate cover I just may
all that means gone crazy like no really
gone deeply is he gonna play like a
documentary and following the adventures
yeah
Jedi that tries to ingratiate himself in
our wiki clan and then gets eaten alive
by Ricky's I felt his old man
really yeah big man and Star Wars of
your life motto of it all that good
stuff I'm happy I love life
