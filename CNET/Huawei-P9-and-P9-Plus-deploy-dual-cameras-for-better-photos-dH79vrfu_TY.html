certainly think so we're taking a look
at its latest flagship the p9 let's
investigate let's talk a little bit
about those two cameras and what they
can do for you
so Huawei says that you'll get more
light by using two sensors 200% more
like the company says those cameras
themselves both have a 12 megapixel
sensor one is an RGB sensor while the
other handles monochrome what's really
interesting I think about using two
cameras is that it gives the phone a lot
more information about the distance
between you and the thing you're taking
photos of so why is that useful well it
lets you play around with things like
this wide aperture mode now what this
does is it figures out what's far away
and what's in the foreground and it has
a little bit of extra blur to the things
in the background which just gives your
photos that nice instagramming look I'd
quite a lot of fun with this I like that
you can change the focus points
afterwards and it's got some cool
filters as well for example this one
which makes everything that's in the
background of your photo black and white
apart from having fun with shallow depth
of field is fine have some weird selfie
features as well including this one
which lets you tailor all of the
enhancements that you like your selfies
to feature and then it'll apply those
defaults to every selfie you take you do
have to be careful though where you can
end up with slightly scary looking
photos like this one moving on from the
camera features this phone has the same
aluminium body as its predecessor it's
got a 5.2 inch display that's slightly
bigger with a 1080p resolution it
charges using USB type-c and it supports
a micro SD card up to 128 gigabytes
which should be plenty of space spin it
around and on the back there's a
fingerprint sensor underneath that
fingerprint sensor looking inside the
phone is an octa-core processor clocked
at 2.5 gigahertz backed up by three
gigabytes of RAM if you fancy something
a little bit bigger than Huawei has you
covered with the p9 plus now this phone
is essentially the same but it does have
a few key differences
it's bigger of course this is a 5.5 inch
display it's got a larger battery it's
got four gigabytes of RAM and while the
cameras are the same the front-facing
camera has autofocus both these phones
should be out very soon so stay tuned
for the full review
