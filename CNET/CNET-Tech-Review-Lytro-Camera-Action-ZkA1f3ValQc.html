the Samsung Galaxy Nexus is coming
sometime Motorola dust off the razor
brand how to make sure siri isn't being
too helpful and a new digital camera
unlike any you've seen before it's all
coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start things off with the
good the good news is that after a short
one week delay samsung and google have
announced the long-awaited Galaxy Nexus
it's the latest pure Android phone
featuring android 4.0 ice cream sandwich
the other good news it looks pretty good
here's a sneak peek courtesy of our
friends from cnet asia samsung is just
announced the galaxy nexus smartphone
together with google in hong kong this
new android smartphone is the first to
feature the latest Ice Cream Sandwich
operating system it's hardware features
include a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz
processor 1 gigabyte RAM and near-field
communications technology another
highlight is the huge 4.65 inch touch
screen with a resolution of 1280 by 720
pixels the new android 4.0 OS brought
many new features here you see a unified
menu screen that puts all your apps and
widgets in the same place the camera app
is now capable of panoramic images just
use the guy and the phone will stitch
the shots for you here's a demo of the
camera speed this is a big improvement
over previous Nexus phones and will
ensure you don't miss shots because of
shutter lag buttons are all software
based in Ice Cream Sandwich so there are
very few physical keys on the Galaxy
Nexus just power and volume controls on
the back is a 5 megapixel camera and a
textured back cover made with a material
Samsung calls hyper skin we still don't
know how much the Galaxy Nexus will cost
but we do know it will be available
before the end of the year me personally
I would have liked a firmer release date
some pricing info and maybe a pre-order
site but I guess you can't always get
what you want
the Nexus maybe the latest and greatest
in smartphones but there was a time when
the motorola razr was the hot phone to
half and although that was ages ago in
cell phone years some of you who still
prefer a flip phone might still be
carrying what but if the time has come
to upgrade the new droid razr may be
just what you're looking for hey
everyone I'm Banita senior editor at
cnet com and we're here in New York at a
very special event where they have
unveiled the motorola droid razr yes
that's right the razor is back but in a
smartphone form and as the previous
razors it's very very thin it's 7.1
millimeters thick so as you can see
really thin here but a very nice feeling
phone on back you've got a Kevlar fiber
backing so that's very nice and rugged
it's also water repellent inside and out
so if you happen to spill some coffee or
splash and water it should be all right
on friend here you've got a 4.3 inch
super amoled advanced q HD touchscreen
really really gorgeous very sharp and
bright and you know better than previous
Motorola phones which has just qhd
display so very exciting there on bottom
you've got the usual Android buttons the
menu home back and search on top you've
got it hdmi port as well as a micro USB
port and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on back there is an 8 megapixel camera
and it can do 1080p HD video so even
though this phone is very thin it's
still very feature packed and powerful
it's got a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz
processor as well as 4G LTE capabilities
software wise it's running android 2.3
point 5 gingerbread a couple of things
that Motorola added is moto cast so
you'll be able to stream content from
your pc to your phone such as videos and
music and photos it's also got an
application called Smart Actions which
will help you automatically do some
tasks or optimize battery life speaking
of battery life it has a 1780 milliamp
lithium-ion battery and they are saying
the grated top time is going to be 12.5
hours
so you know that was one of my concerns
about a phone this size is what would
happen to battery life but they're
saying is going to be around 12.5 so
we'll have to see once we get it in
whether that's true or not I'll admit
when I first heard the rumors of a droid
razr I wasn't sure what to think about
it but now that I've have it in hand and
have been able to play with it it's
really fast and gorgeous I'm really
excited about it and hopefully it'll
work out in performance testing and
everything else the motorola droid razr
will be available for pre-orders from
Verizon Wireless starting october twenty
seventh and the cost will be to 9999 so
it is a little bit pricey it'll be
available in stores in november but i
don't have a specific date also
available in november is the new Moto
active which they also announced today
it's a fitness and music device that
also has a heart rate monitor and can
hold about 4,000 songs and also can sync
with your phone like the droid razr
which has a pre-loaded on here so you
can check out your workouts and also
receive text messages and see incoming
calls I'm Banita and this has been your
first look at the motorola droid razr
for Verizon Wireless okay I admit I'm
the only person on earth who really
wanted this razor to be a flip phone
also but still I can't get over how thin
it is now to all of you iphone 4s users
out there take note Siri might be
cheating on you it turns out that Siri
can be used even if your phone is locked
with a passcode now whether you prefer
to call this a feature or a security
flaw is up to you but either way Sharon
Vaknin is here to show you how to shut
Siri down
hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet
and today we found a pretty bad security
flaw in serie on the iphone 4s if your
phone ever gets in the wrong hands
anyone can activate siri even if your
phone is locked with a passcode all you
have to do is long press the home button
and siri pops right up from there they
can do a number of things like send a
text ask for your friend's phone numbers
or find out what your address is Siri
will even display events on your
calendar check it out what's Chris
Parker's address kind of freaky right
it's only when you try to do something
like access an app that Siri asks for
your passcode give me directions to
Chris Parker's address Sharon I can't
get maps and directions while your
phones locked you will need to unlock it
first thankfully though there is a fix
for this head to settings general
passcode lock enter your passcode and
switch Siri to off where it says allow
access to Siri when locked with a
passcode now your phone is actually
protected of course by doing this you
lose the ability to quickly complete
tasks with Siri when your phone is
locked but the choice between security
and convenience is up to you for more
how to's and security tips visit how to
sina com and feel free to send me any
questions on twitter or my facebook page
for seen it I'm Sharon Vaknin and i'll
see you on the interwebs
granted voice commands have been
accessible from the lock screen for
years but since Siri can do so much more
she's exposing a lot more of your
information to tampering plus it would
have been nice if Apple had told us this
was turned on by default or better yet
if they had turned it off by default in
the past we've shown you how you can
create your own ringtones using iTunes
but with the introduction of text tones
in iOS 5 brian Tong figured it was worth
revisiting the process and who am I to
stand in his way Brian song here with
Cena calm and one of the new features in
iOS 5 allows you to use your custom
ringtones as custom text tones because
there's plenty of you that have reached
for your phone when it was someone else
who received the text message loser so
we're going to show you how to do it and
if you've seen our ringtones video the
process is almost exactly the same but
let's refresh your memory so first off
let's start in itunes and find a song
like this one that i want to turn into a
ringtone or text tone right click on the
song and select get info a window will
appear with track information and you
want to select the options tab and look
for the start time and stop time
settings click on the boxes next to
those settings for now now i know where
i want my custom tonus start so i'll
enter in a start time and a stop time
there's a 40 seconds max duration for
itunes custom tones and if you want to
use sound effects or sound bites from
your favorite movie just make sure you
have an audio file that's playable in
itunes once you've set the time press ok
then go to advanced on the main menu bar
and select create AAC version itunes
will create the shorter version of your
song below the original file you'll see
the duration time and you want to drag
and drop that version onto your desktop
to make a copy now there's a little
housekeeping we need to take care of
first if the option to create AAC
version is not available in iTunes go to
your preferences and in the general tab
find the section that says when you
insert a CD click on the import settings
and then select import using AAC encoder
the option should now appear in the menu
bar you also want to go back to the
original audio
file in itunes and then check off the
start and stop time so that it plays
normally from now on okay back to our
custom audio file on the desktop we're
going to change the extension name on
the file from m4a to m4r you'll be asked
to confirm the changes and we'll use em
for our now from Windows users you'll
need to go to your control panel then
choose appearance and personalization
select the folder options and in the
View tab make sure you've unchecked the
box to hide extensions for known file
types that will allow you to see and
change the file type okay we're almost
there but before you bring your ringtone
back into itunes you have to delete the
custom version that we initially created
and if you don't do this itunes will not
accept the ringtone so this is an
important and crucial step once you've
done that drag and drop the renamed m4r
file into the source column of itunes
and the word library should highlight it
will copy the file into itunes check out
the ringtone session and voila you have
a new ringtone plug in your phone into a
computer make sure you set it up to sync
the ringtones in the appropriate section
and your custom tones will be synced to
your phone now the final step is to take
your iOS device go into your settings
then sound and we already know about
ringtones so this time let's go to your
text tones and you'll be able to choose
your default sound of choice from the
ones you've created and if you want even
more customization you can go into your
contacts and set specific ringtones and
text tones for your friends I'm Brian
song with your how to percussion
learning jones and text tones for iOS 5
there's no reason for you to pay money
when you can do it this way hey
Chewbacca just texted me use it wisely
please I beg of you don't get too
carried away with your text tones we
just learned a few weeks ago that some
of you are texting over 40 times a day I
don't need to hear at katy perry song
every time you do and no Bieber or if
you would like to take a moment to set
your phone to vibrate I'll give you the
chance to do that during this break
we'll be back with more tech review
right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good the ultra
books are coming intel announced support
for this new category of ultra-thin
intel-powered laptops that would compete
with macbook airs and they are starting
to appear Lenovo's new ideapad is
possibly the best looking of the bunch
let's have a look i'm dan ackerman and
we are here taking a look at the lenovo
ideapad u310 othr one of the new laptops
in the sub category known as the
Ultrabook that's an Intel invented term
that refers to laptops that are very
thin very light still pretty powerful
good battery life kind of like a Windows
version of the macbook air you know
we've seen a couple of them that are the
same price of the macbook air some that
are significantly less expensive this
model right here comes in two different
configurations the one that matches up
with the entry-level macbook air has a
128 gig solid state hard drive a core i5
cpu from intel if you go with that set
up the window Vau you 300 s is actually
a hundred dollars cheaper than the
macbook air and you know what this is
probably one of the nicer looking
windows laptops we've ever seen so that
actually seems like a pretty good deal
especially if you think that this
includes things like an HDMI output USB
3.0 things are not going to get on the
macbook air this exact model sitting
right in front of us however is the more
expensive version this has a big 256 gig
SSD drive at a core i7 CPU very powerful
very enviable stuff that actually works
out to be 1599 the exact same as the
13-inch macbook air that has that bigger
hard drive and that faster cpu if
they're exactly the same price I don't
know I still might be tempted to go with
the macbook air just because that's such
a great all together system and the
design and the touchpad and the keyboard
everything works fantastically on that
now on this model much like we see with
a lot of other Lenovo's keyboard is x1
it's got a nice big touchpad the keys
have that lenovo ideapad thing we
they curve out just a tiny bit at the
bottom I find that helps with some of my
sloppy tightening I kind of catch the
bottom edge of the key we're normally on
a perfectly squared off key I'd miss it
one not that we've got is the 13 inch
screen native resolution is 1366 x 768
that's perfectly normal for a 13-inch
laptop but when you get up to this price
range it kind of want something a little
bit a little bit nicer maybe a 16 by 9
even the macbook air is a 1440 x 900
slight difference there because that's a
at 16 x 10 verses 16 x nine design of
this however is really great it's super
thin super light when you close it it
kind of looks almost like a book from
the side it's got the little lips kind
of stick out a tiny bit the body is
stamped from a single piece of aluminum
and as you can see there are no vents on
the bottom it actually uses some very
subtle vents here on the side and they
claim that the keyboard actually acts as
a venting system itself letting heat out
through the keys although we certainly
didn't suffer any hot finger while
typing on it this Ultrabook concept is
still unproven but if we see more
systems that cost the same we're
hopefully less than a macbook air and
that look and work as nicely as this one
I think there's a lot of legs there and
going into next year thereafter that
hopefully we'll see a lot more super
thin systems like that that will leave
them become the basic standard for
laptops of all sizes I'm Dan Akron and
that is the Lenovo IdeaPad u310 admit I
was skeptical of this fleet of MacBook
Air killers but it looks like Intel
could be on to something after all also
I like that burnt umber color but now
let's turn our attention to less
promising devices in the back
a fleet of MacBook Air killers might be
possible but the fleet of would-be iPad
killers is pretty much a sinking
proposition and none are sinking faster
than this fusion garage thing I love new
and innovative tech well at least I'm
supposed to love new an innovative tech
right we're all supposed to love new and
innovative things but the truth is we
only love new and innovative when it's
actually well-executed hi i'm eric
franklin and today we're taking a first
look at the fusion garage grid 10 tablet
the grid team has a unique UI but okay i
won't bury the lead it's not
well-executed first off there's no home
or back button virtual or otherwise
instead you have to use two finger
swipes for those commands swiping to the
left takes you back and swiping down
from the top takes you home now it
rather have actual or virtual buttons do
this well this way works fine too as
long as the tablets lay down on the
surface trying to swipe with two fingers
while holding the tablet makes for a
finger crampy and experience though also
the grid tens angular pointy corners
make it uncomfortable to hold and we
have the bruises and our palms to prove
it okay we don't have bruises but those
corners really do dig into the palms
this brings us to the way the grid 10
handles navigation to apps apps are
grouped into different clusters and the
clusters are by default expand it and
spread across the screen it seems to be
fusing garages solution for having to
flip through pages of apps like on a
typical tablet and works a lot like the
way folders do on an iPad luckily you
can edit the grid so that the clusters
are closer together making them easier
to find once they're all expanded
however it becomes difficult to find the
cluster and therefore the app you need
quickly there's a little mini map in the
corner to help but the fact that there's
a map to help you navigate the interface
leaves even more credence to the idea
that the interface needed more work
before release features wise the left
side of the tablet hosts a headphone
jack a 40 pin connector for power and
connecting to a PC a microSD card slot
and hole
for the speakers on the opposite edge
are more speaker holes a micro-sim slot
unusable in our Wi-Fi version and a
power button within white LED light the
front side includes a low-quality 1.2
megapixel camera performance wise
navigating and launching apps seems more
sluggish than Don other tablets also the
screen doesn't rotate to a line when in
an upside down horizontal position which
is kind of weird and the screen has a
low brightness and darkened severely
when view from the right side though
innovative the grid 10 is severely held
back by its user interface this overly
complex inefficient you I with is
ridiculously unnecessary two-finger
swipe navigation is clunky to use
perform sluggishly and feels unfinished
there's potential here but not enough to
warrant a recommendation once again i'm
eric franklin and this has been a first
look at the fusion garage grid 10 so
that's not shooting to the top of any
holiday lists sometimes multi-touch is
just a little too multi sorry guys
actually let's give them a break and
move right along to this week's bottom
line if the fusion garage grid 10 was
trying to be innovative the lytro camera
really is innovative I've been excited
about this light field camera since it
was announced back in June and I'm even
more excited now that light row has
shown off some working prototypes hey
guys Brian song here with Cena TV and we
have a first look at the Lytro camera
this is the first ever light field
camera now you see this design it's
really unique it's not a traditional
camera because this camera does not do
traditional things so when you talk
about your standard digital cameras you
know you focus on one one angle one
specific amount of light focus on a
piranha subject but here this captures
everything a light field sensor captures
all the light information in the picture
so what I'm going to do here is kind of
show you an example we're going to take
this camera right here now and we're
going to just go up really close the
beauty of this you do not need a focus I
know it doesn't sound like it could
happen but you don't need to focus on
the picture I just snap it instantly and
I have this dinosaur right here in the
floor
now some of the specs inside of this
camera it includes an 8x optical zoom
and f2 constant aperture really unheard
of in any kind of camera at this size
and what you can do once you have the
pictures in here is you'll plug it into
your computer your pc or your mac the
software that comes included allows you
to manipulate the picture so no matter
what I take right now after the fact
I'll be able to choose what I want to
focus on so I mean like I said really
crazy amazing stuff now if you look at
the form factor on here there's not too
many buttons there's really not many
buttons at all you have your standard
power button you also have your shutter
button it's an instant shutter and you
have here at the top of you kind of
slide back and forth you'll have a zoom
what also makes this product unique is
that this glass screen in the back this
is a touch screen that allows you to
interact with the pictures just like you
interact with it on your computer so you
can swipe left or right to see some of
the previous pictures you've taken and
then what's a beauty of this is in the
camera the software is all there which
enables you to pick a focal point and
then it focuses it on the camera just
some really amazing software again you
don't need a focus when you take your
picture so the big question is when are
these going to be available you can jump
on a light show comms website there's a
few models out there the graphite and
the aqua blue color they'll be going for
eight gigs at three hundred and ninety
nine dollars and then if you talk about
the red hot model that's going to be a
16 gig model for 499 but they'll be
starting to ship early sometime in 2012
but overall this is just some really
killer technology first time we've ever
seen it bringing it to you in your
living room i'm brian Tong christina TV
with the first look at the lytro camera
the bottom line this week now every side
is your good side it's not often that a
technology appears that's actually all
new exciting and pretty affordable as
for that lipstick case design hey if
that's what it takes to accommodate mega
ray optics I am fine with it I ordered
mine in blue alright that's going to do
it for this time but come back next week
for an all-new cnet tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at cnet TV com I'll
see you next time and
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
