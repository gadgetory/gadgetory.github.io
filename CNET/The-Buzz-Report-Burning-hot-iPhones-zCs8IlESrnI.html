report the show about the tech news that
everybody's talking about this week it's
the green damn delay a universal charger
and burning burden iPhones but first
it's the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the Sony Walkman which is
30 years old this week can you believe
that the seminal portable music player
the gadget that launched a personal
music revolution the icon of on-the-go
listening is 30 years old that is like
old I wonder if it thinks the music is
too loud now and now for the news this
comes as a surprise China
pushed back its deadline for PC makers
to pre install it's mandatory filtering
software called green damp now all
manufacturers were supposed to have the
software pre-installed on PCs sold in
China by July 1st but there were some
serious problems with the software
itself for example it apparently blocked
images of say Garfield and cooked pork
and Johnny Depp's face although let's
face it that is porn but there were also
of course all those international out
cries and internet pressure and then an
unprecedented joint letter from tech
businesses around the world to the
Chinese government the end result was
that China decided at the very last
second to delay the July 1st requirement
whew but the news came too late for Sony
which had already started selling
computers with the software installed in
fact it started a few days before the
deadline and hasn't really said whether
it plans to stop installing the software
hey so China you're getting Adele in
other news Europe will get a universal
mobile phone charger by 2010
lucky ducks 10 of the world's biggest
mobile phone makers have signed on to
deliver new handsets by next year and of
course the EU is hoping that the
initiative will spread worldwide after
that the phone makers on board include
Nokia Research In Motion Motorola Sony
Ericsson oh and you know who else Apple
yeah remember back in February when the
GSMA announced the universal charger
spec and Apple refused to sign on I
really think that it was the buzz
reports logical cogent and well reasoned
commentary that convinced them to change
their mind most phones around the world
will
use the universal charger by 2012 except
Apple phones Apple is not on board with
this because they hate the earth they
hate industry standards and they hate
you I mean what else am I supposed to
think you to Apple god yep you're
welcome in other Apple related news
reports are coming in that the new 3GS
iPhone might have a little bit of an
overheating problem one user posted a
photo of a white iphone 3gs that had
turned pink around the back reportedly
from high heat in fact a PC world
blogger said that her handset got so hot
from constant use that she couldn't even
put it up to her face this week Apple
issued a support document that warned
against leaving the iPhone in a hot car
or using it constantly in direct
sunlight or exposing it to extreme
temperatures and the document revealed
that the iPhone apparently has a
temperature warning that lets you know
if the device is overheating and needs a
little break now les do you think that
I'm gonna be totally snotty about this
let's all please try to remember that
the iPhone 600 megahertz processor used
to live in something like this and it
now lives in a gadget that is only
slightly larger than my hand I mean
computers get hot it's a thing cut him
some slack
seriously though it turns pink you think
that's true
cuz that's hilarious see that's why you
don't make a white phone it flushes OH
in ridiculous Twitter news of the week
co-founder Biz Stone responded to
Internet speculation with news that the
company is indeed applying for a
trademark on the word tweet a tweet as
you know is what you call the actual
message that someone Twitter's that is
if you can bring yourself to say it with
a straight face but apparently so many
Twitter related businesses are being
built with tweet in their names that
Twitter's concerned there might be
confusion over whose tweet belongs to
whom Wow
so first case on the docket 50 million
Canaries next stop Tweety Bird when will
it end
and finally let's have a look at what's
clogged in the tubes
obviously this week it was only one
thing Michael Jackson news of the king
of pops death absolutely destroyed the
Internet
it broke Google which thought that a
spike in news searches was actually some
sort of virus or botnet attack it broke
the LA Times it broke TMZ broke CBS news
it broke twitter at broke Wikipedia
broke a o L and of course it broke my
heart
the online frenzy also caused intranet
douchebags everywhere to start making up
fake stories about other celebrities who
had died this week in terrible ways
making the internet as usual the best
and worst possible source of information
to ever exist in the whole of human
history oh and sorry Iran guess we're
kind of over you now good luck with that
whole democracy thing and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood thank you for watching we'll
have to hear the Robin go tweet tweet
tweet
crack and Robin tweet tweet lady rock
and Robin tweet
wait that's not fair you're rolling and
I'm the only one on camera not cool
I can really go rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
