about to kick off I'm Bridget Carey this
is your cnet update
it's time once again for the annual
consumer electronics show of known as
CES held in Las Vegas this is where the
tech world unites to show off what's to
come in 2016 for the next few days seen
it's going to be covering every corner
of the show floor and here's what you
can expect companies are still putting
the finishing touches on their booths
right now but there's already some news
around televisions of course televisions
are always a highlight of the show
everyone goes gaga for screens they get
larger brighter and somehow even thinner
you may be familiar with ultra-high
definition also known as 4k but the
buzzword this year could be HDR that
stands for high dynamic range and here's
one way to explain it HDR on a TV
doesn't just mean more pixels but rather
think of it as better pixels you're
getting a broader range of contrast in
color and images seem to have more depth
we'll hear more about that in the days
to come LG announced it has LED LCD TVs
with a new name super ultra high
definition and calling it super makes
you feel it's even better than other 4k
and I'm sure there's going to be yet
another TV introduced in a day or two
there'll be somehow even more super
perhaps super duper and this year
Samsung has 4k TVs that can talk to a
smart home system so you can control the
front door locks and the thermostat from
your TV now aside from televisions the
smart home is going to be another big
star of the show I'm not talking about
smart locks or garage door openers it's
the large appliances that get most of
the attention at CES and speaking of
smart home LG's going to show off its
cylindrical speaker called the smart
Fink which can talk to some smart home
gadgets does it remind you of something
hello Alexa looks like LG's trying to
copy Amazon success with the echo but
this is just a small taste of what's to
come at the show this week there's also
going to be lots of smart car tech
Toyota tease that it has some sort of
new mapping technology that could
eliminate the need for Google's
dedicated gps vehicles that drive around
recording street maps and of course
there will be plenty of hype for virtual
reality and other contraptions to put on
your head if you already have your own
headset like a Google cardboard or
Samsung gear VR you can visit the show
yourself CNN is doing its own 360 degree
video tour of
yes that's happening thursday so that
your tech news update but we're just
getting started so stay tuned all week
long coming to you from the Las Vegas
