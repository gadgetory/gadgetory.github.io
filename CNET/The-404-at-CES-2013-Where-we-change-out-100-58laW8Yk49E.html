Brava come on you guys Alya wow you need
everybody to calm down please sit down
the audience is acting a little too
crazy right now how's everybody how's
everybody doing good good yeah okay okay
calm down uh we are the four oh four sho
we're based out of New York City my name
is Jeff Bakalar and I'm Justin you and
we're CNN's daily show about all things
tech and pop culture just didn't tell
these fine people where they can find us
every day well if you want to see the
links that we talk about every day on
the show you can go to the 404 cnet com
we're also on Facebook Instagram Twitter
we also have a myspace page still up
somewhere with a lot of that photo to us
you can go check those out as well yeah
um so stick around we're going to be
giving away free stuff you guys like
free stuff and was like no okay that's
good stick around on the second part of
our show today we're going to give away
free stuff and if you guys are on
Twitter that's how you're going to enter
the contest we're going to do it live
right here you watch a video it's going
to be a lot of fun and if it doesn't
work we're going to be really upset
it'll work it'll work we'll see all
right we got a few things to talk about
today yesterday we had Danny DeVito here
so just gonna let you guys know it's
tough to follow up a show when Danny
DeVito is not here today yeah but
nevertheless Justin you tell us what we
got going on to we've had a few days to
check out the show floor right you've
walked around a little bit a little bit
yeah well some of the cooler things that
I've seen our alternative displays I
think that's one thing that's really
trending at the show this year like
yesterday I walked up on to the south
hall right and I was greeted by Thomas
Edison very modern celebrity right I
know yeah um the ghost of Thomas Edison
is actually on the showroom floor right
now if you go to the I Triple E booth
you know that is right there like the
standards and practice organization I
think they uh they did 802 11 be ok it
did that so anyway they have a big
display up there with uh it's basically
a glorified humidifier it's really cool
it's a machine that spurts out water
vapor
we can see her and there's a projector
uh if we actually looking at a video of
it right here it spurts out a bunch of
water vapor and then there's a
projection in the back that shows the
video on top of the water vapor thanks
for walking into my shot guy but there
it is really cool pretty sure this was
pioneered first by the Pirates of the
Caribbean ride at Disneyland right have
you been there by oh yeah really cool
they do it at sporting events to like
when they're announcing everyone they
like bless someone's number and then
they run through it right out of like a
big piece of paper yeah for sure that's
pretty cool they were talking about
maybe putting this in people's homes
which I can't see really being a viable
thing just have bacteria floating into
the air but when would you ever need to
do that in your house yeah no I can't
see that being a practical application
ever so of course I had to take a
picture with it I think we actually have
a photo of me and Thomas Edison here we
put that up on the screen um it's me
picking Thomas Edison's knows I did know
that you do that unfortunately we don't
hug Thomas load of it having technical
difficulties that's okay anyway you
should go check it out it's at the I
Triple E booth that was something I was
really cool also Paul Sloan talked to oh
there it is there's me picking his nose
I really like that so guys didn't enjoy
but Paul Sloan also wrote a really cool
news article about a projection that
shows an image of a video on water so if
you want to show video in your sink in
your bathroom you can do that technology
we didn't know we needed but exists
anyway there's a lot of that here it's
the stuff that you didn't know you
needed yeah and you still don't but
nevertheless it's here um Justin keeps a
very positive mentality when it comes to
CES myself not so much i'm a pessimist
at heart and I made a made a few I made
a list of a few things that I don't
really need to see anymore at CS and I
want to know if you guys agree with me
because there's a lot of things here at
CS and I just think we can say goodbye
to forever yeah like I think I'd be okay
if I never saw another iphone 5 case for
the rest of my life a lot of cases on
the show I there seems to be an
abundance of iphone cases and I I only
have I don't have an iphone but everyone
i know with one only has one case right
you get is anyone have more than one
iphone 5 k you sir how many
you have you have to but that's not a
lot more than one so I still don't
understand the need to debut new iphone
5 cases all these months after it comes
out right I don't know if I never see
another helicopter with a drone flying
around I'm gonna be okay with that
what's the point of the drone is it just
a toy I don't know why don't people just
get a pair of binoculars and look over
the fence at their neighbor like
everyone like the rest of the very
normal creep you don't be a high degree
exactly and you can do it from the
counter you know you're comfortable
setting of your home living your roof
that's what I do okay just dress in all
black yeah I don't what are they forward
and how do they work and and do they
have something some sort of feature that
we need yeah right we had when we had
one of the parrot AR drones in the
office take it almost took someone's
head off but we used it once and that
was it and the battery life is like four
and a half minutes and then you have to
charge it overnight right so I don't
know how that works there's a lot of
Bluetooth speakers here do you are you
guys for a big like music fans no you
listen to music at all if you appreciate
music you probably don't respect the
sound that comes out of a bluetooth
speaker I'd right for the most part
doesn't sound too good yeah seems to be
a technology that doesn't give you the
fidelity right real audio files respect
there's a lot of them out there my
favorite was the one that was shaped
like a rock that just seems way too easy
to lose in your art yeah there's a rock
shape Bluetooth sure let's go look at
all these but finally and I'm sure every
last person in here will agree with me
if I hear somebody playing a song ever
again I will lose my mind and I'm
talking about the Gangnam style song yes
that's true talk about committing like
hip miss you aside there were many
robots on the CES floor that we're doing
the gunk the horse dance right that just
seems unnecessary can we bring up a
photo really quick by the way before the
show started we were kind of talking
about the rundown and what we're gonna
say and bring up and I Jeff made a list
of things he wanted to talk about what
we he just listed the iphone cases the
helicopters and finally there we don't
have to do this gun we should do this
and I want ariella bring this up on the
screen look at how Jeff wrote
Gangnam style he spelled it G you and ma
ND there's a silent d at the end Jeff
thought I don't know it's got gun damn
stuff yeah white people probably i bet
so I'm sorry that's racist I'm sorry
it's okay but uh I'm not very hip with
the weather even he himself is like I'm
done I'm never singing the song again
it's ruined my life it's over it's over
so I think we can all say goodbye to
this CES 2014 if there's iphone 5 cases
getting right back on the plane back to
New York noticing like an OPA seanut
style no we're not we're not going to
play that game today alright Justin what
else are we are we talking about today
another trend that I noticed was a
unbreakable tech just indestructible
tech that's meant for SWAT teams and
police officers but somehow I've landed
in the hands of civilians right right
have you noticed this all the ridiculous
demos they have of unbreakable screens I
saw someone chopping vegetables on a
tablet screen that had a screen
protector on it so if you want to do
that who's now available cuz it's just
like when I chop vegetables I keep my
phone right next right there I'm just
like let's really make this fun and
interesting they seem to think that
we're all klutzes right exactly we're
just hoping a bunch of Oracle's like
knocking things over and chopping on the
screens there's one of the Sony Xperia Z
cell phone you see the demo for that it
was someone in the shower for 30 minutes
using their cell phone pretty sure when
you're in the shower you should be doing
one first off who takes a 3-2 things but
one should be cleaning yourself the
other isn't typing on yourself yeah
that's just not something I ever find
myself in but right it's here and we
have to appreciate it for being here
yeah in we're from New York so a lot of
people when they drop their phones odds
are it's dropping on to cement concrete
so there are more broken iphone 5
screens in New York than probably any
other place in the world so I can I
appreciate you know trying to keep that
you know damage proof but that's not all
of us that's not all I guerilla screen
in a case is all you really need it you
don't have to exit you are you guys a
little uh frustrated with the amount of
protection anyone have like a disaster
story about I don't know
in your phone down a sewer grate your
dog getting to it anything like that you
ever had to replace your cell phone
right we don't seem like a klutz no I'm
a normal person I think a lot of people
and this is crazy a lot of people drop
phones into toilets right have you guys
in it they're not gonna admit it but
someone out there as they have now these
guys are out of it I just throw it in
there when I'm done yeah that's a that's
a problem for a lot of young people
right yeah absolutely we're trends all
right we're going to take a break when
we come back we have a very special
video to share with you guys it's our
debut of a video while we're in Las
Vegas we were lucky enough to get a
private tour of a club called insert
coins which is a very cool Club folk you
know directed right at me which is uh
playing video games and drinking alcohol
so that's directed to me right so
there's something for everybody here
we'll be right back stay tuned your
chance to win one of three very cool
prizes when we return on the 404 show
stick around we'll be right back
to the 404 show we're live in Las Vegas
at CES 2013 telling you before the break
we got a chance to check out a very cool
nightclub called insert coins the first
place I've ever seen that combines video
games with getting drunk but in a public
night club setting legally legally
that's all right so we shot a little
something with our producer Arielle
we're going to run that now before we do
this though you have to pay very close
attention to this video get on Twitter
what we're going to do is the owner of
this club his name is Chris laporte he
told us there's one game that's the most
popular at the bar okay so when we're at
there's a scene where at the bar the
video game that he says is the most
popular that's what you must tweet to
the 404 our twitter handle is at the 404
please use the hashtag hashtag 404 CES
do it right here live and then after the
video will get three people the first
three people to do that will win either
a shirt from insert coins which is a
copyright infringement waiting to happen
and um and the first cnet hoodie
available on the show floor this is some
pretty excellence up so you'll have your
choice first second third place arielle
pay attention to the video pay attention
please run it oh this is happening now
Oh your face is gonna get Oh fine oh my
god oh that sucks for you though it's
upside down us so we're here in downtown
Las Vegas CES is going on a couple miles
away but we came down here to insert
coins it's the world's first interactive
lounge you know we wanted to check out
something at CES that maybe interests us
on a more personal basis so we came here
where they let you play video games and
drink booze the greatest combination
possibly ever invented by human beings
so let's go in and check it out oh yeah
is that sound good some more of a you
interest not so much oh all right do you
play the video come inside
we're here with the owner Chris laporte
so Chris tell us exactly what the what
the focus was for this club you know
it's funny they say that when you want
to create something that works don't
worry about what people think they want
just do what you want so this is what I
always wanted as a gamer I wanted a
night club for me and there's so many
people like me who wants to play video
games in a social setting so to include
a bottle service night life style night
club but with to video game consoles and
a DJ and video game music intertwined
with all the muses that you know and
love from the 80's 90's to now that's
what insert coins is so we're here at
the bar at insert coins have a nice
array of games available for people we
start a tab at the bar that's how you
get access to a controller alright Chris
here can you tell us how this is all
connected I'm kind of curious get a
little console stack there what else is
going on so essentially we have here is
what we call our games on tap so we're
offering particular two player games at
the bar that everything is connected on
you know online to the Internet
everything is t1 connections and you
know on a weekend night very busy in
here it's chance for you to sit down and
challenge somebody to a video game as
long as you're drinking that's pretty
much the policy have a beer controller
what would you say you're most popular
games like is there one game that people
are always just waiting on mortal kombat
absolutely all that's franchise huge
street fighter fan i live in dial up a
mortal kombat I tell you have girls
standing on chairs yelling as they pick
Jade or milena yeah and just beat people
up
one of the things that we challenged our
DJ's to do is integrate video game music
into their sex you can sit here and hear
the coolest new tastes making music
you've never heard before music from the
80's and 90's hip hop rock and then all
of a sudden you hear you know a chumlee
rendition in the middle of it all or we
did a final fantasy eres remix that came
in about a week ago and people recognize
it and it's very cool to see people who
you won't Taylor as a gamer be like Oh
remember once if I put that sort through
that all right Jeff you know I feel
like you may have actually changed my
mind about this whole gaming experience
thing I knew after I let you win you
know the other games are no problem I
wanted us to play a cooperative game and
here we will arrived at that the
original uncanny x-men arcade machine
this is 21 years old by the way let's
all just take that in for a second and
realize how old that makes us but I knew
at the end of the day we would wind up
at the classic x-men cabinet here I'm
gonna be Nightcrawler who are you gonna
be I'm gonna be my man Oh Colossus all
right I think we're all set you just got
to get some quarters man oh you don't
have any money no I don't I don't carry
money with me so change out a hundred
they might if you had a hundred-dollar
bill you don't you have like singles all
right pretty cool that was those pretty
awesome right who get a round of
applause for the guys at insert coin for
Arielle helping us out with that if you
were born in I don't know the 70s the
80s the 90s whatever decade you're gonna
have something here for you it's really
nostalgic from the console games to the
arcade machines they had the simpsons
game there that I really love Tron all
that stuff it's amazing if you if you
get a table if you buy bottle service
they will give you your choice of pretty
much any console there ever was right I
think they I think in television oh
that's gone because they broke them all
right but every other
so is available there it's really really
cool so thanks again to those guys uh
they really dispel the myth that gamers
are just a bunch of losers sitting in
their parents basement maybe they have
short curly hair maybe they're wearing a
weirdly check shirt maybe they review
video games for Cena and have a mediocre
podcast it's not all the same type of
person gaming and that's what that's
cool about that place they don't cater
that one person what do you look at me
like I'm that's not funny at all is what
that is but uh but yeah we can't say
enough good stuff about them we have
some winners man yeah we have a that was
really really quick obviously the most
popular game at the bar was mortal
kombat somebody spilled mortal combat
with a see but which is blasphemous
color I need to show that pic of how you
spin a spell Gundam style again oh
you're right okay so we have three
winners the first was first off somebody
put Street Fighter 2 what is that that
was clearly not what he said Sharif
Jackson number one winner round of
applause for Sharif everybody come on up
so we like we say we have a hoodie or
one of the insert coin shirts you have a
choice the hoodie uh he's a smart man
all right there you go round of applause
for Sharif uh at free JP all right my
man second place winner what would you
like okay there you go and finally the
third place winner even though he
spelled combat with a see everybody roll
your eyes and when it comes up everyone
boo this man Kevin piece there is
brother's dead
oh that's all right do you know what
game this is based off of autocorrect
are fair hey all right not going to
fault you for that sir congratulations
Kevin peace all right very very cool I
think that's going to do it for us man
