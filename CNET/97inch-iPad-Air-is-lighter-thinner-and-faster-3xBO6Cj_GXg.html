right after the Apple iPad event and we
were expecting new iPads and sure enough
the large iPad has undergone a pretty
big redesign it's almost like an iPhone
5 style refinement it still has a nine
point seven inch screen but it's been
renamed the iPad air and it is thinner
and lighter than before it's one pound
feels nice in the hand it's thinner it's
kind of like a return to the field of
the iPad 2 had wear was surprisingly
thin and it's even more portable than
that inside it's got an a7 processor
similar to the iPhone 5s it's also got
an m7 motion coprocessor which is
interesting and it also has improved
FaceTime front-facing camera five
megapixel back camera and it's got that
Retina display like before
cost $4.99 for the Wi-Fi version 16
gigabytes and if you want to pay up to
get the LTE version at 6:29 so it's
interesting is that the LTE has been
improved in this one and there's also
improved Wi-Fi as well so both of those
antennas and have been read revamped in
this model it feels really nice but keep
in mind that if the new iPad Mini with
Retina display has similar features and
a similar resolution screens it's going
to be interesting to see which one
people pick this certainly feels like a
very light and fun better version of the
existing iPad that have been on the
market I'm Scott Stein and that's a look
at the iPad air coming out soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
