a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad flex 14 now
of course everybody knows Lenovo's yoga
line those are the laptops with the
screen bends back of all the way around
has become a flat tablet or you'll stop
anywhere in between those can be kind of
expensive they started about a thousand
dollars the flex line takes some of
those ideas but makes them less
expensive the main continue to the flex
a valve one a 14 or 15 inch side is that
the screen does bend back goes all the
way like this keeps going but then it
stops right around 300 degrees like this
so you have what I call kind of a kiosk
mode and you can use that day obviously
it's a touchscreen you can use that to
display let's say a PowerPoint to a
group or watch a video and you don't
have the keyboard and the touchpad in
front of you so it sort of like a small
monitor a touchscreen monitor you can
use and then when you're done you just
fold it down and the screen comes right
back here like this now the flex 14
starts at under six hundred dollars
that's a pretty good deal we have a core
i5 version here with the 128 gig SSD
I've seen the price for that very pretty
steeply between seven something about
999 you really get all over the place
with the pricing the flex 14 feels a
little plastic alittle budget so you're
going to want to look at the lower end
of the price scale for these maybe the
core i5 version with a regular hard
drive where they have a core i3 version
as well if I spend a thousand dollars or
more in one of these I want a more solid
body with more metal more more sort of a
high-end feel you still get the very
excellent lenovo keyboard design
although the keyboard flexes a little
bit under my fingers and great time span
of course the touchscreen is always very
responsive and it's interesting to have
a a flexible screen that's kind of like
a yoga and something that's a little bit
bigger those are 11 and 13 inch these
come in 14 and 15 inch sizes i'm dan
ackerman and that is the Lenovo IdeaPad
flex 14
