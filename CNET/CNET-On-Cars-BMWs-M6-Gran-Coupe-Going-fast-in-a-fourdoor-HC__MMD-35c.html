four-door luxury coupe on a racetrack
but what's up to it
this car needs lithium it's got at least
two personalities one as a quite
credible track car the other as a
four-door for four adults who are all
for comfort I don't think anybody but
BMW can pull this off let's drive the
2014 BMW m6 Gran Coupe and check the
tech on the track let's cut to the chase
the powertrain
BMW is 4.4 liter v8 with direct
injection and a pair of twin scroll
turbo turn a 7-speed dual-clutch
transmission out to the two rear wheels
via an active electronic differential
this is how the company earns its name
we're just about at the ragged edge of
all performance functions except I've
left a little bit of stability control
on to save my ass when I lose it
560 horsepower 502 foot-pounds of torque
notice it's rather oddly under torque
for a turbo v8 now as we noted earlier
the torque on this car is not crazy as a
result it absolutely loves to be opened
up and breathe and it just runs and runs
and runs appeal that there's no red line
you have the option of getting a
six-speed manual instead of this 7-speed
dual-clutch now that's interesting and
really a 4,400 pound car has no right to
hit 60 in about four seconds but this
one does here's where you pay the piper
in spite of brake force energy
regeneration and automatic start/stop
it's not enough to avoid a gas guzzler
tax mpg is 14:20 the best way to
describe this car's performance
especially its power delivery is
effortless
there's just no problem in there where
the car feels like it's got to breathe
harder it just bleeds easy all the time
that's what I come away from on this
engine the breathing is absolutely
unbelievable now short of the
ostentatious BMW x6m that coupe UV this
is the most outrageous of the em cars it
says you can have it all except excess
weight and here's how aluminum hood
aluminum doors plastic fenders plastic
trunk lid up here we've got a
carbon-fiber roof all of this saving a
lot of weight and saving it in the right
places oh I love this touch back here
look at that ferret in high
center-mounted stoplight and inside our
m6 Gran Coupe not a lot we haven't seen
before I'm still waiting for the new
version of I Drive that will have a
touchpad here on the controller and let
you move your finger around draw
characters and pinch-to-zoom
here's the home screen the key things
are the connected drive area where
you've got BMW online and an interesting
way to add little applications that are
sort of like mini apps more importantly
you've got built in Internet
connectivity and therefore online search
all of this is on a standard 10.2 inch
really wide beautifully done LCD display
German car still no touch it's all on
the iDrive controller but they got this
working really well now now this is
something new I've not seen this before
BMW online widgets it's like a sub set
of apps I've got one running right now
it's that weather app that I chose and
they are cloud-based now this is new
also when you're in a screen you also
see a shadow of the other screen that
you click over to this is a nice
improvement now off the infotainment
let's get to some of the drive control
really complex in M cars this one's no
different you've got screen based macros
for the M drive modes and then a whole
bunch of direct set buttons down here
let's walk through them - M Drive
buttons on the wheel so you've got the
choice of settings Stability control -
full-on barely on or completely off
here's your engine or throttle response
Sport Sport+ and efficient adaptive
suspension settings these are your three
levels of firmness aggression and road
reading steering is variable as well and
this is what I call the twitch control
tells you how twitchy how tight and fast
your shifts are going to be and finally
I love this they've got the most amazing
HUD in the M mode and you can have it
show either general information or you
can put it in the MU which puts this
really cool kind of a bandit
a commoner and shift light indicator
right in the glass and down here you've
got some physical buttons that go with a
lot of that here's my throttle response
suspension steering response there's my
twitch control so hardware software
however you want to get there but these
you can do on the fly not just as a
macro the shifters editing on these em
cars these days you've got reverse
neutral Drive that's it once you can
kick it back and forth to shift it
shifting can also be done via the
paddles on the wheel left is downshift
riders up shift unfortunately they're on
the wheel which I hate they should be on
the stalk for a car of this much Road
credibility over on the left here your
driver assistance technology enables for
lane departure and blind spot collision
prevention and these cars have efficient
dynamics which means among other things
he recaptures energy from braking to
regenerative lee charge the battery and
it's got the unfortunate inclusion of
auto start/stop which on this car is as
bad as it is on just about every other
car I hate it I turn it off standard
audio is stunning it's 16 speakers and
500 Watts more you can option up what we
have here the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen system
which you know because you got that
pop-up dispersion lens on top of the
dash it sounds incredibly good
I bet the basic system does as well much
of that cabin tech comes together in one
message on the track a big effortless
rocket that sheds weight with
acceleration delivers the classic joys
of rear-wheel drive throttle steering
but also a completely modern delight in
its dual clutch transmission so fast and
so quick you'll finally give up on any
egoistic pretense that you can ship
better than a machine in full twitch
mode the gear change actually seems to
happen faster than the
to addressed position they can't live
with this car on the track all the time
so how is it on the road well first
thing I notice is there's a certain
amount of driveline noise sort of I
guess I'd call it driveline whine that
is sort of intrusive around town and
such when you just want to chill and
just drive this thing there's this kind
of hard to pick up on our microphone
here but it's really annoying in regular
automatic mode it's also a good
well-behaved gearbox and reversing good
luck I can't back it up without lighting
them up okay let's build this guy now
it's the second most expensive of the M
cars so it's not going to come cheap
with destination and the gas guzzler tax
it's a hundred and seventeen and some
change and we haven't even gotten it
seen that style yet the intriguing
six-speed is a no-cost pick carbon
ceramic brakes are the big one ninety
two hundred bucks they may pay for
themselves because they can get up to
four times the light and they're
virtually dust free which I love
banging Olufsen audio probably overkill
but $3,700 night vision with pedestrian
detection 2600 more come on why not
the executive package is fifty five
hundred bucks and that brings you a lot
of sort of silly niceties but also that
great HUD automatic high beams and
amazing active seats and if you want the
driver assistance package with the lane
departure in the blind spot stuff that's
kind of a steep 1,900 bucks considering
it's not really active technology all in
or over a hundred and forty thousand
here now you know me I don't buy this
idea that folks who buy track capable
cars ever take them they're very rarely
if ever so I have to look pretty hard at
this car sibling the 650i grand coupe
which gives up very little in terms of
performance gives you the option of
all-wheel-drive which is important in a
lot of your regions as well as a more
comfortable ride when you want it and a
lower cost of ownership both upfront and
a little bit better fuel economy as well
plus with this guy you're taking on the
a little bit of m-car - leanness which
may or may not print for the person who
wants a luxurious four-door all in I do
love this car but with your money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
