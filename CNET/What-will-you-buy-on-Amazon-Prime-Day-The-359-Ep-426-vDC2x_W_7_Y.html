Alfred Inge okay so today is finally
prime day if you are an Amazon Prime
member and feel like spending even more
money with the e-commerce giant today is
your day as in past years Amazon is
using the big sales day to promote its
own devices and products offering
discounts on echo and fired devices plus
its growing list of clothing and home
decor brands Alfred are you excited
actually have a list going on of what I
want to buy and I'm not sharing it for
security purposes mm boy yeah like last
week I had all this stuff that like I
was going to buy and then because I
needed it sooner rather than later and I
just thought you know I can wait a week
for this like in case like hopefully not
toilet paper but yeah I get it you can
wait a week for all right so obviously
people are probably interested in some
of the deals so I want to run through a
couple of them so for instance the fire
TV stick with the Alexa voice remote is
going for twenty dollars the echo spot
going for a hundred dollars that's a $30
savings the new second generation echo
is for seventy dollars now granted if
you're not like if you don't want to
like pull the trigger on these specific
deals right now these same deals are
probably going to arrive in Black Friday
Cyber Monday as well so you're not in
the shopping movie yet honestly like I
never look at the Amazon products as a
real deal just because it's like they
control the prices on these and they can
go down to these prices at any time that
Amazon chooses to which it usually does
like sometimes it'll be a random weekend
wears like oh the Kindles like $40 off
today by the way yes
so like those aren't really did the
deals that I'm I would be excited about
like with prime date content right so
what kind of stuff are you excited about
um I mean it's all random like you can I
can never really tell when it's not
Amazon products like it's a given that
Amazon products are gonna be on sale but
you know last year I got a cat tree that
was like $90 retail and I got it for 48
it's like it's like the unexpected
things that like I know like won't be
this price again for a while I also
wanted to mention there are other
retailers jumping into the fray because
July tends to be a pretty quiet period
for retail so
Target Walmart and eBay are also
offering deals today so if you are
shopping around online definitely do
some using pricing Chavez on has
basically forced other companies into
like making deals on like prime day as
well yes yeah and there's a lot more
like traffic and interest going on so it
benefits them to a certain extent to
also Alfred you looked into how Facebook
Twitter and YouTube are working to kill
fake bot accounts on their networks tell
me a little bit more about this
especially like what Facebook is doing
yeah so this was a deep dive into
artificial intelligence that I was just
generally curious about on my own after
watching all these tech CEOs basically
talking about oh we have all these
problems that we're dealing with using
artificial intelligence and then that
was it there was bit and then it just
got me thinking you know what artificial
intelligent Israel called unmodified
where it uses biometrics by like
behavioral biometrics so like think
about how you tap your phone the angle
that you hold your phone at and like
where you touch your screen when you're
swiping around and think it could also
sense like breathing to like it senses
like the small small motions in the
gyroscope but it doesn't yeah it uses
your gyroscope so it's not like oh this
guy's breathing like it basically when
you hold your phone obviously you are
breathing so it moves up and down so
they use that as oh this is a human like
this isn't a bot because it's like it's
taking subtle movements like that and
using that to tell like this is a human
versus this is a bot so related to
behavioral biometrics how easy do you
think it would be for like fakers
counterfeiters what-have-you to actually
start to catch up and and provide you
know ways of I think you'd have to be
really sophisticated I mean like
obviously there's GPS spoofing where you
can like tell your phone you're in one
location when you're not really so I
don't think we're far off from like
gaming the accelerometer and gaming you
know the gyroscope but then like it's up
to these bot makers to figure out oh how
how human moves like they basically have
to do the job of these AI companies as
well like figuring out like the angle to
like game the device out and things like
that yeah the cat-and-mouse game
continues if you want to read more about
these
check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm Alfred Inge thanks for listening no
problems I'm out of practice
so yeah thanks everybody for joining us
as always time to jump into the chat and
pull out questions and comments reigning
question that's going to be overarching
throughout the rest of the show will be
what are you guys looking for on prime
day is there anything that's got you
excited do you think Amazon's gonna
finally step up their game and not make
it like a garage sale in the meantime
that would be an improvement if it were
a garage garage sales rule oh and
there's stupid cheap at garage sales
ouch look if you want a Roomba you
should probably buy one today they
usually sell a dumb amount of Roombas
today and they are very deeply
discounted so I've seen the Roomba deal
happen at least two years in a row they
also have TV deals but you know they
haven't specifically mentioned like what
brands are available so they're
mentioning for instance this was this
was info that was released overnight
premium brand 49 inch 4k Smart TV for
only four hundred and thirty-eight
dollars we're gonna find out later today
what that actually is so there are deals
out there if you're interested in Amazon
goes out of their way to say look
they're gonna be about a million deals
and you know you might think it's junk
but it's someone else's treasure and
that's why we're offering so many
different things I think if I were if I
were a competitor I would go the
complete opposite way of prime day and I
would make it like rich people day or
something like that where the prices are
actually jacked all the way up and then
to stunt on your friends and like show
them how much money you have you like
buy stuff that's at above the regular
price you can steal my idea if you want
Walmart
that's a pretty that's a pretty good
idea what do you think of that one Brian
yeah there wasn't that was like that and
like Apple took it off the App Store it
was like a thousand dollars or something
and it did nothing for a red ruby yeah I
remember nothing but yeah
like you buy it to like show off like oh
this is how much I spent on like apps
today I think that app actually got
kicked off because it had so little
value
but either way to answer your question
Brian I am interested in getting a new
TV so I'm gonna look around for that but
it's it's sometimes the brands aren't
exactly what you're looking for on prime
day because they are a little bit more
of the bargain side so definitely do
your homework before buying stuff I
would say it's probably ever done or
prime - ever done games in the past cuz
I would love it yes it's like build out
my there was a deal going on today for I
think it was only bundles with the
Nintendo switch though like you could
get it with Mario Tennis or another game
who then I think it was Super Mario to
see but the name is escaping me
currently yeah there's current they they
like teased out some information without
like the full deal so there is a
Nintendo switch gaming bundle for $300
that's going to be available yeah the
the problem is and I understand people's
it kind of like displeasure about it is
is that some of the super popular stuff
the really interesting stuff sometimes
just doesn't get discounted you know
like premium brands or the most popular
games the reason for that is is that
those companies realize that you're
gonna pay top dollar for that stuff
anyway they're they're the most high in
demand so they don't they don't
necessarily need to discount it and you
might end up buying it today anyway just
because you're shopping online let's
take some questions actually we have a
few people chiming in with their look
for deals
Pamela's looking for a good surround
sound system I say your likelihood is
pretty good on that today priority one
is looking for ram rafael wants to know
why does Amazon do prime de ok in the
warehouse that one I have yeah I can
clear out the warehouse idea is
definitely one that I've heard a lot of
and there's probably a little bit
definitely to that the other reason is
is that July tends to be a really quiet
month in the summer in general tends to
be a pretty quiet month people go on
vacation they're saving up money for the
holiday there's no reason to buy gifts
during July right yeah and and Amazon
manages to get people to shop more
like providing more like home essential
stuff it's not as much like yeah you'll
see the TVs and electronics but they
also offer discounts on just like giant
tubs of petroleum jelly and like other
just random stuff too like restock your
your pants that is very much a home
essential so so that's the primary
reason why why they do it and it's been
really successful for them they broke
their single day sales record two years
running on prime day which is pretty
surprising it's it's impressive to the
fact that you have to be a prime member
to shop on prime day to begin with so it
is a limited set of people it's not
offered to every budget you have to take
the sales numbers with like a grain of
salt though because Amazon usually
doesn't disclose their sales numbers
like regularly yeah absolutely and also
Amazon is growing really quickly so they
tend to repeatedly break their single
day sales record so it always sounds
really great that like oh we broke the
record again but the other the other
thing too is that Prime Day this year is
36 hours so I expect them to say that
they broke their single day sales record
but Prime Day this year is not a sing so
if they don't break the record that
would be really weird but it will be
with an asterisk this year sir and joy
says ring video doorbell Pro is down to
175 Boyce convinced me I'm not gonna do
that I don't think you should get a
smart doorbell or home system I've
spoken with the CEO ring a couple times
and he his big pitch is that this is
something that actually can reduce crime
in a neighborhood and the more okay
alfred is very aggressively rolling his
eyes but anyway that is their their
pitch where they think that video
doorbells and and they did do a pilot
program to try to prove this they think
the video doorbells are a very useful
security measure and if you are hesitant
or uncomfortable about the idea of
security cameras in your home in this
case it's a security camera that's
pointing outside your door so it's a
little bit easier for people to deal
with anyway that's that's rings pitch if
you are interested the thing is is that
it's a video doorbell
it's so it's expensive and you know if
you've got 170 dollars burning a hole in
your pocket sure but I think a lot of
people probably don't have that kind of
money to spend on an on a doorbell yeah
get a dog they're cooler and they can't
be hacked nice well unless you have
sausages dogs rule
what about the Sony AIBO I don't know is
that what it's called
what the hell is that that's the Sony
dog you can you can hack that dog I
suppose so yeah zero out of ten yeah
apex looking for a router Dodgers
looking for a router as well so at this
point I'm gonna plug our own website
there like the the reviews and like
Cheapskate team put together like a ton
of content to try to like round out all
the different deals so if you do want to
go on SEANET and like they've just tried
to like consolidate all this information
so if you are looking for things
specifically this is my shameless plug
and I just I just did that well that's
good because Screwtape is looking for
good speakers it looks like we've got
some headphones and wireless bluetooth
speakers listed up here yet if you're
looking for home stereo I'm not sure
where those might be hidden in the list
cuz it is a massive list and probably
ever-growing but we'll do our best and
I'll make sure to put the these links in
the in the description down below in the
show notes so everybody can find where
they're going is it cnet.com it might be
cnet.com edu no no no not see that I you
know now I'm curious so I'm gonna check
what seat we're seeing a dot edu takes
you here's a fun question from bombs a
bomb if you bought something before
prime day and after you bought it it
gets discontinued would be you sir
discounted sorry would you still be able
to get that discount I don't think so I
don't think so but there is if you got
it within like I think it's a 30 or 60
day window this is probably frowned upon
but what you could do is just buy it
again on prime day and then return the
old one so you probably need a little
bit of extra money because like let's
say you bought it for $300 the first
time in $200 the second time you have to
wait for the
the return to go through but people that
I know have have done that in the past
is that a people that I know is that
just you and you're like my friend did
my friend my friend has done this before
but anyway if it does seem like a really
good deal you can try to call customer
service and get the discount but if they
don't do that that is a method that has
been used by people okay here's another
fun one coming in from Priority One hey
guys if you had $100 what would you buy
on Prime whoo that's a good question
well they don't have $100 no no I don't
even have a hundred dollars in my bank
account right now hundred dollars a year
I mean are we talking about like
specifically prime day stuff or like
just Amazon in general let's stick it to
prime day let's stay on theme man I wish
I had a good answer to that I've got to
spend like a thousand dollars replacing
my water heater that is so not
interesting that's like a real homeowner
pilot crap right don't do that on prime
day I'm not doing a big random buying I
insist I mean I'm buying it from Lowe's
so Lowe's day looks love day get your
water heater with a free pamphlet I'd
probably spend it on Amazon like gift
card like a hundred dollar gift card and
probably give it away to a good friend
of mine because I'm very wholesome and
cool give me a break
that's horrible I'm sorry mr. selfish
man okay once together the water heater
for himself all right and altruistic I
will give to the world okay I have to
think I have to think about what I
actually I guess if I had a hundred
bucks like I would probably get a bunch
of toys for my kids even though they
have a bunch of toys already so whatever
that's Bigley altruist
I probably spend it on a prime
membership for a year yeah that's not a
bad idea to be honest here's a question
from APEC do you find that the more you
look at an item on Amazon the more the
price seems to go up also does Prime day
prices increase right before the
discount is applied he's wondering if
they're playing games with us and like
if that
really real so people have definitely
had skepticism about that and some of
the prime day deals in years past have
been like really really tiny where it
was like a dollar or five dollars
especially on like more expensive items
I think Amazon's trying to do a little
bit better to not have those
embarrassing like this isn't really a
deal type of situation what the question
or what is it like did do they jack up
the prices before so that like when it's
a 50% discount like cuz you're not
supposed to do that they're supposed to
like and I definitely know like
specifically like I know what the
regular prices for the Amazon devices so
the Amazon devices are discounted from
what you would regularly have them on an
any given day but what was either way
they do something called dynamic pricing
where they will constantly change the
price identifying a variety of different
things that they that they notice online
including what other retailers are
pricing a certain item at how much
traffic that specific page is getting so
if you are seeing items go up usually
they're supposed to fluctuate they're
not supposed to just go up but they're
always trying to like test out exactly
how much to charge people so it's what
you can do is also go on camel camel
camel calm to see the historical price
changes so you can get a better idea as
to whether the price is a good one or
not because the price does tend to
change quite a bit on Amazon just about
out of time so maybe we switch gears
real quick before I call it a day
Matthieu Dodgers asking how does a group
feel about Elon Musk's recent incendiary
comments great question
going on to say what should we do when
CEOs of companies we want to like are
problematic yeah we were talking about
this before the podcast and it was
definitely a surprising comment and we
were wondering if it even fits under
libel where the this guy could sue so
let's reiterate for those who may be and
not in the know like myself what did it
do alright I have been relishing this
story so if you missed out on Sunday
there was a video from CNN where they
had interviewed one of the British
divers in Thailand who had discovered
that the boys were that the kids were
stuck yeah and you know he was the one
who had alerted you know the the British
Navy and and like helped of the Thai
government on like how to get there how
to rescue the kids who were saved about
five days ago now if you recall Elon
Musk a the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and
other companies also wanted to pitch in
and help and he did so by sending a
submarine that was never used and in
this video the British diver talks about
how that submarine was completely
useless and how mr. musk you know going
there and dropping off the submarine
that was never used was essentially a PR
stunt he specifically said that so Ellen
must responds on Twitter
basically in a fit of rage arguing you
know you know what that Cape that that
submarine would have worked okay and
then at one point he says sorry pedo guy
you really asked for this specifically
about the British divers yes essentially
insinuating that the British diver was a
pedophile prior to that tweet and
calling the guy a pedophile though he
also had written I have never seen this
British diver who happens to be living
in Thailand and then in parenthesis he
writes us which isn't suspicious
he says that's about a lot of things
yeah so he basically called this man a
pedophile without any backup or claim
and then he deleted the tweet he deleted
it yeah he deleted all those to my video
those were up for a couple hours
yeah they were I thought he was gonna
leave them up but you know I guess
better judgment got to him but the idea
is you know this is a tech CEO and
billionaire with a lot of influence and
power calling a guy pedophile
because he said that his submarine was
useless which is a fact how was that
even related though it does musk have a
history of these kind of like off the
cuff yeah it's a rage does he oh
absolutely
he does it he does it against reporters
for stories that he doesn't like he
tends to be very fast and loose on
Twitter so and I think doctor was asking
about what you should do about texting
yeah yeah like we should do about it and
you know what boycott gets thrown around
look the argument is is that does it
matter what Elon Musk does on his free
time you know complaining about people
on Twitter if you like having a Tesla
car and it's like is it is it valuable
to you to just have that and kind of
disassociated from the CEO that's that's
an interesting philosophical argument
I'm not really sure and I think
especially with this last situation he
is not making it super easy for people
that may be on the fence to like him the
people that do like him were already
defending him right here's the thing I
think it's very easy to idolize somebody
like him and I think that you know he
does have a lot of his fans my argument
for anything has always been like you
shouldn't idolize anybody or anything
just because like they're human and they
have flaws and they have mistakes and to
stand by somebody for so long after like
you know being problematic like this I'm
sure you have your reasons but like my
flaw like I it's like I think it's
problematic to always like put somebody
on a pedestal like that I was like oh
well he's he called him a pedophile
because you know he did this this and
this and it's just like people like he's
clearly wrong for it and you know that I
don't know how that affects your view of
him but at the same time I think that
you know there really shouldn't be this
sort of like worship of like any tech
CEO for that matter it doesn't decide
anybody yeah it doesn't matter like how
smart or like talented somebody is like
well and unfortunately we in the media I
have a lot to do with really building
altering bolstering and you know doing
that deification and hero worship I mean
we saw that with their thoroughness as
CEO
who ended up being a complete fraud so
but either way that was definitely glad
you mentioned that Dasher and it was
something that we were certainly
considering mentioning on the shows I'm
glad you talked about it what we did we
did talk about it so you know and and
it's definitely an interesting
conversation I think will absolutely
continue and there's a possibility that
there could be a lawsuit stemming from
this and so we'll we'll keep an eye on
it that's disappointing you want to like
somebody like that like like you said
the whole worship thing is going a
little far but in my casual observation
it's just like oh he's a lucky guy
he likes science he promotes education
etc etc I'm on board and then you find
out he's a rage monster and a complete
dick bag so let's see that's your
problem you wanted to like somebody you
should never want to like anybody that's
a good philosophy to live by Alfred yeah
I learn a lot from you it's uh it's
gonna take me at least a few more years
to become that Center having friends is
overrated mm-hmm yeah yeah if you've
learned anything about the 359 that's
that's the big take off enemies now
that's where the real that's where the
rubber meets the road okay right before
we take off let's take one more question
about prime day maybe not so much prime
day but just Amazon shopping in general
this is a good question from Hector
Sanchez does anyone know if you can use
your prime account for different
countries I have mine in Mexico you
don't want to get onboard the Amazon US
storefront I don't know that's a good
question and I'm not entirely sure
so let's research that that might be a
good topic to come back to some days how
Amazon functions internationally and how
it affects consumers in different
countries yeah it does tend to it
depends on different countries and
Amazon does tend to roll out its
services in different countries in
different ways like for instance I know
like Canadian shoppers had to shop
through the u.s. website for a while
until like the Canadian website was a
little bit stronger so when did that
really mean just a pain in the butt with
conversions hq2 is coming to Toronto
yeah that's that's basically a no I
think like
and I don't know enough about this to
really talk too much about it but I
think it's it's you would have to get a
lot of things shipped to you just over
the border and then pick them up so if
you loose yeah it was a little strange
but now you don't have to do that as
much because they expanded out their
Canadian operations and their
fulfillment so so it sounds like in
large that's probably the way it's gonna
apply in any situation in any nation
that's not the u.s. store yeah the best
is I can remember usually like the
inventory is specific to your country
and if it isn't then you might have to
pay more for International shipping
that's my best guess at this point but I
do apologize that I don't know that
information offhand you know a lot of
information been will forgive you will
find out more though for sure that's a
great question we'll have to look into
that but on that note we are out of time
it's been back fantastic to be back
regular schedule resumes we'll be back
tomorrow you guys got any closing
thoughts yeah what does that post it on
your laptop say oh it's uh it's a list
of equipment that I need to purchase for
the studio it's not all that interests
were like primed a are you buying that
I'm not it's not even exciting stuff
it's like hardware and cabling so
otherwise I'd share yeah all right cool
why don't you do it I always end up
doing it alright sure if you liked what
you heard today check us out on cnn.com
the podcast is also available on tuning
