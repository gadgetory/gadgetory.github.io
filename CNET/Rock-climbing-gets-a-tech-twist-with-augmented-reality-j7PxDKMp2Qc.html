escape from reality you're not going to
break a sweat as Nathan Drake rock
climbing and uncharted but with
augmented reality climbing is pretty
difficult even on easy mode the game is
set up using a laptop with a webcam and
a projector its projected onto the
rock-climbing wall with five checkpoints
spread across the webcam syncs up with
the game's user interface and registers
each time it's tapped on the climb the
game was created in Brooklyn Boulder
Somerville location in 2015 by randori
climbing the most popular game mode is
time trial where you're racing up the
walls to see who can finish the course
the fastest climbers use every trick in
the bag including swinging their legs to
tap on the checkpoints to get the
quickest times possible some people are
really good at the game
while others are not
well that didn't go very well the good
news about a are climbing though is that
they can move them around and make it
super easy so let's see how it plays out
on easy mode thanks to the magic of
augmented reality I went from chump to
champion finishing the force in 5.5
seconds but even after all that I was
still worn out for the day since its
creation randori climbing has been used
in gyms in New Zealand Japan and France</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
