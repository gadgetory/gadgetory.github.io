a huge role in making Acura the comedy
you think of for high value luxury tech
so let's see about the 2012 TL super
handling all-wheel drive and check that
10 when the fourth-generation TL came
out as a 2009 a lot of folks gasp what's
on the front of that thing a beak a
breastplate a huge bottle opener such
questions aren't cool when a ride has to
account for half of Acuras car sales
thus we have this Rhino plastic redo
let's see what else got worked on
smoother less aggressive less ugly they
had a lot of friction in the showroom
from consumers who came in and said I
like the car but Wow kind of a harsh
look now it definitely says sedan with a
coupe like roofline and notice on the
back light it remains indented a bit or
recessed so they maintain those very
slight sail panels on the inside of the
back light kind of a key feature on the
TL that looks really good from a rear
three-quarter view now inside the TL has
not changed dramatically you've still
got these two kind of scooped eyebrows
this is Honda / Acuras newer head unit
thankfully you can tell by the really
smooth map graphics the basic menu has
not changed dramatically though you've
got this idea of rotating among these
menu items around a sort of a
rectangular circular pattern and again
the system is largely oriented toward
navigation but you do have a home button
here to take you to audio we'll get to
that in a moment
entering a destination is simple enough
you can either punch in the address here
big clear indications there's no
touchscreen of course it's all through
the Acura controller you can also use
voice command which is pretty good
typically on these cars now speaking of
voice command you can also do something
else in this car that's kind of new that
is the idea of calling out a piece of
music an album name a track name
whatever it is whether it's on the hard
drive or your iPod or on a USB Drive on
that same pigtail on the console play
laugh out loud so
laughs out loud it's certainly better
than rotating through playlists which no
matter how the carmaker implements that
it's never really slick like it is on
your iPod your other sources on this guy
are AM and FM of course but no HD radio
Acura's not doing that XM is your
satellite flavor you've also got weather
and traffic on this guy through Acura
link your disc player is this single
slot optical up here you have a hard
drive on this car as well you can rip -
you can tell because you have hard drive
and aux on that button right there and
you've also got bluetooth streaming
audio though I was never able to get it
work with my droid and there's a lot of
complaints about that out there on the
board so this is one of those where you
do want to go to the whatever Acura comm
/ Bluetooth phones that won't piss you
off / whatever to find out if your phone
actually works here now because we're
the tech package in this car we've got
the Els audio system that will take DVDs
but only DVD audio yeah because you got
a lot of those like you even know what
it is you do have Dolby PL - that's
Dolby's a really good quality synthetic
surround sound from digital sources it
won't work with a.m. or FM broadcast for
example but it will work with anything
digital you pump in here it can create
some pretty good synthetic surround as I
mentioned the USB pigtails down here for
iPod as well as for USB drives you've
also got a good old standard aux that'll
work with anything the 60 gig hard drive
spares out 15 gigabytes of space for
your music but with an increasing rush
to the cloud like Pandora or Amazon
Cloud Player on your phone this sort of
tech is starting to lose its shine
before it was even mainstream most of us
don't need or want another hard drive to
fiddle with the tech package also brings
us this guy which is our rear view
camera if you've got your distance
markers but you've got no trajectory
showing up there you can also get that
all a card if you want same thing goes
for backup parking sensors those are all
acardo
now what's unusual about the TL line is
it depending on the drivetrain you get
the engine size changes we have the
super handling all-wheel drive that
means a 3.7 liters sidesaddle v6 if you
don't get the fancy all-wheel drive you
get a three and a half liter now this
guy the bigger motor delivers 305
horsepower 273 foot-pounds of torque and
gets this car up to 16 about 6.3 seconds
while delivering 1826 mpg that can be
either through a 6-speed manual or in
our car we have a new 6-speed automatic
that replaces the outgoing 5-speed
automatic in the previous model year
nice improvement the manual transmission
by the way is a no-cost option you can
just pick that instead but it will
reduce your mpg by one in the city and
one on Iowa these tiel's always feel
like about the right point they have a
nice sort of plan of this power comes on
right now I mean I've been Drive like I
mentioned my doing anything to improve
the shifting and what I wanted to get on
some just now it was right there it
didn't get stuck in sixth gear saying
I'm in love with sixth gear because the
EPA wants me to be no it was happy to
shift down here very nice
okay let's price this TL 2012 model
we're looking at here super handling
all-wheel drive is about forty thousand
dollars but to go see that style you got
to take it up 1/2 that tech package trim
level that adds 3730 that gets you the
hard drive navigation system you've also
got some hard drive space for your music
the rear camera the ELS audio full
keyless access and some other high-tech
niceties that's gonna be an important
package to get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
