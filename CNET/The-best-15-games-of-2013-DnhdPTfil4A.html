cnet.com and today I'm counting down my
picks for the best 15 games of 2013
we've got lots to do so let's jump right
into it with number 15 tearaway on
PlayStation Vita the creators of Little
Big Planet did it again with the
surprise portable hit that combined a
great art style and ultra creative
incorporation of the Vita's unique
features in at number 14 is DMC or devil
may cry DMC hit back in January and it
delivered one of the best action games
in years with its amazing and satisfying
combo possibilities and respectful
reimagining of the classic series now
2013 was a great year for indie games as
well and at number 13 is the Stanley
parable easily one of the most unique
games of the year the Stanley parable
takes gamers on a self-reflective
journey that pokes fun at video games in
general odds are you've never played
anything like it coming in at number 12
is guacamelee another surprise hit that
first launched on vita and ps3
simultaneously the light-hearted
platformer meshed great beat-'em-up
action with a cast of lovable characters
the indie luv continues with number 11
which is gone home this game tells the
story of a young girl who returns home
from traveling abroad only to find out
that her family is gone so what happened
to them well you have to play gone home
to find out number 10 on the list is
brothers a tale of two sons now this
downloadable title put players in
control of two separate characters using
both the left and right analog sticks to
control both characters at the same time
the unique setup took puzzle-solving to
a brand new level at number nine is
rayman legends the sequel to the
gorgeous 2d scroller we first played
back in 2011 legends not only looks
amazing but provides some of the best
platforming we've seen in years landing
in at number eight is saints row 4 we
didn't expect much from this one but the
game's over the top setting an addition
of superpowers made it the ultimate
sandbox experience
coming in at number seven is the legend
of zelda a link between worlds for the
nintendo 3ds now not only is this a
worthy sequel to the 1992 classic a Link
to the Past it's also likely the best
3ds game yet dropping anchor at number 6
is assassins creed 4 i'm not going to
lie i haven't liked an assassin's creed
game in years but a c4 totally delivers
on every level making it the most fun
assassins game to play in the entire
series there's pirates there's see
combat plundering and looting it's tons
of fun so you should check it out so
here we are the top five now try and
guess the remaining games as we jump
into number five which is Tomb Raider
the reimagined franchise delivered an
explosive first entry with an origin
story starring a much more badass Lara
Croft fantastic gameplay and believe it
or not it had tombs that you could
actually raid they were rateable tombs
for the first time that's amazing an old
familiar face takes the number four spot
it's super mario 3d world now i have to
say expectations for this one we're a
little low but you can't argue with 3d
worlds incredible level design and sheer
entertainment it provides what the Super
Mario Galaxy series did for the Wii 3d
world looks like it might be able to do
for the Wii U for number three we look
to the clouds at BioShock Infinite
loading city of Columbia now sure the
original BioShock one might be the
better game overall but Infinite's
ambitious gameplay otherworldly setting
remind bending storyline make it one of
2013's most compelling experiences just
make sure whatever you do you don't get
the ending spoiled for you if you
haven't played it yet I cannot stress
that enough so what's the runner up to
the best game of the year it's the last
of us developer Naughty Dog's scared the
absolute out of gamers this year with a
tale of two unlikely partners having to
team up during an apocalyptic fungal
outbreak it's gritty hyper realistic
atmosphere smooth gameplay an
unbelievable production value and acting
cement the last of us as the
to game of 2013 and finally the best
game of the year is grand theft auto 5
of course this shouldn't be much of a
surprise to anyone GTA 5 killed it on
every single level creating the fully
realized and interactive city of Los
Santos that was absolutely brimming with
personality and charisma the game's
rollercoaster narrative featured
fantastic and believable performances
from an incredible cast that rendered
some of the most memorable characters in
recent years GTA 5 successfully created
an immersive experience unlike anything
I've ever played and it should be
enjoyed by gamers of all kinds of course
as long as you're old enough to play
that'll do it for the best games of 2013
