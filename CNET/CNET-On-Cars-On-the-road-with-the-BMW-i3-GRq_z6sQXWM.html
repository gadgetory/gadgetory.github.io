of the AI cars the i3 what they call a
megacity vehicle a clean sheet
all-electric that if it weren't for the
badge on the nose you probably wouldn't
know as a BMW at all this will either go
down as a seminal visionary change in
the company's direction or just a little
bit too much for the brand to bear
history will write that story but in the
meantime we're here to see what it's all
about today all right now nobody accuses
the i3 of being the prettiest BMW
especially from the back it's kind of
sporty from the front and I'll let you
decide what you think about the side but
the structure is interesting
this car is TARDIS like it's bigger
inside than on the outside check it out
you've got a very spacious conventional
front door but then you've got what they
call nowadays a coach door because no
one likes to term suicide doors anymore
notice when you look in there you've got
a flat floor that's because there's no
need for a driveshaft or exhaust pipes
to run up and down the car they own
those videos I've done showing you the
new thing in seat design well here it is
look at this guy this is a thin shell
seat design it's not this big old block
that's like five or six inches thick of
padding and leather and frame it's
really a couple inches of thickness plus
some curvature it's part of a way that
you make more room in a small car and
say it with me save weight when you get
the weight down everything sorts itself
out the car handles better accelerates
better does that with a less heavy
smaller battery in many cases it's just
win-win-win now this guy as you can see
all around me is made up of what looks
like carbon fiber but not quite this is
carbon fibre reinforced plastic it's
kind of a middle ground that gives you
more of a real world price base carbon
fiber is very expensive and very slow to
work with but this is a hybrid of that
and a much more pliable usable plastic
that is a middle ground it's going to
make this car more real-world priced and
faster to manufacture while still
getting really light and really tough
okay now motive power is an interesting
story here Tale of Two Cities if you
will we're seeing right here the
inverter and the electric motor that all
i3s will have 170 horsepower 184
foot-pounds of torque
twenty-seven hundred pound curb weight
small numbers on all counts but the
torque to weight ratio is 22 percent
better than a320 I and just 10 percent
shy of a 328i
with this configuration you've got
eighty to a hundred miles of typical
range on a full charge maybe up to a
hundred and eighteen if you really drive
it eco in a steady state but look at
this hole over here that's there for a
reason
you can option this car as a range
extender they would put a 650 CC
basically BMW motorcycle engine here
running a generator to add another let's
say 70 miles or so of electric range to
the battery now that may sound like a
Chevy Volt killer but not exactly a
Chevy Volt can use its range extender
generator to run continuously as long as
you have gas it's running on electric
this one is more of an additional big
boost of range but it does not keep you
running continuously now the battery in
this car is actually kind of
uninteresting and that is interesting if
you look at that thing you see it's a
very simple rectangular flat square
package that's because they started this
car with a clean sheet design all around
it they didn't need to mold a battery to
fit an existing car platform that has a
place for a drive shaft and things like
that that makes this very simple
potentially modular in the future don't
know if that's on their plans or not and
it's also lithium-ion technology not
lithium polymer which you typically use
to make batteries of irregular shapes
you get that eighty to a hundred ish
miles on your i3 with a three hour
charge from nearly flat that's pretty
short by industry standards these days
now beyond charging what I find
interesting is BMW is got this kind of
AI fiala G about the whole ecosystem of
getting around here's one called Park
now this programs going to allow you to
use their resources to find a place to
park like for your daily work parking
and also have your charging waiting for
you there as well drive now already
doing this in San Francisco by our
office where BMW lectric cars are in a
car share program and then there's this
alternative mobility program where when
you need to go on a long drive
they will loan you out a gas engine BMW
that has no range issues and what they'd
also like to see is all of these
programs combining in a way that also
interfaces with mass transit and even
bicycle usage that's really a European
thing American
just don't do that okay first thing I
notice when I get into the i3 is how
spacious this guy is I'm a tall guy got
no problem with Headroom
it doesn't feel terribly narrow legroom
is great you get this guy going by
rocking this unusual drive control here
kick forward for Drive and then back for
neutral and reverse press the top for
park so I kick that there now we're in
drive mode off we go
plenty of torque of course I've got ways
to adjust the motor the powertrain down
here with comfort Eco Pro and Eco Pro
Plus you notice it doesn't go up to
sport it goes down into different levels
of eco BMW argues that this car doesn't
need a sport mode because it's so light
and because electric is so torquey it's
sporty by its nature why is that
instrument panel just a slit you see
that little module sticking up there
that is your instrument panel there are
no gauges in this car understandably but
it's all bezel it just bothers me for
some reason
when the other big LCD the iDrive panel
to the right is gorgeous it floats in
midair it's what about a 10 10 and 1/2
inch ultra wide screen beyond that it's
standard I drive stuff which is good we
do have here something new we have the
touchpad controller for I drive I
believe they call this I Drive 4.2 it'll
let me do navigation by scrolling on the
top of the thing or writing characters
let's face it out he had that a little
while ago but BMWs got it on a new
bigger controller now it's perhaps the
quietest electric car I've driven yet
they all tend to be pretty quiet but
some of them have a certain amount of
electric gear whine you know the the
reduction gear this one seems to have I
sewed that out the best so far
optional self driving tech on the i3
will handle steering braking and
acceleration at up to 25 miles an hour
braking but not staring at up to about
40 and adaptive cruise control on the
freeway and the self parking tech in
this car will move the ball forward as
well handling not just steering but also
the accelerator and the brake so torquey
quiet pointable
not radically different from a leaf or a
focus cv which i also like but i'm
starting to think that with electric
vehicles we're just dealing with a kind
of car that has less distinctive
personality in its driving manners but
here's the real shocker the only one
I've discovered in this vehicle is they
have delete
it coasts as soon as you get off the
accelerator this car goes into heavy
region it's as if I'm crammed on the
brakes but I'm never touching them
now the i3 arrives q2 of 2014 pricing
will be about 42 grand before credits
and rebates and then about another 4
grand if you want to get the range
extender option to add that roughly 70
miles on top of the hundred or so it
does in its all-electric configuration
what's interesting about this car is I
would have written it off at arm's
length as a compliance car a play made
just to meet federal cafe and California
zero emission standards so they can keep
selling their other cars but there's too
much ambition going on in this guy to
just pawn it off that way this is a big
deal for this company whether it's a
successful big deal remains to be seen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
