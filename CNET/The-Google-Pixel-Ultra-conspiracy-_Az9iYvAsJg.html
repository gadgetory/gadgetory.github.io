show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc alphabet is probably best
known as Google's parent company I'm
your guide I as actor and you are the
fantastic alphabet citizens today we're
focusing on Google we're sorry loon X
and way Moe we've got several upcoming
Android phones Google's plans for China
and your comments but first there's a
conspiracy afoot let's head on over to
pixel Park so we've been covering the
upcoming pixel 3 for a while now but
recently a new conspiracy theory has
popped up a fellow on YouTube by the
name of John Prosser says that Google
contacted him to use a piece of one of
his videos so why does that matter the
clip Google wanted to use has Prosser
saying quote Google should fire its
design team this had to do with the
pixel 3xl the clip would be used in the
opener for the google event on October
9th likely that one clip would be one of
many that discusses the new pixel and
its leaks that seems a little odd right
why would Google request potentially
negative comments before introducing its
new phones some think that Google is
going to surprise everyone with a device
that has not been one we've seen it's
been dubbed the pixel ultra a lot of
people are dismissing the idea of a
surprise pixel however there was a
report by noted leaker elder Matt Azzam
that was published a while ago in it he
said Google was working on seven
smartphones to were the third gentles
that we've been seeing floating around
four other models would also be updated
pixels Berta's instead by october two of
those four would also be ready he
guessed that Google may have leaked the
ones we've seen to gauge reaction if it
was met with negative responses Google
could release the other models Google
has also put up some teasers for its
next phones one site has the number
three on it it's at the Google store
then there's this teaser at coming soon
2018
JP dot with Google com clicking the G
changes the colors of things click it
again and confetti drops some are
guessing that there are three different
colors for the pixel three a white one a
black one and a
mint green one no word if the pixel
three will ship with confetti chrome
unboxed published images of what could
be a new pixel book this site received
the images by an email tipster who said
he saw the pics on Facebook as an ad the
notebook looks to be running Chrome OS
and has a very very thin bezel around
the screen is this really a new pixel
book or is it just a Photoshop job for
an ad we'll find out soon enough and now
it's the news you've been waiting for
try to contain your excitement you ready

headphone adapter amazing right in
eighty bitty little text Google wrote

uptown updates this is the newly renamed
segment where we put together a bunch of
smaller news stories thanks to Reginald

lame update Street they I came up with
that one oneplus is dropping the
headphone jack on the next one plus
headset in an interview with TechRadar 1
+ s co founder carl pace says they're
making the switch because the company
found that 59% of oneplus owners already
owned wireless headphones pay says quote

will benefit the majority of our users

business we'll have to see if they go
with android TV as the interface or not

on October 3rd a New York Post report
says a Long Island woman is suing
Samsung over a potentially faulty Galaxy
Note 9 she claims that the phone became
extremely hot the plaintiff then put the
note 9 in her purse
then she heard whistling and screeching
sounds that was followed by thick smoke
coming from her purse the phone
eventually stopped smoking after another
person wound up taking the note 9 and
putting it in a bucket of water a
Samsung spokesperson told the post that
quote we have not received any reports
of similar incidents involving a Galaxy
Note 9 device and we are investigating
the matter the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was
famously recalled twice due to defective
batteries which led to devices Catching
Fire the note 7 was then discontinued
before being revived as the Galaxy Note
fan edition let's go to the garden of
Google the intercept published a report
talking about Google's plans to build a
censored version of its search engine
for China according to the report the
search engine codenamed dragonfly would
have run on Android devices a number of
items would be blacklisted from search
results including Nobel Prize student
protests and human rights on top of that
the intercept sources say that dragonfly
linked the app to the Android phone and
phone number so that would mean users a
dragonfly would be easily trackable
dragonfly would be the product of a
joint venture partnership between Google
and a Chinese company BuzzFeed news
reports that seven employees have left
Google over quote a lack of corporate
transparency end quote
the site says people had left Google
particularly over dragonfly the
intercept published a report about a
senior Google scientist by the name of
Jack Paulson who quit over dragonfly in
an interview he said it was his ethical
responsibility to resign in protest of
the forfeiture of our public human
rights commitments Google has been
facing scrutiny by the US government as
well the company failed to send Google
CEO sundar Pichai or alphabet CEO Larry
Page to a recent Senate hearing in other
Google News a bunch of people were
online complaining that battery saver
mode would somehow be activated on their
Android devices even if they turned off
the feature themselves Google posted a
response
Reddit and said the company was doing an
internal experiment to test battery
saving features the only problem was it
was rolled out to more users than
intended by mistake the company says
it's put the settings back to default
and apologize for the confusion
