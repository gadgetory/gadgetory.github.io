Josh Lowensohn seen that's Apple expert
and we're here to talk about some iphone
5 rumors now Josh jun 29th marks the
anniversary of the iphone 5 years ago
the first debuted and we've come a long
way since looking back at that first
model it feels sort of a prehistoric
does when she say I mean when the first
phone came out no one thought I was
going to do well it was six hundred
dollars it didn't have apps you couldn't
take the battery out didn't have a
keyboard these are all things that
people really didn't know what to do
with I mean it was a completely
different kind of smartphone at the time
and now obviously the rest is history
they've sold more than 200 million
that's a huge part of apples business
and you know it's it's their key product
absolutely so we've seen five versions
of the iphone so far the last being the
4s released in 2011 everyone is waiting
for the new version when could that
possibly happen I think the rumor is it
pegged it for september-october which is
the same time they did it last year
that's really good time for them to
release something it's when right around
the holidays people have some money to
spend they're not on vacation and for a
lot of people who bought it maybe you're
too ago it's already past their two-year
contract so they're ready to buy their
eager so with the floor s we saw the new
edition of Siri the talking voice
assistant and we also saw you know
better camera better screen what kinds
of improvements big or small or we're
going to see with this next version I
think it's safe to say we'll see a
faster processor will see a better
camera the big rumor is actually that
the screen will increase in size and it
sounds really unexcited for a lot of
people they keep in mind a lot of
competing devices from google and
microsoft have these larger screen the
people are just getting used to them and
by comparison apples kind of look small
and toy ish so i would definitely expect
them to increase that if they don't i
think a lot of people are going to be
asking you know why not buy a larger
device hmm so we may actually see a
hardware change the first hardware
change in a couple of models then
correct and this was a really rumor that
was floating around well before the 4s
and actually four years before that but
apples really kept it the same although
to the credit that's really been nice
for app makers because it's easier for
them to make apps and it's the apps from
a few years ago work with your new phone
that's always been a benefit for them
there hasn't been this sort of
fragmentation that's played Google
interesting and what about some smaller
changes are improvements to look out for
another one is it will have a new dock
connector there's been rumors of magnets
like they use on their on their
notebooks and that's really kind of a
big deal because the smaller you can
make the port the more size there is on
the inside for other things like maybe
even a larger battery well a lot to look
out for and keep our fingers crossed for
september-october we'll check in with
you then cool thank you josh Josh
