money on a dishwasher it's a good
question to ask yourself if you're
thinking about buying a more
budget-friendly option because at least
with this $700 kenmore behind me you're
not sacrificing cleaning performance
Kenmore $700 dishwasher is a great
cleaner scoring just over 90% on our
really stressful tests and besting
models that cost hundreds more in the
process it's seriously awesome
topping it off it has a bunch of options
and cycles to choose from including all
the basic cycles you'd expect from a
higher-end model it also has this really
cool turbo zone option what you do is
you put a casserole dish in the back of
the rack facing these specialized Jets
turn on the turbo zone and this Kenmore
is gonna give that dish and extra scrub
so what do you sacrifice if you pay less
for this dishwasher well the main thing
is that it has a plastic tub on the
interior as opposed to a stainless steel
tub that helps you save energy over time
it also looks pretty plain especially
the buttons on the top that feel
plasticky and cheap and it's missing
some nicer extras like fold down tines
it has one set but that's not a lot of
extra flexibility what I missed most
though our wine stem holders this
distortion doesn't have any of them and
if you try to put wine glasses in those
outer most columns it actually will
knock into the side of the dishwasher
when you try to push it in so yeah on
closer examination you do have to
sacrifice a little bit to save some
money on this $700 Kenmore dishwasher
but it's roomy enough it has plenty of
cycle options and plenty of cleaning
power as well in fact it's a good
cleaner at any price so if you're okay
with the bland looks I strongly
recommend this $700 10 more as a lower
mid-range option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
