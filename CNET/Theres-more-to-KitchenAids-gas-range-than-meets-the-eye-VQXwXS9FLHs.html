student appliances here with the
KitchenAid kg rs30 six BFS like a lot of
the other gas models that we've been
reviewing recently this 1649 dollar unit
fits in the mid price range at this
price point suggest you're going to see
some premium options but definitely not
as much as you would with pricier models
the Whirlpool gas range that Brian
Bennett recently reviewed was kind of
the reverse it looks really nice but was
missing some features usability and
performance things that makes this one
stand out one small feature I really
like about this model is the
responsiveness of its touchscreen with a
lot of the other ones we've reviewed
recently you have to press really hard
or try a couple of times before it
responds this model does come with a
standard 5 burner setup but one thing I
didn't like is that the center burner
isn't an oval burner so it won't
disperse the flame quite as widely as
some of the other options I also like
that it comes with a girl family the
performance of the 5.8 cubic foot
capacity oven did impress though I baked
a ton of biscuits I roasted a whole
chicken and I broiled burgers and
everything came out very well given that
we've tried out a disproportionately
high number of biscuits in recent
history I have to say that these are
some of the best I've seen others also
commented that the outside of the
biscuits were crisp while the inside
stayed soft and delicious which is
something we actually didn't notice on a
lot of the other models and at 14
minutes and 37 seconds it's also the
fastest burger broiler we've encountered
yet the gas whirlpool range took over 24
minutes so this model and that model sit
on opposite ends of the spectrum it has
decent features it's easy to use and it
made delicious foods thanks for watching
