fives you know we work really hard to
make sure we give you information in an
entertaining way no I'm serious here
anyway not all of the ideas we have make
the cut these are the ones that just
couldn't hack it at number five top-five
gestures we want to see now this one was
one of the weirder ones sure we've got
pinch and zoom and other multi-touch
gestures but now we've got devices that
can track your motion in space so the
episode would have looked like me doing
tai chi or something which you see why
we covered that one at number four
reasons not to mourn media center a
little disclosure on my home theater
nerd I've had computers attached to my
tvs for about 10 years now windows media
center was a pretty cool thing but then
Microsoft killed it surprisingly people
got upset if you're upset go try out
flex or Cody and number three top-five
tech horrors this was originally time
for Halloween but I think an apple event
or something showed up screwing up my
schedule yep it was that new macbook pro
with a touch bar that came out and boom
episode scrapped at number two top-five
tech companions more and more devices
are getting smarter you can talk to your
Amazon speaker you can get watched by
that creepy sense mother device you can
even have a conversation with a smart
grill the only problem with this top
five not enough devices are smart enough
yes and at number one top 5 realtek
things from TV shows originally I
thought about ranking tech from West
world or black mirror to shows I'm
obsessed with this one became kind of a
mess because there's a lot of tech also
what was I ranking how cool it was how
real it was do you see why you got the
kibosh should I stop asking questions
now sometimes things get reworked so if
you see an upcoming top 5 that was on
this list it means it went through some
severe reworking give it a shot I hope
you enjoyed this little look inside of
top five I'm I as actor and I'll see you
online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
