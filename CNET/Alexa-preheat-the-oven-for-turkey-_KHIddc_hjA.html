of hands in the kitchen especially
around Thanksgiving so GE appliances has
created a new skill in partnership with
Amazon Alexa to help make cooking a
little bit easier and hands-free GES
line of Wi-Fi connected appliances now
connect with Amazon Alexa which is
Amazon's virtual assistant here's how it
works
GE created a skill called Geneva so you
can ask your Amazon Alexa connected
device such as an echo or an echo dot to
ask Geneva to do something with your
oven or refrigerator in this case we
tested an induction range with our
Amazon echo dot does it sound a little
bit confusing let me show you how it
works
Alexa asked Geneva what the status of my
oven is your oven is currently often is
ready to be controlled and it's also
handy around Thanksgiving Alexa asked
Geneva to preheat my oven for turkey
you'd like me to set your oven
convection roast at 325 degrees
Fahrenheit for turkey right yes all
right
I recommend adjusting your oven racks so
that the turkey will be centered in the
oven if you have an oven food probe this
is a great time to use it as you can see
the GE induction range works really well
with Amazon Alexa you just have to be
very particular about which phrases you
use because she can be a little bit
tricky when it comes to picking up on
exactly what you want Geneva and Alexa
to do together and Wi-Fi connectivity
Assad this is actually a really great
oven because of its fast induction
cooktop it can boil a huge pot of water
in less than six minutes and it's baked
times and evenness in baking biscuits
during our test was also really great
now this evan is two thousand dollars
which is a little on the high end
especially for a free-standing range
like this but that gets you induction
power even baking and some Wi-Fi
connectivity that will really help
connect your kitchen to the greater
smart home
