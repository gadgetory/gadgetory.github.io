we talk about books of interest to see
net readers I'm Dan Ackerman and with my
co-host Scott Stein we're pleased to
bring you this conversation with one of
our favorite authors Walter Mosley best
known for his hard-boiled detective
fiction we also love his science fiction
in spanked with a fiction but we're here
also to talk about his new book down the
river unto the sea the great Walter
Mosley is here with us his new book down
the river unto the sea maybe we can
start and you can tell us just a little
bit about this new book maybe the first
in a new series it might be the person
who's serious who knows I mean I wrote
this book it's interesting last couple
of years I've been really kind of
concentrating on doing film work like I
was gonna I was been working with John
Singleton on this new show of his it's
been out for a year uh
snowfall and I've been doing you know
trying to sell some stuff I have a deal
with NBC trying to to create some series
there and and so you know and and it's
fun to do do film except for sometimes
it gets a little like not boring but
it's like I like I'm not enjoying this
and so I started to write this novel
night I wrote this novel for a very
specific reason there are black men and
some women are around the country who
are being oppressed all the time by the
police among that large group group of
people there's a few people who actually
push back they organize they become
journalists they get other people to
resist and the police really kind of
hate it because it puts them in a bad
position and so often there's a conflict
between these guys and the police and
sometimes people get killed and
sometimes it's the place they get killed
and sometimes it's self-defense on the
part of these guys over here but if you
kill a cop me you definitely gonna be
sentenced to death if they can if the
law can do it and so you know it
happened in Philly with Mia it happened
in Baltimore with Eddie Conway but it's
all over the place and so I want to
write a book about a guy a black guy
who's used to be a detective but has
been disgraced there and he's not and
now and now he's a private
active and he Fenny he's been hired to
prove whether or not this guy another
black guy has killed these two cops and
he's on death row now he doesn't like
the guy because you know he identifies
as a policeman
but he decides to look into it and at
the end he proves a couple of things
when he proves his innocence from
previous time but nobody wants to listen
and he also proves that this guy is
innocent
and they said that might very well be
but we're still gonna kill him that's
right us nobody cares and he's innocent
it's the narrative that they set up
those parallels with his own case what
what drove you to turn this into a new
series rather than let's say assigning
it to one of your other characters was
there something new you wanted some new
angle you wanted the tackle that Lina
and McGill or easy Rollins couldn't
couldn't couldn't have done with this
with this case well that is true but
part of the situation was this ax I I
wanted to write I was just writing a
book I hadn't sold it I hadn't brought
it to anybody I didn't know if I was
gonna solve but I was just gonna write
it and so if I had to do with one of my
caret characters fearless Jonesy Rollins
you know Lynn and McGill I would have to
actually think about it like okay who is
he what is okay what did the easy do in
the last book okay what are the other
characters doing and I don't want all
that I and and I needed him to be a
policeman because a policeman trying to
proofs my who killed the policeman is
innocent that's a hard
that's a hard jump for him and when so
it's so you can feel his resistance to a
while he's moving along he's almost the
only person who could do that having
been a cop yeah well you know and once
he's done it we really believe him
because you know he said look I'm
looking at the evidence here and do it
and he still thinks himself as a cop all
these years later yes you know even
though the other cops may not yeah well
some cops do sometimes do so it's an
interesting thing yeah I I mean I love
that it's at New York I always thought
of you as a Los Angeles writer and you
created such a vivid picture of Los
Angeles for me as only an occasional
visitor Scott actually used to live in
LA yeah I wasn't a lifer Bella so it's
Southern California for about eight
years so it's a different energy look at
sur la did you lose I lived in the
valley I lived in Germany
and I had friends who were in Los Feliz
and then I was in San Diego for a bunch
of years but I would always travel
love-letter and used to work down in
West Hollywood so would travel up
through through Mahal and driver and
mouth through their Coldwater Canyon but
ya got to explore as much as I could and
I would only be in Los Angeles now a
couple of times a year but reading the
first you know half dozen six or seven
easy Rawlins books I really felt like
this reflected even what I had seen
during my you know a couple times a year
trips it was such a great vivid portrait
so when I started reading the lean in
McGill books and they were set in New
York I was very excited about that I
love this is soon I'm a native New
Yorker and it's very familiar to me and
then when I saw this was set in Brooklyn
where I now live not that far from from
where I live I was like oh the guys
offices on Montague Street this is great
yeah and you start talking about the
issues of gentrification and changing
neighborhoods as someone who ended up in
Brooklyn because I was gentrified out of
my old neighborhood yeah III saw I saw
all that and I was very interested in
kind of New York as a character and how
that feels to you compared to let's say
Los Angeles as a character that's that's
an interesting New Yorkers is much much
much older and more conservative which
is you know both good and bad
Los Angeles is sprawling and and always
growing it's kind of like a cancer that
won't die you know and this is it's just
you know all over the place and and
that's and so you know you talk about it
in different ways in New York they're
very lot of things which you can believe
like when you know when you know Joe Joe
Oliver goes to to some you know
apartment somewhere and there's a door
and it leads underneath and there's you
know giant speakeasy underneath that's
kind of understandable in New York it's
not understandable in LA but in New York
that's the kind of thing that you can do
because they're people who've been there
forever they've been people who've been
there since before America you know it
was the United States you know that
that's that's the kind of thing that
that you do but it's but the other part
was just knowing it just you know
walking streets taking the subway you
know they're taking buses taxis talking
to people you know and and you see that
you know one of the things is LA is
segregated by class
and in New York all classes are kind of
shoved together you know so there's
something particularly interesting about
Brooklyn which is sort of I guess over
the last ten years become a brand and
just become like one of these places
that everyone on the in the world talks
about well no I I just you know I listen
at same thing happened with you nine
years ago they when they raise my rent
to $6,500 a month I said oh I had to
move away so I went you know it's a
Brooklyn and you know then I found
myself in Brooklyn and I don't even know
what the old Brooklyn was like because
the new Brooklyn is just like like kind
of appeared oh yeah you know
spontaneously and but you know it's a
lot of fun you know I can't even afford
a new Brooklyn I went out to New Jersey
no I can't either
yeah and I can't even afford New Jersey
really I feel like yeah you have to move
to other part of New Jersey affordable
Connecticut hey I do if I grew up in the
Bronx
I eventually achieve my dream of moving
to Manhattan then I got bumped to
Brooklyn but I feel like it's kind of
caught up and it's everybody else yeah
so Manhattan is evolved we've all gone
there yeah I don't know anyone who still
lives in Manhattan well my vector like
what I discovered you use a writer was
through science fiction and that that
sim is what we talk about a lot here and
and a book that I fell in love with was
future land and I didn't read it when I
first came out mm when I read it when I
about six seven years ago and and it is
still lingered with me I love it for the
way that it was disruptive was
disturbing and I saw things like black
mirror later I kept thinking about
future land you know I felt and it made
me think about and that I start reading
interviews and referring to Philip dick
and I was thinking about that when I was
reading in a really in a really good way
i I just was fascinating about the
existence a book what what drove you to
write it and it's still so timely now
because we're saying a lot of the a lot
of the issues in a class and race that
the technology some of the the
surveillance issues you even get into
things like like like like Nazism and
and and different social groups through
the feminist issues there's all sorts of
things that I feel like we're talking
about now at this moment more than when
I read it six years ago and so I was
curious where your thoughts on the book
were now versus that and and it was very
interesting you know it's so long ago
you know that those nine stories that
kind of try to encapsulate a future
world one of the things that you know
like it being black and coming to
science fiction you do things like
you're watching Star Wars which has a
much larger influence than for instance
Star Trek which is just wonderful but
Star Wars and Star Wars there just
aren't any people of color who aren't
like aliens or stupid and and so and and
because you know coming out of Jules
Verne Jules Verne invented the next
century he did in those books he just
invented it so we're gonna have some
submarines and we're gonna go to the
moon and then we're gonna do flying
things you just had all this stuff he's
doing it and so I'm thinking god these
movies are trying to create a future in
which there are no black people there
are no people of color but I'm gonna go
into a future not like going to the
future of Moby Dick where there are but
but going into Hawthorne and you know
Scarlet Letter where there aren't then
we just don't we aren't there and so I
wanted to write a book that that
included us in a real and also in a
political way that that there are people
of all kinds of colors and races and
also in gender who are like you know
wonderful and powerful I actually I'm
I'm working now with Forest Whitaker
Forrest wants to play and the first if
we do a television series of the first
season of we want to play the electric
guy would be great it would be fantastic
incredible actor and you know he likes
that kind of stuff and and and but
that's it I'm trying to create a future
that I that I see comes from a
trajectory that I'm starting from rather
than some other guy you know I like
Harrison Ford and everything but you
know please you know I have to be like
him
well I thought it was also it's very
kaleidoscopic in the way it deals with I
think race and culture in those nine
stories that it's coming from a lot of
different directions a lot of different
positions and and then I keep and then
the elements keep resurfacing it's not
really separate stories at all it's a
novel and nine
whose data it all intertwine so I
thought that was that was really
exciting I mean the thing needs to get
made because I made me think about
anthology shows now and there's so many
of those now and there's so many built
in that former philip k dick Selectric
dreams or again that feels are I could
obviously black mirror feels a lot like
it but this predated all of those and
even so many that we were talking about
private prisons there's a lot of issues
about access to health care and health
insurance megalomaniacal billionaires
who want to send people to Mars and we
actually have one of those now Elon Musk
wanted to go to Mars and if anyone would
buy their own Island and set up their
own government it's probably him
although we have plenty of other
billionaires with similar delusions of
grandeur and then some of the stuff
about you know the the mechanical eye
that feels like a wearable Scott is uh
written extensively about things like
the microsoft hololens which is a pair
of glasses you put on that has its
overlay with all this data on it or
what's the other one that's like that
Google's always yeah there's a promise
of a magic leap is going to bring it for
me you know cuz I really often I'm like
giving readings people say you know who
influenced you and they want me to say
though she has skin Shakespeare and
Ralph Ellison you know instead of the
people you know who really like
influenced me like Jack Kirby you know
who's you know when he does the New Gods
in the mother box that mother box it's
just like it's outrageous like I like
the you know the the Justice League you
know that movie has the mother box in it
but it's not you know you wore it on
your shoulder it talked to you it took
care of you it fixed you in your bed it
was actually some something in the
future that people would want you know
and but maybe shouldn't have and and and
that's you know that's you know the
electric guy was certainly that I talked
about Farrah Jones the first legitimate
female inter-gender heavyweight champion
of the world you know I mean you really
have that kind of stuff you know it
sounds so crazy right now but it's not
gonna be you know when you you talk
about you know the radical lesbian
feminist separatist you know that you
know that you know that are part of
creating her life you know and
and you just kind of like wow this is
this is such a this is such a kind of a
crazy and end it it's it there's a
there's a sense to it you know it's not
it's not science fiction like you know
like you know 2001 I love 2001 but you
know it's not like oh it's just neat
halls and no dust and everything is nice
you know there's there's bodily fluids
on the floor that you're walking there's
a lot of sexuality and I think that's
what that's also it's it's exciting it's
surprising it's it's a source of I
remember you know stories I like after I
was a kid later on again like Philip
dick comes to mind yeah it's it's it's
rattling and I thought that politically
the landscape is you mentioned somebody
there are so many different political
groups and factions and it's a very like
living with this technology and
political groups very I'm not separate
now I like together and that's what's
like so worrisome right you know that's
what I mean that's what comic books did
so well I mean Jack Kirby specifically
but other people too and it seems even
now I mean we're much more politically
active and things are a lot crazier it
feels all the time crazier so that fell
more even more written to the moment and
that I thought that was interesting you
know if you felt it somehow now it's
coming or did you feel like it was the
path from celebrity to politics also
yeah yeah I just went you know I'm yeah
I'm just always thinking about it I
think there's a group people who are
always thinking about well what's
happening next it's not that we're right
or any any person is right so I'm like
that but saying well what happens what
naturally comes out of this and that's
what comes you know and really that the
brilliance of dick I don't like dicks
writing like I don't like how he writes
words but his ideas are extraordinary
and his characters are real people
rather than people who were you know
Flash Gordon you know what I mean that
that kind of thing that or the you know
the the captain of you know the
enterprise you know this it's like yeah
yeah yeah but you know the real guy
who's gonna make a difference is like
you know with Camus and the plague it's
just a normal everyday guy who's gonna
just gonna sit there and he's gonna gird
himself and he's gonna fight for what's
right
that's that's the world that's the world
we live in you know and has always been
you know these heroes I mean John Wayne
is fine but he's not you know he's an
actor he's not a person you know what I
mean and and then so it's fun to write
about those characters and to see where
they go and and how they get there and
how they represent us getting there do
you feel like now I mean right now we're
in a period of time were there a lot of
lot of superhero movies a lot of
cyberpunk stuff set in that genre I used
to read a lot of cyberpunk before do you
feel like now you do any thoughts about
like that at landscape is it is it has
it drifted to becoming too much of a
genre in and of itself work you
mentioned like the the the grittiness
and the reality of some of those ideas
like that yeah well that's that's the
thing right I mean that you know the I
keep on telling people they say what are
you gonna make another movie you know
I'm always trying to make a movie but
but the thing is I said well you know
they just made Black Panther so that
means I have a six to nine month window
and they and they go what are you
talking about now that everything is
different I said well they said that
with the Emancipation Proclamation it's
not being completely work out that way
and and then then they'll say but but
everything is different now look at all
that money that was made and I said yes
and who made the money Disney made the
money and I can promise you the Black
Panther doesn't work at this name you
know where Ford isn't it but now I had
Disney and certainly is not collecting
the big money on top and that ends and
that alone to say I'm identifying my
politics with this movie that made all
this money for these white people over
here it's like well that's um that's
that's really like when you've been
bamboozled that's when you know Spike
Lee's movie comes into play right it's
all you've been bamboozled mad this
isn't your you're paying them a Mary
Baraka once it was he was giving a talk
and he said he said I used to go down to
the corner and listen to jazz is now I
got to go to another man's neighborhood
and pay him to find out what I got on my
own mind and that's that's what I think
is happening now that's when the you
know everything happens at a at a
predict
time I was excited when I you know I
bought the Fantastic Four comic book
where it was for the first Black Panther
you know I mean that that's the moment
it's not all you know fifty years later
you know do you think science fiction is
a is an area you'll you're going to keep
wanting to return to as an area that's
always on your mind or do you feel like
it it comes at certain points or how do
you relate to it with the rest you're
right it depends on what you're trying
to say you know it's like if I'm really
trying to understand the structure of
the fabric of the universe I'm not gonna
write a mystery because that doesn't
make sense you know if I'm gonna try to
figure out what the only spiritual thing
I have in my head which is that I
believe there is a soul I'm not gonna
write you know a kind of a literary
novel of a philosopher thinking about
the song but you know I want to get to
it and so then in those kinds of
questions that's definitely you know
alternative fiction speculative fiction
and you know when I'm talking more
politically mysteries work very well for
politics you know and then sort of you
know literary not when I have you know
intellectual ideas well literary fiction
fits that for a while and sometimes I
just write nonfiction yeah I believe
this there's kind of a little bit of a
technology crossover between the science
fiction and some of the some of the
detective books that we're always
looking for for that in the leaning
McGill books he's got a hacker friend
and you start to have some of this
interaction with databases and
technology and tracking people that you
don't get in easy rawls books because
it's before or any of that any of that
stuff happened and you see a little bit
of it in in in down the river where
there's a lot of you know you know you
have to take the battery out of the cell
phone and ditch it because they're
because they're because they're tracking
you I'm always struck that these
characters are of other generation where
they kind of have one foot on either
side they're they're comfortable enough
engaging with the technology sometimes
with some help in some way but they're
also still in your face I'm gonna go do
it in person kind of people and I feel
like we don't see that as often I feel
we're all sort of behind our screens all
day long I that person-to-person
communication even making a phone call
as head has gotten lost and so
interesting to see there's people who
can call their hacker friend or do
something that that's kind of high-tech
but then also just bust through the door
or bust into an office and I think I
know shocking people now who are so anti
confrontational an anti inter-relational
they're happy to confront you in
Arminius from the hierarchy right but I
I sign up a sort of justified where a
guy had had used like the Marshalls logo
to steal this guy's business online the
guy goes to the Marshall Marshall says
that's not us they misspelled Marshalls
so obviously it's wrong and so then the
but then the the people who did it that
guy find somebody and they go to people
who did it and and he said listen man
you know it's all on the net I can't and
then the guy pulls out a gun and points
it at his head okay that's the moment
right there's a moment and when somebody
is like a pointing gun at your head or
is going into in the future point a gun
in your head you can say I really am not
trusting this keyboard to protect me I
actually need a living body that's gonna
help me you know you know make sure that
I don't die because the computer is not
a mother box it's not gonna help you not
die it's kind of just sit there and and
you know when you're dead and won't even
miss you and so I think that that even
for those people you know the things
that they're doing online haven't become
completely technological it's not that
people are talking about binary I used
to be a computer programmer i coded
programs in assembler language in in in
binary language or hexadecimal and that
like that's a that was like an amazing
thing and it's still true those things
still run computers today nobody talks
about that so all the things they're
talking about is sex and violence and
anger at something and how you can get
away and Bitcoin or all of it is real
it's real things it's just people who
are have become a bit more effete in
their dealing with the world you know
but it's the same stuff
it'll keep you in there yeah - you know
and that it's it's an interesting thing
you know you try to make people try to
make enemies out of technology but now
technology isn't the end it isn't an
enemy and it's not also something you
can't get away from okay that was gonna
be a question I was gonna ask you do you
feel it's a seeing seeing it put to good
and bad in future land in other books is
it is it a force for positive change is
it a force for democratization or is it
a force to you know keep people keep
people tied up keep people down well the
answer the question that I would come
back with from that is what is the most
sophisticated culture in the world is a
good friend of mine once I said what is
good evening he's all the West you know
they have technology and they've there's
nothing domination so like that and he
said what are you thinking I said well
I'm kind of partial to the Aborigines in
Australia you know cuz an Aborigine you
know wearing nothing can walk across
like a river with thousands of
crocodiles in it and not get eaten
because he or she understands that at a
certain temperature pocket else go to
sleep so if you get into the hottest
part of the water they won't they won't
be able to get at you because they'll
fall asleep along the way and you know
to be able to be able to live in a world
like that to be able to live under the
stars to be able to live naturally in
the world we can't and on top of that we
don't understand what we do have like
air conditioners I mean nobody
understands air conditioners those
people again they don't what they might
talk about air conditioner but they
don't understand them you know they
understand like the meta they understand
the the software that runs the system
they get you to those sexual pictures or
or they they understand all kinds of
stuff that that is is not there like an
in an air conditioner so how do you how
does an air conditioner work you so what
you just flip the switch and it comes on
that's a meta an ocean right that's why
in every post-apocalyptic book in TV
series and movie the world falls apart
completely because no one knows even you
know if they're lucky they can get some
crops going if they get lucky but they
can't figure out how to hook up even
like a windmill and power a light bulb
yeah and it reminds me to when you talk
about technology in those in future land
there are these industries and products
that again sneak through all the stories
that are referred to as almost their own
brand names in and of themselves like a
sense steal or something and it makes me
think of that it's like you oh it's that
thing because we know what that thing is
in that world but you you sometimes
follow it up to who's making it but even
then it's it's it's like another
character in the story that that people
have become dependent on there's a lot
of dependence at all though of all the
levels yeah I get dependent on and and
really and this has been true for ever
like Allegra there was a moment along
the Nile where the the the Egyptians
started growing grain before they were
just gathering it then they started
growing it and when you follow the
graves from before that and after before
everybody lived to 80 years old if they
didn't die in childbirth everybody you
know that they were in younger healthy
there was all these there was no
arthritis there's no this not that but
as soon as they started eating that
grain average age death is 35 years old
everybody is obese everybody has
arthritis because they could just eat
you know and and and those people had to
be winnowed out so that you could eat
you need not get so fat but like that's
the that's the the notion technology is
always weighing on us always weighing on
us and and and and we're kind of stuck
with it we're stuck with being part of
that thing and of course you you run
systems okay if if everything runs
itself in the future everything is made
by factories cars drive themselves
everything is worked like that then you
have a trouble you have a conflict
between capitalism which has been
mastered technology and and and people
working and making money to pay the
capitalist the money to make the
technology you know and you know we're
we haven't talked about it that much yet
but that's that's the big problem next
50 years and the enforced escapism that
constant blaring it you watch this
experience this plug into this play this
game watch this movie watch this to you
it's on your it's on your phone now to
everywhere you go stream everything the
the the pole
strug in future land reminded me and I
think Scott too of we less couple years
we've done a lot with virtual reality
it's gotten to the hardware's gotten to
a point where it's a similar experience
in that it's putting you in a completely
realistic fantasy land where you move
and experience it in the same way and
it's very disconcerting
have you even died and that feels extra
current have you tried any of the
conscious was to one place where there
they had rides mmm-hmm that so instead
of being and you didn't wear anything
actually it was like there's a whole it
was just a whole room and you felt like
you were moving so bright you felt like
you're going back and forth and I would
get dizzy but like but the thing was
yeah I've seen that that's one thing you
know that's like that pure entertainment
mountain ocean but the other things like
in the prisons in future land where you
have a thing that you wear that no
matter that no matter what you know if
you get too excited to calms you down if
you if she's honestly but wait wakes you
up if you you know whatever it is it's
gonna fix you and you understand I my
understanding of that is once you
haven't working in the prisons then you
can give it to everybody give it to
students in school because we know you
know because we have you know
standardized education and you know you
give it to people at work so they can
work at their that their best you know
it doesn't matter that they don't have
offices and everybody's sitting right
next to each other all of this stuff you
know like becomes a part of the future
and the thing is if it makes money it's
hard to get rid of it because because
our system is not technological it's
capitalism and capitalism is the person
who makes the most profit for the least
effort is the person who's going to be
in charge you know and so that that I
you know that that's what you have to
wonder about and I guess you could worry
about it worry about something's gonna
happen I think I'm gonna die one day
well yeah you are you know there's a
sense draft your wrists one day and
it'll
you have it now nowhere was hacks I mean
who has a fitness tracker or a
SmartWatch basically has a it has a
heart sensor connected to them in the
version again for seven should be
thankful that's not his deeply imagine
he can monitor your heart rate and the
new version is an apple working on
something great can tell you if in North
today if you've an elevated sedentary
heart rate it'll ping you about that but
the question then is where the data gets
collected into your insurance companies
sent ashore like the engines of that but
I think the continual observation that
is in some of my in my favorite
nightmare scenarios in science fiction
shows up a lot in future land of like
you were mentioning the the ability to
always administer checks and balances to
your body control you continuously in
what you can do by that that's that's a
yeah it's very pharmaceutical and the
thing don't think about is when does it
happen
that you need that band to go to work
that becomes the thing when you need the
band to go to work you can't get in the
front door you don't have your band on I
mean it has to be on can't be just
holding it has to be on you know and and
and it's following you every time and if
you disappear that's a problem security
is war so all of a sudden because of one
thing your life becomes completely
controlled because the one thing that
doesn't seem to be about controlling you
you become controlled and that becomes
the issue and it is the issue it is the
issue because the of domination people
get upset people get upset with me I
never when I leave my home and I'm just
going out somewhere to you know do
things I always leave my phone at home
a I'm gonna leave my phone at home oh my
god normal people call sir where were
you guys I was out and so what did you
have your phone isn't no I leave my
phone at home when I go out I have a
tremendously hard time when you do that
my kids love to my kid guilts me all the
time about it he'll notice but it's
something you know I guess it's to some
degree drinking the the water here and
testing tech and decide and you started
using it all the time and you have to
disconnect from and develop a routine
where you don't fall too deep into
yourself
but that continual but the problem
the problem with that is this you two
work together for the same person let's
say and you know your chore home is two
o'clock in the morning that person needs
something at two o'clock in the morning
he's gonna call both of you and dice the
person and if you answer and he doesn't
yeah you're ahead
you know and if you keep answering and
he doesn't and you keep on you're gonna
move ahead and so you're gonna have to
listen I got to keep my phone like right
next to my the difference of early
morning TV run into that all the TV
appears at six o'clock in the morning
sure send the car TV but you know it's
true and then and there's a degree to
which you want it you want to disconnect
but it travels home with you it's
already lights that immersiveness you
can yeah you can't I mean really I mean
Chris and it's again like but okay
that's one thing to think about and how
it's going to impact people's lives the
other thing is the Industrial Revolution
12 hours a day six and a half days a
week you get a half day off on Sunday to
go to church you know that's because
people working for the company stores
Tennessee Ernie Ford says you know
you're there working for the company so
it doesn't matter who you are what you
are what you feel you know and that
becomes the moment where the interface
with technology is you know and it's in
that moment has always existed since the
ancient Egyptians it's all we're always
running up against that wall the thing
is that people you know people always
think they're different now all is they
just think they're different and I
really I just to say and and the other
thing that I the next thing I would
write about if I if I can figure it out
in in science fiction you know up until
World War one knowledge doubled every
century all the way back knowledge
doubles so you have three four
generations in the same culture
technological culture which means which
is our culture and then all of a sudden
World War one a doubled and then it
moved up a little faster than World War
two happening faster now knowledge
doubles every ten months right and that
means you know it used to be that kids
would say to their parents you don't
know what you're talking about and then
they were got in the world ten years
later they come back so
you know you were right I found out that
what you said is the right thing now
they say you don't know what you're
talking about they got in the world and
ten years later the parent says you know
no but they were right because knowledge
is changing so fast that you can't keep
up nobody can keep up and that that is
really it's like any credit second
insidious enemy it's it's like you know
the economic infrastructure or the
unconscious or evolution you know it's
like all of those things they're there
and they're changing you and you don't
know it as two people getting up
industry I think we totally feel the
burden of that all the time with kids
yeah where I already filled up at this
point or watching what he does on his
own he'll accelerate past even though I
follow tech all the time or think I do
and then all of a sudden he'll be ahead
in some area like programming for
instance where he'll just sort of teach
himself and and play around with things
I mean to some degree it does feel like
an acceleration through the technology
that we use and that's what's always so
it's always it always is and that that's
the thing it's like the thing too if I
if you can connect this with ancient
Egyptian then then you begin to
understand what it is to be human you
know if you always think and of course
it's hard to look at the past because
you look through the lens of the current
technology so it's really hard to
understand other technologies that
people are living under but so that way
they're different in that way but
they're the same as far as impacting how
your life is organized how your your
relationship to children your your
relationship to to gender your
relationship to everything gets changed
by how your technology works and that
that's really and it's always been true
have you wanted to write anything that
dives even further back in history to
look like it again with that lens of the
present on a period of time we know I
have this book coming out in a September
called John woman and it's it's a it's a
novel about a deconstructionist
historian I believe that history is the
only true deconstruction to start
because you can never know history it's
always it's always gonna change it's
gonna damage I was even in future land I
feel like that was that yeah that's
exactly their father had brought up yeah
well you can't no you can
so like and and right now that that and
that's a technologic no logical thing
you know though it's all all in your
head and you know cuz that's the other
like like really like the thing about
Einstein I mean he just made that
up I mean he just made it up I mean he's
just like well you know I was thinking
that space might be different here and
and you know and in the upper atmosphere
so I'm gonna have to refute Newton and
just say but literally he didn't do any
calculations he didn't have a laboratory
and he just did all of the gorgeous
thing about the human mind is that
moment you know lack of just of sudden
awareness you know which usually comes I
think from some kind of mental illness
mental illness is always helps us to do
better often helps us do better in
society you know and and at the same
time it doesn't help us do better in
human relation
but here that seems like a great place
to get spot to wrap up yes yes I'm I'm
fascinated by all of us like I and I
actually want to read a lot more of your
crime and mystery novels which is an
area that I've never been a reader of a
lot of like mystery stories but I did I
know I've torn through so many of them
so quickly I started with Elmore Leonard
and then I got it to you and I start
reading Richard price and that's kind of
like my triumvirate of crime novels
that's the area it's a gray area for me
like I don't I don't know in terms of
writers and the genre I need to catch up
you know and and i highly recommend of
course down the river unto the sea which
i just finished and is also great a
great new york detective novel thank you
