from clips that you can get for a closer
to $80 online it comes in black and
white and has an inline one-button
remote and microphone for making cell
phone calls hi I'm David Carr noise and
like other clips in your models this one
comes with the company's patented
oval-shaped
ear tips that make it easier to
establish a perfect seal than round tips
these guys are fairly lightweight and
relatively comfortable to wear they also
do a decent job sealing out ambient
noise so long as you can get a tight
seal of course and they come with a
standard clips carrying case which is
better than most in terms of sound if
you like bass you'll like the r6i and if
you like a lot of bass you may love it
yes this is a very basic headphone and
even the mid-range is warmed up and rich
bass fullness oomph and power are more
plentiful than many similarly priced in
your headphones but the downside is that
treble definition is lacking it's just
not a detailed headphone which will be a
problem for some listeners on the plus
side it does reduce the grading
harshness on a lot of contemporary
recordings and for example rendered
Arcade Fire's recent reflector album
more listenable overall I like the fit
of this headphone and liked it with
certain types of music if you're someone
who likes a balanced detailed headphone
this isn't it but if you listen to a lot
of hip-hop or techno and are looking for
a headphone with very plump bass the r6i
has that in spades I'm David Conway
that's the clips r6i thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
