backyard barbecues lemonade and tablet
warfare I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update if you want a tablet
that can compete against the iPad you
gotta build it yourself that's the
philosophy of Microsoft which just
showed off its first tablet called
surface and next week Google is going to
have its own tablet to the word is that
Google has worked with asus to build its
own tablet and we were expecting to see
more on that next week at its IO
Developers Conference folks we're in a
new age of tablet wars where the system
makers have to get their hands in the
mix to create a meaningful device
clearly Microsoft was not happy with the
tablets coming from its partners no
surprise there so here comes the surface
it's got solid hardware from what we can
tell it comes with a kickstand and the
biggest take away a cover that also
serves as a keyboard it comes in two
flavors a lite version that will likely
be priced somewhere around five hundred
dollars and a pro version that could be
powerful enough to be a laptop
replacement of course that all depends
on a few factors like how much we love
that keyboard we don't know price we
don't know when it'll go on sale but you
do know that Microsoft hopes to avoid
the same mistakes of failed laptops like
the HP touchpad and the blackberry
playbook it's all about the apps and how
the surface will play along with our
other gadgets microsoft said nothing
about how your life will be better
nothing about how it could be tied in
with an Xbox nothing about phones but
you see that's what's next there's an
event for Windows Phone developers that
begins Wednesday and will get a look at
the next generation of Windows phones in
other news the mobile card readers
square is adding customer reward punch

app to encourage customers to return and
