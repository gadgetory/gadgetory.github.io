for iOS and that means your iPhone and
your iPad and it's actually also going
to work with a game controller for iPad
with some game controllers that have
been released in the past so you got
that going for you I don't understand
who you are if you haven't played
Bioshock but thank you neither I have
not played Bioshock we just started man
so here's what Bioshock looks like guys
thank you have you ever heard of it
I've heard of it I've seen gameplay I've
actually seen the news about it alright
so this is what it looks like on iOS I
mean yeah it looks like it's gonna suck
with the virtual buttons but hook up a
game controller and I'm on board man

schmuck is touching everything it just
looks terrible but it does support there
you go look at that game controller on

it I don't know how much gonna cost I'm
a little nervous about that
