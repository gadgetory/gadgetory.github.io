crewmates and the NASA into the entire
world but I'm still alive surprise in
the new sci-fi movie the Martian Matt
Damon plays Mark Watney an astronaut
stranded on Mars and forced to figure
out how to live in the harsh conditions
with little food and water this movie is
really meant to take place in the very
very near future so we're right on the
cusp of being able to do a lot of the
things that that we do in the movie
while NASA continues to explore Mars
with unmanned Rovers plans are already
being made for human exploration of the
red planet in the 2030s one of the
biggest challenges involved supplies
NASA successfully landed the one-ton
Curiosity rover three years ago but
needs to deliver much heavier payloads
for a human mission what we're going to
need down on the surface to support
humans is probably 40 tons worth of
equipment or how we're going to use the
thin atmosphere of Mars to help slow
down and then eventually lay stuff down
on the ground as nicely as we did
curiosity curiosity's much-celebrated
landing helped inspire what dr. Greene
calls the mars generation adding to the
mars mania NASA's recent announcement
that liquid water exists on Mars
boosting hopes of finding microbial life
there next NASA will be working to
pinpoint which parts of the planet
astronauts should first explorer we're
going to find out where on Mars we would
want to set humans where they would work
where they would extract materials how
they would survive in that environment
with years to go before humans step foot
on Mars movies such as the Martian could
help keep the public's interest in space
exploration that value is not lost on
NASA which opened its doors to acclaim
director Ridley Scott to do research for
the movie in los angeles ashley escada
