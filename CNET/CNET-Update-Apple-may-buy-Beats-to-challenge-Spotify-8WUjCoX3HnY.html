Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the next episode 4 dr dre in
Beats Audio could be Apple a video
posted to Facebook seems to confirm
reports that apple is buying beats
electronics for 3.2 billion dollars the
video was posted by the rmv artist and
actor Tyrese Gibson and in it he's
having fun with rapper dr. Dre the
co-founder of beats and he says Forbes
needs to update their billionaires list
then the good doctor from Compton points
to the camera and says that he's the
first billionaire in hip-hop the video
was soon removed from tyreese's public
facebook page now this turns out to be
true the whole deal is really
interesting for a number of reasons it's
not typical for Apple to buy a hardware
company and when it comes to quality
sound beats is not the best headphone
out there but beats goes beyond
headphones it's a massively popular
brand and beats also has a new streaming
service called beats music Apple may
want to just absorb beats technology and
build on that streaming service and
don't forget about one of the brains
behind beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine
he's a good man to have on your team if
you want to strengthen your music muscle
he's a famous record producer and
chairman of universals Interscope Geffen
and A&amp;amp;M record labels there are rumors
that he may be brought into Apple as a
special advisor to Tim Cook Apple
changed digital music with the ipod and
itunes but Apple may need fresh
perspectives to keep innovating and
perhaps come up with a product that
could compete with Spotify moving on
from streaming music to streaming movies
Netflix has raised its monthly
subscription price by one dollar more a
month but if you already subscribe to
netflix you won't have to pay anything
extra for another two years for now only
newcomers have to pay the higher nine
dollar monthly fee Netflix will be using
that extra cash on beefing up its video
offerings and investing in exclusive
shows like house of cards starring Kevin
Spacey and there's a new app that Kevin
Spacey's corrupt character would really
love it's called make it
rain the love of money this odd game has
gone viral and it's at the top of the
iTunes charts it's satire on our
obsession with wealth and it encourages
you to swipe your finger on a stack of
cash really fast and be corrupt and
manipulative to earn virtual money you
only get rich if you get into insider
trading subprime mortgages and bribe
politicians what's crazy is that people
are spending their actual American
dollars to buy a booster pack in the
game to bribe the FBI now if you can
make it past the investigation you can
invest in larger businesses there's
always money in the banana stand that's
