HD 8.9 because the Kindle line just
keeps expanding and the screens just
keep getting bigger so this is for the
Kindle and Amazon fan who kind of wants
an iPad but doesn't want to spend that
much and just really loves Kindle stuff
let's check it out
I do love Amazon's packaging that's how
easy it is like this is the box that it
came in I love it although I miss my box
cutter all right here we go now this is
kind of an interesting sized tablet 8.9
sits right between the 7.9 inch iPad
Mini and then maybe a 10 inch iPad or
nexus 10 it's all dusty let's check it
out
very very similar to the Kindle Fire HD
in design of course and actually almost
seems similar in size it's just a little
bit bigger and obviously very
rectangular lis oriented I'm sure that's
a word alright let's see what else we
have in the box here
Amazon continuing to leave out the power
brick with its chargers now there's some
controversy about this and I've come
down on both sides the peasants to be
honest but I kind of feel like everybody
at this point probably does have some
sort of a brick or a computer so I
appreciate at least the lack of waste I
also appreciate the fact that this is a
nice long charging cable I'm never gonna
get over that obsession all right that
is basically it some instructions here
getting to know your Kindle
no waste love it
alright let's fire this up my biggest
complaint about these Kindles is that I
can never figure out what the power is
don't laugh you're gonna do this to see
that it oh that's it
it's the little button at the top next
to the volume rocker while we wait for
this to fire up I'm gonna go through set
up and all that so you don't have to be
here for it let's go through the specs
the Kindle Fire has as I mentioned an
8.9 inch HD display it's extremely
beautiful this display 1920 by 1200
pixel resolution the tablet weighs 1.25
pounds and performance is pretty good at
1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor with
one gig of onboard ram memory starts at
16 gigs and that price is just $2.99 it
does go up from there and for 32 gigs
with LTE you'll pay $4.99 now compared
to an iPad that's a good price it runs
the Amazon version of Android which
means you won't get all the apps
available in the Android app store but
you'll get plenty battery life is pretty
good according to Amazon ten hours of
continuous use in terms of ports you get
microUSB and micro-hdmi it also has a
front-facing camera for video
conferencing or taking pictures the
Kindle Fire HD has dual stereo speakers
that sound pretty good and you can watch
shows in hi-def up to 1080p so if you're
in the market for a full sized tablet
right now the options are obviously iPad
or 800-pound gorilla the new Google
Nexus 10 or something like the Kindle
Fire HD
now what this tablet has going for it is
price like I said it starts at $299 for
all of that Amazon goodness so if you're
already a fan of Kindle books if you
have a Prime subscription you like the
streaming video this is a pretty easy
choice and for the price of an iPad
you'll get 4G LTE and that's just an
extra $50 a year so it's a pretty good
value as a tablet I have to say my only
complaint about it is that the ecosystem
is a little bit limited because it's not
full Android you won't get all of the
apps you really are just living in the
Amazon world
like I said if that's where you live
already and you don't want to spend a
ton of money this is a great option I
have to say though for me on this table
the best value still the Nexus 10
sorry Amazon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
