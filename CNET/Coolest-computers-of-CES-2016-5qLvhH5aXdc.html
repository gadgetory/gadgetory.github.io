parts of the show we're near the end of
it we get together with the coolest
laptops and computers at CES joining me
for the first time this year all the
years we've been doing this is my new
best buddy Shawn Hollister Shawn we've
seen some very excited computers here
haven't we yes yes some excellent new
laptops and computers here well I'm
gonna start off with what I think my
favorite trend is because it's all about
trends it's not about individual
products but though we like products
it's about trends and I love seeing OLED
screens on laptops we've seen Ã¶land and
TVs for years now always super
impressive but super expensive I still
can't afford one I'm hoping maybe next
year but for now I can get OLED in a
laptop the first one I saw was this guy
this is the ThinkPad x1 yoga from Lenovo
and you know Lenovo makes a lot of yoga
system so this think pant version of the
yoga has an OLED screams super bright
and if you put it next to a regular
screen you can really tell the
difference and of course because it's a
yoga it folds back when I love about the
sync pads is that the keyboard goes down
like this it goes flat when you fold it
over as opposed to the regular yogurt
where the keyboard stays up and inactive
but the real selling point here is this
gorgeous screen and when I saw this
early this week I was just blown away I
said that's it there's no laptop at CES
I could possibly look better but I was
what I thought at first because it turns
out there are even more OLED laptops
here at CES you saw the nits of a big
trends tell me what this guy is right
here right here we've got the new
Alienware 13 OLED laptop we've got a
gaming machine finally with an OLED
screen you get that quick response time
we've been lacking in games so when
you've got your video game characters
running across the screen it looks like
you're looking through a window at them
it doesn't they the characters don't
smear across the screen it looks like
the standard Alienware 13 they've been
making for a while
same laughs finally figured out how to
get an OLED screen into it and not much
ice cream too too much hopefully it's
gonna be the same price as their regular
high-definition screen you get this OLED
upgrade for free that is awesome and I
love how that looks
this is one of the few small 13-inch
gaming laptops you can even get it's a
pretty small category although I guess
it's going because look at that here's
another one that's do this I always I
always like to see what Razer has
designed wise because they really push
the boundaries there so show me what
that guy is this razor blade stealth not
only does this laptop have this crazy
keyboard here that lights up in totally
different colors okay it's super thin
it's 999 dollars for Core i7 and H nigga
bytes memory
lots of premium components that build
quality here and and it's so thin I
can't imagine you can get a big graphics
card in here you can't get it in there
but you pull out this box the razor core
with a giant desktop graphics card in
there this is great okay this is Grace
Lee just a box and you put a desktop GPU
in this desktop like it in the rear you
plug it into the razor with this single
cable and yank this over here and a
single cable USB see this is the new
USBC standard this cable is going to
charge the laptop it's going to give it
the power of this full graphics card to
play my son it lights not it's beautiful
and Dana the same time you got USB ports
back here so you can plug it all your
peripherals you put in this single cable
you get your whole desktop gaming setup
together or you buy this and then you
can buy this separately you gotta buy
this and that's separately we don't even
know how much this cost
yet the for the box and it doesn't come
with a graphics card you gotta buy your
own write your own graphics card in
there 200 it's gonna be some money yeah
absolutely nice way to get gaming and
then also super portability I like that
I'm gonna put this down here before I
break yes with it nice big a little bit
of box but the laptop inexpensive for
the premium components you get here it
was like what they do I never really
I've never really drunk the kool-aid on
the flashy lights under the keyboard but
maybe that's good them not into sort of
the dorm room aesthetic one something a
little more sophisticated I have what I
think is the only laptop that really
competes feel and design wise with what
I'm using right here for taking notes
that's that 12-inch MacBook from Apple
and that's this guy this is the HP
EliteBook
folio g1 oh and it's super thin super
light 12.5 inch screen
you can get up to a 4k screen on this
which you can't get on on the 12 inch
MacBook and you can see it really feels
very similar and you've discovered the
secret feature right there that's a
180-degree screen I always complain when
laptop screams don't go back far enough
so this goes totally flat like this I
guess you could lay it down on the table
if you want let's do it and like that
MacBook it actually runs it actually
runs Intel Core M that second generation
Core M that's the other theme we're
seeing here this week a lot of companies
are going all-in on that second gen Core
M where maybe the first end only a
handful of people did so what makes
these laptops so thin you don't have to
have a good - yep with when you got Core
M and said you know we're gonna have to
do more testing in our CNET labs to see
if that core M chip really stands up
because the first generation you know
didn't quite give us the performance in
the battery life we wanted but I think
there are so many people here at CES
this week
betting on core M that that I I suspect
it'll be it'll be pretty good I love the
touch pad to keep our oh yeah - for
something this thing a little dying it's
impressive tale right there around the
around the around the touchpad so I like
this one a lot and you have another
really cool super slim design that I
like a lot if you want to go really
really thin the galaxy tabpro s
this Samsung tablet right here sorry I
spoiled the surprise it's a tablet like
a Microsoft Surface this thing hooks
right into this magnetic keyboard folio
and you just pop it right up there I
love how the keyboard magnetically just
pops into the Windows system we've got a
Galaxy Tab name which was previously
Android right so thin because they're
designing it like those Android tablets
so thin and you just pop it right in
there the other neat thing about this
the reason that the Galaxy makes a big
difference here you take a galaxy phone
you pop it right here on to the keyboard
it pairs wirelessly and you could read
all of your text messages from your
phone even reply to them on this we have
them on some systems for years where you
get the little pop-up that shows the
screen Android systems sure yeah you got
a Windows you're doing some real work on
your Windows computer you pop your phone
on there now you don't have to worry
about pulling your phone out of your
pocket to get those messages now if I
buy this guy I just wanna take a look at
the tablet for absolutely full write off
the first time I'm really getting a
chance to play with this this
with with the keyboard it does it's done
because a lot of times you get something
like a surface pro you buy the surface
pro and then you spend another whatever
it is hundred and thirty hundred fifty
dollars it starts to add up fairly
people packaged stuff that looks like a
nice keyboard it's not bad at all spin
outstanding like if you like the 12-inch
MacBook you're using a 12-inch MacBook
it's pretty thin this feels pretty good
too I don't know about the touch beds a
little smaller but that's keyboard okay
bundled excellent I just don't know what
it costs yet also we're talking about
OLED screen treads this is another OLED
screen 0.5 inch OLED screen just like
Samsung smartphones and tablets now you
get it into Windows to get to the
holiday season without everybody I don't
want to get OLED screen laptop I
definitely I have got to have one in my
next laptop I know you have one you have
another thing back there that's not on
our list but you said hey here's a cool
surprise I thought we should bring this
into this is the Samsung notebook 9 ok
13 inch notebook 9 and the claim to fame
here is this thing is so so light under
2 pounds I think it's one point eight
five pounds line they've had four years
ago that we first saw here at CES
several years ago that everybody really
liked it kind of kicked off the whole
ultra book design yeah there's really
one of the first ones to fall into that
category I feel that actually absolutely
oh that's nice to hold that right there
give it a heft it's so light you can
take the 15-inch one and a 13 and one
lift them in one hand two laptops one
hand that's how light a long week I
might need you hands that is cool I like
that really is light so we're gonna move
from super expensive super fancy and
let's start talking about some less
expensive stuff yeah because you know
what my favorite laptops are always the
budget laptops because I'd like to see
what you can do with the least amount of
money possible and then one of the
coolest trends that I've seen on that
front is the rise of what we call the
$200 laptop yeah and HP had won the
stream 11 and Lenovo has won a couple
other companies do now dell has one and
this was called the Inspiron 11 3011
3000 199 won
it's full Windows 10 and it's got a
reasonably decent keyboard and touchpad
it's got obviously in 11.6 inch screen
and it runs I think a seller on and
getting Celeron processor a couple
gigabytes of memory things unlike those
netbooks of many years ago that were
very inexpensive but didn't really run
well this new generation of 200 our
laptops you know what for surfing the
web going online email shopping social
media they're fine and most importantly
things like streaming Netflix or
streaming HD video from YouTube they
also work well and that's I think 90% of
what people do with their computers it
was using it away with that we're kids
great for traveling obviously if you
leave one in the back of a taxi it's not
the end of the world it used to be you
could pay $400 for a cheap a laptop and
it wouldn't have a good keyboard it
wouldn't have a good touchpad it
wouldn't do basic tests now you're
paying $199 for something that's you
know it's plasticky it's like a little
bit of Oh kids colors here but it feels
good enough to do all these kind of
plastic about making it pop a little bit
and these cool colors are awesome and of
course if you want to spend a little bit
more they've got all kinds of
color-coded accessories that go with it
I think of another color over here right
yeah we've got the white and the white
and I read freely white the red sleeve
on it I like that that's red as well
several different colors if you want to
make your laptop really pop like a whole
rainbow of them and hand them out
absolutely now one of my one of my other
favorite cheap laptops not cheap laptops
cheap desktops is something that we saw
here for the first time exactly one year
ago at CES 2015 that was the Intel
compute stick a tiny little thing that
looked like a chunky USB key you plugged
into any TV any monitor and it turn it
into you know a low-level but functional
computer well guess what we're here
again and this is the next generation
right now generation 2 of the Intel
compute stick and they've made a couple
of changes that actually fix some of the
problems we have in the first generation
number one instead of one USB port now
we've got two one USB three one USB 2 so
if you have a dongle for wireless mouse
and one for a wireless keyboard or
something like that you're not stuck
although you should frankly just use
Bluetooth and save the ports for
something else and of course here's the
here is the HDMI connection right here
at the
it's got a toe 2.11 AC Wi-Fi it's
supposed to end last year because people
complained it was a very fast at
downloading stuff and the atom processor
inside it's not great it's cherry trail
instead of the instead of the older
version in last year's but you know what
retail price is gonna be about a hundred
and fifty nine dollars and then here's
the big secret later this year Intel is
gonna have something that looks same
size same dimensions it's gonna have
core m3 and core am v yeah and that's
much more mainstream performance there
but that sounds good to me you know
traveling somewhere and you have your
presentations on this you plug it into
let's say a TV in a conference room you
know you're ready to go and then you
take it with you all your files are on
there or on there securely like a USB
key but now it's the entire computer I
see a few of these this year this past
year and I think we're gonna see more
and I like it and I think we have time
for probably one more system this is the
furthest the first shot in all the years
we have been doing this coolest
computers at CES show I do not believe
we have ever brought a desktop up here a
standard desktop the computer stick kind
of counts I guess but but I thought this
was so funky I said we got to bring a
desktop up here please pass me that that
that's that tower over there that little
triangular thing this is the Lenovo idea
center six 10s okay it looks like a lot
of the living room centric media pcs
that we've seen like the Asian Revo one
you can basically you know plug it into
your TV if you want sort your stuff on
there it's almost like a security cam or
like a router and that's fine the big
secret here is hold us up for me
absolutely I'm surprised for it it comes
with this guy which is a projector a
720p I think it's 220 lumens projector
and it snaps right on top there and
magnetically connects you need a power
cable for this you do need a power cable
for the projector part also but they do
not need to be connected to each other
you can actually take this and they will
communicate wirelessly and you can just
have the projector and point it anywhere
and turn any you know room into like the
mini projection theater and for
something that's kind of a little
portable media home theater PC I think
that is super cool and then you just
stack it on there like that to think
that this is what a desktop looks like
in 2016 here with the projector I think
it's about 850 bucks so you can even get
some you know fairly mid-level graphics
with it if you want so so that is worthy
of being I think the first tabletop
desktop that we have brought in here at
the years that we have been doing we
have been doing this show that's a lot
of computers to go through Sean why do
it's a big trends here OLED super slim
gaming stuff external gaming time
graphics I shudder to think what we're
gonna see when we come back here next
year
everybody's gonna be OLED I just don't
know how I'm gonna pick my next computer
I can only you buy one of them at a time
right just use it for 30 days send it
back and get another one all right Sean
thank you for joining me for your first
time here co-hosting this cool computer
show right over here and we are going to
wrap it up right now so I'm Dan Ackerman
with internal Hollister thanks for
joining us for our coolest computers at
CES presentation thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
