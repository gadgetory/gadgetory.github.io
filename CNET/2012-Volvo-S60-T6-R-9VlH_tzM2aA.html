best customers away from the a4 in the
free series they didn't screw around
this decidedly handsome beast is perhaps
the most mind-changing Volvo yet let's
drive the 2012 s60 t6 R and check the
tech
the s60 shares a platform with the xc60
crossover but you'd never know it by
looking at them this sedan has none of
Volvo's traditional chunky shoe appeal
nor the goofy trying to hard thing of
the more modern c30 coupe got a handsome
although they've got a distinct and
really very elegant and handsome cabin
language now they've really pulled it
together
very subtly fared in things like their
vents and their bezels this control
panel is very Volvo it ties into that
what seven-inch high-res LCD and what
you've got here is a series of knobs not
a central controller like a lot of
companies use the key thing is this is a
rotating selector with an okay or select
button on top and an exit or back button
on the lower half of this guy it also
doubles as a tuner when you're in Radio
now let's get to what you can see on the
screen here's our navigation optional
navigation by the way and like
everything on this screen really fine
dot pitch I've got all the PIO eyes
showing right now you have real-time
traffic on this guy let's go to the
media system here's your optical slot CD
or DVD because we have the top-end
media system which has Dolby Pro Logic
and handles DVDs down here your control
system brings you to the media tab disc
is this slot of course rotate this to
USB
there's my USB and iPod connector
bluetooth is streaming Bluetooth a2dp of
course you also have Bluetooth
hands-free as well and a good
old-fashioned aux jack right in here
right next to the USB guide and since
every car makers teaming up with some
robb report style home audio brand these
guys have teamed up with odyssey they've
got a system in here with I believe 12
speakers five amps at 130 watts each as
I mentioned Dolby Pro Logic decoding and
what they call multi EQ which is a
advanced DSP system that Tunes out all
the distortions and weirdnesses of this
cars particular cabin although I don't
find any mention of there being active
noise cancellation cameras this car is
optioned up with the camera in the rear
which is pretty standard stuff you have
two views useful and useless which is
just a little bit of a crop and push on
the existing via a lot of carmakers are
doing
that now it's basically a gimmick but
you do in the main view have trajectory
and these kind of silly dotted lines I
don't know if those dotted lines mean I
prefer the red green yellow or something
like that
I guess I look in the manual it's going
to tell me every dotted line is six
inches or something but I don't need to
memorize that math give me regions that
say don't go here now as this is a Volvo
there's a slew of tech to keep you from
running into or over anyone standard is
city safety which keeps you from
rear-ending someone in stop-and-go
traffic we've tried it it works optional
is the blind spot information system
adaptive cruise control lane departure
warning and the related distance alert
to prevent rear Enders in other
situations then there's collision
warning technology with pedestrian
detection which can actually detect a
pedestrian when you're texting or
whatever and apply up to 100% of the
brakes to keep you from running them
over an industry-first from Volvo one
choice on the gearbox here which is this
a gear tronic six-speed automatic a true
automatic not a CVT
as you can see it's got a pretty
traditional gate and then you've got
your shiftable gate over here no paddles
though now let's go see what feeds into
that
now the r-spec on this car is the same
engine layout 3 litre inline-six
turbocharged sitting like this but
they've revised it with different timing
on spark and advance and combustion and
they've also gone through and they kind
of ported and free flowed the engine so
you get a much better breathing mill
which takes you to 325 horsepower 354
foot-pounds of torque and it gets this
guy up to sixty about a half a second
faster around five and a half while
still delivering 1826 mpg and again both
models are all-wheel drive that we're
talking about here and both go out to
that same 6-speed automatic which we
will now go find out how well it works
first of all in everyday city driving
how's the power delivery of this turbo
it's actually quite good around town
very tractable in that sense I don't get
the determination or the feeling that
it's having to think to apply boost and
that's good because when you feel a
turbo in town you've got a disaster on
your hands we'll see how it is more on
the open road now let's try adjusting
the steering force there's this menu
here for steering wheel force I have
three settings low medium high let me
see alright so how I should give me a
higher weighting dramatically more than
low letzte nice smooth sounding engine
not quite in the Audi realm of
smoothness but that's the benchmark
anyway so it's not bad to be even close
to that it's quite comfortable in town
firm seats but good overall Mergen omits
and a lot of good room in this car by
the way
plenty of headroom for me ok now I've
got some open road let's set this car up
for it's more athletic handling and
that's really just two things pop it
over here in the gate I don't want to
manually ship it I mean it's an
automatic for crying out loud you do
your job but I'll put it in the manual
gate you see that puts me in sport mode
right there so it's going to shift and
hold rpms a little more aggressively and
then I'm going to dial in this steering
light I did already while I was stopped
into high force which is the least
assist should give me a little better
feedback and a little less oversteer on
my part now leaving this car in the
sports side of the automatic gate you
start to feel that it's an automatic
more so than we did
we were around town it's less suited to
what I'm trying to do here which is
drive a little more spiritedly and
here's where it still seeks a top gear
too much it's someone to yank itself out
of what I think is like fourth or fifth
at a speed where I'd rather have it in
second or third so that's an argument to
get into the shift gate which of course
you can but the power on this car is
really quite linear once it comes on it
has that sort of turbo times overly high
gear thing we get in a lot of cars these
days but once it comes on it's a nice
broad torque curve out of that turbo
which not all of them are and that's a
benefit of having a big engine
suspension I'm not impressed with I'm
getting plenty a little you know yo hop
as I go around this choppy sort of Road
it's got a lot of twists and turns in it
this is where that adaptive 4c
suspension that is optional might be
nice okay let's price this s60 t6 in
this case it's an R but a t6 without the
R package starts off with 38:8 then they
get to an R model which is a different
model you're gonna pay about forty six
hundred dollars more and that's going to
roll in the hotter motor the 4c active
suspension bigger wheels the are body
kit moonroof and those dual xenon
headlights the multimedia package is the
high-end audio the navigations included
as is a rear camera twenty seven hundred
bucks I might go for that the tech
package gets you all that adaptive
cruise Lane Departure distance alert and
the thing that will stop you before you
whack a pedestrian for twenty one
hundred bucks and the one that I blow
off without even thinking about it is
the rear seat entertainment option for
eighteen hundred it's a hokey old dual
screen dual DVD that you could have
bought at Kmart and oak road to your
seats bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
