this is Mitsubishi's HC 7900 DW DLP
projector it's one of the least
expensive 3d projectors and miss abhi
she's lineup we compare this projector
to a couple the other 3d compatible
units out there and while it was a
little bit more expensive it really
didn't deliver that much more of an
impact in picture quality we'll get to
that in a little bit but let's start off
with this projectors look the overall
look is a little bit bulbous to my eye
it is a little bit larger and heavier
than some of the other entry-level
projectors out there
Mitsubishi doesn't do much with a
styling aside from a couple chrome
accents and this all-white coloring set
of features are minimal on this
projector the highlight is a lens shift
you can flip up the little lid here and
find a dial that adjusts the lens up and
down without messing with the geometry
that is a nice extra and a projector at
this level although there are a couple
of others that share it on the top side
toward the back there's a standard array
of controls and of course this projector
also includes a remote not a big fan of
the remote it actually doesn't even say
Mitsubishi on it and it looks like a
very generic model with a haphazard
button arrangement a couple cryptic
labels but all told you probably won't
have to use it much on a projector on
the back there's an ample array of
inputs including two HDMI one component
video and also a PC input that can also
accept component video so does have a
couple more inputs than some of the
other basic projectors on the market
Mitsubishi also includes a couple more
adjustments than some entry-level
projectors there's a full array of video
processing adjustments that allow you to
tweak the smoothing or so proper effect
from zero to nil and actually has quite
a few levels of gradation that I really
appreciated there's also plenty of
controls for color and gamma including a
multi-point gamma control and a full
color management system so all told you
can tweak this projector six ways from
Sunday the picture quality Mitsubishi is
pretty good as long as you keep the
lights off in a dark room it competed
well with other projectors in its price
range and it delivered pretty good black
levels and very accurate color the
problem is light output when we turned
up the lights it really couldn't get
nearly as bright as some of those other
projectors and as a result the picture
lacked a lot of impact in those really
high brightness picture modes picture
look quite a bit more washed out and of
course the Mississippi sheet as a result
is not nearly as versatile as some of
the other projectors we tested that's
not to say that any projector looks
great with the lights up but if you need
to watch with a little bit of ambient
light I choose a different projector
than this Mitsubishi unlike some of its
3d competitors Mitsubishi doesn't
include the 3d option in the box you'll
need to buy a step
mitr as well as separate 3d glasses it's
me she also doesn't sell 3d glasses
itself although these expand glasses
that came with our review sample are
available online for around 40 bucks and
that's a look at Mitsubishi HC 7900 DW
DLP 3d projector I'm David Katz my
