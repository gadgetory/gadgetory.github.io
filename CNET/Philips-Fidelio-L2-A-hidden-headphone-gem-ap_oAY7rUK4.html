this is the Philips Fidelio l2 and over
ear headphones sells for around $250
online there's a lot of competition in
this price range and you don't hear that
much about the l2 which doesn't have
great distribution in the US but it's a
really good headphone unlike the open
back Fidelio x2 which we also like the
l2 has a closed back design and comes
with a cable that has an inline remote
for cell phone use so it does double
duty as a home and mobile headphone
overall it seems sterli built and it's
comfortable to wear with nice padded ear
cushions that said it's not quite as
comfortable as the sony MDR 1a that we
reviewed recently it folds flat but
doesn't fold up this is a very likable
sounding headphone it offers very good
clarity but also manages to play harsh
over compressed recordings with a rare
ease bass is plentiful but never crosses
over the line too muddy and finally the
l2 sounds more open and spacious than
most closed back headphones in this
price range as I said earlier there are
several great headphones and around this
price point maybe a little higher a
little lower these include the
sennheiser momentum 2.0 the v-moda m100
nad viso hp50 audio technica ath msr7
and that aforementioned sony MDR 1a to
name a few the Fidelio l2 doesn't
usually get mentioned in the same breath
as those headphones but it probably
should I David Carr Noi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
