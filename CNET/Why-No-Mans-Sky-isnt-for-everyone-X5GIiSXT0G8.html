the most hyped game of our generation
here with me to tell us about it and his
experiences of the first mobile force
hours he's game sports Dave do it hello
give us a little taste it feels like the
hype has sort of become more of this
more the story of this game than the
actual game so when you when you start
at the game when you actually begin
playing what happens what is this game
you it's it's a strange way it doesn't
hold your hand at it at any moment it
kind of just gives you this universe and
says they go we're used to a lot of
games be like okay you need to go here
you need to do this you need to follow
these objectives no man skies more like
this is what you kind of want to do but
you go at your own pace buddy okay you
start the game you're stranded on a
planet and one of the 18 quintillion
planets that this game has you're
stranded you've got to find resources
repair your ship get into space when
you're in space you have to get fuel
hyperdrive stuff and then you can
explore the the wider galaxy all right
but the best part of this game for me at
least is just that like I said it's 18
quintillion planets that that's a lot to
explore and each one has its own star
it's it's own fauna its own flora alien
races I don't know if it's going to be
for everyone though why is that because
it's there's moments that it feels very
grindy it's a lot of menu management
resource management to do some of the
more exciting stuff in the game means
basically walking up to like a cell of
plutonium and holding down like right
trigger to mine it because otherwise you
just straight up and get off the planet
okay so it can break the flow of the
game when you're exploring the galaxy
and then all of a sudden your engines
just like by the way I'm empty you might
just want to just go and stop and pick
up some plutonium and if you're in the
middle of like chasing down pirates or
examining a space station that could you
be like come on man like let me just
explore why is this why is this bishop
not so eco-friendly yeah it should be
powered by like the Sun or yeah I just
us yeah also it seems a bit weird to fly
to a planet that you know you won't be
able to get off unless you can find some
plutonium on it I pretty much every
plutonium every plutonium every planet
will have plutonium
it's there's there's what if it doesn't
Dave well then it was going to be very
lonely on one of those 18 quintillion
planets I think no man's sky is a prime
example of one of those games where
people have kind of built it up into
something that was never actually
promised okay let the hype kind of just
snowballed out of control if you love
exploration games if you love getting
lost in into these worlds and exploring
and resource gathering you're going to
love it if you get love like games like
minecraft or rust okay then you will
really enjoy this game but I just hope
there's not so many people just going in
and expecting instant action and instant
gratification because no man sky does
make you work for it okay let's talk a
little bit about the the hype factor
because you mentioned that this game
isn't sort of living up to the hype but
do you think if it had been released
with no fanfare like for example i'm
thinking minecraft and left to sort of
gather its own sort of popularity in a
slightly more organic fashion do you
think it would be do you think it would
feel more exciting because I mean we've
had we've had years literally years of
hype about this this being a total game
changer yeah and it sounds like it is it
sounds like it's got some really cool
procedures got your amazing ideas to it
yeah but if Sony wasn't heavily involved
it would have been an early access thing
on steam it would have come out in an
alpha and then slowly built up with like
live player feedback which could have
made a completely different game right
but I mean I think we're all slaves to
hype at this point mmm sometimes
sometimes it lives up sometimes it
doesn't we've just got to kind of temper
our expectations and enjoy the game
forward it is rather than what just
random internet forums and videos kind
of hyped up to be no game is going to be
the best thing ever that was good
analysis Dave thank you if you want to
know more about no man's sky you can
find it all on cnet or indeed on
gamespot com
