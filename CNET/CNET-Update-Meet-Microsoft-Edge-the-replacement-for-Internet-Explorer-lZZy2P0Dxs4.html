Internet Explorer I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update it's not easy
being Internet Explorer Microsoft's web
browser has a reputation for being slow
to use and difficult for web designers
and it earned the distinction for being
the most despised browser it couldn't
shake the shame even after making
improvements in performance and design
but now Microsoft is starting fresh for
Windows 10 and leaving ie behind for a
new browser program it's called
Microsoft edge previously codenamed
project Spartan Microsoft officially
revealed that's going to be called edge
and it'll have new features including
add-on extensions
something familiar to users of Firefox
and Chrome it also lets you mark notes
on web pages with a drawing tool and you
can share them as an image with others
the browser integrates with Cortana's
voice commands but will a new name and a
new icon be enough to get people to
switch to edge I mean the icon is pretty
slick it's got this swooshy spike
reminds me of something but I can't
quite put my finger on it
at the Microsoft Developers Conference
the company also showed off more of its
upcoming augmented reality headset
hololens although we still don't know
the price or when exactly you can order
one we got to see more examples of the
holographic interface it projects in
front of your eyes blending virtual
images with the real world in this
living room example different programs
shortcuts are placed around your
environment and you can keep a window
attached to your wall for something like
Skype or a video player if you want to
take the program to another room you
just use a hand gesture and a voice
command to detach it and have it follow
you around we also saw examples of how
this could be used as an educational
tool in this demonstration a hologram
can show the human body in three
dimensions to teach Anatomy separating
individual systems or parts of the body
Microsoft has said hololens will be
available sometime when Windows 10 is
out but it remains to be seen how
limited the release will be Microsoft
has said Windows 10 will be coming out
sometime in the summer and it's
to bid farewell to the controversial app
secret the anonymous messaging app is
shutting down and deleting all data
that's according to the CEO secret has
been out for just over a year and it
raised about thirty five million dollars
in funding it's giving some of that
money back to investors secret allowed
people to post confessions and
conversations about taboo topics but the
app has been criticized for serving as a
platform for gossip trolling and
bullying much like other anonymous apps
like Yik yak and whisper but not all
gossip apps are giving up whisper
announced it hit 10 million users got
