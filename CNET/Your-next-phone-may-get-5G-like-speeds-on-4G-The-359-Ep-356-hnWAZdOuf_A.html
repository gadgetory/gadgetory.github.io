Valentine's Day you're all my Valentines
I'm BVG it's the 359 episode 356 and
here's Alfred Inge and Roger Chang
happy Valentine's Brian you told me I
was your Valentine you're all my
Valentine way to be politically say in
their trade alright so we're gonna be
talking about do watch your chairman yep
we're gonna be talking about Qualcomm's
latest modem and how that's gonna
supercharge your phone's connection
speed your future phone maybe not the
one but you have today but in the near
future and how basically you don't
really need 5g yet we've got four G's
getting pretty fast on its own I will
also be talking about cryptocurrency and
why criminals are in love with it and
lastly we're gonna talk about a magic
leap scoop from our colleague John
salesmen out of the code conference so
without further ado if you have any
questions leave it in the comment
section Brian will pick up the best and
we will get to them in three minutes and
59 seconds from three to welcome to the
359 I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred Eng
can't wait for five Jeep well Qualcomm
may have the next best thing
it just unveiled its X 24 LTE modem and
that's a walkie term for a modem that
promises to gigabits per second of speed
just a frame of reference that's twice
as fast as the fastest possible speed
you can get from home internet service
and would allow you to download a seven
gig Ultra HD Netflix video in 28 seconds
so pretty fast yeah I'm just gonna be
downloading a ton of stuff from Netflix
now because of this I mean realistically
though assuming that I have this modem
but like my provider speed isn't fast
enough like what's the point yeah so
that that's definitely a great point
these are these are theoretical peak
speeds the more realistic speed you'll
get or closer to 200 to 600 Meg's still
very very fast
that's our to be a downer here no no
it's it's an excellent point to bring up
this chip doesn't come out with this
motor doesn't come out around 2019 at
that point the thinking is that the
carriers will upgrade their network so
your your speeds will get significantly
faster I don't know if I'll get up to
speeds everywhere but in select pockets
and they're gonna start rolling out more
broadly it'll actually get that fast 92
gigabits well we're talking 206 I think
the more important question is though
will it get to a speed where I can mine
for crypto currency like efficiently
pretty much yeah
I don't I think I think they should be
selling that up that should be the
surrogate Netflix on that is an
excellent segue to our next piece on
cryptocurrency cryptic currencies like
Bitcoin and why they're so attractive to
criminals
Alfred you wrote you broke down the
story what what is it that's so
appealing yeah criminals criminals love
cryptocurrency the biggest appeal of it
is that it's not tied to your bank
account like we had mentioned on
previous of these podcasts you know
blockchain is essentially decentralized
there's no like bank or anything like
that so it's hard to follow a paper
trail I have read this one story where
essentially in these like divorce cases
a lot of people were putting their money
into like Bitcoin and their
cryptocurrency wallets so that the
lawyers couldn't track it down for like
alimony or anything like that which is
insane but yeah I mean that happens in a
lot of like cybercrime too so like a lot
of these drugs that people are buying
online or a lot of malware that people
are buying online all of that has to do
like you have to pay for that in some
way and a lot of them they do it with
cryptocurrency so that's like
essentially been like their way of
moving around there's and now bitcoin is
like two popular criminals right yeah
essentially you know with Bitcoin it's
not it's not as simple as like I give
you money here you have it kind of thing
like immediacy thing it takes a bit of
processing time that's why there's all
these miners out there and because
bitcoin is so popular it's gotten to the
point where like some days you'll have
to wait like four days to get your money
and if you're a criminal like that's a
lot of time wait and essentially you
know sometimes people will do these
scams where like I send you the money
but because it takes four days you ship
me the product and I already retract it
back to my wallet before it like gets to
you so people are like really concerned
about that - all right plenty of risk
lastly we want to talk about this scoop
from Jones salesmen out of the code
conference magic leap it's a startup you
may not have heard of but really buzzy
companies like Google and Qualcomm
invest in it it's got this crazy mixed
reality headset
no one's really tried yet but everyone
seems to be super excited about
they told Joan exclusively that they are
working to partner with a major telco
later this year that's that's
significant because they're about to
launch the first headset but they're
already talking about how a subsequent
generations are hinting at least the
subsequent generations might have a
cellular connections you can go out on
your own I really want to see what magic
leap has to offer and I think it
partnering for major telcos like a great
move because you know it gets a lot of
eyes on it yep but at the same time it's
just like this feels like the Duke Nukem
Forever of like VR there's like they've
partnered with like they had Shaquille
O'Neal at the code conference like
wearing their sad they have like Beyonce
use it and all this stuff but it's just
like what do they actually do yes
there's no we haven't really seen a real
product I mean there have been some
minor testing and there's some select
individuals have tried it but yeah I'm
really gonna see what happens with it so
for those stories and more check us out
at sea net from Roger Chang I'm Afra
dang thanks for listening and it's time
to go and ahead and jump back into the
chat I'm gonna dig out some good
questions and comments in the meantime
you can talk amongst yourselves
I like your Duke Nukem analogy I thought
that was deadly it's gonna get to a
point where like there's all this hype
for it and when it actually comes out
it's like it's just I know and then like
the vision he laid out was amazing like
the idea that this partnership with the
NBA like eventually you wear these
headsets and you'll be able to see if
this miniaturize stadium with players
running around you'll see 7 virtual
screens around you showing the action on
different displays different camera
angles holographic projections there was
all this stuff and he's like yeah this
will happen in two years happened five
years but like yeah we haven't seen an
actual there are the only people that
are the only company that I've seen that
could get momentum from Beyonce and not
go anywhere with it you know what
there's still there's plenty of hype and
there's a lot of big important backers
behind it yeah that's the thing so
that's why people don't you can't really
write it off because it's just there are
a lot of people invested yeah maybe I'm
just very cynical that well you are a
cynical person this is true this is true
this is why I am great in the tech world
well look it's and I do think it's a
it's a good step in the right direction
if they do
cement a deal with a major telco that
usually implies they've got an
actual product that there yeah sell
that's that you know the telcos aren't
just gonna sign a deal for them for
nothing you know for just vaporware so
hopefully that means we'll get to see
them soon they're they're already
talking about magically one will be will
be coming out later this year they said
it's gonna be the price of a of a
premium computer this is a stand-alone
headset yeah yeah I know I know
I know you the thing is the cheap alfred
like the price of a premium computer
would definitely change by the time it
comes out - oh that's that's a good
point I don't know I like that I imagine
Sagi has thrown us a good analogy for
the the hype train is all I could think
of his IT 2.0 where they were so much
high for the segue before we knew what
it was right was the nickname for it
what do you mean way
the SCOOTER yeah I thought it was always
just called segue no no no I before we
knew what it was oh I have no idea I
don't recall there was a they all have
like manufacturing names like the
Gamecube was the dolphin and right right
right they're just trying to hide the
hype I guess there's just like in
production mode yes Matthew catcher is
kicking us off with a batch with our
first great question any speculation on
how much the carriers will charge for 5
g 4 5 g or more more it'll be more well
here's a sad thing like it is actually
gonna be cheaper for them to deliver
services to you but at least one carrier
does or to go on the record and said
that they see 5g as an opportunity to
raise prices
jerax yeah to be fair they have the
lowest prices in the industry and
they've been really aggressive in trying
to get people to come how much how much
was the price jump going from like 3G to
LTE when like that was available that's
a great question because I thought I was
under the impression as a person that's
never paid a phone bill I was under the
impression that the price stayed the
same because it's a rough name I mean
what happened was when LTE became
probably available I think like everyone
had it but that were plans started
changing right that was still around the
shift
you couldn't have unlimited data yeah
going away from a lid so you know there
was definitely that kind of
that dynamically so I don't know we'll
see if the other carriers you know
follow suit at least Brett has said that
you know they kind of see it as an
opportunity so race yeah so we always
use like downloading a Netflix movie as
like a metric for a leg yeah this speed
right so you're saying with this you'd
be or with 5g you can get like a gig
movie like an hour-long movie in what
like two seconds seconds okay how fast
is a right now and lt like really what
depends on the movie right like yeah the
example I gave was a seven gig Ultra HD
okay the super highest possible movie I
mean that could take every type every
time like we bring up this scenario with
like five G I'm just thinking like what
kind of maniac is out there just like
I'm getting this and I'm getting this
well let me the thing we're just like
and I don't know if it would actually
work theoretically is like Alfred
they're called Millennials well you
could use your phone as a theoretical
hotspot yeah could power that's like the
better scenario for me not right I mean
it's just easier to paint yeah we use
these examples to kind of paint the
picture of how fast five used yeah I
don't think anyone's like going out here
downloading everything of Netflix I mean
I think the example I gave for a long
time was like downloading the entire
catalog of The Simpsons show in like
half an hour yeah I mean that's kind of
saying yeah but it gives you a good
picture of how fast it yeah not that
you're necessarily going to download or
series but you know it's good yeah show
how fast it goes let's talk about 5g
versus 4G elephant in the moon
Scott Maya is a man after my own heart
with the curmudgeon II questions at hand
I love it surely the network should
concentrate on for 4G full coverage
before working on 5g yes that is an
excellent point I think what in all
missing in all the hype about 5g is
these carriers are still going to
continue to invest in 4G and LTE in
particular that's why you have
announcements like this X 24 motive this
is an LTE modem out of 5g mode ok good
clearance so this really shows that
carriers the chip makers everyone is
still invested in 4G there's you know I
think he Mobile CTO just said that
they're gonna be investing in LTE to the
next decade yeah but if your modem is
like even if your modems really fast if
I'm in a rural region that doesn't get
it
what's your point I think that kind of
what his question is though you know
like how about expanding this network to
everywhere so that and that is happening
some of the carriers are doing t-mobile
has invested in expanding coverage I
mean David notoriously were really good
in big cities not so much elsewhere you
know they've they've acquired spectrum
they've got this what's known as a 600
megahertz spectrum that is a lot wider
coverage so they're promising a lot
better coverage in areas where they
traditionally haven't had coverage so
those are new areas the carriers are
still investing in improving current
coverage but right now there's a lot of
excitement over 5g which is why we keep
talking about it question from jeffer do
you think that once 5g hits mainstream
they'll just give out free phones to
everybody
no let go okay he references how kind of
like Amazon did with the cheap tablets
how it tons and tons of ads and them
just for the sake of the data collection
uh I mean I imagine some companies
potentially doing that you're never
gonna get a free iPhone from Apple yes
like I on the side there might be really
millennial we've we've been doing this
show for almost two years oh my god that
just happened this time talking about 5g
guys were like stop talking about 4G 5g
damn it anyways back to the question at
hand I forgot the question was the
question was about free phones giving
away free phones we know Apple's never
about other capitals never gonna do it I
mean there's an argument that you can
make for Amazon potentially doing this
although they've gotten burned no pun
intended by the fire phone so maybe
they're a little gun-shy from going back
into the handset business you can see
companies doing I mean Amazon was
offering those Amazon exclusive phones
from the likes of if they if they did
they were discounted but they had ads
yeah so that what does that right off
Amazon right if they did do it I would
be like budget phones like the Moto G
yes people are especially people who are
buying iPhone 10 are not gonna want an
iPhone with they're not they're not
gonna yeah they're not gonna give away a
phone like a premium like
thousand-dollar phone for something that
they know people are gonna buy anyway
just for my sake of like collecting ads
there's early 5g phones are gonna be
expensive in walkie that's it's not if
they're gonna do it'll be with a 4G
phone like a cheap cheap 40 phone you
know what I miss when you could upgrade
to the free baseline model without
actually having to invest anything like
when you're when you're oh yeah they
always had the free phone always that's
what I always did right and you can't do
that anymore
really the good old days was like every
year like every two years at least not
from me on a GT well the thing of it is
is your service price technically could
be cheaper though like they change the
dynamics around but you can find a way
to save money you'll have a crappier you
have a crappy old phone but like I just
missed the lazy exchange right yeah that
one grand but that that wasn't that was
a time with like really feature phones
it wasn't really all about smart phones
you didn't have a good baseline
smartphone you could trade up to no but
I would gladly get last year's model
because it would yeah yeah yeah you know
anyways welcome to the show Jules catch
up first time kitchen a live show nice
to have you
you know a dog asks I never get tired of
saying that what would be the latency of
a 5g network ooh that is an excellent
question they're promising a latency of
I believe 0.2 milliseconds and I I don't
know what the LTE lane C is but it's a
lot more it's like 10 milliseconds I
mean basically it's a pretty large
difference it's almost they're saying
it's near real-time which you know seems
like it's obvious but our networks now
aren't real time at all there's a huge
lag between you know when you you click
the bun on your phone and it goes to the
network and you know ask for a website
and it comes back so with with 5g the
latency so low that theoretically like
as soon as you hit a bun on or hit you
know clicking a link for a website like
it'll pop up immediately you think that
with something like that that you know
online gaming would be really changed
like mmm O's that are like actually
mobile like I can play World of Warcraft
like yes out here
zero lag you have interesting I mean the
bigger thing with latency is I mean the
big example always give it a
self-driving cars right but absolutely
need to have real-time awareness of
everything around it
five g's that's why found five GS or the
foundation forget about the cars man
about gaming chart play pokemon alright
i'm my phone alright all these billions
of dollars getting invested so Alfred
can get his Pokemon on question from
Josh Boyd uh when carrier switched to 5g
will LTE become like 3G in rural areas
no I mean LTE for a long time I mean
it's that when it's not like when
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T switches on the five you
know or if they switch off the LT know
that that thing's gonna be running for a
while I guess the analogy is somewhat it
will be somewhat more accurate as 5g
starts mature thing 3G or LTE gets kind
of pushed to the background it becomes
more of a foundational network but
that's gonna be a while for a while
those who are going to coexist and has
to you because like 5g the way it's
structured sometimes the range isn't
that great so you'll need LTE is that
kind of baseline connection for a long
time sure absolutely
imagine soggy when will the fun limited
5g actually come to fruition
ooh I mean we've got really
we have technically unlimited plans now
so I wouldn't surprise me if they start
things off with the limit plans and then
see where it goes a lot of is we're not
sure what kind of applications are gonna
be running on 5g to take up the kind of
traffic that you know LT kind of let's
deal with now so I'd imagine like right
off the bat you'll see unlimited plans
on 5g I mean it's it's a lot cheaper for
the carrier's to deliver that that
service to you so maybe I'm just being
idealistic but I'm hoping for unlimited
right off the bat and who do you think
is going to be testing this like the
petri dish for this first like what
country is going to get it first the
answer Aki's question oh I mean I think
Korea hasn't now they have an early
version of 5g in like very very limited
basically for the Olympics like oh
that's only for the Olympics it's like
super limited to like hey give me a
phone call or whatever or 5g
I think Korea Japan and the US are sort
of the ones leading the way with 5g and
you'll see some version of 5g later this
year with Verizon as it sort of a hombre
band replacement and 18t says it's going
to launch
five G as a mobile service in 12 markets
layer this year hmm alright a couple
more before we call it a day
Scott Myatt do you think mobile networks
will ever replace hardwired Wi-Fi whoo I
I kind of hope so
I have my doubts and I'm concerned that
is the promise of 5g that I'll
theoretically make Wi-Fi less critical
in your home because it's just she--but
goodness it's fast it's cheap to provide
and it's more secure yeah but I mean
that's gonna take a while
5g networks it's gonna take years for
this thing to build out and be like
broadly available so I wouldn't hold my
breath that we'd lose quite fine time
soon and then in terms of like an actual
physical broadband connection we're
gonna need that for a little while - do
you think that's gonna result in who was
that they were experimenting with Wi-Fi
with like blimps right in South America
with like this like giant plane to
record a key it wasn't Wi-Fi though
they're broadcasting cell signals yeah
sounds like sorry yeah they're basically
like a portable mini cell tower yeah
yeah how do you think that's gonna be
like the the future of the the landscape
of drones everywhere broadcasting a
little like in Batman there's just
blimps floating through the city oh yeah
kind of gnarly and gothic what a
terrible doctor yeah that's kind of grim
just like only because these blimps
would and they don't have to put cameras
and everything because there's always a
camera watching from the sky like the
blimps wouldn't be like coaster in
Batman though like like dreary and like
dark and stuff it'd just be like these
blimps I like sponsored by Google like
this in your sky all the time you'd know
it wouldn't be darkness and I would be
like very colourful because all the
blimps are colorful I think that would
be an efficient way to get a lot of
birds with one stone
you know that's ad space up there yeah
brother I in the sky watching every move
you make it's like a Goodyear blimp
except the only message it's like Wi-Fi
the Wi-Fi password is like a dog has
kind of a branching question off of this
do you think ISP will stop supporting
hardline Internet oh that's a really
good question
I don't know I feel like there's there's
a dependability to hardline connections
that just makes it kind of indispensable
Wireless can get knocked out pretty
easily right so yeah I don't see a
reason for them to stop supporting it
the only reason is that it's expensive
mm-hmm it's harder and more expensive
requires more people to maintain a
physical network and like in terms of
building out new networks that's really
tough right it's like digging up you
know sidewalks and putting in cables
that's it that's hard that's why these
companies are really looking to to
wireless I mean Google basically with
the Google Fiber right they've kind of
like completely stopped trying to build
out physical networks and like investing
in mostly Wi-Fi so wireless stuff yeah
right a couple to change things up
before we call today jiff er do you
think more companies like the big three
will lock down all phones like Verizon
just did I see all those phones being
the same they do the same thing they
think care carriers are going to stop
secondhand sales altogether uh I mean
look the truth is on their minds now the
other carriers already lock their phones
and they already have waiting periods
what Verizon's did basically and you
know you could argue that they're
they're reneging on their commitment to
keeping phones unlocked they're arguing
that they're doing this to combat
thievery
Verizon's basically joined the ranks and
putting in a policy that's consistent
with what the rest of the industry is
doing so I I don't see the other and the
other companies looking to like push
that even further right I think it's
more Verizon just sort of getting in
line with everyone else even though it's
a bit of a controversial move I've you
know I've noticed like the folks like at
t-mobile that like the other carriers
have been pretty quiet about this whole
thing so I know I think they've seen the
reaction to the move by consumers and
they just don't want to be part of this
right okay one more before the end of
the show dacher asks when will Bitcoin
mining collapse a national power grid
all right Alfred well it has me all
focused in one area and the thing about
it is it's you know I think if everyone
were mining within like one neighborhood
in like New York or something I thought
it would probably that would probably
yeah what wasn't I read somewhere that
like Iceland Iceland crypto mining is so
popular like they're gonna run out of
power yeah yeah yeah I saw that article
I think I think it was from The
Washington Post
yeah this is about you know it takes up
a lot of energy imagine like your
computer running at like it's full
processor like all the time instantly
yeah and you know people I like very
expensive computers for this that's why
a lot of people don't mind on their own
because like if they because the money
that you make from it will eventually
end up like costing you more like your
hardware yeah your electric bill will
cost you more than the money then yeah
you make like all of cryptocurrency like
all these like mining machines like take
up the entire energy of like the nation
of Singapore right which is that said
yeah I think in Steven Jenkins article
it talks about how it could power like
thousands of homes in a day like if they
did that instead but the thing is it's
like spread out or across the world so
it's not like all these machines are
like hammering down on one network
unless maybe Iceland has like a lot of
miners there or someone yeah I guess
it's like geographically huddled
together that's why a lot of companies
are not a lot of companies sorry a lot
of like cryptocurrency miners are
actually using like botnets they're
using like other people's machines that
they've like because it's easier yeah
they they essentially like install
malware on stuff and botnets used to be
used for like DDoS attacks which would
like take down a website but now it's
just like why are we gonna do that we
can just mined for that money and
there's a cool term for it right
crypto Jackie I love it someone was paid
a lot of money for the Brendan yeah
crypto jacking just sounds pretty cool I
read about this research
two days ago called it's it's drive-by
crypto jacking where I mean this comes
from like a another like security term
called war driving where you drive
around with like a Wi-Fi network on you
and you try to get people to
automatically connect to it right but in
this scenario when you automatically
connect to it it like loads up software
it loads up this screen that's like a
capture screen that's basically like
enter this code to prove you're not a
bot right if you want to connect to our
Wi-Fi and people just enter the code in
but every second then you're not
entering
the code your processor on your phone is
being used is like at like it's max
percentage I have this lightning for
them I have this terrible image in my
head of like somebody dressed up like
the the Hamburglar running around with
like a 5g hotspot a big battery and like
a barcode scanner that you see next door
just sneaking up the people and like
their wallets
just I have your crypto crypto Jack is
actually my new space pirate names I was
like it this needs to be like a Sunday
morning comic or some like that the
crypto checker by the way if you all
learn more about crypto jacking bridge
carey has a great video that's in Alfred
story yes that just went up today as
always the links are going to make a
fantastic parody of an infomercial very
entertaining and educational at the same
time which you know that tries to I
helped there you go Brian yes Brian did
you had a you played a critical role in
the video hold camera yeah yeah no oh
yeah that was fun I just hope I hear me
out for a second I have another image
running through my head my imaginations
on fire today so we're talking about
collapsing the National Grid and like
the collaboration and aggregation of all
of the the crypto jackers into one place
imagine if they pooled their
cryptocurrency but an island off out
someone actually opened well and then
they get the they they self fund a data
blimp right and then they set up a solar
farm and they say and then they they
itself it becomes its own like nation
state and then like the world collapses
