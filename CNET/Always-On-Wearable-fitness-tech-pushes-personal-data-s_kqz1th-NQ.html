surprise hit of CES at its most basic
happy fork is a tool to help you eat
more slowly the demo fork that we have
here has been pre-programmed on a
10-second interval and it basically
means that if I'm putting food in my
mouth under 10 seconds it will vibrate
as you can see here I've just activated
the lightest one Brent and I had a
vibration so basically you'll be having
this on your tongue and going okay oops
20 and 20 zoot suits you can I try as
I've been less than 10 oh yeah we've got
the Fitbit flex that flex is a
risk-based device it does activity
tracking steps distance calories it is
super super comfortable and lightweight
it's got 5 LEDs on it so if you tap it
and actually tells you your progress
against your goal but what's also
important about it is it that uses
Bluetooth 40 so it wirelessly syncs in
the background to smartphones it is a
band you wear like a watch it does tell
the time as well the date but you can
also do quick things like check your
heart rate as you see here check your
calories burned on that day as well as
check your steps right here on the watch
right a huge trend at 2013 CES this year
is this idea of the quantified self
basically wearable gadgets and apps that
can give you more information about how
you behave what you do and how you can
make yourself better so for example I'm
wearing this spree headband which
attracts my heart rate my motion and my
body heat so that I can get more
information about what happens when I
exercise or when I just like walk around
looking kind of
let's talk a little bit about this data
gathering trend and this idea of sort of
the quantified self that's always been
kind of I think the big appeal a Fitbit
that you could gather so much
information about yourself where do you
see that trend going well so we think
it's really about learning insights and
being able to understand our behavior
what you do on a day-to-day basis and
how it affects your help so the data is
really important but even more
importantly is what is how does that
matter what does it really mean well I
think for some people the data itself is
very compelling I think for most people
though it does need to be aggregated in
a way and delivered in a way that's
really actionable so lots of numbers
it's exciting at first but unless you
can do something with it that day in and
day out for the long term it's not going
to be as successful so for us we've
really focused on these things like
hobbits where you take all that data and
make it bring it to people in a way that
they can do something with it obviously
you can't change a you know a lifelong
learned habit of eating habit overnight
when I asking that but very slowly and
progressively to really reprogram that
habits so that you can eat more
healthily and wearable tech is starting
to take all forums including more subtle
options like this patch for those people
who don't have to always go around be
like I'm quantifying myself I like it I
like the pad so it's a multi-sensor
product just like our other products
that people use today it has three axes
of motion as skin temperature rate of
heat coming off the body conductivity
skin munch all that together and create
these really accurate algorithms around
calories burns physical activity minutes
of physical activity steps sleep
patterns that you have and people
generally use that for you know use our
products today for weight loss but also
diabetes management sleep management
bunch of different kinds of conditions
having that feedback or having that
dashboard about me allows me to make
proactive change and and change behavior
no probably a lot in the longitudinal
longer certain way and we see that we
see that in the journeys that our
consumers use every day
so I have a pretty important question
about the fork though was the dishwasher
compatible yes it is so I'm saved that
was my big banner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
