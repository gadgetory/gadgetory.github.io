Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update amazon is many things the
e-commerce giant is a tech manufacturer
a grocery store a digital music
marketplace a video streaming service
maker of robots and flying drones a
directory for repair services a credit
card transaction processor and now we
can add two more specialties to the list
diaper maker and restaurant delivery
service amazon is selling its own
private label for diapers and baby wipes
called amazon elements it's only for
prime subscribers and with the bundle of
diapers delivered to your home amazon
also puts emphasis on the ethical
ingredients of the products you see when
you scan a code with the amazon app it
tells you the factory it came from and
that it was made from daisies or
something like that if you're an Amazon
mom member you can get the diapers for
even cheaper than Prime members but
diapers could be just the beginning the
elements brand is said to be a line of
premium everyday essentials amazon
elements is going after the business
model of honest calm which sells baby
products but it's also going after
grubhub and seamless with a new
restaurant takeout and delivery service
you can browse restaurants and place
online food orders within amazon local
the service is only available in Seattle
for now so what's next some reports say
Amazon's working on a travel and hotel
booking site it's only a matter of time
before Amazon builds its own vacation
resort Amazon's not the only tech
company expanding into kitty products
google plans to create kid friendly
websites and software specifically for
kids ages 12 and under the VP of
engineering for this project talked
about it with USA Today she didn't give
specific examples but it's likely Google
may create kid-friendly search engines
YouTube or even a Chrome browser it's
not easy making sites for kids when
there are laws to limit websites from
collecting data on young users Disney is
also expanding tech for kids it just
announced a new line of Education apps
for kids ages
28 these imagic adam ii apps teach math
science are reading and social skills
and they have companion apps for parents
a grown-up can follow what their kids
are doing on the learning game from
their own separate smartphone the first
app is mickey's magical math world
coming out next week on December 11th
and it's free without ads but extra
activities on the app costs five dollars
a piece personally I prefer donald in
mathmagic land but that was a time long
before apps that's your tech news update
and you could always find more at cnet
com and be sure to follow along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
