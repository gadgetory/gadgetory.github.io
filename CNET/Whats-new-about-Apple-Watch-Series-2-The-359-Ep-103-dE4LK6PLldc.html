the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap you want to throw in I'm
Roger Jen I'm Ben Fox Rubin so today
we're all about the Apple watch you know
it wasn't just iphone 7 yesterday apple
also induce a new version of its
wearable and its initiative tactic they
took for yesterday they you know when
they first introduced the Apple watch is
all about it being a fashion piece
jewelry realized here last year this
year totally different tone right it was
all about sports is not running is not
swimming about being active miss focus
apple watch will save your life yeah
they're sizzle reel was all about you
being in the pool with it and like
sweating while you're running right
Apple watch is like sweat all over it
that's that bells a new trend its
fitness not fashion Department of Nike
to create a version of the Apple watch
the Apple watch Nike Plus which which
really looks like the spiritual
successor of the field band right so
what you think about that what does that
mean that that sort of Apple shifted
gears have been sort of change the
entire conversation around the Apple
watch too okay more more of a fitness
tracker I personally am not in the
market for any sort of Apple watch or a
watch in general however it seems like
they've been paying attention to how the
market has been going fitted is the
biggest wearable so yep it makes sense
to at least be a fast follower when it
comes to that kind of thing they've also
dropped some of the what is it like the
gold Apple watch yes that's cause I
gotta wait so they're not doing the
luxury thing I'm gone is the 17 thousand
dollar gold apple watch edition yeah
which by the way I did get to wear in
the store when it first came out yeah it
looked like any other animals your arm
sparkle after I guess so it was gold you
know like they had like such a residual
effect no no but they you know they were
like blocking me from running away they
didn't trust you at all make sure like
yeah this guy's thing yeah so no it's
just you know the some of the
improvements are our improvements that
really athletes which we appreciate it
is they call it swim resistance really
just it's waterproof or water resistant
more so than even the phone like you can
actually swim with this thing okay
there's even sort of a swim or a
mode on the thing it actually calculates
sure you never tell you it looks a
little too precious to swim with I don't
know that I would really be I personally
would be more interested in using a
cheaper devices like 300 plus dollars
yeah so you could accidentally bump it
up against the wall or I don't know lose
it in the pool I'm not really Apple
Apple would say that's fine just buy
another one just ok that's ok right you
know and the other thing that I think
runners would love built-in GPS why is
that important I have stopped right
along tracking you if you're serious
runner clear no no I know what the route
is you want to know how far how long you
ran and can sort of calculate on a map
like what that what that trail so that's
the thing that my obnoxious friends are
posting on Facebook all the time yes
absolutely I run this man I don't be
able to do it even easier with the
epilogue I love that I'm so excited it's
one of those is why garment you know
carmen was navigation company like
they're still doing really well as a
wearable company so their garment
watches are still really popular because
of GPS it's really the only reason why
they're there they're so relevant so
it's important to note that the Apple
watch is still such a small piece of app
Apple's business that I don't break it
out in their financials so do you think
that getting two series 2 is going to
help at least boost the sales a little
bit I don't know it's I think it's
definitely more of an interesting
product for for athletes you know
they're going to where the market is as
you said and people understand what
fitness tracker is for they don't quite
understand what smart watches for so it
might help them but they still have a
long way to go you know there they are
the top smart watch maker but they're
like the top of a very very small market
right exactly and they say that they're
the top the second biggest watchmaker
also right back yes rolex but again it's
a small market it's but they're not the
biggest wearable guys so they didn't say
that all right from more about the Apple
watch check us out on seen it I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks for
listening
