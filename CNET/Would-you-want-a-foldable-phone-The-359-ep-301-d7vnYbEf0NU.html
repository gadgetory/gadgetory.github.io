it is episode three hundred and one of
the 359 podcast you know me I'm BB G and
today it's the dream team the OGS the
Ben Fox Rubin end the Reggie Chang yeah
hi I was rolling with did you is that is
that like your new thing I really like
that you know me the BG I don't know
that's that's pretty sweet like it it's
true it does ring yes
it's very beachy I definitely like your
hype man intros and then we
intentionally awkwardly were a No so
that was sort of how this podcast
started right - awkward guys talk about
Wow
anyway today we're going to be talking
about foldable bendable expandable
phones boasting foldable phones one from
CTE that just got announced earlier this
week and also the future of shopping and
commerce how do I end up spending all
your money of retailers sometime in the
future including a IVR chat BOTS all
that good stuff it was true it was such
an awesome story I didn't read it so I
need to get all my info from you thank
you yeah well that's what the podcast
vodka I learned something new every day
on the pod for the record we don't
actually socialize with each other in
the office they actually have to put us
in front of cameras trying to talk oh
yeah very weird yeah so as always
sending your questions and comments BBG
we'll get to as many of them as you can
at the end of the show without further
ado let's get to the podcast in three
two welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm Roger Cham so this Chinese phone
maker ZTE introduced a new phone called
the axe on em which has two displays
that can be folded out into one bigger
display yep Roger you wrote about this I
know I get it phones are really kind of
boring now they're all fairly similar
but is this really the solution
uh no not necessarily I think this is a
good first generation attempt I do
appreciate the fact that it's different
you know in a sea of slabs where it's
just plastic metal glass all they all
kind of look alike this is at least a
different phone
yeah I guess so look uh it looks like
you appreciate like an indie film that
you'll never watch right in the same so
I think it's it is significant in a
different way I don't think it's
necessarily gonna be a blockbuster phone
I don't know how many people gonna buy
it but what it does do is hint at the
future affordable phones that we've been
talking about the idea of these phones
that wrap around a wrist or screens that
bend around that can fold over each
other or that could even like be
expanded like they stretch out you could
basically have a yeah exactly - exactly
which think we're a little further away
from that but the bendable thing is
totally truce is toi legit Samsung said
it wants to build a bendable or foldable
phone by next year I mean they're saying
they're kind of hedging a little I'm
saying that it may not actually happen
you know depends on there's a lot of
technical issues with that but that's
what they're shooting for and I think
the fact that ZT came out today with
this phone or yesterday with this phone
hopefully and my my hope is it
jump-starts the rest of the industry
started thinking about it or gets them
the light little fire who starts
thinking about this new move because I
do think foldable phones could be sort
of the solution to this phone fatigue
we're having okay
but one of the other trends that we were
really looking at for a while were mods
and that didn't really take off you
mentioned in one of the stories in a
story you wrote today about how the
Amazon fire phone also tried to be a
little bit different and also completely
failed so is it really a smart move to
try to get away from that tried-and-true
concept I mean yes and no I think for
coming like ZTE they have little to lose
here one thing they're all fairly low
price real low profile company you've
probably never heard of it heard of ZT
and we're talking about them now so
there you go so they're mostly known for
making budget phones they've created
this foldable phone to create a little
buzz and they've got 18t backing them in
a big way so it's for them again I have
a lot to lose and they are they're
introducing a new concept that hopefully
others pick up this baton and keep
running and and really kind of push this
forward in a meaningful way also we
wanted to get to another story Amazon
isn't the only company dreaming up the
future of shopping
at a conference this week Walmart's head
of US ecommerce offered a handful of
futuristic concepts he mentioned having
a conversation with your voice assistant
like Siri or Amazon Alexa or Google
assistant to figure out what TV to buy
now granted that would probably put a
lot of the reviewers that work for C net
out of business but like the concept of
like a Jarvis style Alexa or something
yeah it sounds really sexy and
interesting but I think we're quite a
few years away from yeah I don't think
the AI is intelligent enough to really
kind of get through the nuance
some of your questions especially if
they're you have like unusual
circumstances right like maybe you're
the living room is in a weird position
right but you want a really specific TV
or specific specs I worked in the VR
aspect to be able to shop remotely and
and how VR might change a shopping
experience because if it can replace the
experience of me going to Costco and
fighting the crowds on a Saturday or
Sunday like I would be all for that I
pay up for that but one of the things
that he also talked about with VR
shopping is is that you would look for
an item in its natural environment so as
a for instance if you're shopping around
for a tent you put on a VR headset and
instantly you're transported to a
campsite your voice assistant would be
integrated into that where you could
literally ask your voice assistant any
question about this specific tent and it
would be able to answer like you live in
and swap in different tents like maybe
yeah definitely you could go in it you
could walk around it so those are some
of the interesting concepts that he was
talking about that are granted more
futuristic but it you know maybe that is
a future of how we're gonna shop and
what commerce is going to look like
anyway if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Robert rain thanks for
listening
good show that's all we're done
informative show weird I know where were
these that's right geez we started
really slow and we really picked it out
when things got hot and the the the
timer was going off right yeah and now
we just kind of tuned everybody out what
questions you know I should so like the
shopping and commerce stuff especially
is like that's that's my life right now
like that's what I write about so any
questions about that I'm obviously like
very interested in but on top of that I
used to cover component makers so the
the I also wrote about this concept of
like foldable stretchable displays and I
totally agree with you that this could
very well be the thing that shakes us
out a phone fatigue and significantly
changes the way for gonna look if you
take a look at that concept video that
stems I put up a couple years ago
granted it was in 2013 yeah exactly this
was again a concept video not natural
product it was amazing right like it was
phone on the outside you fold it out
there's a bigger screen in the inside
well that's that's crazy it was like it
was like mystery actual phone wallet
exactly yeah yeah but if that if there
was an extra screen on top of one side
that billfold alright so that's three I
mean that I think that was that answer
the biggest issue that Brian had with
the axe on em where the two screens are
on the outside and they they flip up to
create like a bigger screen but that
bottom screen is maybe prone to
scratches or dents or maybe maybe a grog
last five is super strong that's what
Corning tells it's the contagion
fried-chicken DoubleDown a phone like
it's it's also it's not a seamless
display there's no like that black bar
they've done a good job so there was a
phone that looked like this before the
Kyocera echo it had a huge border around
it so when they folded up as a single
screen that was really thick black
border there - zj's credit they made a
little bit smaller but it is still there
just not a full seamless experience when
you had that combined screen you know
the the more useful scenario that they
gave me was two screens right like male
on one email on one watching video like
this yeah you're holding like this
Oh male and then you're
multitasking with it and your multitask
and your basically you're watching a
video or you're watching YouTube on the
top screen you're commenting on the
second screen or you're instagramming on
the second screen you're doing different
things
yeah because one of the things that we
really need to do is be more sucked into
our phones by doing even yeah and
actually I'm guilty of what some
stacking I I use my phone while watching
my TV right could you imagine watch your
TV and then watching another video and
then texting or emailing right once
three now on three screens well and then
you throw in an AR headset and bingo
you're in the future there you go yeah I
think that may have happened in Back to
the Future actually so way to go Marty
McFly jr. you predicted all of this now
just get us that friggin hoverboard
right Oh
bored one that doesn't explode alright
question time first of all there's more
than a few people in the chat pointing
out there's not really bending or
folding the rack to screen it is yes but
it is a phone that technically folds
it's not the screen that falls but the
device is selling action yes and to my
point like I feel like this is a hint or
suggestion to where we actually will go
and I think that's where we want to be
is with actual legit foldable phones
we're not there yet the technology is
not quite ready yet but you know big
companies like Samsung are working on it
so right that gives me some hope and and
a big hurdle to this is the fact that
all the other aspects of the phone also
need to be unbend enfold like LG and
samsung i think have done a much better
job figuring out how to bend and fold
the display yep but you have to figure
out how to brighten the battery
chips circuitry all that other stuff I
mean it's doable it's definitely
possible but I mean lenovo showed off a
concept of c+ a year ago at their tech
some in SF where the phone actually
wrapped around your wrist and it was a
working phone I mean it's a working
prototype but you can do it that sounds
cumbersome though at the size it would
have to be to be a functioning phone the
width that would need to be just sounds
bulky on my wrist well yeah I mean I
think the example of going around your
wrist is more like showing how it can
bend
less about like this is this is the way
you're gonna have you this is your new
SmartWatch that's a giant thing around
your wrist there's more like check it
out it can actually bend around your
wrist by seizing that's that cuz yeah
that's awkward right all right the -
asks how much how medic an you get can
you have multiple apps on multiple
screens uh that's a great question I
didn't ask about that I know there were
multiple apps you're fired
sorry is in more than one app per screen
like like four apps running yeah I mean
every phone multitask but it's an
interesting thought if you do two things
at but as far as I can tell it was one
app per screen got it yeah wondering I'm
like I don't know could you really would
you really well I'm thinking about like
what the kind of heavy lift thing I do
on a desktop where I'm multitasking kind
of situation would I do that and my from
my pocket know like I'm I guess you know
no I take it back if I was to do
something like to take a video we're
working on and have it playing back and
doing like timecode notes on - that'd be
kind of handy actually especially with
the stylus - yeah like I could see - -
is very I think it's a very easy concept
understand like writing email on one
maybe having been watching a video on
the other yeah or even having my two
emails was like sure reply email the old
email you're referencing mine those all
make sense - I think we would all
readily admit though that ZTE
is not the one that's really gonna push
this whole thing forward once samsung
comes out with something like this
whether it is truly a foldable display
or not then people are really gonna
start paying attacks
I don't think Samsung should come out
with anything unless they've got like a
full legit foldable screen like the
hinge thing is a knight like I said it's
a nice hint what we're gonna get but I
mean Samsung would correctly embarrass
themselves if they came out with like a
hinge phone and I don't think they would
right that's not that's not what they've
been talking about and that's certainly
not what they promised with that exact
sizzle reel back in four years ago yeah
shut up everybody pointing out how
Westworld did it first what Simmons
probably still did at first Simpsons
yeah yeah now there's just a few people
in the chat bringing up how West world
had like a folding full of kind of fun I
mean yeah but what's wrong was like last
year talking about this for like a
couple years now and not only that
that's baking a part also it's called
audience building no it has been in
sci-fi novels for course and I would say
like yeah I would've bet they've got it
somewhere some future episode definitely
yeah all right so we've talked about ZTE
we've talked about axon axon axon acts
off okay very fine we have talked about
the potential for Samsung and Anirudh
asks do you think any other major OEMs
will follow suit from this who else is
going to Humble down the the foldable LG
could do it all LG definitely do it
lenovo has showed off concept products
so they could definitely do it
and then Samsung has I think Samsung's
the only one who's basically publicly
committed to making something next year
it's so it sounds to me like it's a lot
of the folks that are in the component
supply business like they they control
those factories and therefore are able
to yes it did help it helps that LG
makes the screens that Bend and also has
a separate unit that makes the battery
and all these different components so so
don't expect this in an iPhone anytime
soon oh no you're looking for that kind
of like those kinds of groundbreaking
innovations even if they don't aren't
successful you're not getting it from an
iPhone you're getting it from these
different devices right we mentioned the
fire phone with all those front-facing
cameras that was innovative it just
wasn't a popular phone let's fly through
just a couple more all right
Danny Green says Danny Green bendable
foldable this has to shorten the
lifespan how long do we expect these to
live and to branch off from that Matthew
- our again what cases for bendable
foldable look like and fantastic
question and does anyone remember the
entourage edge the dual screen - tablet
oh no entourage edge that doesn't remind
me of I think it may have been ZTE that
created like a nested phone / tablet do
you remember that also in Nokia morph no
no that was it was another Chinese phone
maker yeah it wasn't ZT it was it was I
remember I wrote about it because Intel
I had no no it was it was like a lower
tier it was like phone in a tablet into
a laptop no no it was a phone that that
you you put it inside a tablet and then
they and then it turned itself into a
tablet well if you go back to the
Motorola Atrix that was basically what
was you you plug that into a laptop and
it acted as the brains of that laptop so
to go to Dash's question I think that if
created correctly you might not need a
case because it would just fold in on
itself and the displays would be
protected by the body yeah I don't know
if I'd like the design cuz if I'm
pulling out of my pocket every time if I
have to open it up
that's an extra step that I don't wanna
take like it has to have another screen
on the outside cuz I don't want to
always fold it out to use it right you
used to you did used to roll a razor
I'll probably become how long ago was
the Motorola RAZR move in late Nokia
3100 or 31 what is it that 3,300 3,300
sorry yeah also to Danny's question
about lifespan it's it's probably true
that people might have a bit of
hesitation about yeah the length of the
life of those phones especially because
people do tend to keep their phones a
little bit longer right as you mention
know that the what is the running
average two years everybody's kind of
like falling into this two years three
year three year yeah I used to be two
years I used to haven't looked at the
stats more recently but the way that
it's been going is is that it's been bar
Belling where people will either get a
new phone every year or they'll keep
them for three to four it makes a lot of
economical sense to keep it nowadays
make some way more sense to keep the
phone now than
in the past with contracts right the
hope would be that somebody like Samsung
wouldn't come out with a phone like this
that they readily knew how to like a
shorter lifespan by right that might be
asking them a little too much
all right let's pivot real quick for one
last question before we wrap it up today
Tyson says do you think that there will
be VR headsets everywhere or our
company's going to get in on a universal
AR technology where everyone would just
have minimal glasses and you would just
look at the products I mean I think that
either one is way off in the future I
think the idea of the universal AR
standard is a nice dream but it's a pipe
dream at this point everyone else every
company's building their own version of
AR and so it's it's they're all kind of
competing right now so the idea that
they're all gonna standardize with like
a single pair of glasses this seems
really unlikely I think we're gonna get
a lot of fragment fragmented attempts at
AR for a long time I think with VR
shopping specifically the usages that
I've seen so far mostly in the luxury
space because most people don't want to
pay for and can't afford a VR headset so
these are really more for super users
will say they're getting a lot cheaper
they are I know and there's the
cardboard option which is super cheap
but also kind of crappy but there are
like hundred dollar options you know
add-ons for Samsung or daydream that
aren't that expensive and give you a
pretty decent VR experience my
expectation though again from shopping
is is you you're already in the store
let's say you're at a Best Buy or a
Walmart and there's there's a display
there with VR we're providing a lot of
additional details and resources that it
will actually give you a reason to stop
they're put on a VR headset maybe
there's somebody there to help guide you
through the process I think that that's
something that you might be able to see
sometime in the future if it hasn't
already the real benefit of VR like is
the remote capability like the fact that
I don't have to go to Walmart that I
could just sit home put on my VR headset
and cry and shop at Costco or Walmart
and just be like oh I'll buy that send
it to my house the reality of going to
obtain virtual reality
yeah yeah pretty much yeah I go I go
there I shop my VR headset on my virtual
reality headset they just I don't think
enough people have VR headsets for that
- really I know but I agree with you
that the shopping from your from your
couch because I've got three are three
VR headsets in my closet collecting dust
I'm like I need a reason to use them
well they're trying to figure out how to
do that all right fine
all right we are out of time today but
we gotta make a special shout out yeah a
very special shout oh my god we had
something really cool happened last
night we want to share it with everybody
check this out right here our buddy
Assad made us a special poster to
celebrate our 300th episode it was very
awesome
it's very much made my day it's just
another one of those situations that
proves like you meet some really cool
people and your day-to-day and whoever
thought that us hanging out here in this
weird-ass purple room would have turned
into something where we make friends on
the internet and they're really really
nice and talented and nice people the
internet that's just the form doesn't
yeah Thank You Tube right that's I mean
seriously this was awesome thank you
thank you Assad so much and on that note
let's uh wrap it up for the day Ben take
it away
let's do it the 359 is available on
iTunes tune in citrus SoundCloud
Feedburner google play music and and of
course of course cnet.com cap thanks
everybody for watching we'll see you
again tomorrow see you tomorrow
