oculus rift I've tested dozens and
dozens of VR apps and games from
big-budget adventures to free in the
apps made by lone programmers I can
safely say that the single best
experience I've had in virtual reality
to date is a free app for the HTC vive
called rec room rec room setup looks and
feels a lot like another best-in-class
game Wii Sports like wii sports there
are simple custom avatars with clothing
and hair style choices and a variety of
familiar sports games that are easy to
pick up and play with little to no
instructions if you can figure out how
to hook up a vibe you can figure out how
to play rec room without reading the
manual there's one part of the app that
really stands out paintball you're
transported to an outdoor paintball
course for 4 on 4 cap to the flag or
team deathmatch style games you can move
around within your room scale
environment depending on how much floor
space you have but most of the game is
spent teleporting around and hiding
behind tires and wooden barriers while
shooting tiny virtual paintballs at the
other team it's fun it's fast paced and
it brings a much-needed social element
to VR aided by the built-in microphone
in every vive headset the best part the
game created by a few guys at a small
studio named against gravity is
completely free with so many games
coming to VR actually put off trying rec
room for a long time but as soon as I
played my first game of paintball I was
HOH there's literally nothing better in
Virtual Reality right now
