rumors about the Galaxy S ten the galaxy
s 9 was released way back in the ancient
days known as March 2018 it was a
simpler time Havel brought out pencil
support suits cheap iPad 8 dogs in your
Leif Seth Olsen won the Iditarod the
whole world was watching Sherlock gnomes
but that was then this is now and now
we're wondering what's next of Samsung
so we'll rank the rumors by how
interesting they are let's get to it
coming in at number 5 is the release
date the S 6 was released in April 2015
the S 7 was released in March 2016 the s
8 April 2017 and as you recall from
earlier the S 9 was released in March
2018 so reports say the S 10 will be
released in the first half of 2019
which seems like a really safe bet but
one report from the Korea Herald says we
might see our first glimpse of the S 10
in January now why would that happen
because Samsung might decide to show off
its foldable phone at MWC in late
February 2019 now that would suggest a
foldable phone we Samsung's top phone
but that would be a departure number for
the S 10 may ditch the iris scanner the
Samsung S line has had an iris scanner
since the galaxy s 8 the first major
Samsung phone with an iris scanner was a
galaxy note 7 but we all know what
happened with that thing a report from
the Bell says that Samsung has not
ordered iris scanners for the S 10 why
is that
you can blame number three for that and
that is the arrival of the in display
fingerprint sensor for the S 10 the bell
and ET News claim that Samsung will
adopt an N screen fingerprint sensor in
the past Samsung's had the sensor on the
home button or on the back vivo showing
off in display fingerprint technology in
a phone already
if the S 10 has a fingerprint sensor in
the display you wouldn't necessarily
need an iris scanner coming in at number
two is a 3d front-facing camera for the
S 10 yep this would also explain killing
off that iris scanner on top of that a
3d front-facing camera on the S 10 could
take on the weirdness that is Samsung's
AR emoji take a look at it
don't worry I'll wait
it's awkward to say the least a 3d
front-facing camp can also help out in
other of mental reality applications and
the number one most interesting rumor is
that there will be three different s10
models the s9 and s8 were available in
two different models each a regular
version and a plus model a report from
et News says the s10 will bump that to 3
in a Google translated version of that
article 2 may still have curved screens
while the third would have a flat screen
now that could be a translation issue
but that would be similar to how the
galaxy s6 lineup was 1 flat 2 curved or
maybe it's an active variant also each
s10 would feature different camera
setups the entry-level one would have
one rear camera the mid-range version
would have two and the third would
feature a triple camera on the back that
sounds insane but it also sounds like
something Samsa will try now no real
designs have leaked out regarding the
s10 you don't think Samsung would ever
embrace the knotch
especially after their famous commercial
starring this fellow - you let me know
I'm I as a colonel see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
