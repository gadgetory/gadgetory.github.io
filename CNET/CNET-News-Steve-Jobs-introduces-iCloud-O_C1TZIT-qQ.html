try not to blow it so I get to talk
about iCloud we've been working on this
for some time now and we're really
excited about it about ten years ago we
had one of our most important insights
and that was that the PC was going to
become the digital hub for your digital
life what does that mean well it meant
that that's where you were going to put
your digital photos where else were you
gonna put them your digital video off
your digital camcorder and of course
your music right you were going to
acquire it in the device or potentially
on your Mac and you were going to
basically sync it to the Mac and
everything was going to work fine and it
did for the better part of 10 years but
it's broken down in the last few years
why well because the devices have
changed they now all have music they now
all have photos they now all have video
and so if I acquire a song I buy it
right on my iPhone I want to get that to
my other devices right I pick up my iPad
and it doesn't have that song on it so I
have to sync my iphone to my Mac then I
have to sync my other devices to the Mac
to get that song but then they've
deposited some photos on the Mac so I
have to sync the iPhone again with the
Mac to get those photos and keeping
these devices in sync is driving us
crazy
so we got a great solution for this
problem
and we think this solution is our next
big insight which is we're going to
demote the PC in the Mac to just be a
device just like an iPhone an iPad or an
iPod touch and we're going to move the
digital hub the center of your digital
life into the cloud because all these
new devices have communications built
into them they can all talk to the cloud
whenever they want and so now if I get
something on my iPhone it sends up to
the cloud immediately let's say I take
some pictures with it
those pictures are in the cloud and they
are now pushed down to my devices
completely automatically and now
everything's in sync with me not even
having to think about it I don't even
have to take the devices out of my
pocket I don't have to be near my Mac or
PC now some people think the cloud is
just a hard disk in the sky right and
you take a bunch of stuff and you put it
in your Dropbox or your I disk or
whatever and it transfers it up to the
cloud and stores and then you drag
whatever you want back out on your other
devices we think it's way more than that
and we call it iCloud now iCloud stores
your content in the cloud and wirelessly
pushes it to all your devices so it
automatically uploads it stores it and
automatically pushes it to all your
other devices but also it's completely
integrated with your apps and so
everything happens automatically and
there's nothing new to learn it just all
works
miss Brooke's now you might ask why
should I believe them they're the ones
that brought me mobile me
it wasn't our finest hour let me just
say that but we learned a lot now the
three core apps in MobileMe were
contacts calendar and mail three things
we'd obviously like kept up to date
we've thrown them away we've reacted and
rewritten them from the ground up to be
iCloud apps and we've put them on all of
our devices so as an example in contacts
when I make a new contact on my iPhone
it's automatically brought up to the
cloud where it's stored on the cloud
right the truth is on the cloud and then
it's automatically pushed down to my
other devices so they're all in sync
it's that easy
I just update a contact on my iPhone and
don't even think about it and that
contact is updated on all my other
devices and if I change it on any device
it's updated on all devices wirelessly
automatically without me doing a thing
so that's contacts here's calendars
works much the same way I make a new
calendar event on my iPhone it's stored
in the cloud and it's pushed to my other
devices pretty cool
we've also added calendar sharing so as
an example if I'm sharing a few
calendars with my wife at school and
soccer calendars let's say right and I
add a new calendar for a teacher parent
conference on my phone it's again
automatically pushed up to the cloud and
automatically pushed to my wife's iPhone
if she adds she
that's an appointment for a soccer game
again goes up to the cloud and back to
my iPhone it's that simple
and so calendars has it stores your
calendars in the cloud changes on any
device or push to all your devices and
we have shared calendars and we think
you're going to love the new calendars
it just works and then we have mail the
mail was in the best shape of all but
it's even better now we give you a male
accountant at medCom your new messages
again are pushed to all your devices and
like we're used to your inbox and
folders are all kept up to date on all
devices
so that's mail and no ads
we build products that we want for
ourselves too and we just don't want to
ads so we can't get there so these are
the three apps that form the core of
mobile me we used to sell them for a
subscription price of $99 annually as of
today this product ceases to exist and
those three apps are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
