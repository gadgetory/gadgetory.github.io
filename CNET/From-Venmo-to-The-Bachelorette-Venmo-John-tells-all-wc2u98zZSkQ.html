and hello that family have a very fun
interview happening right now with John
Graham from The Bachelorette for viewers
that may not know who you are you give
like a 30 second you know rundown of who
you are all that kind of fun stuff yeah
I grew up in the Midwest up in Chicago I
went to school in New York and then
after work I started working at a small
start-up called venmo at the time was a
smaller startup home and then I worked
there for about five years and then I
moved to San Francisco about two and a
half years ago and I now work at this
new startup fin and a few months ago I
sort of just randomly applied to be on
The Bachelorette and I was selected to
be a cast member so some people might
have seen me on that show that's now
airing so you'd seen previous seasons so
you kind of knew what you were getting
into or honestly I haven't seen that
many previous seasons when I found out
Beck was gonna be the Bachelorette I
tried to binge-watch a couple of the
five episodes and I was like why is
everyone just making out I don't get
this I can write ready for that my
parents are gonna see this I mean it's
such a huge such a huge cultural thing
that happens every week I mean people
it's constantly trending on Twitter and
you know everybody sits down and shares
their views and you know you kind of
found this like rise of popularity you
know everybody was loving you the first
episode after your cute intro line so
I'm a software engineer I made the app
for venmo
what's that like being the sort of
internet icon I think one of the most
fun things about this is that every once
in a while I like be walking on the
street or I'll go running and someone be
like hey venmo job jonovic whoa you
actually like recognized me and so I'm
always happy to stop for photos or say
hi or something and I think that's just
one of the most exciting things my
family and my friends are so like
they're like whatever like this is like
get over yourself kind of thing I'm
humbled so your time at Penn know you
were there for five years how do you
think that you know working at such a
successful startup do you think that
helps you on the show or do you think
that was just like a
right back story you know how did the
two intersect hmm I don't know the
biggest thing I can think of right now
is having to put yourself out there and
take risks so I remember at venmo I felt
like we were just working all the time
and it never felt like work and so we
were just constantly focusing and I
remember I remember I'd probably get
there like 10:00 in the morning and I
often work til like 10:00 p.m. or 11:00
or 12:00 at night and I just like so
absorbed with Menma that I was like
totally focused at work and for several
years that was like my lifestyle but I
also realize it's not that sustainable
and then on the Bachelorette a lot of
that you just have to be very present
and sort of focus on the whole
experience if you're trying to like
bring in parts of your life that aren't
like part of the Bachelorette right now
if if all you do is I talk about your
work or if you're trying to promote your
brand or if you're trying to like you
know do things that aren't part of the
show you're probably just going to be
worse off and not enjoy the experience
as much so maybe the the best
intersection I can see is like totally
being all-in on something and embracing
that lifestyle for a bit and then when
it's over like think about something
else in a different context so who do
you want to see you Becca end up with
ooh yes who do I want to see back end up
with I'm gonna give a lame answer but I
want to see her with the person who
makes her the most happy all right and
then last but not least what are you
doing now you know it's like wrapping up
paradise is wrapping up yeah what am i
doing now so I work it at Finn I was
just a software engineer so my my
day-to-day is is at my computer coding
away and on the side just for fun and
I've been doing this for years I make
these episodes where I cook on and like
I've selfie film it and I cook random
meals and I called the show kitchen
talking yeah so work cooking and I'm
actually a pretty bad chef I just do it
for fun thank you for coming I'm so
excited to watch you go paradise and I'm
definitely gonna have you back when
paradise airs I'd love to be back
awesome well thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
