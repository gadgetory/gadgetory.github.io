products for many years the company has
made some excellent professional monitor
speakers for the desktop and now it's
delving into more consumer products the
new Airmotive t ones are based on the
company's powered speakers but they are
passive the t ones may look kind of
industrial and imposing but they sound
even better than they were before
standing t once a six hundred and ninety
nine dollars repair and featured
technologies you don't usually see at
the price for instance they come with a
folded ribbon tweeter which contributes
to the speaker's extended frequency
response there's also a solid phase plug
in the center of the five point two five
inch mid driver and most speakers just
come with wobbly dust caps for bass the
Tiguan comes with two six inch woofers
and a rear facing port if you don't like
this angular look the speakers do come
with a magnetic drill as well due to
those bass drivers the speakers will get
down to 37 hertz which means you should
be able to get away without a subwoofer
for most material and the base that is
there is even-handed and time it sounds
punchy with rock music especially detail
levels are way up and you get a real
sense of space in musical recordings on
the other hand movie dialogue is also
clear and isn't nasally or chesty at the
money there's nothing we've heard that
really challenges the t-one sure you can
spend another 300 and get a better
speaker from SVS or ELAC america but you
can always spend more money if you're
looking to buy a set of bookshelves at
this price try the Airmotive t one
instead you get a much more visceral and
dynamic performance than anything an e
lack or BMW book shelf can give you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
