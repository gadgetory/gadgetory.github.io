cnet.com and I'm here with the fight on
moderna ms 200 the company is calling
this a half in ear headphone which means
it's midway between an earbud and an
in-ear headphone I know that sounds a
little confusing but the idea here is
that while the MS 200s have ear tips you
don't jam them all the way into your ear
canal instead they simply rest in your
ear canal so they let some sound in the
earphones come with a few different
kinds of ear tips and depending upon
which one you choose the fit will be a
little different all in all the
earphones are very comfortable to wear
and the target customers someone who
wants a versatile in your style
headphone that can be used on a
day-to-day basis as well as for outdoor
exercise activities where you don't want
to be cut off from your environment the
earphones have a bit of carbon fiber on
their exterior which should help with
durability and Phi eitan claims the MS
200s multi tuned acoustic design uses a
dual chamber and has five tuning points
engineered to optimize airflow that
sounds like techno babble but the MS 200
sound is richly balanced and as good but
not great detail the fairly flat tangle
resistant 47 inch long cable has an
integrated one button remote and
microphone that allows you to make cell
phone calls you get four sizes of
matching soft silicone tips and one pair
of foam tips there's also a set of right
fit silicone eartips and they definitely
provide a more secure fit for exercising
the other tips but the headphones bass
output dropped with the right fit tips
attached an attractively styled
protective carrying case is also
included the headphone is sweat and
water resistant so you can enjoy your
music with a heavy workout or in a light
rain without fear of damaging the
headphone one of the signature sound
traits of the MS 200 is that it sound
very open and airy particularly for an
in-ear style headphone it may not have
the best definition but there's a decent
amount of base and this is an ear foam
that you can listen to for long periods
without experiencing listening fatigue
in terms of fifth that ms 200 shares
some similarities to the Bose mie 2i
another
very comfortable half-inning your style
headphone that said this model offers a
snugger fit and let's unless sound from
the outside world the downside to the MS
200 is the sound feels a little less
direct and immediate than a good in-ear
design but this is a versatile headphone
that it will appeal the folks who want
both in in your style headphone for
day-to-day use as well as for exercising
and 120 dollars online it's reasonably
priced though I think phaeton could get
more traction with a ninety nine dollar
price point i'm david carr nguoi and
that's the fight on moderna ms 200 half
in ear headphone thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
