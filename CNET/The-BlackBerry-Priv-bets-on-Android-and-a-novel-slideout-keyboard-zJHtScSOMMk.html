built to get stuff done now it's my
voice first Android phone but it's
hitting all the right notes with a crisp
curved display speedy hardware and a
solid metal body that isn't too thick or
heavy but it's still a blackberry you'll
find favorites like the BlackBerry hub
to help you manage all your messages and
it's pill from the ground up security
and privacy or privacy in mic and then
there's the keyboard I could do this all
day the sliding mechanism is rigid
enough that it won't pop up an
accidentally but smooth enough to do
casually with one hand and the slider
means you get a nice 5.5 inch
high-resolution screen and a full four
roll keyboard no need to compromise but
whether or not you need a physical
keyboard of a smart phone in 2015 is
still up for debate a keyboard leaves
you more room on the screen to see the
things you're working on and the
physical keys are spaces enough to type
on accurately but the keyboard is also
really narrow and the sign design can be
a bit top-heavy especially if you've got
smaller heads have you been itching for
a phone with a physical keyboard this is
pretty much the only game in town the
sick design will turn heads and the
hardware lines up neatly with the 600
$99 price tag that's unlocked without a
contract
things aren't - a clear cut for everyone
else this is blackberry finest effort in
years thanks in part to the switch with
BlackBerry OS to Android lollipop but
many of the elements that make
blackberry special like the hub or bbm
just seem to get in the way of googles
apps or third-party tools for Google
Play the previous important step for
blackberry and the side design is an
exciting stand out in a sea of flat
slabs but the competition remains fierce
and the keyboards novelty coupled with
promises of secure Android OS might not
be enough to move the masses and make
blackberry back into the limelight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
