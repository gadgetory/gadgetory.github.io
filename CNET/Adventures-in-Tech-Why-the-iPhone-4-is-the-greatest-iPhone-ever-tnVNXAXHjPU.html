coming up the reasons why the iPhone 4
is the best phone that Apple's ever
built
there's no one thing that makes the
iPhone 4 the best iPhone ever and that's
because like bacon or being asleep there
are lots of things that are great about
it
the starters check out its incredible
life span the iPhone 4 arrived in June
2010 but Apple didn't stop selling it
until September 2013
even as newer models were released Apple
kept the iPhone 4 on as a cheaper model
impressive especially compared to the
iPhone 5 which Apple scrapped in less
than a year and even though the iPhone 4
isn't on sale anymore that doesn't mean
that it's dead and gone Apple has
anointed the iPhone 4 with iOS 7 and it
handles it surprisingly well elsewhere
the 3.5 inch display stands as one of
the best around and that design still
looks gorgeous yes like a fine wine the
iPhone 4 has aged well but it doesn't
only look good in hindsight back in 2010
this thing blew our tiny minds for
instance we got our first look at the
exceptionally detailed Retina display
the powerful a4 chip and let's not
forget the front-facing camera that
introduced the world to awkward stilted
FaceTime calls hey Johnny how you doing
then there's the look with two sheets of
custom glass and a stainless steel frame
the iPhone 4 looked like it came from
the same lump of metal as Thor's hammer
it was a unique original style that
Apple is yet to abandon there was one
teensy problem to save space Apple built
the phone's antenna into the steel band
around the edge but this calls signal to
drop whenever you grips the bottom-left
of the phone
this made the iPhone 4 particularly
impractical for left-handed folks but
hey maybe lefties don't really feature
in Apple's vision of the future
burries antenna gates wasn't apples only
crisis the company's famous secrecy fell
apart when a prototype iPhone 4 was lost
in a bar and though Apple promised to
sell a white iPhone 4 on day one
manufacturing rose meant it didn't
actually go on sale until 308 days later
the iPhone 4 gave Apple its fair share
of PR troubles but these humiliations
didn't put a dent in the phone's
popularity then or now apple sold 1.7
million in the first weekend the three
years later Tim Cook would credit the
iPhone 4 with continuing to keep overall
sales up longevity cool features and a
resilience to public disgrace helped
make the iPhone 4 the best iPhone ever
but there is another factor and that's a
general lack of effort from every iPhone
since the iPhone 4s looked identical and
forced us to befriend a snarky robot
Butler the iPhone 5 had a bigger screen
but Samsung had been doing that for ages
the 5s and 5c are cool but they haven't
introduced as many amazing features as
the iPhone 4 did the first three iPhones
were important gadgets but they were
still missing lots of important stuff
compared to the iPhone 4 they look like
prototype experiments while later
versions look like lazy copies in the
end the iPhone 4 was just unstoppable
iOS 7 didn't stop it and tenna gate
didn't stop it even subsequent iPhones
couldn't stop it
that's why I think it's the best but do
you agree let me know and check back
next time for another adventure in tech
