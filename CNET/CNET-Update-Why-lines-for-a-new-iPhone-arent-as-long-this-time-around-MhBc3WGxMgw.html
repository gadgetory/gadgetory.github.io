changing the dynamics of iphone lines
I'm Bridget Carey this is your C net
update Apple's iPhone 6s and 6s plus
went on sale in stores around the world
on Friday and at New York City's
flagship Fifth Avenue Apple Store there
was the usual cheering and high-fives
from employees as customers who waited
overnight funnels into the store to be
the first with the new models it's the
same site we see every year but
something was very different this time
around the line at this flagship store
was extremely short compared to previous
years now the iPhone isn't losing
popularity what's more likely the case
is that consumers don't have a big
reason to buy at an Apple Store when you
can get a better deal by going directly
to a carrier store take this into
consideration any diehard iPhone fan
that has been with AT&amp;amp;T for years may
have one of those old unlimited plan
contracts where you pay $200 upfront
well you can no longer renew that plan
at an Apple Store you can only get it if
you buy directly from AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and
Sprint have crazy cheap leasing plans
for customers who trade in their old
phones but you have to go to the carrier
store to get the deal Sprint is only
charging $1 a month for an iPhone 6s and
6s plus it's in its upgrade every year
plan and t-mobile is offering the iPhone
for $5 a month in stores normally in
years past the line wraps around several
city blocks as you can see in this video
from last year it was utter chaos with
people running and becoming an unordered
most of the people in line at this store
last year were reselling it to buyers in
China because China wasn't getting the
iPhone on day one so people were making
profits of 300 or $500 a phone selling
it to buyers overseas now this year that
changed China was among the first 12
countries to get the iPhone but the
demand still exists for buyers from
other countries that don't have it yet
and don't want to wait the first
customer out of the fifth avenue Apple
store was Justyna CE junetta a 25 year
old student visiting from Lithuania she
pre-ordered a rose gold model and jumped
in line at 2:00 a.m. but pre ordering
made it easy for her to get out first
when she
ran out the crowd cheered for her to
open it up and show it off and she
didn't drop it luckily she now heads
back home to Lithuania where the iPhone
6s is not yet available to buy that's it
for this tech news update and if you
have a story to share about your iPhone
