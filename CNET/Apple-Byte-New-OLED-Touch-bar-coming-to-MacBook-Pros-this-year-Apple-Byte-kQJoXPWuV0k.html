to the Apple buy for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple a lot have
you been telling me enough of the iPhone
what about the mac books well ask and
you shall receive my friends after a new
report by digit x Ming Chi quo that's
also been corroborated by 9 to 5 math
claims Apple will introduce a
dramatically overhauled MacBook Pro
later this year quo claims it will have
a new thinner and lighter design with
design cues taken from the 12 inch
ultra-thin MacBook and adopt new metal
injected molded hinges from the same
company that makes them for the surface
pro that we've talked about in the past
the new MacBook Pros will also support
touch ID and bring a new OLED display
touch bar above the keyboard now this
OLED touch bar will replace the physical
function keys along the top of the
keyboard and the new MacBook Pro is
expected to support both USB C and
Thunderbolt 3 digit times reports the
new updates will come to both the 13
inch and 15 inch models sometime during
the fourth quarter of this year we've
told you to keep holding out in this
looks to be the biggest revamp for the
MacBook Pro line in four years now in
another report digit x claims a new
ultra thin 13 inch MacBook will be
coming in the third quarter of this year
expanding the line to include both a 12
inch model and a 13 inch model now the
current 11 inch and 13 inch MacBook Airs
could transition to become the budget
laptop for Apple's lineup yes $8.99 for
a budget laptop with the new MacBook
Pros representing the feature-packed
model and the macbook ultra-thin x'
becoming the Super portables that were
once occupied by the air see in a world
of Apple you go from the best to budget
in just a few years and that's a sad
Apple now there's a lot of new iphone 7
leaks &amp;amp; rumors this week like a lot lots
the latest iPhone plus parts leaked from
Steve hammers offer show up a dual
camera component that's meant for the
iPhone 7 plus model but even more
interesting storage capacity chips for
the presume 7 plus at capacities of 16
64 and 200
56 gigs yeah you might have peed
yourself a little bit with the 256 gig
potential but seriously Apple you still
might start off at 16 gigs let straight
up embarrassing and you know what you're
getting a pre-emptive bad Apple because
you know they're stubborn and you know
they will do this I'll write a new
iPhone 7 plus schematic from HD blog
shows a place for the rumored dual
camera but no smart connector on the
rear is indicated here leaving that
feature potentially still up in the air
also a purported photo of the casing of
iPhone 7 from Weibo lines up with the
recent schematics that featured a
beveled protruding camera with a larger
lens and the redesigned antenna lines on
top of that nowhere else fr found a
leaked iphone 7 case design that
features the same larger hole for the
4.7 inch iphone camera but the case also
has openings for more speakers there's
two on each side similar to the new iPad
pros and we haven't seen any iPhone
designs with the floor speaker
arrangement so it could just be bunk and
the Taiwan economic daily news reports
Apple has told its supply chain to
produce 72 to 78 million units of the
iPhone 7 for its launch that would make
it the highest launch target since the
six and clearly they believe that this
phone is going to be a big deal Tim even
said on CNBC it's going to give us
things we can't live without so all of
that is a damn the life of the iPhone 7
leaks &amp;amp; rumors and here's a fun one at
startup fest in Amsterdam Tim Cook was
asked if he knew where and when the
first iPhone was invented
Tim joked and said you know I thought I
knew until last night last night Neely
took me over to look at some Rembrandt's
and in one of the paintings I was
shocked
there was an iPhone in one of the
paintings now the painting in question
was actually a piece of work by Pieter
de hooch in 1670 called man handing a
letter to a woman in the entrance hall
of a house it hangs in Amsterdam's
Rijksmuseum now Timmy has a point it
kind of does look like an iPhone so it
got me thinking if an iPhone was in a
1670 painting
maybe it's in the other great works like
Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa si si si
there it is
or how about the Last Supper look right
there and you definitely didn't want to
text Jesus then and even Michelangelo's
creation of iPhone well I mean Adam

Mortal Kombat iOS game giveaway and you

titles I saw a lot of sub zero dark
