business or creative types struggling
slumped shoulders across the street
because they're lugging a giant 15-inch
laptop that weighs five pounds or more
why because sometimes you need more than
a small 13-inch screen or you just want
to full powered all-day laptop that's
why I love the current trend towards
15-inch laptops that have big high-res
screens but are also very slim and light
the Samsung notebook 9 is one of the
newest of these and among the least
expensive now it's not as light as the
LG Graham series it doesn't have the
really cool bezel free design of the
Dell XPS 15 and it doesn't have the
battery life for the 15-inch MacBook Pro
but it does come close in each of these
categories it's a good middle of the
road laptop the waves less than a
MacBook Air it's more safe than exciting
but it's also usually just 1199 with a
core i7 CPU and a big 256 gig
solid-state drive and it's even
discounted right now to 1099 making it
an even better deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
