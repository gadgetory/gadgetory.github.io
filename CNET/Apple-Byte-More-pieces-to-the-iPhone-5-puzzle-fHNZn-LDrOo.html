the Apple bite it's everything inside
the world of Apple
now September's here and many of you are
waiting for an official iPhone 5 launch
date and there's been plenty of rumors
throwing early to mid October around
none of my retail sources even know yet
but there are pieces to the iPhone 5
puzzle that are coming together now you
might not like sushi but you will after
this picture which is believed to be the
first test photo from the next iPhone
pocket now says the photo claims to be
taken by an iPhone 4 and the X of data
shows that the picture has been cropped
to just over 5 megapixels but the
original picture was just under 8 the
rumored size for iPhone 5 photos now the
camera has a fixed 4.3 millimeter lens
with an f-stop of 2.4 translation that's
closer to a point-and-shoot and better
than the current Apple phone and you
know why this picture is legit
well the GPS data places it at Apple's
campus and once it got out on Flickr
they took down the picture smart move
guys now the iPhone 5 cases are also
floating around everywhere in China for
sale and historically these cases have
been pretty accurate MMIC gadget has
built a gallery featuring all of them
and if this comparison with the iPhone 4
is accurate it will be a thinner wider
and longer phone that's as thin as the
iPod touch with a teardrop like shape
design and a mute switch that's moved to
the opposite side plus they're still
rumors about a form factor that's
similar to the iPhone 4 with a slightly
larger display which could be the 4s the
4G or the MST now if you're looking for
more tasty McNuggets digitize reports
suppliers are ramping up for full
production capacity of the new iPhone
with Foxconn already producing 150,000
phones a day they say shipments are set
to reach five to six million units in
September and over 22 million for the
fourth quarter and in some cool iOS 5
news 9 to 5 Mac reports Apple has seated
certain mobile carriers with a near
final version of iOS 5 with FaceTime
over 3G active for testing and it also
includes the nuance dictation
speech-to-text feature that Apple
desperately needs an XL
identically to the Android demo video
all right let's take a quick break and
show you a how-to for treating your own
lion recovery disk hey guys Brian here
with cnet.com and Mac os10 line users
might be happy with how easy it is to
download the Lion through the app store
but there's no need to purchase an
installer disc from Apple for 69 bucks
and there's been no way to create a
physical recovery disk until now
Apple's made their own line recovery
disk assistant that's available to
download for free at the link you see
here you'll be able to create your own
physical recovery disk it's just over a
Meg and it requires you have lion
running with a recovery hard drive
partition which is set up by default now
first up insert a USB thumb stick or
external disc drive with at least one
gig of storage to your computer running
lion run the line recovery assistant and
it will create the recovery disk for you
in a few minutes on that drive so from
now on you'll have a line recovery disk
and if you need to restore your computer
in the future first plug in your disk
drive then power up your Mac on startup
hold the option key and a screen will
appear that allows you to select which
drive you want to boot up from so there
you have it i'm brian tom for cnet.com
with your recovery disk out - that will
save you from potential headaches and
more importantly save you some money use
it wisely wow that guy's really been
working out lately if you can tell
alright thanks for the tip and let's get
back to the show CEO Tim Cook put his
first stamp on Apple recently with the
announcement that Apple will now match
charitable contributions up to ten
thousand dollars for employees annually
dollar for dollar Steve Jobs has not
been known to donate publicly but has
done so privately an Apple accidents
philanthropy programs in 1997 so this is
a nice change to the company all right
to the quick bytes Apple has already
proposed their UFO campus and is
planning moving forward but it won't be
the only one after Apple told the
current Cupertino mayor that they will
begin planning on a third campus after a
UFO one is completed sometime in 2015
great so now the aliens will really know
where to land when they want to take
over
I'll write in cool toys Atari is
planning its own joystick controller for
the iPad called the Atari arcade dual
powered joystick because you know dual
powered sounds so cool it's advertised
as coming soon with no price and
available yet but we can't wait for this
and we leave you today with a story from
the files of when people have too much
money and time thanks to the magic of
YouTube some idiot decided to showcase
his culinary skills with a MacBook Air
by slicing pieces of lettuce and how
about deveining a shrimp because that's
really smart and sanitary and of course
slicing an apple seriously you know
there's only one thing that should be
doing with an apple and it's biting it
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show now check this out let's
have a nifty new mailbox so some of your
comments right in here to the Alpha by
to see Netcom will read a few of them
next week I'm Brian Shawn thanks for
watching only see you next time for
another bite Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
