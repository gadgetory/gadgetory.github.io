big some small and all of them are of
the under-the-hood variety that means
the actual designs of these mac books
are not changing but they'll be faster
and in some cases cost less the MacBook
Pro line intro'd in fall 2016 gets newer
Intel 7g n processors catching up with
the rest of the industry and the
graphics in the highest end 15-inch
model gets a bump - there's also a new
external box with an AMD graphics card
inside that will be available only to
developers at first its way to add
desktop level graphics to a laptop the
box might be available for regular
consumers at some point later on - the
12-inch MacBook also gets a CPU bump but
stays the same
otherwise that's still $12.99 more
interesting is that the basic 13-inch
MacBook Pro the one without the touch
bar interface gets a $200 price cut
going from $14.99 down to $12.99 that's
not quite as cheap as a MacBook Air but
it's closer which is important at Apple
since that model is really the closest
thing to a modern version of the air but
just in case you're not convinced the
biggest Mac surprise of the day is that
the beloved MacBook Air is finally
getting a speed bump the screen ports
and design are all basically the same
but the CPU gets a little bit faster
even though we don't have the exact
specs yet I bet a lot of MacBook Air
fans are excited about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
