6 both are available in 55 and 65 inch
sizes and both trounce the picture
quality of any LCD TV I've ever tested
they're also a bit better than last
year's OLED models let's take a closer
look
OLED which stands for organic
light-emitting diode is a fundamentally
different flat panel display technology
an LCD which is used by just about every
other TV available today each of the
more than eight million pixels in these
4k OLED TVs is its own independent light
source and each can turn pure black when
necessary or get very bright the result
is a spectacular picture that look
equally good from NEC to my testing room
new for 2016 LG has made OLED TVs even
brighter and in my test the difference
was evident they're not as bright as the
most expensive LCDs but the b6 and E 6
are still bright enough to look great in
any room light them and if you really
want to enjoy the best these TVs can do
turn down the lights and soak in their
perfectly dark black levels and awesome
contrast another addition this year is
Dolby vision HDR compatibility and three
of its streaming apps off for TV shows
and movies and Dolby vision Netflix
Amazon and Vudu high-dynamic-range can
look even better than 4k video and
unlike Sony and Samsung TVs LG supports
both HDR and Dolby vision providing the
widest selection of HDR movies and TV
shows in my test HDR from any source
looks superb on these televisions beyond
the picture of these TVs have ohlet's
trademark super slim style it looks
sleek enough on the b6 with its
exceedingly thin cabinet but more
expensive east 6 looks even nicer this
set has a beautiful picture on glass
design and below the screen is a sound
bar then proves the audio too of course
if you're spending this much on a TV you
should pair it with a high-quality
external sound system and price is the
biggest downside of LG's new OLED TVs
depending on the size and model they'll
cost twice as much or even more compared
to high performance LCD sets that's a
lot to pay for supreme picture quality
but if you demand the best and can
afford it LG's 2016 o LEDs are the best
option at these sizes I'm Debbie Catz
