new car in the US without stability
control dual front airbags have been
required on cars here since 96 and yet
there are places in the world right now
where new 2015's are rolling out of the
showroom without a single airbag or
stability control or even much of a body
structure look at how this Indian market
datsun go fails in a crash test the main
impact absorbing structure seems to be
the driver the Dacia Sandero sold in
Europe gets a four star rating a version
sold in brazil last model year got a
one-star rating as you can imagine they
improved it after that because nothing
chases dangerous cars out of the
marketplace faster than miserable crash
rating but who is minding the store
globally interglobal in camp global new
car assessment program the idea is to
stitch together crash testing programs
in different regions around the world
into one global standard to get
automakers to basically have no excuse
while offering less safe cars Europe
already has euro end cap Australia and
New Zealand have n cap there's latin end
cap china's see end cap and bharat end
cap under consideration in India but a
true global standard will be sought at a
major auto safety conference in Brazil
this november when the UN will push for
global end cap that means all cars
worldwide would have common passenger
cell strength standards common
pedestrian impact protection standards
and electronic stability control of
course the big problem here is cost that
datsun go we saw earlier costs like 60
100 bucks the Tata Nano is under 3000
some of the safety gear and American
cars cost more than that never mind the
price of the car so we'll watch with
keen interest how they sort out that
hurt approach that cost gap at
conference in Brazil in the meantime
whatever you drive phase two double
check that it's got good crash test
safety ratings more realities of modern
driving revealed now at cnet on cars.com
