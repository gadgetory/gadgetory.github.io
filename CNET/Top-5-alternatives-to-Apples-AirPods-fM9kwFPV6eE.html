wireless headphones so I talked to see
net editors justinyu to find the five
best alternatives to air pods at number
five Doppler labs here one what's their
gimmick adaptive filtering smart
listening so what does that mean think
noise cancellation plus the ability to
block out sounds like sirens and crying
babies on top of that you can raise the
volume of certain frequencies so you can
pick up the bass at things like a live
show
Doppler labs claims they hear one will
be able to survive three to five hours
on a single charge
these don't ship until November and it
will cost a staggering three hundred
dollars at number four the ear in the
ear and started off as a Kickstarter
project and they are real product you
can buy today these two tiny earbuds
cost about two hundred and fifty dollars
they last two and a half hours on a
single charge Aaron's case can be used
to charge the headphones
there is one oddball thing though once
earrings are out of the case they turn
on so you need to make sure you put them
back in the case you're not using them
or they died at number 3 is the Jabra
elite sport this set of wireless earbuds
are sweat and waterproof the elite sport
also has an integrated heart rate
monitor
they will pump out around 3 hours of
battery life before needing to be
charged in their case plus you can
download custom coaching that will talk
to you during your workout in Justin's
words it's like having a tiny personal
trainer in your ear these cost about two
hundred and fifty dollars and arrive in
late October at number two of the Arado
Apollo 7 these tiny headphones have
dynamic drivers that should mean bigger
bass the Arado Apollo 7 air buds are
also water resistance and work for about
three hours their case gives you another
two full charges they cost about $300 at
number one is the Samsung gear icon X
for people looking for an alternative to
Apple turning the Samsung seems like a
safe bet the icon X has four gigabytes
of space built in so you can use them on
their own for about three hours if you
want to stream music from your phone to
the icon X battery life drops to about
an hour and a half the icon acts also
functions as a fitness tracker so
built-in heart rate monitor the fitness
tracker functions work on phones running
Android 4.0
and higher plus it cost about $200 Apple
earpods arrived in late October for
about one hundred and sixty dollars more
top 5s go to top five to Netcom so let's
go somewhere else
I'm Maya's act hard I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
