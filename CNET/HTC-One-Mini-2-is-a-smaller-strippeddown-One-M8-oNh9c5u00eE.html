One m8 but can't quite stretch your
palms around its 5-inch screen and check
out the HTC one mini 22 scaled-down
version of its luxurious big brother it
keeps you all metal body of the
attractive brushed finish making it look
gorgeous and feel great to hold it of
course has module boomsound speakers on
the front as well 4.5 inches it's a fair
bit smaller than the regular one m8 the
size reduction does make it a bit more
comfortable to hold and you can just
about stretch your thumb across the type
of one hand the display has a 1280 by
720 pixel resolution which is a step
down from the full HD panel on the m8 or
indeed the older 4.7 inch HTC One but it
still seems pretty crisp and bright
inside is a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
processor which again isn't as
impressive as a two point three
gigahertz chip in the m8 but it should
still be able to handle everyday tasks
well and it seems satisfyingly nippy in
my own use it comes with a latest
android 4.4 point2 kit kats with HTC
Sense 6 skin over the top which provides
a simple to use attractive interface as
well as the blinkfeed news aggregator a
13 megapixel camera is on the back
instead of the thought ultrapixel camera
from the m8 and it doesn't have the
depth sensor for those unusual 3d
pictures as a 5 megapixel camera on the
front and it's all powered by a 2100
milliamp battery which should keep it
ticking over for a full day with careful
use it's a shame that HTC hasn't packed
one mini t with the same blistering
processor as its flagship sibling but
it's gorgeous sleek body probably go
some way to making up for it hopefully
HTC also pairs the phone where they cut
down price and Anjou hoyle for cnet and
this is the HTC One mini 2
