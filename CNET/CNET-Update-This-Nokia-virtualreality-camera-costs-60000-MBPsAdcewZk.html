cheap hobby I'm Bridget Carey this is
you're seen that update nokia created a
professional level virtual reality
camera and boy oh boy it does not come
cheap you'll need to dish out sixty
thousand dollars for this camera that
can capture 360 degree video and spatial
audio
it's called ozo and Nokia first showed
off the camera in July but now it's
slapped a hefty price tag on it in the
hopes that big production companies can
afford to drop 60 grand to be among the
first with a virtual reality video for
those headsets that are now being
developed the O's oh ship sin 2016 what
makes the O so interesting is that it
records stereoscopic 3d video through
eight synchronized shutters and it also
has eight integrated microphones it
saves all the footage into one file or
you can even use this for live
broadcasting but Nokia is not the only
company working on cameras for this new
medium Google partnered with GoPro to
create the Odyssey it's a rig of 16
GoPro action cameras attached together
at a cost of $15,000 if fifteen grand
doesn't sound so pricy to you then you
may be just the person who would buy a
luxury
SuperMario watch made by designer Romain
Jerome now it doesn't actually play
Mario games or do any SmartWatch things
for about fifteen thousand dollars it
does tell the time only 85 of these will
be made which have hand-painted Mario
icons surrounded by a titanium casing
retro is fun but if you're gonna pay
that kind of money you want the watch to
do something right well Swiss watchmaker
swatch announced that its upcoming
swatch bellamy model can make payments
at the register similar to how the Apple
watch works the Bellamy model is
launching in early 2016 and it can be
used anywhere contact lists visa
payments are accepted it has an NFC chip
inside with high frequency radio waves
that send data over short distances but
that's the only smart thing it does
there's no checking messages no internet
at all there are so many varieties of
smartwatches and all have different
features it can be a bit messy this
through to find the right model for you
but what if you could just build your
own and handpick the features you want
that's the idea behind blocks
it's a SmartWatch that raced 1.6 million
dollars of funding on Kickstarter each
block on the band holds a different
feature and you clip them together to
form the perfect SmartWatch one strap
link would have GPS and the other may
have NFC for payments or maybe one is
just an extra battery for about three
hundred dollars you can preorder one but
it doesn't come out until June of next
year that's it for this tech news update
and there's more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
