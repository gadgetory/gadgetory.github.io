smart city is how to use that data to be
more effective as a government agency of
the will of people that's how I define
it Chicago is known for its
awe-inspiring skyscrapers and the
l-train that rises above the streets but
it's what's going on underground that's
helping transform it into a smart city
Chicago is literally digging deep to
build itself into a smart city one of
the main problems is incomplete
underground maps of the water sewer and
power lines
now the fix comes from a phone they can
take videos of construction sites to
help create a digital blueprint of the
city's underground so ultimately what we
want to get to is they have a
three-dimensional understanding of the
underground facilities in the future
when we're going to design the new gas
main that goes in we'll be able to
understand and anticipate where we can
lay that gas main it so then as they go
through here when they dig and excavate
they can anticipate our no other
electric power is so they don't hit or
damage it and what it causing an outage
underground mapping is just one of the
projects headed up by UI labs an
innovation accelerator with public
private and academic partners it's City
digital initiative focuses on improving
urban infrastructure throughout Chicago
Chicago is a leader in terms of
publishing data and as of a couple weeks
ago we became the first city in the
world to stream live data from green
infrastructure so the city of Chicago
has many areas that are in flood plains
create infrastructure elements our
treatment with the street level that can
divert stormwater and so with the
sensors are capturing is how much water
and a volume basis is being actually
diverted from heading into the sewer UI
Labs is also experimenting with sensors
and cameras to help buildings conserve
energy and use their space better what
this allows them to do is to turn real
time capture of how people are moving
through the building into essentially a
heat map because your data aggregated
that no one is using the south main
lobby between 4:00 and 10:00 p.m. on a
Saturday and you can power down the heat
and power down the lights
most of these programs are still in
their research or pilot phases but
Chicago does have a smart initiative set
to start on Labor Day the cities
connecting new LED streetlights to a
smart grid which will know when a light
is out or when the brightness needs to
be adjusted
but with Chicago's recent rash of
problems including an alarming number of
homicides and budget issues where does
smart technology fit into the city's
priorities we can do the things you need
to do while also doing some things that
are preparing for the future I don't
think it's either/or but you have to be
smart about it but it's not that easy
even Silicon Valley is struggling with
this stuff so why hasn't this all happen
a lot quicker Apple releases a new
iPhone every year after all well
transforming big cities like San
Francisco and Chicago is expensive the
imperfect is about big they are
Chicago's underground mapping project
for example is estimated to take more
than five years just to map the downtown
area and then there's the politics
getting a big city to be more nimble and
being able to use technology we're not
really built for dealing with individual
residents we kind of do it at mass if
it's something that helps people and not
a bunch of policy experts the public
will be supportive
still one thing's for sure technology is
changing our cities the next question
will be whether it was worth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
