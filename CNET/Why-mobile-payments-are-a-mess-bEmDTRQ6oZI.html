playing a mobile payment guessing game
do I top my phone to pay do I scan a
special app why after all these years in
the u.s. do mobile payments feel like
such a mess our vision is to replace
this and we're gonna start by focusing
on payments
that was 2014 I'm still fumbling with my
wallet most of the time has anything
really changed well we can now pay for
stuff in more ways pay with a watch pay
with a finger pay with your face or do
you still swipe or dip the chip no not
that chip this chip to find out where
all of this is heading I visited
mastercards tech hub in New York and I
found even more payment gadgets like
this ring yes a ring you put on your
finger but what good is a payment ring
if I still can't pay with my phone
everywhere terminals are contactless
today they have the capability it just
has to be turned on and merchants decide
whether or not they want to turn it on
you're only gonna see that continue to
grow with every device becoming a
commerce device so is it a demand
problem after talking to industry
experts and combing through reports it
seems there are a few layers to this
issue Apple pay is the most used mobile
payment more than half of all the retail
locations in the US let you pay with
your iPhone and generally speaking that
means all those stores also take of
their NFC payments like google pay but
even with Apple pay being accepted in
more places people in the u.s. just
aren't using
much the biggest thing holding people
back from using it is fear of hacking
even though Apple pay is safer and more
encrypted than just swiping a card and
there's so much benefit to using it if
the experience isn't always faster
sometimes you still have to deal with an
old payment machine that makes you sign
your name or enter a PIN number even
though you just gave it your fingerprint
or your face to prove you are you and if
it's not faster people just tend to fall
back on their old habits of pulling out
a credit card and you still carry your
wallet everywhere right because you have
to because not everywhere accepts all
types of mobile payments and that is
what everything falls apart
stores know you still carry around
plastic so why should companies invest
all this money updating their software
and systems to accept Apple pay instead
businesses are launching their own apps
like Walmart pay CBS pay target wallet
and of course there's the Starbucks app
the most successful of the bunch pay by
scanning your screen and you may get a
freebie for using it and stores keep
track of loyal customers even small
businesses are looking into custom apps
as the future my name is Dave Allen one
I'm executive chef of union fair
restaurant this popular lunch spot has
gone cashless the line moves fast with
employees swiping every card but despite
it going cashless mobile payments are
not accepted because you're dealing with
money it has to be a good technology in
place so any that's why it takes
sometimes a little bit of time to to
kind of integrate new technologies when
it comes to money because people need to
trust that it works that's the that's
the key to it
chef Lamont says it's a hassle to get
his software to work with multiple
payment systems and customers are just
not asking for Apple pay instead he'd
like to offer an app that can give us
customers something more well we want to
see if we can actually take it a step
further and say if you order a coffee
maybe we could actually give you like
the precise temperature
you want that coffee maybe you could
actually tell you exactly how many grams
of sugar you prefer in your coffee like
that's the next step in customization
when you're actually looking at using
technology to make these systems better
ordering ahead getting your perfect
custom coffee these are all great perks
for using mobile payments until you
realize that world means every place is
gonna want its own app just to know more
about its customers doesn't look like
mobile payments are getting smoother any
time soon that was hot
oh my tongue is burning yeah hey thanks
for watching do you still use a mobile
wallet do you have a favorite one or you
still pull out your credit card be sure
to share your story in the comments and
like and subscribe and click that little
bell so you can catch all my future
videos where I find answers to today's
common tech questions and yeah that's it
I'm just gonna I think play Jenga for
the rest of the day let's go let's do
