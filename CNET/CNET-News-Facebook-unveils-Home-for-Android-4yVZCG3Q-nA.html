experience for your phone it's a family
of apps and you can install it and it
becomes the home of your phone so we're
calling this home now we're going to
show you home this is an android phone
you've installed home on it and when you
turn it on here's what you're going to
see
alright let's pause this for a moment
now with home you see your world through
people not apps one of the most
important things that we do as people is
stay connected with what's going on in
the world around us so home is designed
specifically to help you do this so
let's say you're you're waiting in line
at the grocery store and you look down
and you see these beautiful immersive
updates of your friend finishing a bike
race or your family cooking a meal
together or news from your favorite
sports team you might have missed these
otherwise if you had to go into an appt
to see them but with home they're
brought right in front of you since home
is the lock screen in addition to the
home screen you don't need to do any
swipes or gestures in order to be able
to see this content and since and it's
all right there as soon as you look at
your phone because you've already loaded
all this content in the background while
your phone was sleeping so you can flip
through stories if you want and if you
find something that you like you can
double tap to like it right there you
can comment right there from the home
screen and one of the things that you're
going to notice is that all of the
interactions are just really smooth and
natural you know we wanted this to feel
like system software and not just an app
that you run and we feel like there's a
higher quality bar for that so we've
spent a lot of time building up
infrastructure and tooling in order to
make this the highest quality experience
that you're going to have on Android now
some updates are more important than
others and cover feed is great for being
able to stay on top of what's going on
with all the people you care about but
sometimes there's a more important
message and you want to get notified and
if your phone is designed around people
not apps then your notifications should
be too so let's say I get a message from
my friend I'm going to get a
notification with her face and her name
instead of an apps icon and the app's
name so I'm easily going to be able to
tell if this is a person who I want to
interact with now and if I do that I
could just tap on it to pull her up and
interact with her or if not i could just
swipe away to throw her away for now and
you know let's say there's a bunch of
people who are interacting them in I
don't to deal with this right now I can
just you know press on
it to grab them all and throw them away
if I want but a lot of the time you want
to get back to your notifications later
so you can also just dock them throw
them down and continue just browsing
your your cover feed so that's putting
people first in your phone but apps are
really important to so we want to design
home so that it's just as easy to get to
your apps using home as with any other
phone that you'll use it's just one
swipe away from the home screen or lock
screen so you pull up your lock screen
and and with one swipe you can bring up
your app so let's say that you want to
get directions to a restaurant that
you're going to go to what you do is you
put your finger on your face there at
the bottom and these options pop out for
apps messenger and the last step that
you're in you just swipe up and in there
your apps right there just one one swipe
away all your apps and you know the
launcher has pages and everything else
that you'd expect so you can go and you
can tap on maps to get your directions
then when you're done you just throw it
away and and your back to cover feed and
your friends content so that makes it
really easy to get to all of your apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
