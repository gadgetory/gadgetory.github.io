the HTC One mini it's a sleek all-metal
Android phone it's a little easier to
slip into your pocket now as the name
suggests the mini is smaller than the
previous HTC One its screen measures 4.3
inches which is knocking naught point 4
inches off the full-size model a van not
might seem like much but it actually
makes it much more comfortable to hold
in one hand in terms of its design is
not that much different from the
full-size version you'll see it still
has a full metal construction that feels
just as luxurious here as it did on the
previous model on the front are the same
two boomsound speakers now these gave a
really full sound for a phone on the
last one so hopefully they'll give just
as good performance here the screen
resolution has been knocked down to 720p
but the smaller size means it doesn't
take as many pixels to cram in to make
it look as sharp I've only had a brief
eyes on so far but it already looks
quite good it's powered by a dual rather
than quad-core processor but Qualcomm
reckons that it can still give very good
performance we'll have to wait until the
full review to see how it really stacks
up it comes running for latest Android
4.2.2 jelly bean software now it's big
brother has just seen an update to the
latest version so it is good to see that
this will be launching with the latest
software onboard you'll see the same HTC
Sense software with the big minimalist
tiles in the menus and the blinkfeed
scrolling news panel on your homescreen
around the back you'll see the same four
megapixel camera now HTC reckons that
the individual pixels have been made
physically larger which theoretically
gives better image quality overall I was
very impressed with this tech on the
normal HTC one so fingers crossed it
will be able to give at least comparable
performance so while the HTC One mini
doesn't have the same key specs as its
big brother it does have a sleek design
a great interface and it's a lot more
pocket-friendly there's no word on
pricing yet but hopefully we will be
getting a mid-range price to match
respects when it launches in the UK in
August I'm Andrew coil for CNET and this
is the HTC One mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
