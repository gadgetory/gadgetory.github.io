does everybody else I'm at Walt Disney
World in Orlando where next year we will
finally see what is Star Wars Galaxies
edge it is a whole new type of theme
park experience where you can't eat and
breathe and sleep all things Star Wars
there are a lot of Secrets but here's
what we know so far
Star Wars Galaxies edge is a 14 acre
themed area with two new rides a Cantina
restaurant loads of merchandise and you
can role play to live out your own Star
Wars story and interact with characters
this is currently being built inside two
of Disney's theme parks Disneyland in
California and Disney's Hollywood
Studios in Florida both areas will have
the same design but the California one
will open first in the summer of 2019
the one in Florida opens later in the
fall but Florida is getting something
extra
Disney is building a luxury Star Wars
hotel first though let's go into the
details of the land itself step inside
and you'll be on a whole new planet with
new creatures and characters yet there
will still be familiar Star Wars
elements it takes place on the planet
but - in a village called the black
spire outpost
it's a crossroads for traitors
adventurers and smugglers at the edge of
rogue space it's described as a haven
for the galaxy's most colorful and
notorious characters and a place to
avoid the expanding reach of the first
order the spires are the petrified
remains of the ancient trees the one
that's the most notable is called the
black spire it's become a landmark as
travelers will tell folks to meet them
at the black spire Disney is weaving
this new world into other Star Wars
stories - the upcoming novel Thrawn
alliances makes references to the planet
but - but let's get to the rides in one
you'll be boarding a resistance troop
transport and you'll wind up on a Star
Destroyer making you feel like you're
inside a hangar bay in the middle of a
battle between the first order and the
resistance and you'll encounter two
full-size 8080 walkers it's been
described as the most epic attraction
Disney ever designed
in the second ride you go aboard the
Millennium Falcon sitting in the cockpit
of Han Solo's famous ship flipping
switches and shooting blasters to
control it yourself
Disney is working with NVIDIA for
technology that can render the graphics
of your flight in real time your
performance will determine your ending
if you've been to Disney you may have
written another Star Wars simulator ride
Star Tours but that's been around for
decades
the point is it's gonna be way more
advanced than anything in the Star Tours
ride
how you do on the ride will even follow
you back in the land so if you banged up
the ship you may find yourself in
trouble at the cantina and yes there's a
Cantina restaurant serving up blue milk
fans of the original Star Tours ride may
also recognize the Droid working at the
cantina Captain Rex Rex is back he's got
a new role and he's going to be a DJ at
the cantina so maybe it would be a
better DJ than a star speeder bike
somewhere in the land you'll also run
into nine dub he's a Rebel Alliance
pilot from Return of the Jedi and the
force awakens a few other classic
characters will also be there like
Chewbacca and bb-8 again your secret
plans for the new Star Wars world inside
yeah I guess not the street and market
place will be packed with details and
unique smells there's a marketplace run
by a Toydarian that's a species from the
Phantom Menace you'll also find a
creature stall where different beasts
from literature will come to life and
there will be some you can take home one
of the creatures on display will be the
lost cats from the Star Wars rebels
animated series but let's not forget
about the hotel it will be a luxury
resort attached to the Star Wars land in
Florida every guest will depart together
in a multi-day adventure set on a
starship every window has a view of
space and you are encouraged to dress up
in the proper attire your experience may
vary depending on the choices you make
during your stay you can count on Disney
using technology to bring it all to life
and you may find some clues by looking
at Disney's patent application filings
Disney applied for a patent for layered
screen displays and the screens are
interactive maybe these could be used
for cool space window effects there's a
patent filed to create the illusion of
scene blaster fire that can travel
through the air maybe you'll see that in
a ride and there's a patent for making
3d images float in the air by bouncing
off reflective surfaces so are we
getting Holograms or force ghosts the
site wdw news today was the first to
report on these but patent applications
don't necessarily mean these will become
reality but here
is something real little droid units are
being tested in Disneyland roaming
around guests beeping and posing for
pictures this one is called Jake or j4k
3 will he be in galaxy's edge we won't
know until it opens so what do we do
well we have to wait a whole year we can
use our imaginations right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
