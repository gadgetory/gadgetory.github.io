Jimmy Valencia he's a
licensed private investigator and
polygraph examiner he's come here today
shows the latest in lie detection
equipment this is the older workhorse
still being used but it's the wind-up
watch version if you will okay so this
is the new one
that's correct what we have here is a
regular laptop computer which takes that
old information and converts all the
signals into digital okay
we've taken Ryan Seacrest into custody
and we're gonna pump him for all the
information we can the question that I'm
going to ask you Ryan is regarding the
first time that you ever had sex I need
you on a piece of paper to write down
where that place actually was my mom
watches the show Jimmy you're killing me
we're gonna take her out to dinner
tonight fine okay
so already ready to do the test Oh Kent
regarding where the place was but you
first had sex or that place in the park
no where's that place haunted roller
coaster
no where's that in your girlfriend's
house now
was it in a rose garden no is it true
that you and your friend David when you
were young played a game called little
newscasters no is it true that at age
seven you will lost your bathing suit in
a swimming pool now and my guess the
first time that you ever had sex is that
your girlfriend's house now it's Ramos
