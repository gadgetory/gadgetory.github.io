I've seen that scar Savoy joined by
senior writer Shara tip caen and we are
here outside of the Moscone Center in
San Francisco to talk about Apple's
Worldwide Developers Conference starting
next week jun 2nd through six yes annual
conference yes what are we expecting
this year a lot of software um you know
we're not really expecting a lot of
hardware out of this event if any but
software is going to be the story for
the whole show and we're talking iOS and
OS updates yes for sure and actually
this time around people are thinking
there's gonna be more done with OS 10
okay then with iOS right his last year
we saw iOS 7 and ass and that was pretty
new and Ashley a complete redesign you
know her Johnny I've versus the old team
so this time around he's getting his
hands on the Mac operating system so you
know it's supposed to get a different
kind of look but I'm also still be
distinct from iOS is what people are
thinking ok so that's pretty much a
definite sure thing enough yes yeah ok
what are some of the maybes that you're
expecting yeah one of the things we've
heard about is a home automation which
could be really interesting this is an
area you know that Google is getting
into it nest Samsung has started to
focus on your kind of everybody is
looking at this is kind of the next
frontier like the home so Apple doing
something there could be pretty
interesting it's it's not exactly clear
how this would work but it'd probably be
something that you can control with your
iphone or ipad and you know possibly
using Apple TV in there as well
interesting and what about health and
fitness obviously everyone wants to get
into that place is it apples turn this
time around I don't think we're gonna
see an iWatch here you know that that's
something that everybody's kind of
waiting for but I think that that's
probably more likely in time for the
holidays but you know I think we're
going to see at like a sort of health
book type of program that collects all
of your fitness data in one location
kind of like the apple passbook sure ok
and what about automated payments I know
Apple hasn't really jumped into that on
their own yet yeah is this the time
mobile payments you know there's there's
rumors that in the next iPhone will
include NFC which could be a really big
deal yeah you know Samsung is the one
who's really pushed this sort of thing
you know but they also have hourly done
much with mobile payments mobile
payments is something that's kind of a
promise for a really long time but
hasn't really happened you know Apple is
someone who could you know help move
this forward but you know whether this
happens right now or later this year is
kind of the question and speaking of
later this year this is typically not
the conference to release any big you
know iphone ipad updates yeah you expect
that to be the same yeah exactly yeah I
mean I I would say with almost certainty
that there will not be an iphone you
know like there's there's some talk
about possible smaller capacity iPhones
being announced but I also don't think
that that's probably going to happen
either you know apples going to save
that kind of stuff for later this year
okay and what about a tablet air the
macbook Oh new news on that front I
don't think so you know they just
updated the air with some new processors
you know I think in April so seeing
something there isn't very likely at
this point you know people are waiting
for an air with retina display right so
when that happens you know that's kind
of the next big push for the air you
know as far as max then the next big
Intel processor is late this year yeah
at best for holiday so you know if
they're updating the machines right now
it's not going to be as much of a change
you know Intel could possibly do some
like special special tweaks to its
current chip line for Apple but you know
I think that a really big update for any
of the pcs would be later this year or
early next year so really sounds like
2014 WWDC sort of follows in the
footsteps of previous years yeah for
sure software yeah yeah I mean I think
it's gonna look a lot like last year
minus the mac pro announcement you know
they released their brand new really
high-end PC there and I I don't think
that we're gonna see anything quite like
that but basically the rest of WWDC 2013
is a lot what we're gonna see this year
but you never know I've always a Sephora
never now everyone can follow along with
