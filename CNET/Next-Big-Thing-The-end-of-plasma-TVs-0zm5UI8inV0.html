now I'm gonna bet that plasma is either
not on your list or a low on your list
makes for an interesting story about how
the next big thing is bumping the last
best thing this is my favorite TV for
2013 the reason is because it provides
excellent picture quality for the money
given that the number of plasmas is
shrinking this TV almost gets a
recommendation by default I like the
understated design of the ST 60 although
it's not quite as slick as some of the
LCD TVs out there the F 8500 exhibits
the extremely deep black levels in very
accurate color but the thing that sets
it apart from those other plasma TVs is
its light output this thing can get
extremely bright almost as bright as
some LED TVs and of course that really
helps its picture quality in rooms where
you can't control ambient lighting I'll
let you in on a little secret if you
were to go to the homes of CNET's
television editors you'd find plasmas on
the wall in fact take a look at our list
of the best televisions at any given
moment and the top handful are usually
plasmas in fact they're usually
Panasonic plasmas
but that company has pulled the plug on
its plasma operation leaving Samsung and
LG left to read that writing on the wall
and possibly interpret it the same way
it's dire times for a TV we think is the
best LED LCD is king plasma is this
thinning little sliver an OLED which
many talk about is the next big thing
has years to go before it's gonna hit
really big market numbers just based on
cost alone according to display search
data now it's important to remember here
that 4k or Ultra HD is not a display
type it's a level of resolution so it's
kind of a different discussion but it
relates to plasmas apparent demise
because it turns out it's very difficult
and very expensive to re-engineer
current plasma technology to get those
little gas tubes that make up the screen
small enough and functional to show that
many pixels on a given display size a
key lesson coming out here is one that
we've seen repeatedly in consumer
electronics consumers move away from
being in pursuit of excellence so much
to being in pursuit of adequacy
convenience and a low price prices come
down brutally while quality and features
go up dramatically we all benefit but in
this case plasma is getting squeezed out
specifically we as consumers
right now caught up in lightness
thinness a degree of greenness with
things like LCD television plasma
doesn't fit those new roles nor does it
have shiny new object qualities about it
it leverages something of an old-school
characteristic and that is just great
picture quality it's a turnover of the
crown of the next big thing not the last
time with all your sale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
