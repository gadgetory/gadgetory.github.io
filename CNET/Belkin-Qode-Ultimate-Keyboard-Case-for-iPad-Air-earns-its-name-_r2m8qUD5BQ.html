looking at iPad air accessories keyboard
oriented to be specific you don't need a
keyboard for your iPad now the Belkin
quote or code ultimate keyboard case for
the iPad air cost $130 so that's not
cheap but what it does is provide a
combination of a case and the Bluetooth
keyboard and a few extra really nice
features that set it over the top
the ultimate keyboard case for the last
gen iPads was one of my favorite
accessories in the iPad landscape this
one is thinner it's more compact and it
also has the same set of features that I
liked before namely the keyboard feels
good and it also has not just a magnetic
auto on pairing system but it also has
three different adjustable angles which
is extremely rare to find and comes in
handy if your lap' typing or working at
any cramped angles on an airplane which
you often do working on an ipad this
actually folds flat and you can carry it
around it's it's it's okay although it
will significantly increase the
thickness and weight of your iPad it's
almost a pound this accessory
considering the iPad air is a pound you
are talking about suddenly making this
kind of a 2 pound device but considering
the last iPad was 1.4 pounds and an
accessory push it well over 2 pounds
you're sort of gaining some savings
there and it feels a little more
reasonable than carrying a keyboard case
before there's a nice solid metal base
this part is a plastic case that snaps
onto your iPad probably the most fragile
feeling part of this equation but look
at this you snap it here right there and
then automatically now it is connected
it is paired why is that important well
because once you unpair it and put it
down here in the tablet mode you will
not be accidentally pressing the keys
underneath they no longer function once
this is unpaired that only happens when
it's connected right up here you've got
three different modes slightly subtle
there but again you go from that
elevation all the way up to that
elevation which can make the difference
when you're typing here Oh something
it's a little bit better or if I'm
cramped and leaning over maybe you want
a little more
than saying that subtle but I found over
time that that makes a difference and
the fact that this case is pretty
compact and has one of the better kind
of netbook like keyboards out there that
does not compress keys that much unlike
the logitech fabric skin keyboard folio
that i looked at recently which does
this is not splash resistant but it
feels great and if you want a protective
backside to your case then this is
probably one of the best that's out
there
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Belkin code ultimate keyboard case for
the iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
