at reusable rockets and we'll tell you
how the launch went the Golden Globes
happen last night and they gave major
awards to streaming services and that's
big news they want to talk about that
and also Disney research is testing a
robot who's creating giant works of art
in sand oh those little kids are gonna
be out of a job yeah suck it kids sera
daily
greetings citizen to the internet and
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe we're
back we're back we're back that's the
first quote you wanted to say I get kids
suck your kids all right right there
there little sand buckets yeah it's just
like you get so mad smells like the
Holly Little Billy yeah there's take it
up all those real estate on the beach
you get real annoyed I don't know it's
like I want to go hang out in the water
without having to accidentally kick over
some kids sam cassell that's like some
first world problems anyway so yeah
we're back hopefully you guys got to
join us for our SI CES coverage yes cnet
if you weren't aware I'm Ashley sceva
and this is kale anonymous do not say
that I didn't yeah okay all right but I
just did so we're good yeah so you
should check some of that out we got to
cover some of the future tech that was
at CES I'm everybody else was covering
like cell phones and televisions and we
got spider dress yeah Oh spider dress
showed up yeah spiders are showing up
tour with it was really really strike
check out that content and it's it's
episodes 109-108 107 it was a lot of fun
and for now though win special guests we
did we had special guests justjust
chobot trisha hershberger and jon
rettinger we're pretty delightful
SourceFed Nerdist technobuffalo is all
really good thanks any of you that we're
watching live appreciate that come on we
can feel it in our brains when you're
watching live and in our hearts watching
right now so I can filter you are so
let's hit the headlines
alright so we have to talk about SpaceX
oh no listen this was gonna have to do
bummer what kind of okay so I'll explain
why so SpaceX has been wanting to make
reusable rockets and this is actually
kind of a big deal in terms of
commercial space travel tourism things
like that because if you can make a
reusable rocket then the cost of doing
things in space becomes much much
cheaper obviously you don't have to keep
rebuilding a new rocket every time
recycle reduce or do we use yeah I got
she got the clothes the clothes the
chain so SpaceX had last week planned a
launch in the middle of the week that
they scrapped and then it actually went
down on Saturday instead so we were
sleeping through the weekend after CES
but here is the rocket launch this is
Falcon 9 and the point of this mission
was to send a cargo capsule up to the
international space station so they
launched a rocket send this cargo
capsule up and then and then and this is
the important part land on a floating
pad in the middle in the Atlantic Ocean
and it's not that big not very big at
all i think the entire pad is like a
hundred bite 300 feet it wasn't very big
and that but the target was like 10
meters by 10 meters so it's 30 by 30 and
then tiny don't want to catch it so they
can reuse it okay they want to land it
there there goes my night and so how'd
it go so uh two out of three not bad it
launched it sent the carbon capsule up
sweet but crashed into the landing pad
not on the not on the target how close
um well it was on the landing pad so I
would imagine like within you know 300
feet okay which isn't terrible yeah Elon
Musk even tweeted he was like he said
close but no cigar this time bodes well
for the future though and that's the
thing so would say that so here's here's
the deal with this space extang the they
actually had originally said that there
is maximum of fifty percent chance of
this being successful so they were
actually kind of expecting it to fail
but here's the important part is that
and this is very important life lesson
everybody listening is that failure is
an important part of learning yeah and
so they're learning a lot based on this
failure and they're hoping I love how
they described this this is my favorite
they likened hitting this bullseye on
this floating
had to quote trying to balance a rubber
broom stick on your hand in the middle
of a windstorm so that's pretty tough I
mean I yell does it every week like an
old woman came up with that metaphor
some Elon Musk's grandma okay she told
but it's pretty cool that it didn't land
failure kind of a plant failure did get
very close and it looks like you know
SpaceX now has a lot more data that's
going to enable them to hopefully make
the next version of this a success or
even maybe just a closer success so I'm
sure they're already parsing through all
of the information that they got out of
this out of this rocket launch but you
know I say good job I think that you
know like glucose saying failures kind
of the way forward sometimes in science
you got it there's the way of life yeah
a little me keep learning let's go
nobody matter nobody didn't fail nobody
hasn't failed that's a failed in that
sentence but I learned something but you
did and now you're gonna get it right
but now I'm gonna get it right what with
the next door so we're gonna get it no
but I mean I thought you were just gonna
say the next loads but you know buddy
doesn't fail everybody does fail good
see now you learned yes props perfect
example okay now tell me about pho we
all watch the Golden Gloves last night
didn't we I mean well well I mean like I
watched it but I don't think everybody
watched a lot of people are turned off
by award shows but i would i would
debate that the golden globes are the
most entertaining of them because you're
not it's it's formal but it's not stuffy
so right well they're all a given
alcohol at the tables they all have
tables they can all talk to each other's
an oscars where they're just seated like
in a movie theater it's true like very
friendly everyone gets into it and
people get drunk which is always really
fun yeah BuzzFeed had people doing
breathalyzers oh that's exciting that's
us next year but anyway yeah so it was I
think it was the 72nd annual glitter I
think okay so I and I don't yep it's
worth it is now Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
third year in a row rushed it amazing
killed a funny they did they did a joke
that was a little offensive to everybody
but that's not what works I know okay we
are here to talk about the fact that
some of the biggest winners were
streaming services yeah amazon it lb I'm
an Amazon and Netflix thank you for life
it's very very the legs I am sorry God
that being amazon and and netflix amazon
winning with transparent their show
this shows been getting a lot of really
good notices ya seen it yet yeah it's
it's really good and that also jeffrey
tambor who played the main character in
transparent also won big wind he had a
great speech he think you know he
thanked the transgender community but
the fact that these streaming services
are winning big awards big deal against
these like you know giant print like
British companies is is so good for the
progress of entertainment on the
internet or in kind of cord cutting and
and putting this stuff back in our hands
you know because now everything is
happening on your you know your
streaming device quality entertainment
on streaming devices I think it's a
really important thing is like Kevin
Spacey also won last night best actor in
a drama for house of cards finally long
overdue I ever do ever do but finally
got us do on this and and honestly this
is a huge deal in terms of you're
getting you're getting content like
house of cards orange is the new black
transparent you're getting all these
great bits of scripted television from
streaming services that are
self-producing you know and distributing
that content not on your television and
this is a huge deal right Kayla me
during a big cord cutter I'm a huge cord
cutter and I've always seen these new
these new companies like Netflix and
Amazon as risk takers they don't really
have a whole lot to lose and they're
putting a lot of money out there cuz
they want to try and create this content
and they're creating it specifically for
us if you didn't know house of cards was
made through an algorithm of finding out
what people are watching on Netflix
finding out that they watch a lot of
Kevin Spacey movies that they're
watching a lot of political political a
lot of political dramas and they siphon
that all together and they created house
of cards which is so cool amazon is is
deciding they want to go all kinds of
different directions with creating like
a transgender show like these very
diverse very severe make like not
risk-taking but they're very smart moves
i say the risky risky in the sense of
traditional tea exactly absolutely i
think well the show you're never gonna
see on you know fox like you're not
gonna see that show and think about the
youth of the think about the way that we
consume things and and how much more
we're consuming off of mine
heck probably about sixty percent of you
are watching this show on a mobile
device that's usually about yantis ting
so you got to think of the way that
we're consuming this and the youth they
age of these digital companies is like
two three four or five years really yeah
really short about young I mean work so
this is really good really exciting I'm
overly excited about it because these
sorts of outlets are so exciting to me
no it's super thrilling their money
hoping to like cut the border you guys
this content yeah we just on this this
is our home so it's really interesting
to us you probably consume a lot of
content on there you're probably not
sitting there watching TV now DVRs are
the future anyway boxes DVR it's all
that so that brings us to our hashtag is
a day sorry Michelle gets really into
this topic you guys if you ever see him
at an event talk him up about
cord-cutting he gets super into it okay
um ok so our hashtag today today is TD
Globes and I want to know what your
favorite non should not not JLo not JLo
that was another coach that's a pretty
good joke super sexist but I laughed um
what was your favorite non-traditional
show of 2014 so what on streaming
services was your favorite show oh well
I watched a lot of shows that were like
on cable that i streamed this black
mirror account um I think so cuz you
can't find it on our you can't find it
on our cable networks yeah like it
doesn't is an error there so I watch a
lot of YouTube so I watch a lot of quite
highly produced you to show that's
non-traditional exactly so I watch a lot
of stuff like would you give a Golden
Globe to on YouTube what'swhat's just so
good that you got to give it an award uh
you go first let me give me a second to
think oh wait no no there's this guy
that makes this less called uh it's
called top ten memes and it's it's not
top ten names but he does top ten lists
of like valve or he did an Illuminati
like a whole bunch of different types of
but they're really they're really
interesting give it a shot like go look
at his list but it's there really
interest they're not like click Beatty
they're very very well done interesting
so I do you like orange is the new black
so good yeah so so good good choice I'm
so that's your hashtag a day and then
we're gonna hit this third story really
briefly because it's adorable and I want
to talk about it before we go to break
well yeah you gotta have some break
adorable we got to talk about this
besides Ashley ha ha ha yeah hilarious
2015 your the compliments well your
compliments time you guys are great
that's look amazing have you been
working out you look like you've lost a
little bit of ways are you know a good
um okay so Disney research Zurich we've
talked about them before they did the
eyeball the creepy eyeball remember the
rendered eyeball oh yeah ok they're back
but they have something a little bit
less creepy and kind of adorable now
it's called it's like a beach spot and
and what this is is we have footage of
this it's adorable it's a little tiny
robot that can draw art in the sand and
so it's a the people who created or like
sand is a totally reusable medium this
is a canvas that can be wiped clean and
start over with all over again without
having to waste anything the robot has
Wi-Fi it has an inertial measurement
unit and laser scanner on board and what
it does is you put four poles on the
beach that sort of gives it its
boundaries as a canvas and it uses a
rake to draw in the sand so that you can
like program it and tell it exactly what
you want it to make so here it is making
this really beautiful kind of spirograph
design cool the tires are designed to
not leave heavy tracks in the sand so
you won't see like the driving of it
it's just the rake part and they
unfortunately they still have to is
there's one of the looks imbecile
linking they still have to manually
adjust the robots path for really big
drawings like they'll have to readjust
it but someday they want you to be able
to just upload any picture you want to
this robot and then have the robot
compute a path and then draw it
completely autonomously which is pretty
cool so here it is drawing Nemo which I
thought was awesome so this is their own
is this like their own little invention
which is pretty cool um there they said
that someday their goal is to create art
as large as the Nazca lines if you're
familiar with those of really big Nazca
lines or Nazca I'm not sure how it's
pronounced um but yeah so I thought this
was just super awesome that's the beach
bot you can check it out online I think
it's super cool and just something
really interesting and weird and fun
like and if technology is not fun then
why why would it exists right if it is
so fun so that's really cool so let's uh
let's take a quick break let's come back
we have a really awesome a concept for
backcolor hackett that even kale was
really into but it might be a little bit
pricey so stick around and don't click
away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show welcome back we
we didn't get to do back at her hackett
at CES that's true but i'm really glad
that we're coming back in 2015 with this
this is our first one officially like in
the studio back at her hackett that's
kind of exciting so on this is Becker
Hackett
okay Kel bear with me imagine a world
where you turn on your television in
your playing what's your favorite
first-person shooter on console times
TimeSplitters 3 okay you're playing time
splitters 3 okay you got it on your
television you're playing yeah and then
all of a sudden everything around your
television including all of the walls in
your room turns into timesplitters 3 all
around you oh that's awesome because it
takes place in different time periods
yeah and so you can just raise okay all
right so we've kind of heard of this
technology with Microsoft's illumiroom
but this this one in particular is
taking it to a whole new level
apparently supposedly allegedly this is
called immerses and so this is to be
used with video games photospheres so if
you have an android device or if you use
the photos for your app on iOS and
panoramic videos this is a projection
like I said not unlike Microsoft's
illumiroom but it's really cool because
it's a real-time adaptation of the image
to the shape and size of the room you're
in it's using an optical system that
connects your computer and I'll project
any 3d made content in 180 degrees so
not full 360 degree in Russian so it has
to be three already be 3d like for a 3ds
if it's a flat image it will display
this flat like a flat projection the one
thing I really like about this is it
also integrates your TV monitor or
tablet into the projection so let's say
you have your TV if you are playing a
game it will keep playing the game in
the middle of your screen and then
readjust the room based on that so
here's the very very ad review if the
room is bigger it will adjust that see
it just showed you it will readjust it
very contextual which is pretty cool it
is a compatible of unity 3d so there is
already a plugin for content created
with unity the unity engine Wow there is
an unreal engine plugin already in beta
so they're really not messing around
with this as far as I saw on the
Kickstarter page it looks like they were
they have some some pretty good interest
from folks like nvidia which is a pretty
big deal oh and delivery starts in May
of this year so actually pretty soon
yeah but you didn't say a price at all I
didn't and here's the thing guys it's
gonna be kind of expensive yeah it's a
giant projector before k for
really give trick okay so it starts at i
believe the the backer like early bird
is already all gone the first two early
birds so it's going to be 1200 starting
like right now okay then it goes up to
but it says like save $1,500 so i think
even like when you get when it releases
i think they're from what I saw it looks
like they're looking at selling it for
like over two grand for the bat and the
development kit like you get a dev kit
and all the other stuff but yeah I don't
know it's a little pricey but but here's
the thing for the for the upwardly
mobile gaming connoisseur is this
something that they would buy I feel
like maybe it is for two grand I mean
it's like that's expensive for a lot of
people including me but on that same
note there are a lot of people with a
lot of cash to burn who would be like
that's really cool i want that my living
room just like somebody would buy a
really expensive surround sound system
or it's around the same price as that
like a starter surrounds like really
high quality surround sound you'd pay
around that price that's what I'm saying
that's all just contact Major Case made
my case yeah but it is a little pricey
for the average gamer who's like a sixty
dollars is expensive for a game comment
how much do they need for this Girardi
as far as they'd seen this morning they
already halfway there I think they were
asking for like a hundred grand or
something what like it's not a lot but
they weren't asking for a lot yeah but
they have a feeling it's gonna be a
pretty limited run if that's all they're
asking for like the first but they're
already like 50,000 because I don't
they're gonna go away so what do you
what is yours back at her Hackett I say
if you have the money I highly recommend
that you get one as Ferris Bueller would
say but if you don't if you don't have
the money it's okay wait because I have
a feeling we're gonna see stuff like
this in the next like year or two come
down way in price and you're gonna be
able to get it with like you know a
connect that on or something like that
that's what I think so right now I'm
gonna say no okay I say wait okay save
your money yeah buy some extra games I
unless you have to have it right this
second oh boy what people have to adopt
3d first I can't that's too i can't
really support this until like there's
not enough good not gonna be enough 3d
stuff to immerse yourself in when you
buy this thing for like 5 million dollar
see this so oculus is supposedly coming
out later this year between let's say
around the time of the ships yeah and
the end of the year right may to
december november holiday season so
let's say you had one of these and you
could experience that 3d content that
was made for oculus which isn't
flourishing right now I mean like
there's a lot of cut up will ya will ya
can catch on right it will I do want to
be a first adopter that's the question
really man no you don't care that I
don't think most people carry no but i
will say for a hundred thousand it's
that's not that bad if you want to get
in on this I think it's a hundred
thousand i really hope it is should I
check should I feel like I said just get
a 4k TV or projector so can't afford a
projector so for right now I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say Hackett I know we rarely
we rarely do thumbs down sorry show no I
have no problem with the tech like I
think we should be supporting that kind
of I don't do it but they 100 grand and
they get idea where I thought I like
I've always wanted to be the rich guy
that has a projector that shows his
screen thank you invite people are Roma
we're not little idiots like me but
that's not what we're not that's called
in our dreams it's gonna be in like five
years like we'll have this may be in
five years I'll be able to get an oculus
experience that will enable me to feel
as if I'm a rich plainly a rich person
yeah that would be really nice and drown
out my world with whatever animal yeah
it's totally okay cool on that note I
think we got to talk about you guys
let's never use a feedback
last week we asked you guys at CES use
the hashtag TV CES cars to tell us what
you need in your car of the future
what's the thing and so there were a lot
of really cool concept cars that see ya
I'm sidharth wrote to us and said in my
next car I want to have wireless
charging on the dashboard so that I can
charge my phone not to hook up with
cables oh yeah cuz it's like that yeah
it's like you had to go porns him haha
like all these wires are so true sherry
wrote to us and said I really want a
future car to be eco-friendly have free
Wi-Fi but most of all be comfortable and
driverless like that oh wow every road
observos cars man a free Wi-Fi that's
good to good I Tony wrote to us and said
I want my car to do everything kit can
do especially turbo boost and drive by
itself haha I can't I can't do that Tony
I'm sorry Jerome lastly wrote to us and
said proper automated climate control
home systems have done it for ages very
simple and then also included this
lovely picture of a french bulldog we
asked came to photoshop we asked you
guys in Photoshop us as French bulldogs
last Thursday us and John render from
technobuffalo in honor of his french
bulldog Lucy who is adorable um so yeah
great work to Rome yeah high five not
only did you answer the you answered the
call to TD CES cars you also sent us a
French Bulldog Photoshop he already had
that photo arm amazing he just made it
just cuz that he's been waiting for his
moment he's like finally use my french
bulldog Photoshop that I've been sitting
on since July yeah well I mean there's
