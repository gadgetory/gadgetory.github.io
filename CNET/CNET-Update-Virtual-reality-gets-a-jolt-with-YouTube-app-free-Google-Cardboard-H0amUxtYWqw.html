really cares right now I'm Bridget Carey
this is your seat at update there's
quite a bit of news lately about virtual
reality and I think it's time we have an
honest talk about the tech which is so
often overhyped now the idea of putting
on a headset to step into a virtual
world sounds mega cool is what sci-fi
dreams are made of but in actuality the
technology isn't all that fantastic
right now this is the Samsung gear VR
now this cost a hundred dollars but you
also you to put your smartphone inside
of the front otherwise it just looks
like a pair of really cool goggles now
samsung says are coming out with a new
version of this by november and it'll
come with an app and you can watch vimeo
and twitch videos so that it looks like
you're watching these videos in a
virtual theater with you and your
friends sitting in seats and the screen
ahead of you in the distance there are
some top-of-the-line gaming machines
that don't use a smartphone coming next
year Facebook's oculus rift is coming in
early 2016 and Sony's PlayStation VR is
also coming next year and some early
demos I can tell you it only takes a few
minutes for people to start to feel
dizzy when playing games maybe you can
last for 30 minutes at best but even
though we're in these early stages tech
companies are still really eager to push
virtuality as the next big advancement
that we won't be able to imagine living
without people don't even like going to
3d movies so I don't know 3d headsets
are going to be essential but right now
it is something that you can pop on for
a minute for a quick experience and
that's where google cardboard comes in
so cheap head said to give you a taste
of what's to come you can pick it up for
around three bucks on ebay it's made of
plastic lenses and velcro holds it
together your phone just sits in the
front and apps will split the screen in
two so you can see in 3d the New York
Times just launched a VR app so you can
immerse yourself in 360 degree video
photos from environments of their
stories and everyone that still
subscribes to a physical newspaper is
going to get one of these cardboard
headsets included with weekend delivery
now to be ready for over a million
people getting google cardboard
youtube announced that its app for
android is going to support virtual
reality video there are a few YouTube vr
videos made already like The Hunger
Games experience which takes you through
recreated movie scenes and if a video
isn't made for VR it'll just look like
you're watching it on a movie theater
screen in the distance it's going to
take some great VR content to get people
to want to give it a try and then maybe
people won't mind spending a little more
on a better headset as long as it
doesn't make them too dizzy we'll see
how that plays out next year that's it
for this tech news update and there's
more cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
