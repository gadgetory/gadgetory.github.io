could become a video game controller but
here I am pretending to fly a toy doll
to control my character in a mobile game
this is light seekers and it's not an
easy game to explain it's not really
fair to just call it a game it combines
smart toys and collectable cards to
create this unique layered universe of
play there's also augmented reality and
comic books thrown into the mix it's a
bit much to take in all at once so let
me break it down for you this is Mari
she's one of the lights seeker heroes
that you can play in the game her 7-inch
action figure starter pack cost $70 and
it lights up and talks and has motion
sensors to know when you're moving her
around or flipping her upside down
come on cute right you can snap
different weapon accessories to her
hands and the toy knows what type of
weapon she is holding she comes with one
weapon but other accessories cost 15
bucks each
this is tie racks and he's another
character and when you're ready to jump
in the action figures sync up with the
mobile game which can be played on any
iOS or Android device
now as you play you'll notice your toy
lights change colors depending on what's
happening whatever weapon the toys
holding is the weapon you're fighting
with in the game and if you get to the
flight level well you can pick up your
toy as if it's flying and use it to
navigate through the level but that's
only if you have the flight pack wing
accessory yeah that's right another
accessory and just you wait mom and dad
because there's much more for you to
purchase in this light seekers universe
if you buy the collector cards you can
scan those into the game to use as bonus
attacks or even bring in helper friends
to battle enemies there are more than
385 collectible printed cards which can
be played as a standalone card game a
starter deck is $20 so that's the basic
run-through of this weird new world of
play but there are many more layers
designed to keep the game fresh for kids
and encourage them to engage with
friends toys arrests will be the first
retailer to sell the assortment of light
seekers products with online pre-orders
