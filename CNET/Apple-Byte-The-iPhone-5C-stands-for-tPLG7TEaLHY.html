welcome to the Apple bite it's all the
good bad inside the world of Apple put
together like a packed lunch and that's
really what my lunches look like
isn't that Totoro so cute all right
let's get to the show and we start with
the next gen iPad Mini a report from
nine to five Mac says references in the
iOS 7 SDK indicate Apple is currently
working on an a6 processor based iPad
Mini without a Retina display it's the
first real details we've heard outside
of supply chain rumors but according to
the report the big a is considering
three models with the code names j75 j76
and j77
the rumored retina iPad Mini has been
referenced with codename J 85 in the
past now the references also indicate
the processor will be the same ASIC
system on a chip that's inside Apple's
iPhone 5 now the iPhone 5 and 4th gen
iPad both had hooks for images that were
at twice the resolution supporting the
Retina displays but the current findings
in the iOS 7 software development kit
indicate they aren't present for this
new iPad Mini which even more strongly
suggests the lack of a Retina display
this time around
now again we'll just have to wait around
the september/october timeframe to find
out because honestly right now no one
can touch the new Nexus 7 alright
earlier in the week the Apple product
you couldn't avoid hearing about was the
rumored low-cost iPhone 5c with images
and hands-on videos everywhere
that's the name being thrown around
after an image posted on Chinese website
way phone appears to show plastic retail
packaging with the name iPhone 5c now
we've seen all the rumored color options
for this low-cost iPhone so the C might
logically refer to the word color
because that sounds like a real catchy
name the iPhone 5 color but that's no
fun so I asked you guys this week on my
Twitter what does the C an iPhone 5c
stand for well Alex to Bailey says
Costco because it's cheap and I'm okay
with that if I could get free food
samples because I've actually been able
to have a whole lunch there
now Cole Kuiper said iphone5 coconut
hill Cabrera said iPhone 5 because Steve
is gone and not there to stop it that
one burned kike mr. Gucci said gotta be
cronut and if you don't know a cronut is
this hybrid croissant doughnut that's
all the craze right now and D flow hood
called it the iPhone 5 catastrophe for
Apple and Apple fans and that's another
brutal one all right now you know the
phone game is extremely competitive and
especially overseas Apple needs a
cheaper solution for markets like China
now Reuters confirmed that Apple CEO Tim
Cook traveled to China to talk to China
Mobile chairman Zhi Guo hua to talk
about better cooperation between the two
China Mobile is the world's largest
carrier and the only major Chinese
carrier that doesn't have a deal with
Apple to distribute the iPhone wait you
guys I just realized we're gonna call it
the iPhone 5 Chinese like me
all right in other Apple news the fourth
beta for iOS 7 was released to
developers with some interface tweaks
like a redesigned lockscreen with a
changing highlight color and arrow and
subtle updates across the board in other
apps developer Hamzah suit has also
found an accessibility portion of iOS 7
called biometric kit UI that contains
details for using a fingerprint sensor
on an iPhone it's the best real clue
we've seen that Apple will potentially
include a fingerprint sensor in the
phone after their acquisition of mobile
security firm authentic last year and a
report from the China Times makes claims
for an October launch for Apple's
MacBook Pros featuring Intel's latest
Haswell chip set that's already made it
into the MacBook Airs now the pros are
expected to feature Intel's highest end
iris pro 5200 integrated graphics and
during the recent earnings call October
was also the month CFO Peter Oppenheimer
hinted at four apples next batch of
announcements all right to the quickie
bytes according to the app Annie Index
which measures app store activity the
Google Play Store surpassed Apple's App
Store for the very first time in app
downloads in the second quarter of 2013
now Google had 10% more app downloads
but Apple's App Store brought in over 2
times the amount
revenue and it's just something to keep
an eye on and we talked about the
chromecast streaming stick last week it
has a ton of potential but if you still
would rather have an Apple TV now is a
great time to get a refurbished one
Apple just lower the price to $75
compared to the normal $99 retail price
is still under the same warranty and
it's good as new if you're in the Apple
ecosystem so you guys should check that
out all right let's get to our tile
giveaway winners I'm in love with this
tracker tag so we asked you what would
you put it on well the congrats go out
to on email april Funston says I put
tiles on each of my kids oh I only get
one I'll pick my favorite one then and
that's love
Rebeca Sosa says I will put my tile on
my beating pillow pet oh it's so cute
now William Stone says I would attach
the tile - my wife's good mood so I can
see where it goes when it suddenly
disappears William I really hope she's
not watching right now and on Twitter
sean-o Gullu says I'd stick a tile in my
lunch because someone from the office
keeps eating it that happens here a lot
- and dave says I would put the tile on
my hair the older I get the more I lose
well Dave I'm just glad my hair color is
a hundred percent natural
all right so many of you guys also said
you put the tile on your brain because
you lose your mind or you'd put it on
your virginity but I didn't get that one
