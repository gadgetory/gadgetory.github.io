taking a look at the brand new 2013
edition of Apple's 15-inch MacBook Pro
this is the model with the Retina
display oh this is frankly the main
macbook pro now we don't need to say
Retina every time anymore now if you
look at it you'll say this looks a lot
like the 2012 version of the retina
MacBook Pro and you would be right the
changes here are on the inside but they
are pretty significant this is still you
know thin and light for a macbook pro
it's not quite ultra book level it's
still a little thick and heavy to carry
around everyday in your backpack I'm not
sure I'd want to do that but it's
certainly a lot thinner than the
traditional macbook pro they have the
optical drive that's one of the things
you lose here but it fits very nice into
desktop and you can you know stick into
the bag and take it with you if you
really need to what I'm most excited
about is this MacBook Pro finally has
one of those big updates we've been
waiting for the MacBook Air had of the
imac got it now we have got Intel's
fourth generation Core iSeries chips
otherwise known by the codename Haswell
and what that gives you is a modest
performance boost you get better onboard
graphics that's all great but what you
really get is much better battery life
and in previous cell laptops both PCs
and Macs that we've tested with these
new Intel chips you really do get a very
nice battery life boost Apple says that
the 15-inch version of the macbook pro
is gonna run for eight hours they say
that the smaller 13 inch version that I
have right here is going to run for nine
hours this is one of those rare cases
when an hour of battery testing actually
sometimes run a little bit longer what
you get is also some of the other new
upgrades that both Macs and PCs have
gotten this year at least the high-end
ones you got a toe 2.11
AC wireless in this case with the other
Mac's you've got PCIe type of SSD
storage which is supposed to run a
little bit faster and of course you have
Thunderbolt 2 and you still get HDMI on
this and an USB 3.0 I think the most
surprising thing to me about these new
MacBook Pros of that app will actually
cut the price of them a little bit they
did this with the 13-inch MacBook Air as
well so the 15-inch MacBook Pro now
starts at $19.99 that's still very
expensive but it's a little bit less
than it was last year I couldn't let you
in on a little secret though where we
got a more high
and configuration here this thing has
got discrete NVIDIA GeForce 750 M
graphics and it's got 16 gigs are a
matte a 512 gigabyte SSD and that's
gonna cost you like $25.99 still a hefty
investment but a very very powerful
laptop I'm Dan Agron and that is the
2013 Apple 15 macbook pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
