features we want to see for any portable
device the thing everyone really wants
most is battery life so we're not going
to include that on this list because
that would be an obvious number one so
let's get to it at number five
modularity LG is walking away from
modularity in its G Series due to a lack
of interest by human beings the problem
might have been that switching modules
would turn off your phone moto show it
off how to do this right with its motor
mods rumors say the SH will have a USBC
port maybe that's a way to expand the
function of an s 8 at number 4 and easy
fingerprint sensor rumors say the SH
fingerprint sensor will be next to the
camera which is mighty far away
hopefully that rumor is wrong but if
it's not wrong maybe the iris scanner is
great and there won't be any need to
have to be mr. fantastic to reach that
fingerprint sensor at number 3 a thin
skin the galaxy note 7 showed a lighter
version of Samsung's TouchWiz UI
TouchWiz UI as Samsung software skin
that sits on top of Android in the past
that layer of software was a mess the
note 7 version was a lot sleeker
hopefully Santha has a lighter touch
than in the past itachi get it Terrill
terrible at number two pens support we
know the pen is the domain of the note
but why can't more of Samsung's phones
take advantage of the pen if any one of
Samsung's phones were to cannibalize
from the note line it should be the
Galaxy S series and the number one
ruggedness the rumors say there's a lot
of screen on these new phones in the
neighborhood of eighty percent screen so
what happens when you drop the thing we
want the essay to be super tough like
that moto droid turbo 2 when we tested
out the turbo 2 we were able to drive
machinery over it and the screen did not
crack samsung make the s8 super top
disappointed i didn't make a crack about
a non exploding battery let me know I'm
a tie us on Twitter for more top 5 check
out top five dot cnet com
did you really watch all the way till
the end well here's a kitten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
