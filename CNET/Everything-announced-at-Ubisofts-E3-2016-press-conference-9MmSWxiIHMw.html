co-op demo of Ghost Recon wildlands a
game that puts you in the shoes of
special operatives test with taking down
an intricate drug state organization
next we got an update on the new
southpark game creators Trey Parker and
Matt Stone were on stage discussing
what's new about the fractured butt hole
where the stick of truth was a fantasy
game this is a superhero game where you
spend more time developing your
character there's also an updated combat
system which gives players more freedom
to move around and make use of get ready
for it time traveling farts that's right
South Park the fractured butthole will
arrive December sixth Ubisoft took some
time to update players on the division
the new expansion called underground

ps4 and PC they also introduced a new
expansion called survival VR had some
stage time too we got to see a demo of
Eagle flight a VR game where you take to

got to see a nice chunk of single-player
game play featuring some brutal
swordplay that will hit consoles and PC
on februari 14 2017 redlynx is back with
a new trials game called trials of the
Blood Dragon it's an 80s inspired twist
on the super popular motocross racer no
Ubisoft showcase would be complete
without Assassin's Creed so we were
treated to a behind-the-scenes look at
the movie and interviews with actors
like Michael Fassbender and of course
things wouldn't be complete without a
preview of watch dogs too we got an idea
of what the next game in the series
looks and plays like it'll take place in
San Francisco and extend the feature set
of the first game the original watch dog
showed a lot of potential but never
really came together in a satisfying way
so here's hoping watchdogs to is able to
pull it off
game hits November fifth 2016 and
finally ubisoft premiered steep it's an
online racing an adventure game that
combines various winter mountain sports
and lets you share videos taken of all
the action using a robust set of tools

it definitely looks like a promising new
franchise the game's going to hit
consoles this December that's it for
Ubisoft at e3 2016 keep it here at cnet
