flavors we have the base model the TPS
and now the TT RS that's the
top-of-the-line fastest model and we're
here looking at the 2012 Audi tt-rs
the RS in the name stanza Rennsport
translate that into English means racing
sport the RS version the Tiki has a few
different elements than the standard PT
the TT RS gets a bigger engine that gets
Audi's mandate a ride suspension
technology standard plus we get some
different appearance packages
this car has this optional optic package
they call it gives us the silver mirror
covers you can also get carbon fiber and
back here we have a fixed spoiler does
away with some of that motorised
elements saves a little weight which
keeps true to this cars sporting team
wonderful things with cabin tech lately
like Google Earth integration on the
navigation system but this car not so
much this generation is six years old
for the TT and the cabin tech is six
years old as well here in the head unit
we have just the stock system no
upgrades and this is a basic radio it's
got satellite radio it's got broadcasts
it's got a CD player and according to
the literature somewhere around here
there's an auxilary input but I can't
find it now as it is we do have a nine
speaker audio system which isn't too bad
but you really can't hear it very well
over the sound of the engine this really
aggressive engine in this car you can
get an upgrade here though you can get a
navigation system and that comes in a
tech package just $3500 tech package
that brings in a Bose audio system so an
upgrade over that nine speaker system
and iPod integration now you can't get
iPod integration without the navigation
system and the navigation system is DVD
based it's six years old which isn't
great sports car fans are gonna love the
fact that Audi only offers one
transmission with this car it's a
6-speed manual so shift your own gears
it's the way it should be no DSG year
dual clutch manual transmission but we
also have this s button on the console
which controls some of the more
high-tech elements of this car for
example put it in s mode and it makes
the acceleration more aggressive the
throttle is a little more sensitive and
it also can cause the magnetic
suspension that when you put it in S
mode it makes the
quality stiffer and handles the corners
better of course on the flip side it
also makes the ride a little less
comfortable but this s button also
controls the sport exhaust now that's
another option that we have in this car
$1,500 option that makes the exhaust
sound more aggressive it opens up some
baffles and you get this really like
roaring sound which that doesn't do much
for performance but it certainly makes
you happy now with this small cabin you
might assume the TT RS is a two-seater
but I'm gonna prove it's a coupe so you
can see there are back seats here but
I'm gonna need a chiropractor after
sitting back here and bending my head
under under this low low roof you
wouldn't want to sit back here for at
all really ok let me get myself out of
this place here
as standard in the tt-rs you get these
carbon-fiber engine covers not really
important what's more important is you
get an extra cylinder this is a 2.5
litre five-cylinder direct injection
with turbo charger that's one more
cylinder and point 5 liters more than
the standard TT that adds up to 360
horsepower and 343 pound-feet of torque
those are huge numbers for this small
car so it gives it really good
acceleration now you'll also notice this
engine sits sideways sidesaddle
usually this is a mark of a front-wheel
drive car but the TT RS has Quattro
all-wheel drive standard so that doesn't
really matter what's more mediocre about
this engine is the mileage 18 miles per
gallon city 25 miles per gallon highway
not great pretty average numbers but
that's not really the point of this car
makes of a dual purpose car this is
something the MW does really well you
know and this yeah leave it off sport
mode in the city you can drive around
drive to work every day but it doesn't
work so well in this car because the
suspension in non sport mode never
really gets comfortable and engine
always remains a little touchy a little
hard to control in traffic on the fun
curvy roads like I'm on right now you
can really get a sense of how this car
is to post the handle the places it's
supposed to be and this is fun driving
around
yeah suspension really just handles
these corners nicely and you get a nice
sense of rotation in the turns but
there's a couple things I don't really
like about this car as far as the sports
car goes one of that is the fact it's
got this electric power steering system
that it's not tuned all that great I
don't know it the turn in isn't very
tight you don't feel a lot of response
like you do in the you know the best
systems that I've tested this car just
remains kind of fade and it doesn't have
the sharp turnin that I would really
want from a good steering system in a
sports car and I think I'd wait till the
Audi engineers have a chance to tune
that a little bit better another thing
I'm not crazy about is the gate on this
manual transmission the gate isn't quite
as tight as it could be I really want to
be able to feel it's smoothly going each
year but it's kind of notching and it
doesn't really give me a good sense of
going into each gear so ultimately what
I'm feeling in the the ride here is this
is an OK sports car but there's better
options out there
certainly less expensive ones the base
price of the 2012 Audi tt-rs is fifty
six thousand eight hundred fifty dollars
the tech package I talked about $3500
I'm not sure I would include that
because it's an old system the sport
exhaust that's fun
fifteen hundred dollars might as well
throw that on there but ultimately I
might go for a Porsche Boxster the car
we just reviewed which just had a model
update or wait for the model update for
the TT whenever that's going to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
