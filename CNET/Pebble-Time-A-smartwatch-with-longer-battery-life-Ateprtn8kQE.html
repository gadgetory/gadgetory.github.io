time what do you need to know about it
well the previous pebble was my favorite
SmartWatch it was a lot of people's
favorite smartwatches because it had the
best battery life almost seven days it
could be worn while so you can get your
basic information and it looked cool it
was a fun retro look didn't cost too
much and a work with Android and iOS
now pebble is back in the big
differences there that has a color
reflective screen that's always on has
the same promise seven day battery life
and it's got a microphone if you're an
Android user iOS you can use it a little
bit in the future plus it's got the
promise of smart straps the charge port
in the back can connect potentially in
the future to sensor studded straps that
aren't here yet so it's hard to judge
what I'm going to look at is this has a
color SmartWatch how does it compare to
the competition well it's not as fancy
as an Apple watch or Android wear it
doesn't have a touchscreen you have to
use buttons on the side and it doesn't
really interact all that much with its
apps but there are a lot of apps out
there there are our fitness apps there
are games there are quirky watch faces
with all sorts of weird characters in
them and all the previous pebble apps
can load onto this this has more storage
than previous pebble watches you can put
dozens of watch faces and apps onto this
as opposed to just eight before the
battery life maybe I got a little more
like four days as opposed to seven but
the software is early on this review
model so that may change I like the look
it's kind of cutesy kids II type of look
but it does have a stainless steel bezel
and a gorilla glass display that's
better than the original pebble which
had a very scratch prone plastic surface
the pebble still though kind of cut a
little more of a mature look there is
going to be a steel version of this
coming for $100 more in the summer maybe
you want to wait for that and it has a
little more battery life - I like the
pebble time I'm not absolutely
head-over-heels in love with it but I
spent less time looking at it and
dealing with it than I did with some of
the fancier smartwatches and if you want
a watch that's going to get basic
notifications Buzz you when you need to
that you can sleep with and that can
give you silent alarms and looks fun and
you can play around with maybe the
pebble time is for you
I like wearing one again I'm Scott Stein
at sea night and this is the pebble time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
