look for the logos get the whole story
at enabling USB org hey good morning
everybody and welcome to the 359 podcast
on Wednesday August 22nd we're at
episode 447 and before we get started we
want to wish a very happy birthday to
the uncompelled ray bradbury the
legendary sci-fi author famous for the
Martian Chronicles Fahrenheit 451 and
one of my personal favorites the
Halloween tree passed away in 2012 would
have been 98 today oh wow Alfred Roger
were you guys Ray Bradbury fans I mean
hi 451 is definitely a favorite that was
one of the best school assigned readings
I bet 1984 were like my oh yeah
Martian Chronicles so yes
huge huge fan I was very devastated when
he passed away so huge loss for the
community but hey that's not what we're
talking about today well we are talking
about that kind of feature tech that Ray
Bradbury
he was pretty stoked about our third
story yes he would so we we are we've
got a lot of 5g stuff today we're gonna
talk about t-mobile I had a chance to
talk with t-mobile John Leger Mike
Siebert about their vision for 5ve we'll
break that down while stalk about
Qualcomm showing off their latest 5g
platform which I know we're all tired of
talking about 5g coming but this is
definitely the latest indication that is
actually coming for real give a
one-sixth G coming the year after okay
and then lastly as Brian sort of hinted
at we'll be talking about the project to
send hundreds of little spacecrafts to
Alpha Centauri definitely a story that
Ray Bradbury would be stoked about since
this is this is real they did not you
know give me a seat on one of those
unfortunately what they're pretty small
so whatever I fit it would have been
uncovered you are a small guy but maybe
not that small as always if you have any
questions live in the comments section
Brian will pick out the best and we'll
get to them in three minutes and 59
seconds see back in the chat then and
three
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Alfred Aang t-mobile is pushing hard to
get its merger with Sprint completed I
had a chance to sit down with CEO John
Leger and president Mike Siebert to
discuss how Sprint fits into their plans
for 5g
bottom line is that they're they're
arguing that the combination of t-mobile
and Sprint will allowed them to offer a
network that is both cheaper and faster
which you know in when you break it down
like that doesn't seem likely since
that's not usually how technology works
but of course it is everything is always
better and cheaper and cheaper every
everyone knows that that's why I'm now
paying two thousand dollars for a
standard phone I know what phone yours
you're I didn't it's it's just it's a
dark future that we live in but I mean
you know obviously these these these
telecom companies are very optimistic
they're all racing to be first I'm very
curious though of like does in this
scenario this first really matter like
if I'm on t-mobile and Verizon gets 5g
first I'm not gonna say like oh I'm
leaving this to go to Verizon because I
think that like they'll probably get it
like all within a few months of each
other no you bring up an excellent point
I think that the idea of being first a
5g is at this point really just about
bragging rights it's not really gonna
affect most consumers people aren't
gonna jump ship just to get access to 5g
and you have to sort of parse how these
companies are getting to five you first
verizon says it'll be first to 5g but
it's gonna be a broadband service in
four cities so chances are you're not
gonna have access to it 18 he wants to
get mobile 5g of first later this year
but it's really just pucks and not
phones Tebow will sprint both say
they're gonna launch next year t-mobile
is committed to a nationwide launch by
2020 which is which know the carrier has
so there's the there's may be a
likelihood that you'll be able to get 5g
in the next two years
maybe with T moments right now can we
talk about what you can actually do with
5g I mean you we've I feel like we've
been talking about 5g probably since
like episode 104 the 359 by right um but
yeah I mean what what's all the hubbub
so 5g obviously big speed boost is the
the big thing
you're looking at speeds that you know
100 megabits per second basically faster
speeds than what you would get at home
right and so way faster speeds and
that's great for streaming video or
whatever but they're there looking at
stuff applications like streaming VR
like powering self-driving cars being
able to do remote surgery these sort of
thing these sorts of applications
require not just a speedy Network but a
responsive one and that's that's sort of
the key pin for 5g so what's the holdup
I mean everyone's like racing to be the
first but like I said we've been talking
about this for a while it's a great
segue into our next door with Qualcomm
announcing its mobile platform part of
the issue is the heart lack of hardware
right we don't have the right equipment
to tap into those 5g networks the ones
that are getting built now and so
Qualcomm yesterday just pulled back the
current on its 5g platform so it's
basically telegraphing that those next
flagship phones with like the the
top-of-the-line processors will have the
ability to do 5g they talked about 5g
hotspot capabilities by the end of this
year phone's coming next year that's it
the $2,000 phone's probably 2,000
cheaper and faster the service not the
phones and cell phones to be even crazy
expensive lastly our own Steven Shanklin
just published the latest installment of
a road trip story this one a look at
breakthrough starshot it's a project
designed to send spacecraft out to
neighboring Alpha Centauri and the
interesting thing is these aren't huge
spaceship sits there not spacecraft that
you can actually get in there tight
little essentially like baseballs that
they're firing out using layer lasers to
power them across really crazy
light-years away they're saying it takes
about 30 to 40 years to get to Alpha
Centauri using this technique but
they're hoping to answer the question
are we alone I certainly hope that we
are not and if anyone is out there
listening 30 to 40 years from now please
take me with you there we go for more on
those stories shook sound Cena and Roger
Chang I'm alfred ring thanks for
listening
I'll show 60 yeah all 16 all the time
every shows us a new g3 to 359 G that's
what I'm saying I'm getting tired of
hearing about it just make it happen so
it can be rendered obsolete you joke
about it but I think one cable company
at some point actually throughout the
term 6g a few months ago I mean he was
immediately ridiculed but yeah we're at
that point where the hype is so it's
gonna be rabid that we're just throwing
G's everywhere it's gonna be like the
end of her we're like the networks are
just like we've ascended like G's and
now we're sentient life-forms spoilers
I've still never watched that movie
it's 2018 do other things to do let's go
ahead and jump into the chat and take
some questions first and foremost Mike
Shaw has to know the burning question
did Roger get a pair of pink sneakers no
I asked about the the sneakers and John
later like mentioned the name of it and
I couldn't pronounce it so I know I
can't afford them so what was it like
palancio guys or something
no I have to look it up I think it's
sort of the Z is John Leger a good date
I'm just curious like is he is he does
he hold the door for you I feel like
John t'v John is great it's great to
hang out with for like 30 minutes spurts
but after a while you're like I gotta
get out here like your parents there you
go
wow that's John mushy the dad of five G
okay so uh here's our next one from Josh
boy uh did they have a timeline on when
the merger is going to be concluded yes
so they are looking to close a merger by
early next year but of course it is
dependent upon regulatory approval and
that's still not guaranteed there's a
lot of folks who are giving this sort of
a 50/50 shot especially noticing how the
Justice Department has sort of clung to
its fight to block the 18 T Time Warner
merger that deal did go through but the
government still kind
kicking up dust about it so a lot of
folks are wondering if they'll sort of
offer the same kind of hurdles or
obstacles to t-bone spring so it's not a
guarantee at all got it from oh hang on
I lost track of where I was going here
oh I want to talk a little bit more
about the Alpha Centauri thing because
as always the last story always gets cut
short and it's always a cool one in my
eyes so so Shanklin went I see we had
footage here that had Stephen Hawking in
it has this been a long-running project
that he's been working on for a couple
years
Franklin that is now Shaklee yeah he's
been working on this for about two two
and a half months so I mean that yeah
the illustration I think the the Hawking
footage is sort of an illustration of
some of the folks the minds that are
being tapped got it got it kind of look
at how we travel just great distances
and so yeah I mean the story to me is
interesting because it's it's a little
counterintuitive if you're thinking you
always envision like a big spacecraft
explorers you think like lost in space
or one of these are more like space
segways not now they're smaller than
like space basketballs or something it's
like when Vegeta and nappa are in there
like little pods coming no they're even
smaller than that because these can
could you put a Kryptonian child inside
one of them yes you probably could got
it
so there you go I know this stuff like
this is cool is it just Barry Bonds like
just knocking them all out of the park
he just line them up I'm sure Stephen
Beecham's geeking out just as hard as I
am on this stuff no it's cool the fact
that there's a I mean there's a latest
laser beams that if we can power this
thing right it it basically it shoots
these things off and accelerates - what
1/5 of the speed of light you're not so
I guess the game here is to shoot as
many as possible so I guess what did I
gonna flick the spider egg strategy here
what is the spider Age try to have as
many eggs as this yeah and they set
strategy yeah yeah okay I probably
should have three that what we're
talking about oh yeah we shoot hundreds
of hundreds of these because chances are
most of them aren't going to make it all
the way there but in
once they're there though it's
interesting they've got their own
observation equipment right it basically
it doesn't stop it just sort of whizzes
by Alpha Centauri and takes captures all
the data it has its own laser which
fires it back it's like like a Google
Maps for space kind of yeah yeah all
right next question coming in from Mike
Shaw
again won't 5g mobile kill DSL and cable
internet services now we've asked this
question before that's a great question
I would say if you talk to the Internet
service providers that would say maybe
down the line but not right away this I
mean this is gonna be fairly limited
deployment right you're looking at four
cities with a Verizon and and I talked
to them and it it seems like for a lot
of places just having the standard hook
up that process is like not that onerous
so I can't imagine it's gonna replace
broadband for a lot of people especially
like places like rural areas where it is
still kind of expensive to put equipment
up but who knows down the line I would
love to have like a fully wireless
broadband service they don't sound that
threatened by it though where like if
there were a giant meteor coming towards
like the earth and like Sciences are
just saying oh maybe that'll kill us
down the line but like not immediately I
like I would be have a lot more concern
about if I were like one of these cable
companies knowing that like you know
something like 5g has potential to put
me out of business
yeah I mean it's interesting that
they're not working on a 5g like answer
of their own or the issues I mean they
are they do have their own wireless
service but they're not you know they're
not wireless companies so I feel like
they're in there they're in the position
they're in now and I'm sure there's
maybe an element of denial to it because
it does threaten their core business and
they don't want to admit bilities but
the fact of the matter is 5g it's gonna
take a while for 5v to get out there as
broadly as it would take to become to
pose a risk these companies so they're
right now they're at least pretending
they're not worried or if they're not if
they're not actually worried they're
always pretending they're not pretending
not to be worried is a great strategy
yeah okay if they're truly not that kind
of made sense and a roundabout way yeah
sorry
next question going back
the 5g discussion Ryan Williams asks any
idea when 5g is gonna be available in
Canada and it really wouldn't really be
worth the wait over the LTE oh great
question I'm not sure about Canada that
a lot of noise is being made in the US
as well as Japan and Korea but I don't
hear a candidate in the discussion all
that often so you might have to wait a
little longer
come on down to the US may year tune
things like right here so G don't really
worth it to come here for our four five
g's yeah but nothing else in terms of
whether it's worth the wait I don't
think you're really waiting though it's
not like you're not having internet
search yeah exactly your your LG the
thing it is is you keep in mind that the
LTE networks are getting better
step-by-step you know they're not
perfect yet and I think I imagine some
of the issues that you you experienced
with LT now you might experience the 5g
in terms of coverage gaps right there's
still going to be areas where there
won't be five genes so you kind of are
relying on the network that you have now
so for a while I think the transition is
gonna be really rough I think it's not
this situation where you know 2019 hits
they turn on a switch and like 5 G's
everywhere it's gonna drop and then
instead of people instead of people like
kissing their uploader this picture so
that will not happen from John for the
general public that just goes to youtube
and social media and a little bit of
browsing maybe some music do you really
need 5g we showed off how it helps with
the Internet of Things and smart cars on
the road and the madmen who let you do
like open heart surgery Roger yeah that
was my is 5g really that appeasing to
the masses when we're already pretty
solid with our up-and-down speeds for
the most part pockets and exceptions of
course exams yeah that's a great
question I would say if you're sort of a
casual user and your experience is
pretty good now yeah you may not get it
may not be a huge benefit at least right
away but keep in mind that when LTE
launched you know the first thing we got
was like better speeds and that was
great but then we got stuff like uber
and
and Instagram and we got all these
different apps that popped up that
worked so much better because we had a
faster Network and so you really have to
look at the long term benefits it's
really the these speeds are insane so
they're gonna be able to enable apps
that we haven't even figured out yet
right so that's what I'm most excited
yeah I would I would agree with that
like if we're considering like around
the parameters of what we're using
currently then yell T's like pretty good
enough but like I think you know with 5g
that expands your parameters and in the
sense of like I like immediately always
go to thinking about like mobile gaming
in the sense of like you would be able
to play like online games like without
that much latency and there's also been
talks you know I know Ian's chair wrote
about this with like cloud based gaming
yeah in the same sense like you don't
need to have the games on your phone
anymore or anything like that or even
the computer that you're using like if
you can just like connect it to a
processor some whatnot processor but uh
like a server so like a server somewhere
that like can host like these like
incredibly powerful games then like with
5g that would be much easy one sort of
basic example that I would use Google
photos is a good one right like when you
pull up your Google Photos app you know
your photos take a little while to load
like especially if you're scrolling back
through time because it's it still has
to payment server with 5g it's like it's
a taste you pull up the app all your
photos are loaded in already you don't
the wait it's as if they were on your
phone they might even be faster yeah
yeah and I think like you know you
talked about your example of like VR
heart surgery stuff but like I'm just
thinking about VR in general well like
you can just like see people in VR with
like that Facebook thing that they're
doing the the not work space but like
the thing they're like chat yeah service
yeah exactly like that would be
definitely be something that like be
analyzed under that just mean that in
real time yeah I mean 5g will enable
that make that super smooth experience I
also just like thinking about the way
that like you watch TV and like TV shows
and all these things like just like even
it within the parameters currently like
just like how quickly you'd be able to
download like movies off of Netflix now
would be completely different yep so
then the next burning question is will
LG e a 4G LTE service become cheaper
because of the implementation of
look t-mobile's promising cheaper
service but truthfully I don't imagine
the prices go down imagine you like get
more for your money is ultimately
holidays they kind of it's the Samsung
argument you know they justified that
the note nine is like a better value
because they give you more i imagine
that that's gonna be what the argument
is for for these carriers because it's
hard for me to see them actually cut
prices per se especially if they're
pouring money into investing these
networks their argument is that there's
more capacity with with the spectrum
they get especially a t-mobile and
Sprint combined means it's the cost of
delivering the services cheaper and that
they want to pass those savings down to
consumers I imagine you'll just get more
in terms of like capacity in terms of
the ability to you know consume data
like that's gonna all jump but I don't
know prices are actually gonna be
cheaper do you think I be generally
surprised if they the prices went down
do you think that with 5g that they're
still gonna be these issues of like hey
it's unlimited but like not really like
do you think that that expands the price
that's the big question yes I mean
technically if what they're saying is
true then like these limits should all
go Yeah right like throttling should go
away the fact that like there's a high
definition and a standard definition
video an option like that should all be
high definite should all be 4k streaming
the limit does not exist because there
was that issue with those firefighters
in California yes the throttle yeah
absolutely
verizon says it was a customer error
they blame the customer but the
firefighters they blame the fire but
yeah like the issues of throttling
should actively go away at least for a
while I imagine like once they open it
up in like the capacity is huge
people will start creating apps and
different programs that take advantage
of all that bandwidth once this gets
start starts getting eaten up again you
can see the carrier's tighten things up
and I would like to see 5g open up the
open the doors to like a truly fully
unlimited no strings type plan again and
that that they'll cancel in like two
years
yeah well at least you get four feet get
grandfathered in yeah while you can this
one just came in from Mike Shaw that
caught my attention it says I saw a
story where a company is making a
hourglasses that we use v GE to
instantly overlay information on the
real world may
even people's social media stuff over
their heads and store hours this sounds
like a little bit of what we saw at the
last Google i/o and more specifically it
sounds a whole lot like magic leap mad
yeah magic leap Google i/o I mean a
company old odg is one that I looked at
a few years back
they've got smart glasses running on LTE
I would say it's gonna be a little while
before we get smart glasses running on
5g I mean in terms of the battery
consumption those glasses would have to
be super bulky to work but yeah the idea
is if you've got a 5g connection you can
overlay data superfast as if it was
stored on the glasses themselves but
really running over the network and so
definitely that's definitely more
exciting prospects making actually smart
glasses relevant again I'm working I'm
more curious about who would actually
buy into that like I get I feel like
it'd be cool for like the first 20
minutes and then it should be useful for
consumers but imagine like an auto
mechanic wears glasses if your starid an
engine and they could see the diagram
yeah there's been talks about using this
within like the US military as well yeah
the US military already use a smart
closet yeah so like having a 5v
connected one like having like data
relay to your glasses in real time
that's that would be huge so I'm glad
you actually mentioned battery because
that was the next question from Ricky is
uh how will it 5g performance on devices
affect battery life on your previous we
phones is it going to help hurt what do
you think well it's not gonna work on
existing phones anyways you if you want
5g you're gonna get a new well okay I'm
my phrase that wrongs how we talked
about how the battery's gonna be on like
a giant a our goggles let's talk about
just a phone yeah of course it's unclear
everyone I asked that question to all
the the handset makers all the carriers
basically everyone and they all say they
have a plan to account for it but I do
remember when 4G LTE first came out
those first phones were like they did
not last that long despite the fact they
were bulky they had large batteries to
kind of accommodate the LTE connection
the phones didn't run long and I imagine
it'll be very similar Safari file I
think I remember like when I had my
first smartphone I purposely set it to
only like 2g unless I need me G yeah
unless I needed it no no like this
before four so I purposely like set it
to like 2g only unless I say no you have
no data then yeah yeah but like I would
rather have no data than like my I have
your phone today yeah okay I would
basically only turn it up to 3G if I
need it to like look for stuff any good
time the argument that they made is you
know they've obviously learned a lot
from 4G they've got more intelligent
systems that allow for like directing
battery usage when it's not needed like
shutting off 5g when it's not needed or
like turning it on what it is
so we'll see I mean I'm a little
skeptical that these phones are gonna
run that long but again it's that's a
that's a problem for next year now maybe
not the comments section is killing me
right now Chris Osborne says 5g AR for
tinder would be hope seeing people's
profiles pop up over their heads and
then priority one follows up 5g starting
the suitcase cell phone war all over
again I love our audience yeah well like
a sprint just announced last week that
it will have the first 5g phone in the
US if they're tapping LG to make it I
asked them about sort of the bulk and
they say like it's not it's gonna be a
little thicker than your normal premium
flagship phone but it's a it's not gonna
be significantly bigger so we'll see
we'll see how they work
Brandon Franco asks do you think 5g will
have a lot of home throttling oh great
question like as a broadband service I
would think so yeah I would say early on
no I think they're just gonna like it's
gonna be wild wild west for the first
few years as experiment with it and
because that home broadband service is
using what's known as millimeter wave
spectrum that's super super high
frequency spectrum that's got a lot of
capacity you're not gonna hit a limit
for a while so I can imagine these
companies sort of letting people go
crazy for a while just to really test
the full capabilities of 5g so yeah I
can't imagine throttling limits at least
early on here's a question coming in
from BVG how long until a GTI screws
this up oh I'm not gonna answer that
Alfred will I don't know if we have
enough time like who's a who's a Nadja
pie
one more for 5g chris osborn do you
think Apple Google Samsung and all of
them will offer LTE versions and 5g
versions of their new phones oh well I
mean you're gonna see LTE versions of
phones this year for sure I mean next
year not every phone is going to be 5g
there's definitely gonna bleed over for
a while yeah you're definitely gonna and
in terms of phones with 5g there will
definitely be an LTE connection it's not
like it's 5g only like no there's no 5g
network that's gonna handle it in terms
of coverage so you're gonna have to have
that fall back to LTE but they're gonna
be plenty of phones that will just be LT
only next year it's not like next year
is the year 5g where everything just
switches over it's gonna be gradual
though the telecom companies would very
much like you to believe that you're a
5g it's like I feel like 5g is like a
youtube comment section now where every
company is just gonna come like first
riser shows with like wrist wrist wrist
alright just a couple minutes left to
chat about the probes the Alpha Centauri
pros Storm King asks do these probes
have anything to do with president
Trump's space force that's a good
question private a project so this is
not this is not space force related so
when they get out there what are they
looking to send back is it just gonna be
more pictures and information from
greater distances that we haven't
achieved yet or are they actually
pursuing something specific you know
like Mac and me you know I think they're
trying to run a scan for basically scan
for life-forms scan for what plants look
like what what sort of the the
atmosphere is like in the Alpha Centauri
system so the I think they're looking
for whatever they can find and then and
that firing back that data that's
because the Alpha Centauri system is
literally our measured closest neighbors
yes it's our next-door neighbor we're
gonna start there and then only 40 years
away yeah that's what if that's really
not that big a deal what if the folks in
Alpha Centauri had also sent out laser
probes laser powered probe and they hit
ours at the same time now what if the
