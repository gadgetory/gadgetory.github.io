app the thing that sure we dig up the
hottest applications in the mobile space
and then just kind of touch them a lot
for your viewing enjoyment today we're
taking a look at the smart tools app for
Android phones it basically combines all
five of smart tool companies probe
measurement apps into one package giving
you 15 tools at a bundle discount now
when you fire the app up you'll find all
of your tools right here on the home
screen length and angle tools include an
on-screen ruler that's good for
measuring small items and a level that's
good for shoring up those crooked
pictures on your wall there are also two
protractor tools for measuring small
items with the screen and larger items
using your phone's camera there are also
tools that give you access to your
phone's internal compass if it's
equipped with a GPS antenna which about
all of them are these days that same
compass is used to power a metal
detector tool that actually works on
this HTC Thunderbolt albe it only at
very close ranges there's a flashlight
tool that can either use your phone's
LED flash or the screen to light up dark
areas and there are also tools for
measuring ambient found levels in
decibels and physical vibrations on a
scale from weak to cataclysmic finally
there's a distance calculator that I
frankly haven't even figured out how to
use yet it's a little bit confusing just
about all of these tools perform
admirably on my test phone however I did
run into an issue where the decibel
meter became a bit unresponsive after
exiting and reopening the app
fortunately there's an option to
reinitialize all the settings right
there on the home screen that fixed
everything right on up this apps
available today in the Google Play Store
for 2 dollars and 50 cents or you can
get each of the individual tools if you
don't want the whole pack at prices
ranging from free to about 99 cents each
depending on which particular tool you
want for that price you should go ahead
and probably just springg for the whole
kit that's it for this week's episode of
tap that app if you've got an app that
you'd like to see tap send it to tap
that app cocina
I'm Anton Goodwin you can find me on
twitter at ant goo and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
