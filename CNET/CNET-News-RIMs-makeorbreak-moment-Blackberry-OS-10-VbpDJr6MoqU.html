business professional had a blackberry
dubbed crack berries the phone's
commanded a 60 percent market share
today rim is struggling
no one has black raisin where everyone
just seasons like iPhone so it's just
easier to communicate with everyone the
buttons are too little it's hard to use
that little scroll button from friends
and friends use the blackberries but now
they would all want to get the iPhone
but could blackberry make a comeback on
January 30th rim is expected to announce
two phones one with a full touchscreen
the other according keyboard plus its
new operating system OS 10 they're
really focusing on one-handed operation
here so that you can hold the phone in
your hand and kind of move your thumb
around in order to unlock the screens
navigate around the phone will likely
appeal to users who like keyboards and
multitasking you're addicted to email
this is the phone for you I think a lot
of people who are hanging on to the
blackberries now this is definitely the
phone for you other questions remain
including the availability of apps
quality of the built in camera and cost
it all adds up to a make-or-break moment
they don't have a plan B if you see
blackberry 10 phones struggle early on
and carry and start to abandon them
that's basically it for the company so
2013 will either be the end of an era
for RIM or a new beginning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
