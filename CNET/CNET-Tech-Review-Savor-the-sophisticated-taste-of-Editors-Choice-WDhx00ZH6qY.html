prismo to scan text into your iphone see
what you've been missing on your iPad we
count down the top-5 back-to-school
downloads and not one but two editors
choice award worthy products it's all
coming up right now
hi everyone in Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and of course offer some
life-changing tech wisdom in the form of
the bottom line let's start with the
good it's the middle of August and some
of you kids are already headed back to
school but before you start clogging
your campuses network sharing torrents
check out our top 5 downloads for
students they'll come in handy when you
actually get around to doing some work
yeah you still see piles of pencils
erasers and paper and stores back to
school aisles but I don't know why I'm
Brian Cooley here with another cnet top
five top five things you really need to
go back to school software downloads
number five wordweb it's a great tool if
when you're cranking on a paper and need
to come off smarter than you are
highlight a word hit a hotkey and presto
there's a definition synonyms and other
info about the word that you really
don't know but want a copy and paste so
it looks like you do windows only but
that's okay since mac users probably
think only windows users are stupid
enough to need this number for microsoft
office yeah downloads are usually cheap
or free an office isn't really either of
those but you can download an academic
version costing as little as a hundred
bucks and sorry google and openoffice
you're great but Redmond's productivity
suite is still the gold standard of
getting stuff done number three google
earth seldom is anything so cool so free
but that's Google doesn't matter what
your major having what used to be
government level access to geography
satellite imagery and street level views
of locations you're studying or just
dreaming of a spring break too is
incredibly powerful number two avast
antivirus free windows only but then
again who needs it more it galls most of
us to pay for antivirus software
especially since so often the anti virus
warnings out there are coming from an
antivirus company so a freebie like
avast is a good feeling no brainer and
is highly rated so you get way more than
you pay for before we get to our number
one top back-to-school download maybe
you're wondering if you're being cheap
with your kid on the shopping budget
this year well a fresh survey indicates
the average back to school budget for a
seven to twelve year old is gonna be
about four hundred and forty bucks this
year down ten percent from last year and
if you've got a teen in the family look
to spend about 480 to be average that's
down about twelve percent clearly we're
not buying our kids upon
ipads or if we are we're sending into
school and rags okay now it's time to
reveal our number one back to school
download its review okay you're gonna
think I'm nuts or moronic or both but
this is a flash card program which
doesn't mean it's limited just to grade
school stuff last cards were one of my
secret weapons all the way through
college sure I got my degree in
multiplication but review is a great
tool to make flashcards to hammer home
into your mind anything and it can test
you with the cards you've created oh by
the way if you need something to
download these great software pics on to
go over to cnet TV calm and look for our
recent top five desktop computers and
for details on all these software titles
just head over to back to school cnet
com I'm Brian Cooley thanks for joining
us for this top by
oh you don't have your back to school
computer yet well as Brian mentioned you
can find all of our computer reviews at
cnet com but let me save you a little
trouble here are a new laptop and an
editor's choice award winning desktop
for your consideration hi I'm Scott
Stein senior associate editor at cnet
com and this is the alienware m11x
laptop the Nvidia Optimus version I say
that because we reviewed the alienware
m11x previously in the spring we talked
to battered at CES 2010 as well it's an
11.6 inch small ultraportable laptop
with pretty powerful built-in high-end
graphics but an ultra-low voltage
processor inside previously a core two
duo ulv processor which combined provide
an interesting balance between decent
battery life switching over to some
pretty good graphics in a compact little
shell back then the starting price for
this little 11.6 inch laptop was 799 but
since then dell has released a new
version with upgraded processors and
Nvidia Optimus automatically switching
graphics at a starting price of 949 now
what do you get for this you get a core
i5 ulv processor or you can upgrade to a
core i7 ulv processor you also get up to
four or eight gigs of ram a 500 gig 7200
RPM hard drive when you add all that up
in hours it came to about twelve ninety
nine so it's really not that cheap and
another thing that's a little
disappointing is that while the Nvidia
Optimus graphics do provide an
automatically switching experience
meaning you can go from your game
playing mowed down to a non dedicated
graphics mode using integrated graphics
to extend your battery life the actual
gains in our tests were not that
spectacular in fact the battery life was
a little bit less than we had on the
previous version a little over three
hours which is great for a gaming laptop
but it's not so great for most laptops
that you'd expect would have a slightly
better battery life nowadays the
macbooks being a great example there's
also no optical drive on this which is
surprising because it's a pretty thick
base on the other hand you're getting
nvidia geforce GT 3 35 n graphics in
here which are really good they're a
step below really high-end graph
you're going to get some really nice
frame rates we played a lot of
mainstream games look fantastic and
there's a great built-in audio system
here too with 5.1 simulated surround you
can also export this with HDMI or using
DisplayPort there's no vga on this which
is dropped from the previous model a
little strange and you can play it on an
HD TV or monitor 1080p display looked a
little bit choppy but it looked pretty
good in other resolutions and it's cool
that you can do that all in all for the
price there are a lot of other laptops
you can get that can provide you a
better overall experience but if you're
looking for a really portable gaming
experience for a price that won't
destroy you it could be an interesting
one to look into particularly with the
added improvements I'm Scott Stein and
this is the new alienware m11x the
Nvidia Optimus edition hi I'm Justin you
associate editor for cnet.com with a
first look at the sx 2801 01 e it's
gateways latest budget slim tower system
that we're proud to award our editors
choice this 500 $19 desktop is it best
buy exclusive and it isn't too far off
from last year's model which also
received an editor's choice the system
features a 2.8 gigahertz intel dual core
processor that can easily keep up with
most consumer level tasks a one terabyte
hard drive and six gigs of storage so as
you can see the narrow case is suitable
for any environment and it has an hdmi
port on the back that makes it a
suitable partner for your HDTV if you
want to use it in a home theater you
also get a flexible set of connectivity
options including nine total USB ports
e-sata optical audio and VGA out in
addition to hdmi a big part of the
criteria for judging budget desktops are
its performance scores and as expected
this computer keeps up in our
head-to-head performance tests with four
competing systems so it certainly can
handle all your day-to-day tasks but if
you're a video editor that uses graphics
heavy programs like Photoshop or premier
the Gateway SX 28 4000 1e that's last
year's model and it's faster core i3
processor is a better fit you can get
all the details on both of those systems
on cnet com but that's my time I'm
Justin you and you just took a look at
the gateway sx
28 01 01 e that's an Editors Choice
winner for it stop to your performance
upgrade ability and affordable price tag
thanks for watching up next on the good
list is this week's edition of tap that
app now for those of you who came for
Brian tongs dancing you may be
disappointed but Josh Lowensohn is here
with an iphone app that can really come
in handy
welcome to tap that app I'm Josh
Lowensohn and this is a show where we
cover the hottest apps in the mobile
space this week's appt is prismo for the
iPhone by belgium-based developer crea
seed the app is scheduled to be released
mid August 2010 prismo uses the iphone's
camera to scan and process text so you
can get rid of that sack of business
cards or pile of notes and store
everything on your phone instead to
start out you just tell prisma what you
want to scan it does business cards
plain text whiteboards and bills for
this demo we're going to use a business
card the app includes a handy on-screen
grid to help you straighten out your
shot once you've taken a picture you can
rotate it left or right by 90 degrees
crop it and correct the white balance
this makes it easier for the program to
do its next step which is to pull out
all that information prismo uses optical
character recognition or OCR to grab
letters and numbers from your shot we
found it to do a pretty great job at
this though if your picture is blurry on
a multicolored background or you're
working with a handwritten note it can
bungle it up luckily it lets you go and
correct any mistakes it might have made
just by tapping on a text field once
you've captured any text you want to
save you can store it on your iPhone's
camera roll as a personal contact or a
spreadsheet file the app can also be
tied into Amazon simple storage service
or Dropbox so you can store your files
in the cloud beyond business cards and
whiteboards prismo even works on
receipts so if you get a big dinner bill
or you're trying to manage your finances
you can use this app to record that data
to do this you just snap a picture like
you would with the business card but
this time you'll notice there's this big
sideways bar use this to split up the
description from the price and prismo
puts it into an order bill you can then
send or save this as a spreadsheet or
use the built-in bill splitting tool to
figure out who needs to pay how much
prismo has a few advanced features that
make it really unique one is that it can
actually read back text you've scanned
with one of 36 international voices
these costs two dollars and ninety-nine
cents a pop but are very well done sabe
me llamo Vittorio a solo la voce mescal
italiana we don't really know why you
want to use this feature but it's nice
that it's there the app is also able to
translate whatever text you've captured
using google trends
late this is useful if you're trying to
translate a dinner menu or any signage
the most impressive feature is that you
can actually use this app to correct
photos you've taken it with a bad
perspective so save taking something off
angle you can make it look like you took
it straight on this works especially
well on magazines prismo is just
submitted to apple for approval and will
be on the app store in early August for
around ten dollars since it puts so many
features in one little package we think
it's a really killer deal for the money
don't forget that if you got an app you
want to tap send us an email at tap that
app at cnet com I'm Josh Lowensohn and
thanks for watching that is one pretty
tap where the app but I can just imagine
the look on the waitresses face if you
pull your phone out and try to use
prismo to split up the bill put it on
the company card that's what I do all
right while you're figuring out that
eighteen percent tip I'm gonna take a
break actually bump it up to 20 the math
is easier and we'll be right back with
more cnet tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV let's
continue on with the good and our
editors have been busy choosing things
lately here's Donald Bell with an iPod
speaker system that gives his boat hey
I'm Donal Bell and today we're taking a
first look at the s7 15 I from Logitech
this is a portable speaker designed for
the iphone and ipod and price at 149
dollars it's such an outstanding price
for the sound quality that you're
getting that I've given it a cnet
editors choice award I send a lot of
rinky-dink portable ipod speakers come
through here but this one really raises
the bar the design measure is around 15
inches across and two inches thick it's
on the larger end of portable speakers
but it has no problem fitting in a
backpack or a messenger bag on the front
you have buttons for power and volume
and a covered ipod dock that flips back
into a kickstand on the back there's a
little gasket here that covers an aux
input and a sock for the included power
adapter you also notice too passive
radiator woofers on the back which we
have to assume is how this thing gets
his deep full sound there's also a pair
of powered three inch speakers on the
front another pair of passive radiators
and dedicated tweeters that are spaced
at the edges to offer a better stereo
sound stage then you'll typically find
that this price range to really sweeten
the deal Logitech also throws in and ir
remote control with basic play pause
skip shuffle and repeat controls and you
also get a carrying case and the
included power adapter the internal
rechargeable battery is rated around
eight hours of use at a moderate volume
we notice a definite improvement in
volume and sound quality when the
speakers plugged in but even off the
battery the s7 15 I sounds better than
any similar product at this price you
won't get features such as an integrated
radio eq Bluetooth or alarm clock but if
you're using an iPhone or an iPod Touch
you've already got most of these
features so that's the Logitech s 715 I
an editor's choice portable speaker for
the iphone and ipod or Cena
calm I'm Donald bell
of course they cannot all be winners
David karna has another ipod speaker
system should show us and this one's
even solar-powered but that is not
enough to save it from being this week's
representative of the bat I'm David
cardo and I'm here with the actin solar
ipod iphone portable audio system this
is actually an audio system that is
designed to go outside it is both a
little bit ruggedized and has a splash
proof design as you can see you can hide
your iPod or iPhone behind the plastic
shield here in the front that is
removable you can also put down this
little lid here a but what the key thing
is is this is a solar charger right here
in the lid the idea is that you would
charge this unit up with the AC adapter
it has a built-in lithium ion
rechargeable battery that you take it
outside and you would flip this lit up
and it would allow you to trickle charge
so you get more battery life without any
son you only get about four hours of
battery life but with the Sun you can
probably get in the range of around six
hours so this can go for a full day
outside it also charges your iPod or
iPhone now from a feature standpoint
aside from that solar charging there
isn't a whole lot here this is really a
very basic audio system there is no FM
radio there's no bluetooth or anything
like that this is designed to be set
outside and it has a little handle on
top so you can carry around it isn't all
that heavy but does have enough heft to
it that does feel like there's something
to it and it is compact as you can see
like a lot of these little systems this
one does come with a remote it matches
the design of the product that's kind of
an industrial look we did like the
design of the product and the remote is
simple and durable as for the sound it's
okay but not great we found the base to
be a little bit thin there is a bass
boost on it but doesn't offer tremendous
clarity and it distorts a little bit at
higher volumes um so you want to play
this in sort of a middle volume level
but for casual listening outdoors it
certainly does the job i'm david carr
nguoi and that is the
akon soul rub okay so you plug it in you
charge it up for however long and then
maybe you get two extra hours with the
solar charger two extra hours of cruddy
audio quality Wow where do I sign up and
now it's time for this week's bottom
line it's true the ipad is pretty and it
runs all kind of apps that's fine for
reading and angry birds is kind of a
troublesome addiction but damn it
sometimes I just want to click on a
video link and watch a flash video
luckily some clever hackers have removed
the last barrier to web surfing nirvana
flash on your iPhone or iPad is here
kind of apples refused to allow flash to
run on your iPhone iPad or iPod touch
but now you can do it if you're willing
to jailbreak your device i'm brian Tong
and i'll show you how to install an app
called frash that will allow you to view
flash content on your idevices now
you'll first need a jailbreak your
device which is legal but Voyager apple
warranty with apple so to find out how
to do that you can find the video at
cnet TV com now let's get to it you have
a jailbroken device and first will
launch this city app select the manage
tab and then select sources you'll see a
list of sources hit the edit button and
then add enter in this URL and then once
you're done with that add source it will
update and when it's done hit return to
cydia when the installation finishes go
to the search tab and then find fresh
and install that application reboot your
iDevice but once it's up and running
you'll have the ability to view some but
not all flash content on your idevice so
far we've seen it run best on car
websites and restaurant websites and yes
those advertisements you love to hate
they display most of the time but it's a
basic flash you're getting here and all
the websites with a flash-based video
player did not display content or would
crash including our own gamespot com but
there you have it i'm brian Tong with
your how-to for installing and viewing
flash content on your idevices use it
wisely
the bottom line this week come on Steve
just let us have flash already sure I
can live without some of those annoying
flash ads but how do you expect me to
shop for my new Porsche without
jailbreaking my iPad well that's our
show for this week everyone join us next
time when we'll be back with a brand new
tech review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at cnet
TV com see you next time and thank you
