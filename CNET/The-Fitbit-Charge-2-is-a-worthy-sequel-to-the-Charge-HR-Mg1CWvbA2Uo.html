bounds better than the charge HR which
is saying a lot since the HR was our
most recommended fitness tracker but
Fitbit has really stepped it up this
time the charge to cost $150 that's the
same price of the charge HR but the new
model packs so much more the larger
display for example can now alert you to
incoming calls text messages and
upcoming calendar events although I did
find them difficult to read and would
usually just pull out my phone if it was
something important also new this year
our sport profiles for running biking
weightlifting and interval workouts and
while there isn't GPS built in the
charge to can use the GPS in your
smartphone to display pace distance and
speed when running or biking another
unique feature is the guided breathing
sessions the charge can actually
determine your breathing rate and will
then guide you to relaxation over a two
or five minute session it's actually
kind of cool but after the first week I
really didn't use it and while it's
still a bit bulky overall the charge too
is a lot more stylish and a lot of that
has to do with the interchangeable bands
there's a variety of bands to choose
from and even some more premium options
as for battery life you will get about
four and a half days maybe five if
you're lucky which is pretty good and
because this is a Fitbit it can still
track your steps your distance calories
burned floors climbed active minutes and
your sleep and yes even though HR isn't
in the name there is still an optical
heart rate sensor that runs continuously
speaking of the heart rate I found it to
be pretty accurate when resting and
walking around but it did fluctuate
during runs and workouts Fitbit is also
using the sensor to determine what it
calls your cardio fitness level this is
an estimate of your vo2 max and it lets
you see how fit you are and how you
compare to others in your age range all
of this can be seen in the app and also
provide some tips on improving your
score overall I really like this feature
and hope we see more of this from Fitbit
in the future now unfortunately I will
have to end with some bad news the
charge too isn't waterproof so you can't
shower with it or you can't swim with it
and that's just a huge disappointment
it's literally the one feature I wanted
this year so maybe for some people it's
better off to wait for the Fitbit charge
three but overall the charge too is the
fitness band that will appeal the most
people the Fitbit app is easy to use and
it lets you compete with friends and
family the price point of the charge too
is pretty good and those interchangeable
bands make it a lot more stylish but if
you want a waterproof tracker check out
the Fitbit flex 2 for more information
