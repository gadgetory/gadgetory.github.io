you never saw a guy with a chainsaw hand
before he doesn't care what anybody
thinks I'll be at a press conference I
get three bad questions and I'd shut the
whole thing down and walk out because
I'm the president he's running on get
out of my face
leave me alone the next one of you
primates even touches me I'll talk to
you when I want to talk to you let's
talk about how I get back home I think
we should get rid of taxes everybody
dies here it's just a rule death taxes
more death and I don't pay taxes so all
I know is death yep we want axes not
taxes
meet with the Soviet Union because I'm
gonna be so hungover I'll be the
greatest negotiator ever is you just the
guys in your office Oval Office like
Putin you just go right right for his
throat right right from the go get and
your own guys have to pull you off of
him and his own guys you know and that's
how you start negotiations you go for
his throat oh well the bedrooms got to
get you know black lights water beds
bongs you know we got it we got a deck
that place out better ventilation so we
get the reefer going you know so that
the Secret Service guys don't get all
weird you know you allowed to write in a
vote so I think he's gonna get the
write-in vote so you won't have to make
