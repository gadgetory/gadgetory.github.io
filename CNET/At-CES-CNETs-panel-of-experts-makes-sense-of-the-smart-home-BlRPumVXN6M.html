the moment that gets people the most
excited when you talk about what you're
doing voice my three-year-old gets it we
we are delighted by it in the house
every time you know when it works and
it's not it's not echoes fault when it
doesn't i think at least sometimes you
know we just have a lot of things
connected to it yeah voice that one's
easy so they carry from our perspective
is the are haiku is sense me because
once you program it the fan operates
dependent on its looking at temperature
at the ceiling at the floor it's looking
at the humidity it's looking at
occupancy and it's making decisions
based it on itself I mean you don't need
a cell phone to make the damn thing turn
off and on and it also by communicating
with the thermostats is able to back
down your AC in the in the summertime
and to back down your heat in the winter
time and I think the AHA there is and it
is for me is when I walk into a room and
the fan is moving very very slowly and I
recognized especially in the winter time
that it's actually harvesting heat I
wouldn't think about it I would never go
over and say you know I think maybe I
can save some heat energy by turning
that fan on right now it simply does it
because it recognizes the the the
opportunity to do so and that to me is a
haha thing I think for us the you know
the big moments is when you know the
products really start to do meaningful
things and you know when your thermostat
can save you a lot of money every month
when you're heating or cooling a smoke
and co alarm that's intuitive that makes
sense to you that keeps you safe I mean
those are big those are big things that
I think really resonate with customers
because the those are the important
things in the home you know keeping you
safe keeping yourself comfortable and
and I think that's really when people
understand you know the connected
devices the smart devices it's not just
about you know again controlling it from
your phone
doing parlor tricks and getting your
lights to flash it's really it's really
about some of these more meaningful
things that these smarter and more
connected and more intelligent products
can do so yeah I think haha moment is
when we know we're actually solving
problems we were having a meeting in one
of the women in the meeting was very
anxious about not having the house light
on because she had a dog and the dog was
afraid of the dark and it was getting
late into the evening so I actually
showed her my application of smart
things that you can remotely turn on the
light just simple as that and I still
remember how delighted she was and she
said she's just going to do that right
now and once we see that kind of
customer moment it just gives us you
know goosebumps it's funny I was going
to use goose bumps in my examples well
not that that example is a really good
one and it represents these really
simple moments if you look at the the
top reviews of echo on amazon com the
top three or four of them are from
people with disabilities they're either
aged or cited or they have some other
physical disability and there they tell
stories in these reviews of how the with
voice now they can control their home
where they couldn't before and it's it's
a huge responsibility when you read
those you realize that you're building
the product that you know how meaningful
this is for people's lives and this is
the difference today in the home
automation space versus last time I made
a run at it which was in the 1999 time
frame is that we actually are now at the
point in time where we can deliver the
type of value for those simple
experiences that cause goose bumps
here you know so i think the aha moments
for us have really been around when we
go out and talk to consumers across the
world about what they're interested in
the smart home the basic problems that
they want to solve and frankly most of
them are not around technology per se
there are things like you know are my
kids safe no are my parents okay my
aging parents you know again did I leave
my garage door open so things around
peace of mind are really powerful and
and and drive a lot of the smart home
narrative when you when you talk to end
consumers a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
