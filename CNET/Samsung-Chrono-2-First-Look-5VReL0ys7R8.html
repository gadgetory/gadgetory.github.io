editor here at seen it today I'm going
to give you a first look at the samsung
chrono to now I know what you're
probably saying you probably think this
is 2004-2005 and you know you've been
transported back to the past which it's
not true it's actually 2012 and this
phone just looks really old but I
promise you it is new it is with US
cellular and it's actually the second
chrono as I said it's the chrono the
original chrono came out in April yeah
this design looks really old a blast
from the past but you know what this
design works and Samsung is used it for
years and years I haven't owned a flip
phone a reviewed 1 and I can't even tell
you it like before 2010 maybe but you
know I one soon as I picked this up it
just brought back a little bit of
feeling a nostalgia you can open it with
one hand flip it close there's that
familiar clacking sound of course to use
t9 to text that's not like riding a
bicycle I really had to remember how to
use it after using keyboards for so long
punching out punching out those words
and making sure the predicted was right
that did take a long time to get used to
again but you know it is a phone that
does make all's well the call quality is
good and it does what a phone should do
just course it's not very exciting so as
I said it is a very simple flip phone
design you have the rounded corners on
the end smooth line to the plastic
casing the hinge is sturdy I didn't feel
it was too loose or too stiff you can't
open it with one hand outside there is
one point three memos a camera lens you
can use the external displays of
self-portrait mere also shows the date
time and battery life all the
information you need the only thing I
like didn't like about the mostly when
they backlighting is off the external
display disappears completely and you
can't push any of these buttons to light
it back up again you have to actually
open the phone shut it so that's kind of
annoying you just want to see the time
you're not wearing a watch you have to
fiddle with the phone quite a bit just
to see the time just have a textured
cover on the back here on the side
there's a camera shutter a 3.5
millimeter headset jack over here
there's a volume rocker and a micro USB
charger port inside there's the main
display of course not a great resolution
great graphics are not going to blow you
away but you know they're really not
supposed to on a phone like this inside
the user interface is easy to use
there's just a grid for icons and the
main menu and the familiar list is you
get into the submenus Keaton keypad and
navigation array they are flat so you
can't really use them by feel there are
a lot of spate there's
space though especially for that
navigation array there's a toggle okay
but in the middle to soft keys the talk
and and power key and then a clear
button and then the alphanumeric keypad
Keys have it a little bit of a rubbery
feel which is nice but again it is flush
so using it I feel is a little difficult
but overall very easy to use and simple
feature set is very very basic does have
Bluetooth it does have voice dialing it
does have USB mass storage otherwise
you'll find the basic set of organizer
options like calculator a calendar
courses text and multimedia messaging so
said call quality is pretty decent I
could hear people fine little distortion
on the voice some voices sound like they
had a higher pitch than they usually do
but not a big deal on the other end
caller said that I had to be pretty
close to the phone especially the
speakerphone I want to be heard they did
report some background and wind noise
but overall this phone does exactly what
a phone should do I have to admit I did
feel a little weird using this phone on
the street I did see a couple people
staring when I was taking photos with it
of course that could have been for some
other reasons but you need to phone just
to make calls he wanted me to keep in
your glove compartment you want to keep
for emergencies and you want to use it
just only when you need to this phone
definitely does the trick it is only
twenty nine dollars if you buy prepaid
so that means just one ten dollars
without a contract and of course it is
free with a contract and this is the
samsung chrono two from US Cellular
