laptop isn't as convenient as watching
on TV
besides the smaller screen one of the
biggest pains is the lack of a remote
control it can be annoying to have to
click the mouse or the trackpad to play
the video or pause it but you actually
don't have to do this there's a handful
of keyboard shortcuts that simplify
everything pressing enter or the space
key will toggle pause and play the left
arrow can be held to rewind and the
right arrow to fast-forward pressing the
up arrow will increase the volume while
the down arrow will lower it and
pressing the M key will mute the video
movies and TV shows are frequently
coming and going from Netflix here at
CNET we have an excellent series that
tells you exactly when these shows are
departing but if you don't have time to
tune in you can check the my list
section on the Netflix website from here
you can view and organize all the shows
you want to watch the list even displays
when the show is about to leave the
service this one should be a no-brainer
for a lot of you but if you share an
account with a few different people and
are sick and tired of seeing
recommendations for things like my
little pony
make sure you have set up profiles for
each user you can have up to five
profiles for a single Netflix account
having your own profile will keep your
list ratings and personalized
suggestions separate from your friends
and it will take away a lot of that
clutter that's in the Netflix interface
you should also remember to always rate
the movies and TV shows you watch this
will help make Netflix recommendations a
lot more accurate I find that I waste a
lot of time simply looking for a movie
or TV show I want to watch well that was
until I found my new favorite tool if
you just want a quick recommendation try
what is on Netflix calm the site shows
recently added a new content to Netflix
and has a list of top ranked movies
curated from IMDB Rotten Tomatoes and
Metacritic there's even a random pick
tool to help you out when you just can't
decide what to watch and there you have
it four tips that I hope will improve
your Netflix experience feel free to
share with me some of your favorite tips
and tricks in the comments section below
