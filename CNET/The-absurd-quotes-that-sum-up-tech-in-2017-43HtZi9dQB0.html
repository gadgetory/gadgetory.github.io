world we're talking about hacking space
travel and the terrifying rise of AI so
did our tech luminaries have their
finger on the pulse or do they get it
terribly terribly wrong let's take a
look back at the strangest and most
notable quotes of the tech world this
year
first up uber in between revelations of
sexual harassment and a hack that
exposed 57 million users it's been a bad
year for the ride-sharing company but no
one had it worse than former CEO Travis
kalanick
if you're fending off claims of
harassment and a bro culture at your
company it's not a good idea to be
secretly filmed ranting at your uber
driver some people don't like to take
responsibility for their own Kalen it
was recorded saying well he certainly
had to take responsibility for that one
he is no longer CEO of uber number two
is Elon Musk now this man seems to run
half of the companies in the Silicon
Valley but he has some major qualms with
artificial intelligence
according to musk AI harbors more risk
than North Korea and will be the most
likely cause of World War three but this
is the comment that had us really
worried AI is a fundamental risk to the
existence of human civilization he said
in July so we're screwed number three
security fails if it wasn't one of cry
locking down our computers it was
Equifax somehow compromising the
personal data of half the US population
Equifax discovered a vulnerability in
its systems in March but former CEO
Richard Smith blamed a bad scanner and a
single employee for failing to catch it
Equifax was entrusted with Americans
private data and we let them down he
said yes you did and I'd say that
letdown was a bit of an understatement
at number four diversity in Silicon
Valley 2017 was the year former Google
engineer James day Moore declared women
on average have more neuroticism higher
anxiety and lower stress tolerance our
biological determinism that old chestnut
but the year that brought us hashtag me
too also saw Silicon Valley making a
hash of their mere Colpitts when tech
evangelist Robert Scoble was accused of
inappropriate behavior by a number of
he declared none of them were ever in a
position where I could make or break
their careers yeah that's not how that
works coab eliza and finally our vote
for strangers quote of 2017 was it
Google home telling us Republican sequel
Nazis or Elon Musk telling us the
quickest way from New York to Shanghai
was a big rocket let's give the last
word to the US president who tweeted
this gem in May despite the constant
negative press to feffy and so say all
of us mr. president all right
what was your favorite quote of 2017 you
can tweet your hot takes to me on
Twitter or you can head to see Netcom to
read about the year that was this is
