we bring you a car with a new advanced
powertrain the question is that's great
but how long will it take me to earn
back the additional MSRP in my measly
fuel savings let's do that math with a
2014 Audi q5 with the turbo diesel and
check the tech now to my eye the first
thing I notice about a q5 is that it's
exceptionally spelt it doesn't have that
big broad-shouldered look of some
crossovers that are based on lower to
mid-size sedans this guy's based on the
same platform of the Audi five generally
speaking you can tell it's been
significantly enlarged but it still has
a compact nough stew it it's a two row
four-door only there are no other
configurations of it and there's no
third row option by the way now to be
fair the 2014 q5 is very much a
carryover in the cabin this is largely
an engine story but let's do a quick
review
Howdy's MMI is not standard but it is
included on this car at mid or higher
levels you've got this four zone
controller a nice little turn click and
jog wheel additional buttons around
there it is not a touchscreen in the way
shape or form and you've got very good
though not perfect voice command let's
look at a few things on the main menu
here navigation this is one of the
cleaner looking nav screens that is out
there you've got direct zoom in and out
right here on the knob there's no menu
to have to go to like some cars same
thing goes for tour and move you can
just hit this little jog wheel just move
it again some cars make that a menu
forget it by then it's too tedious and
of course the Audi trademark you can go
to Google Earth as your actual view on
the map this is really pretty cool stuff
but you will need to use a live data
connection to do that that data
connection lives down here in a sim card
this car has its own 3G account separate
from your phone
there we go here comes the Google Earth
data loading in takes a while
that's 3G which it was for but it ain't
as it's doing this it's gonna buffer I
think it's a 25 mile radius so you're
not constantly buffering as you go it
does a big gulp at once and if you're
really into maps the combination of this
kind of photorealism plus really good
traffic and guidance information you get
here
and on the helper screen makes this
quite a nice experience all in switch
into 3d view for additional oohs and
ahhs turn on a few P oh is this is a
kind of fun system to use now here's one
of the best things about it when you
want to find a place to go because
you've got a live connection and Google
services on the other end of it the
voice command button actually becomes
useful let's check it out online
destination pizzeria Pico online
destinations retrieving requested
information if it's really smart it's
gonna check in the greater area to enter
the line to pizzeria Pico has been
accepted okay well you just saw there is
a big slice of the way all navigation
systems should work but most don't about
all that Mars that is a beep tone
negotiation you've got to do you either
have to wait for those beep tones that I
think take too long or constantly get
here on the voice button to preempt them
and that's too much work so I wish
they'd get rid of that the way BMW has
all your modern sources are in here no
headlines to speak of a hard drive I'd
never use an SD card two of them in fact
that I find odd you hook up your iPod to
what they call the MMI connector they're
in the cable and of course we have
bluetooth streaming though I don't think
every q5 has that watch your trim level
standard audio can be optioned up to
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen 14 speaker 505 watts and
as we'll see at the end of the piece the
price on it's not bad I think I would do
it now your drive controls your stick
here is for your 8-speed automatic it's
a Tiptronic though it doesn't have any
Tiptronic controls on the wheel no
paddles or thumb toggles at all it's all
gait based so in Drive once for Drive
another one for sport mode take it to
the right and that's where you get your
shift ability up for up shift down for
downshift the way it should be
you can't option this car up with Audi
Drive select which will give you several
buttons for different sort of drivetrain
personalities we don't have that on this
car the last thing I'll point out is a
standard and vast power glass roof this
guy is big and then once you get that
big glass panel open look what you can
do you've got a mesh panel you can
decide to have closed which gets great
gentle air circulation through here
without all the buffeting of being all
the way open or all that
sunbaking I'm getting all the UV on your
head the whole time it's a real nice
middle ground
now if the decals on the side of this
thing didn't tip you off we've got a TDI
in this vehicle they're pretty proud of
that
as the q5 gets that engine let's refresh
what this great outtie mill is all about
3 litre v6 sitting longitudinally of
course single turbo you see it sitting
right there not a twin turbo
configuration the results are 240
scrawny horsepower simply not enough to
move something of this weight but hold
on here comes the torque 428 crushing
foot-pounds now we're doing just fine
weighs about 4500 pounds big boy
zero to 60 though in six and a half
pretty trim seconds mpg is rated at 24
31 normally you get something low to low
mid between those two but I've been
observing 30-plus in real world that's
nice all these guys have Quattro
all-wheel drive standard and go out
through that one choice only 8-speed
automatic that we talked about oh by the
way two gears on that 8-speed automatic
are overdrive we're gonna check that out
on the roads and this car does use your
RIA injection it's got a 6 gallon AdBlue
tank that once in a great while you will
have to add to that's how a scrub a lot
of the soot and junk out of the diesel
exhaust let's go for a ride let's start
here without moving an inch gonna be a
little hard for you to hear but listen
to this I'm gonna turn down the fan all
the way to nothing
audios off
it doesn't sound like a diesel it sounds
like any other car with a gas engine
that's a real breakthrough not so much
even in smoothness of the engine but I
think isolation of the cabin that's a
good thing let's go for a ride now of
course with the kind of torque you have
in addy so getting off the line is
really fun I mean whoosh it's like
getting shot out of a cannon
you don't rev very high in these guys
what you start to peter out at 4500 on
the clock there the only issue I find
with this power train transmission and
engine combination is it does tend to
hunt out those two overdrive gears very
aggressively but on the freeway
typically the vehicle will get caught
flat-footed when you need to make a
quick little squirt into a hole in
traffic and it's in like you know Top
Gear and even this much torque doesn't
get the job done that's frustrating that
happened more than a few times
nice isolation of the cabin road feel is
I'd say more comfortable than it is
sporting therefore it's not a fatiguing
car to drive at all visibility is not
bad which is surprising for a car of
this type at this era now as I mentioned
we do not have i'li drive select so
there's no adjustability on the
suspension it's really a nice smooth car
to drive I'm very impressed with this
vehicle and how much the diesel behaves
unobtrusively okay let's price our q5
TDI 46/5 plus delivery is your base so
here's what I do I take that 46 5 I add
3,500 for the MMI navigation camera HD
radio advanced head unit that's a good
buy overall with the many technologies
you get Google connectivity good voice
command all of that
another 850 for the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
upgraded audio system and that's it I'm
not going to add in the passive blind
spot tech don't really need it as well
as the $2,000 for the dual rear seat
entertainment system get the kids a
couple iPads bottom line it's gonna take
you some time to earn back the diesel
premium on this vehicle regardless of
what other q5 you compare it to however
it's fairly manageable especially
compared to the gas v6 where you'll earn
this back and I think less than 4 years
depending on your diesel prices combine
that with the nice Longinus car the
really excellent cabin tech and the fact
this is a really out
they executed diesel and you've got a
package you can definitely consider
unlike some vehicles out there that will
take you longer than you're a lifespan
to earn back the green premium</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
