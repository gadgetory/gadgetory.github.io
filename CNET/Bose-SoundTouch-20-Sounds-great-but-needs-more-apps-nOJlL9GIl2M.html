of the Bose soundTouch 20 streaming
speaker with the rise and rise of Sonos
it was natural that other established
companies would want a slice of
streaming cake and Bose is the latest
that has turned up to the streaming
party the Bose soundTouch 20 has the
bones of an excellent streaming product
with great sound being the most
important thing while some crucial
features are missing the company has
promised the product will improve over
time the sometimes 20 is part of boses
new range which is designed to bring
multi room music to your home it boasts
Wi-Fi playback with both airplay and
DLNA supported but unfortunately there's
no Bluetooth the system offers six
presets as the center of its offering
the touch in sound touch and can be used
to playback internet radio playlists or
individual songs if you want unlike
competitive systems the sound touch also
comes with a remote which unlike the
unit itself features playback controls
arguably the most important part of a
streaming device is the services
supports and currently the Bose only
offers pandora Sonos well and truly has
the lead here with dozens of services
including most crucially Spotify Bose
says both Deezer and I Heart Radio are
coming in the second half of 2014 while
others are planned while the system
supports playback of most formats
including mp3 and Apple Lossless
it does miss flack though that is also
promised later unlike some other systems
Bose doesn't use a proprietary network
and so setup means connecting a USB
cable to each unit in your house and
then running a wizard still the best
thing about this unit by far is the
sound when pitted against the
competitive solos play 3 and Samsung
shape the Bose had better bass response
despite being smaller and had a more
intimate and intelligible vocal response
it simply sounds better once Bose adds
more services it will truly be
competitive with Sonos if you're looking
for Bluetooth and high-res support
though your best option is currently the
Samsung
