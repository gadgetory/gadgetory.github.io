for cnet.com this is your first look at
the HP X 7000 Wi-Fi touch Mouse so it
draws inspiration from other touch
sensitive mice like Apple's Magic Mouse
and a Logitech m600 this is HP's version
and it adds an extra feature to the mix
with the ability to connect through the
wireless adapter in your Windows 7
powered computer and that's instead of
Bluetooth which is what the majority of
other wireless mice are that adds
benefit by freeing up precious USB ports
for your other peripherals on your
computer but unfortunately a series of
Hardware hiccups left a pretty bad taste
in my mouth so let's take a tour of the
device before I tell you about that
first you'll notice immediately that the
mouse is contoured for right-handed
users so lefty should keep shopping the
whole piece has a really ergonomic shape
you get the two standard buttons on top
here for left and right clicks two
buttons on the side for moving backward
and forwards through a web browser and a
single touch sensitive button in the
middle strip here instead of the scroll
dial you usually see in the center of
modern mice this one is touch sensitive
so the pointer will actually respond to
your finger flicking across it in my
experience however the mouse is a little
overly sensitive and that made it a
little prone to accidental clicks when
my finger lingered even for an extra
second too long on the pad that and the
real estate for swiping is too small
with only a slightly raised position in
the center that makes it hard to
distinguish unless you're looking down
directly at it and who wants to do that
every time you scroll but let's get back
to the connectivity really quick the
first thing you should know is that it
will only pair with compatible windows 7
wireless adapters so double-check with a
link I put in the written review to make
sure your computer works before you buy
it once you confirm that however pairing
with the mouse and your wireless
receiver is really easy it shouldn't
take more than five minutes with a
single button push to establish a
connection I did notice however that the
mouse takes a little time to reconnect
if its companion computer goes into
sleep mode my last gripe with the X 7000
is the lack of reprogrammable buttons
there's five of them and you can change
the number of scrolls per notch on the
touch panel as well as the specific
functions in those
but you can't actually remap any of them
to launch an application of your choice
or perform keystroke combinations
overall my favorite Mouse is still the
Logitech performance mouse MX you can
find a link to that in the written
review it's about 20 bucks more than
this X 7000 but it's a lot more
comfortable to use and definitely worth
the use of your USB port you can read
all the details in my full review on
cnn.com I'm Justin you you just took a
first look at the HP X 7000 Wi-Fi touch
mouse
