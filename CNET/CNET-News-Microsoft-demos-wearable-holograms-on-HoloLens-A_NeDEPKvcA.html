can place amazing holograms in your
world and how those Holograms can
interact with the environment around you
but today we want to take mixed reality
one step further so we've got something
new to show you Holograms you can hold
this holographic gauntlet is the weapon
that Dan will be using while playing
project x-ray you'll notice that as he
moves his arm
the hologram moves as well this is a
wearable hologram and when you combine
technology like this with the
environment understanding of hololens
you can do some pretty spectacular
things nice
alright let's battle some robots
with hololens you're completely
untethered which means you Dan is free
to move around as he shoots it enemies
and avoids their fire with hololens the
action happens all around you and thanks
to spatial sound you'll hear the
gameplay as though it's happening in
your room you'll notice that the robots
know where the walls and the furniture
are and they can use that knowledge to
navigate and plan attacks against you
since each room is unique every game is
customized to you
that didn't work what else you got
vortex mode
Holograms behave just like real objects
they can interact with the environment
and with each other
for larger enemies with more powerful
weapons dan can even use his shield to
defend himself
nicely done looks like that's all of
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
