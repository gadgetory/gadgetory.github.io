over its predecessor in nearly every way
it's even lighter than the first
generation iPad Mini and with a really
narrow build is one of the easiest
tablets to hold in one hand there's an
easy to find power button and volume
rocker on the side and the headphone
jack on the top there's a 1.2 megapixel
camera on the front and a five megapixel
back camera they're not bad cameras but
are pretty typically unimpressive even
for tablet cameras the back texture
isn't as inviting or comfortable as the
originals but it's not unpleasant either
there's a microUSB port on the bottom
man with the purchase of a $30.00 slim
court adapter will also double as an
HDMI port it has speaker grilles on the
top and bottom which allows for a pretty
effective surround sound it ships with
Android 4.3 which gives you three major
new features restricted user profiles
allows you to add a kid-friendly profile
OpenGL ES 3.0 improves polygamy
experiments and Bluetooth smart allows
the Nexus 7 to connect to a newer
generation of Bluetooth devices
near-field communication support returns
and we also get wireless charging which
according to Google will allow any Qi
compatible charger to bill the Nexus 7's
battery however the actual charging
speed was painfully slow compared to a
wired charge the screen has a 1920 by
1200 resolution and responds quickly the
touches and swipes switching between
different apps as fast and scrolling
through webpages is smooth and zippy
Wi-Fi speeds were consistently high with
no spotty connection issues when within
a reasonable distance from a network in
our official battery tests it lasted an
impressive eleven point five hours while
running a movie in airplane mode Real
Racing 3 and Riptide gp2 both look
really impressive with smooth frame
rates and sharp graphics with minimal
aliasing on the edges 2d games like
Angry Birds also pack in the pixels and
look impressively sharp while it doesn't
completely blow away the competition
starting at just $230 for 16 gigabytes
of storage it
Nexus 7 has enough improvements to
easily earn the best small tablet crown
at least for now I'm Eric Franklin and
this has been a first look at the Google
Nexus 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
