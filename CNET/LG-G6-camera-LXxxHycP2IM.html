and setup as its predecessors but inside
it's packed with new features for video
pros and Instagram lovers spec wise the
main camera has been downgraded in the
g6
but you won't notice much of a
difference in the results plus you'll
actually be more likely to use that
wide-angle sensor because this time
around it's got a significant boost in
quality selfie lovers may be sad to hear
there are less megapixels in the G sixes
front camera as well but you'll now be
able to fit more into each shot thanks
again to that wide-angle option but the
most notable upgrades are actually found
on the app you'll notice a new camera
roll strip next to the viewfinder
that lets you preview all your shots
without leaving the app there's also a
new panorama option under mode in the
main camera which lets you take a full
360-degree shot of your surroundings and
share as a flattened image or
interactive 360 you'll have to swipe or
move the phone to view click on the auto
icon on the top left and you'll now see
a new square format for social media
friendly snaps the default snapshot uses
a top square as a viewfinder and the
bottom to preview your shot or click on
mode if you want to get more artistic
there's a match shot for side by sides
or top two bottoms a guide shot if you
want to stop motion feel or catalog
effect or make a four shot collage
without having to download a third-party
app and finally you can add a customized
watermark to all of your shots from the
settings menu add your signature and
make sure you turn it on just know
there's no way to get rid of it once
it's on a shot the video camera also has
a few notable upgrades it borrowed from
LG's b20 this includes a manual mode
that allows you to change the audio
levels white balance focus ISO and
shutter speed right from the viewfinder
or click on the Settings icon for even
more control frame rate bitrate or
tracking focus this one is great for
action shots kids and pets so that your
subject never loses focus but unless
you're a pro video user or Instagram
addict the main reason why you'd favor
the camera on the g6 is still that
wide-angle lens an old feature that has
now been refined on this model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
