smartwatches I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update when the foretold
apple iwatch emerges in the fall season
it will come in many forms at least
that's what's being reported by The Wall
Street Journal sources told the paper
that apple SmartWatch will include more
than ten sensors some designed to track
health and fitness as you would expect
and this watch may come in multiple
screen sizes for different styles that
would be refreshing if true because
bulky smartwatches don't look stylish on
thin wrists and that's not the only I
watch report out this week reuters has
sources seen that the iWatch screen will
be slightly rectangular measuring 2.5
inches diagonally now you're going to
see lots of variation in Smart Watch
screen sizes this year Samsung debuted
the gear fit with a long and thin screen
and Motorola is going round when it
launches its Android wear watch now
these companies are getting creative to
see what sticks with consumers and you
know who else is testing different sizes
blackberry yep blackberry has not given
up the fight it's coming out with a new
smartphone that looks kind of square and
blocky this is the passport the screen
measures 4.5 inches across and there's a
stretched out qwerty keyboard at the
bottom it's like trying to be a tablet
ish phone but we shall learn more about
the passport in September as for other
phones future Android and Windows Phone
devices will have a new security feature
Microsoft and Google signed an agreement
with the New York Attorney General to
add a kill switch that will render a
device useless if stolen the hope is
that it will discourage smartphone theft
and before we end let us reflect on the
sudden craze of the app called yo the
app does one thing it sends a message to
someone with the word yo that's it just
yo it started as a joke for april fools
but it took off in popularity after the
Creator announced that he raised more
than 1 million dollars in funding all
that for an app that is essentially just
like poking someone on face
book but I regret to inform the 50,000
of you who downloaded this app that yo
has been hacked a Georgia Tech student
said he was able to access any yo users
phone number and spam users with many
o's you can spoof accounts and pose as
someone else we knew yo and push
notifications can be programmed with
longer messages the apps creator
confirms that he's working on fixing
these problems but the moral of the
story don't trust a jokey app with your
phone number yo that your tech news
update we can always find more at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
