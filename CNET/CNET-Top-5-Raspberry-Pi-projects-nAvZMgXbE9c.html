pocket-sized computer comes down to $35
if you're creatively inclined at least
you start to wonder what kinds of
projects you could make with an almost
disposable computer Donal bell and this
top five I'm counting down my favorite
uses for the Raspberry Pi starting off
at number five using as an actual
computer I know it's not very creative
but if you're looking for the bare
minimum excuse to buy a Raspberry Pi
just know that you can plug in a
keyboard a mouse an HDMI monitor and you
can use this as a practical little Linux
computer or even dabble in the world of
Windows 10 if you want to get creative
just make a cool case for it or shove it
inside an old Commodore 64 coming in at
number four use your Raspberry Pi to
power your own photo booth that's right
you can up your selfie game by making a
dedicated photo booth for you and your
friends the digital camera and a photo
printer and a couple LEDs on the start
button you practically got your own
mobile wedding photo business and
there's a version of this project that
uploads animated gifts to tumblr so just
set it up in front of the baby panda
enclosure at the zoo and watch the
internet break at number three make your
own internet radio ones you can buy
off-the-shelf or so dole with the pie
and a screen and a couple speakers you
can retrofit an old jukebox or make your
own custom enclosure that you can be
proud of because the pie has a built-in
audio output the hard part is just
setting up the software coming in at
number two build a freaking robot
especially with the enhanced processing
power of the PI 2 a robot based on Pi
can do some serious image and spatial
processing to find its way around I
found a site called Pi board org
entirely dedicated to PI robotics
everything from little toy BOTS that can
scoot around your desk to terrifying
doodle
that you can actually stand on but I
wouldn't which brings us to my vote for
the number one use for a raspberry pi a
retro game console there's the cup Cade
the super game pie the pie girl game boy
and about a hundred other retro console
emulation projects out there and that's
just for the original pie the pie two
has already been seen emulating ps1
games so get ready for a whole new wave
of pie gaming projects and because the
pie works out of the box with USB
gamepads HDMI output and built-in audio
it's just an irresistible project for
gamers so there you go five excuses to
buy a $35 Raspberry Pi computer make
something cool with it
let me know I'm at Donal on Twitter you
can also find me in more videos like
