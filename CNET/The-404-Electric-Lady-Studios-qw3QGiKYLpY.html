religious person okay and I'm not even
as people say nowadays spiritual but I I
had a spiritual experience sitting at
Electric Lady studios yeah it's just
such an amazing place so Jimi Hendrix
built this studio and I think 1969 about
a year before he died and he wanted to
build the most advanced recording studio
in the world who was that I think the
first 24 track studio and had all the
best gear and beyond the gear being good
the actual rooms were amazing instead of
having rectangular the walls they had
these sweeping curves and then he had
these artists come in and do murals on
them on the walls on the ceiling in the
bathroom when you're when you're in the
control room the big that in the big
studios control room the entire wall
back behind well the artists would sit
to listen the playback is an aquarium so
cool so you got all these weird fish big
match everybody getting stung but gonna
have these fish swimming around behind
although actually I read a little trivia
bit on the Wikipedia page and said that
it was a very professional studio huh no
drugs were allowed in the studio okay
officially officially there's no way
people don't like Jimi Hendrix oh okay
that roll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
