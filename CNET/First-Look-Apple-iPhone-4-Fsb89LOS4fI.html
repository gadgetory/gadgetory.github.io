singer calm to day Rex a first look at
the Apple iPhone 4 this of course is
Apple's newest iPhone has a lot of new
features has a redesign first we're
gonna take it out of box though just pop
it off the top there
Daniel oh there it is so from the start
you see this is a very different iPhone
and design take it off the lid there and
inside you have of course a small
instruction sheet you get the small wall
plug that we've seen a normal USB cable
and the standard iPhone earbuds so
pretty standard as far as the box goes
now with the iPhone 3G and 3GS merely
were tweaks of that original iPhones
design this is a lot different it's flat
on both the front and the back so the
nice thing is is it doesn't wall but
when you put it on the table anymore
when you pair at the iPhone 3G that we
have here you'll see that it is a bit
thinner it's actually a 25% thinner
yeah Apple says this is a thinnest
smartphone around that certainly may be
true for now but you know the thin
iPhone the thin smartphone race changes
constantly so I don't think we'll hold
that title for long it does have glass
on the front and on the back I do notice
at the back in particular attracts a lot
of smudges and fingerprints that we
didn't see on the previous phone so you
want to watch that you see a metal band
and circling the entire phone it
actually is a new antenna as well you do
see a couple of notches on the top on
the side but it's Apple didn't say that
this would improve call quality they
didn't actually promise that perhaps
this redesign is an effort to make those
things better some of the other changes
you'll see is there's a new poise
cancellation microphone here right on
the top that's next to the 3.5 mm
headset jack and the power switch here
on the side the SIM tray which used to
be on the top is moved to the side of
course that is a micro SIM slot the
volume rocker has been redesigned it's
now split volume buttons a small change
but I like it actually
the silence button has been revamped
just a little bit about you to barely
notice it and down here on the bottom
you see that the same 30 pin connector
Jack the speaker and the microphone and
of course the home button is completely
the same the phone is four point eight
ounces so it actually is the same way as
the original iPhone the iPhone 3G and
iPhone 3GS were just a little bit
lighter you don't really notice it it
definitely is smaller though and I
notice that immediately taken out of the
box it is a bit narrow and measured
across the front face and I already told
you that it is thinner I do think that
when I look at it alone it certainly
looks small and of course you
particularly notice it when you put the
phone
by side couple other changes in design
you see that there's a camera right here
that is a VGA camera you can use that
for self-portraits or for the FaceTime
video calling feature it is five
megapixel it also records HD video the
iPhone 4s and the first handset to offer
this feature but it certainly works well
we recorded some quick videos and they
looked really great there's still no
white balance or brightness or color
tones or anything like that but I used
to seen that from Apple but never really
taken the camera and add a lot of
customization with it but I think what
these updated certainly makes a camera
pretty good along with the new camera
you will know a couple tweaks to the
interface there is the control for the
flash you also see a small control for
switching between the front and rear
cameras so everything is really
accessible in front so it's pretty cool
the FaceTime feature is Apple's new
video calling feature it isn't new Apple
certainly makes it look really nice from
what I've seen in demos we have seen it
look pretty good I can't show you here
right now because we actually don't have
I - iPhone 4s at the moment getting one
very soon though so well add an extra
video how-to of what the FaceTime looks
like also we need to talk about that
display of course this is Apple's Retina
display and the reason they call that is
they think they say that its resolution
is beyond what's perceivable by the
human eye there's been some debate about
whether that's really true but I can say
that the display is absolutely stunning
you can't see any pixels at all
colors are fantastic text looks great
websites photos videos everything I was
looking at was really really great when
you put it next to you really need to
get zoom in to see it but you do see a
definite difference there
Apple certainly stepped up the display
and made something that's really
competitive so it's glad to see that the
iPhone 4 does have a new processor and
from the start I can tell you that it
was completely faster doing anything
opening apps going between menus
especially that camera shutter actually
that was really really quick but this
phone is certainly faster than what
we've seen before as I said the iPhone 4
does have a bigger battery of course we
haven't haven't done a full battery
drain yet but in just in the brief
testing I've done it seems like it's
doing it well with the multitasking and
we saw with iOS 4 there of course is the
concern that that will put a drain on
the battery faster I the way Apple
design multitasking they say that that
it's not gonna do that and I haven't
found anything yet but it's always nice
to see a bigger battery so certainly
welcome those of course the feature wise
the iPhone 4 brings a lot of things
and with the added iOS for idiot brings
even more I won't get into the iOS for
changes here but if you want to learn
more about the iOS 4 changes I did a
first look at the iowa's 4 so you can
check that out on the whole this is the
biggest upgrade to the iPhone since the
iPhone 3G
I think we've took them independently if
you took the iPhone 4 you took the iOS 4
you took those independently they'd be
great but you need to add them together
you really come with a compelling sleek
and really nice device of course there
are so many great smartphones out there
so not gonna say that it's the best cuz
you to do that to do that would really
ignore so many smartphones and how fast
the technology world develops if you're
an iPhone fan and if you like what Apple
has designed as a smartphone experience
this is a great phone I'm Kent Sherman
and this is the Apple iPhone 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
