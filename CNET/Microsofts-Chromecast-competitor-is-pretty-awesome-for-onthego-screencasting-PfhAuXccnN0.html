Microsoft Wireless Display adapter the
device does exactly what its name says
it lets you connect a miracast enabled
machine to a TV projector or monitor
wirelessly there's not much the actual
device pop off the cap and you'll find
an HDMI connector on the other end as a
USB cable that's used to power the
device Microsoft chose not to include a
USB plug for some reason but a lot of
modern TVs or monitors have powered USB
ports so this shouldn't be a problem the
Wireless Display adapter doesn't do much
by itself it just waits for you to
connect a Windows 8.1 machine or
compatible Android device if your
windows 8.1 tablets up to date you send
your tablet screen to a TV by going to
devices then project then add a wireless
display the adapter uses miracast
which means you don't have to have the
adapter on the same network as your
tablet the adapter and the tablet can
see each other directly which is great
if you're traveling with the device
performance was very good with a tiny
bit of lag the Wireless Display adapter
isn't meant for gaming but for sharing
video or showing a presentation the
adapter can also allow you to extend
your desktop but then you're going to
need a trackpad or a mouse to put
Windows on that second screen if you're
looking at the Microsoft Wireless
Display adapter as a home theater device
you're probably better off with a Roku
device that runs its own apps or the
cheaper google chromecast however if
you're looking for a device that
complements your windows 8.1 or Android
device for travel or presentations the
Microsoft Wireless Display adapter could
be for you a mayas actor and this has
been the Microsoft Wireless at display
adapter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
