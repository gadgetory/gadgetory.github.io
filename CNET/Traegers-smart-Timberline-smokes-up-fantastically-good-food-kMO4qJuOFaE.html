barbecue grill it isn't powered by
liquid propane natural gas or even
charcoal this baby burns wood pellets
the heat and smoke it produces makes
this machine more of a hot smoker than a
cooker I really wanted to hate this
grill it's fickle must be cleaned often
and if you don't tend it properly its
flames die at the worst possible times
at $1,700 the Traeger Timberline is
extremely expensive - worse it uses only
specialty wood pellets sold by trigger
but food cooked on the Timberline is
good phenomenally good so tasty in fact
that I forgive its faults mostly you put
pellets into the triggers hopper like
this just pour it right in
once the hopper is full make sure to
smooth it out make sure there's no gaps
and that ensures that the auger within
the machine will constantly feed a
steady stream of pellets into the
triggers firebox and ignite them this
thing is temperamental though too much
ash in the firebox and the grill won't
start properly and die out dead flame
can lead to unfired pellets which then
causes over firing a scary flare-up when
too many pellets ignite at once
everything the trigger cooks from ribs
to burgers to chicken and veggies were
kissed with delicious smoky flavor the
meat was especially juicy and flavorful
there's a super smoke function to add
extra taste and aroma to ingredients to
the grill even talks to your phone over
Wi-Fi and through an app you can monitor
and control it remotely the app has a
large library of recipes as well you can
also send recipes directly to the grill
the Timberline then uses these
instructions along with a digital meat
probe to cook food autonomously so is a
Timberline worth it
right now it's the only non portable and
smart pellet grill you can buy so if
that's what you're after then the answer
is yes it has precisely controlled
temperatures and serves up delicious
food if you have the money and patience
to use it properly
