for cnet.com and I'm here with the
monster I Sport intensity headphones
unlike the standard I sport model these
are in ear headphones but they don't Jam
in your ears so they're not totally
noise isolating and that's important for
a lot of people who run and they want to
be able to hear traffic the one downside
to them is that they don't sound quite
as good as the eye sports you do lose a
little bit bass and there's a little bit
less detail with these earphones however
they do offer a comfortable fit they do
come with a few different sized wings
depending on your ear size and they fit
very securely in your ears and they also
are comfortable and relatively
lightweight they're not super
lightweight in some sense they're
similar to the bows in ear model that's
the Bose ie2 that comes in a sports
model as well this model does have an
inline remote and microphone that is
geared towards iOS devices that's the
iPhone the iPod Touch and iPads I
personally like these standard ice ports
a little bit better for their sound but
I do like the comfort level of this
earphone and I can recommend them at
their price point of 99.95 I'm David
Carr noise and those the monster I Sport
intensity sports earphones thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
