at Mobile World Congress 2019 MWC is the
showcase for all kinds of mobile devices
a note about this top five we're
expecting to see every one of the items
listed at MWC to rank them let's use
height as our metric the more hype the
feature will be the higher it'll be on
this list let's get to it coming at
number five cameras how do you make your
phone stand out in the crowd
slap another camera on it take a look at
this leaked image of a Nokia phone
that's not some kind of abstract floral
pattern that's the rear camera array
including the flash unit also expect an
older method of talking up cameras more
and more megapixels the Oppo F 11 Pro
could have a 48 megapixel camera on the
back that's not even a crazy number the
honor of u-20 already showed off its own
48 megapixel camera number four are in
screen fingerprint sensors this
technology has been around for a little
while now but I bet we'll see more more
phones crowing about in screen
fingerprint sensors why if companies
move to something like face ID you're
potentially looking at a big notch on
this wing there already seems to be a
movement to smaller and more elegant
notches on Android devices so the in
display sensor could allow for a more
secure way to unlock your phone without
packing in a face ID like assembly these
new sensors are also supposed to be
harder to fool that's right fake fingers
shouldn't work that was a worse to live
by at number three is what I'm calling
the knot notch speaking of the move to
smaller notches we're seeing some
experimentation in the mobile space to
avoid the knotch display
Samsung has showed off its hole punch
style infinity Oh display we've seen
selfie cameras popping out of the body
of phones there's even something like
the dual screened Nubia X which slaps a
display on the back who needs a notch
for a selfie camera when you could just
use the main rear camera for pictures
there's also report from scene that's
owned Roger Cheng that says LG will have
an option for a second screen attachment
we are now at number two and that is 5g
it's the next big thing they've added
another g5 is better than four you're
going to see a lot of phones touting 5g
the thing is you don't have to show up a
vastly different looking device if it's
faster inside plus there's a race to get
the first 5g phone to market a note to
all getting the first next-generation
device doesn't always work out great
there are usually all kinds of kinks to
work out plus there's no real 5g network
to hook into but they are rolling out
slowly also be aware the first 5g phones
may be thicker than older models to
handle the new tech we'll see 5g devices
from Samsung huawei LG and one plus and
the number one thing to get hyped out of
MWC 2019 will be foldable phones we're
living in a world where smart phones
just don't have the wow factor that they
used to do you know what makes people
say Wow foldable phones that become
tablets how much function does an
expanding display add that remains to be
seen the future for foldables looks
bright since Google has already set up
guidelines on how Android developers can
take advantage of these transforming
tablets I'd imagine we'll see some
really cool looking concepts the
question is how good will these be when
they make it to market shammies teaser
video makes us want to believe in an
elegant future a special thanks to the
one and only Gestalt court for her help
on this episode where do you see phones
going in the future let us know I my as
actor I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
