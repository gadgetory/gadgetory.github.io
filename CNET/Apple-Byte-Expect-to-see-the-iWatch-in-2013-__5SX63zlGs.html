to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the show and the biggest news of the
week Apple is taking its trademark
filing for the term i watch worldwide
now bloomberg reports that Apple filed
for the iWatch trademark in Japan
according to a June third filing with
Japan's Patent Office that was made
public the very first eyewash trademark
report came from russian newspaper
Izvestia
on june 3rd as well now 9 to 5 mac also
reports that Tim Cook and company have
expanded their eyewash trademark take
over to Mexico Taiwan Turkey and
Colombia with the same filing date of
June 3rd so what does this mean well I
think it's pretty much a no-brainer that
the iWatch comes out this year and
before Apple's new TV now if we look
back at history when Apple filed for the
very first I pad trademark in early
January of 2010 in Canada Europe and
Hong Kong Steve Jobs then announced the
iPad on January the 27th and the first
gen iPad went on sale on April the 3rd
now the iWatch is probably not coming
out that soon but I've talked to people
working on the project they never give
me some acidic details of course but the
iWatch product is significantly further
along and they're genuinely excited and
giddy about the interface so you guys
could pretty much expect it in 2013 and
especially with the content deals still
holding up the Apple TV let's say Apple
TV in 2014 now there's still a lot of
action around iOS 7 and boy genius
report says Apple will be sticking to
the two-week cycle for iOS 7 beta
releases with the third beta expected to
be available on July 8 Apple retail
employees are also just as excited about
iOS 7 but Apple management is cracking
down on them and making sure they're
going through an official developer
account because they're concerned that
they're sharing it with all their
co-workers can you say bad maybe you
guys could at least provide it to
employees on phones in the break room so
they can educate themselves about your
next OS that they're supposed to
champion
see well that's a good idea all right
I'm not gonna call this next one a bad
apple but it's a lame one Apple just
announced their back-to-school promo
that's good through September 6 if you
buy a Mac computer you get a $100 gift
card to the App Store iTunes Store and
if you buy an iPad or iPhone you get a
$50 App Store gift card now remember the
days where you actually got 100 to 150
dollars off a computer but now they're
basically telling you to spend that
money on the App Store come on sir all
right lots of leaks coming from China
with some sketchy photos from the wave
phone forums showing off more pictures
of the back plate of the rumored
low-cost iPhone I'm gonna go out on a
limb and hope that highlighter yellow
watermelon and neon green aren't going
to be final colors and a new set of
detailed design schematics claiming to
be for the 5th gen iPad from website
nowhere else FR show a thinner profile
compared to the fortune and reduced
width for the thinner bezel that matches
up with all the earlier rumor leaks and
cases being made in China and since
we're talking bezels let's check out
some of Apple's patents the big a has
been granted a new patent that could
bring touch controls to the bezel of a
device with a small display the
technology would allow a bezel to
dynamically change by holding down on a
specific area and an area with controls
would show up now what a coming product
could this be perfect for there's a
small display and a watch has a really
small display but now that's probably
not it
so yeah wait and see now I know we've
all been in a situation where there's a
single iPhone that just doesn't get
enough light in a dark setting but a
handful of them remotely controlled just
might do the trick that's the idea
behind a patent filed by Apple called
the illumination system where an iPhone
could take a picture figure out how much
light is needed and then team up with
other iPhones or multiple devices to act
as camera flashes so how would I use
this
Apple has also applied for a patent on a
computer port that combines two
connectors such as a USB port and an SD
card reader and they're calling it the
combined input port now who wouldn't
want this
it's like text version of Smuckers and
crust the bowls you know those like
crustless bread pockets that have the
peanut butter and jelly stacked on top
of each other oh they're so good just
like apples combined input port all
right now
Apple buyers we want to do something a
little different here in this week's
show and a lot of you asked me all the
time is this a good time to buy an iMac
MacBook Pro iPad and all that so we
wanted to put together a quick reference
for you so you can make the best
decision based on what we know and we
call it our app so what's the safe bet
to buy right now if you've been
following the news MacBook Airs and
Airport extremes were just announced and
even people wondering about the Apple TV
we don't expect to see any major changes
there so we're giving you the green
light go go go for those but the
products to pump your brakes on start
with the MacBook Pros they didn't see an
update at WWDC they're due for a
processor upgrade at the very least
around the back-to-school season so
we're expecting to see them then don't
buy anything until the next refresh
happens if you take my word for it then
we have the redesigned IMAX of Mac minis
they were last updated over seven months
ago you can still buy these if you want
it's more of a yellow light yield
honestly but my heart advice is to wait
on these even if it's a little more than
a couple months I expect to speed bump
before the end of the year now if any of
you buy an iPad or an iPhone in the next
two months
I might have to slap you silly it's
simple see that stop sign do not buy
respecting updates around the early
September timeframe even throw in the
iPod Touch which might get a slight
price drop but it makes no sense at all
to buy these now unless you're desperate
and if you're wondering about the Mac
Pro's don't make me answer that for you
just start saving up for it a lot as in
over 3000 a lot that's what we're
guessing the price will be so pretty
much it's the airs the Apple TVs and
airports that are the safe bets and
finally we asked you about the top buy
features you want to see in the next an
iPhone but
we're gonna save those for one more week
so keep sending your responses to the
Apple bite at cnet.com or my twitter at
Brian Tom it'll be worth the wait with a
surprise prize or I could call it a
surprise and spell see but we'll do the
giveaway to you the Apple biters that we
feature on next week's show all right
that's gonna do it for this week I'm
Brian Tong thanks for watching and we'll
catch you guys next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
