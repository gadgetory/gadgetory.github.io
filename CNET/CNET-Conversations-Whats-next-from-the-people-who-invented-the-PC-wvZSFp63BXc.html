and development their work is woven
through the story of technology over the
last 50 years they pioneered personal
computing networking natural language
processing and of course copying and
laser printing I grew up a couple of
miles from their palo alto research
center or park and in a valley jammed
with the world's best engineers it was
revered recently I went back to the old
stomping grounds to meet up with their
CTO Sophie vandebrooke and see what's
next the best way to predict the future
is to invent it and to create it and
that's what we continue to do park is in
the business of innovation park was set
up by xerox in 1970 in a burgeoning
Silicon Valley thousands of miles from
company headquarters in Rochester New
York in every sense it was a team apart
and within two years they were on to
something big the Alto which many call
the first personal computer good morning
you come in here on this grab a cup of
coffee or tea bread and the Xerox
machine present your morning mail on a
screen this one looks interesting let's
take a look at this I think everybody on
the radically should see this push a
button and the information is sent
electronically to similar units around
the corner or around the world Digital
Network telephony 1973 the legendary
Alto personal computer that was 77
portable versions same year personal
tablets a little earlier than I bet you
thought 1992 over there look at that the
granddaddy of the laser printer and you
know about the mouse this is a big part
of the history of Silicon Valley and the
history of park but to this day let's
face it Yusei Xerox they think copiers
but you are moving into other directions
especially with a new way of medical
staff dealing with us as patients that's
right the digital nurse research project
that we are doing here a park will
enable the nurses and the doctors to
really have the information handy so you
as a patient
don't need to bother telling over and
over again what pain you have or how you
felt yesterday this is truly
patient-centric as you can see it's a
dissipation it shows all these
characteristics what kind of medicine
has he taken or what needs to happen
today what are the lab results this unit
on the wall is able to tell when a
particular nurse not just any nurse but
whoever's idea this is has entered the
room and pull up the relevant
information all about the patient and
what needs to happen today what are the
lab results urgent things not to do or
up here we had specialists that have
work practice expertise that go into
hospital lift with the nurses for
extended amount of time I really see
what was the patient's challenges what
really upset them what what upset the
nurse is the fact that they have to
spend so much time away from the bad
side away from dealing with actual
patient which is really what they love
to do they found that nurses spend only
about thirty percent of their time
taking care of you at seventy percent
doing routine chores like paperwork and
filling medications with their digital
nurse project the park team thinks it
could flip that ratio but it clearly
will make a huge impact to the patient
so the hospital's have really been
opening their doors I mean they've won
innovate they want to be able to figure
out how do I save costs in my hospital
another line of research for Xerox in
the medical field is heart monitoring
that is not only wireless but involves
no contact at all we are doing
experiments today in a neonatal hospital
in India their skins are very fragile
very sensitive so you don't want to keep
putting probes on baby serves yeah so
our researchers are experts in image
processing because of the decades of
expertise making amazing images that we
use different are now using their
expertise to remotely monitor the
signals coming up it is visual
technology to monitor a heart that you
can't even see yes that's correct and
then they can measure remotely to the
heartbeat
so the the temperature that we're doing
the experiment in the hospital now it's
going to make a huge impact if indeed we
can deploy that and many more babies it
can benefit from this technology
hopefully you'll never come into contact
with Xeroxes medical technology but I
bet you could use some help parking I
was impressed by the smarts they're
preparing to put into dumb meters and
spaces on the typical day thirty percent
of the traffic in cities because people
are looking for a parking spot and here
are some examples of what you found one
of them is to take our driveways or curb
cuts and to turn those into possible
parking inventory so what we found out
is that in forty-nine percent almost
half of these situations they will never
drive a car into this parking full of
junk it's full of Chang or your
mother-in-law oh that's fire so why not
provide extra fifty percent more parking
space and I love this meter here this
earth at this mock-up of a meal that
will be tied to a service cloud service
the web-based service that you run in
the cloud where you're going into the
city tonight for some event you can log
in the software will tell you were the
closest free markets for this during the
time that you're interested to park you
pay for it at home and then you drive
and the parking spot is empty waiting
for you today we are working with
talking with many cities is very very
interested in this concept a less
frustrated driver much easier flow of
traffic through the city less pollution
cleaner cities I mean it just makes a
lot of sense park is one of maybe a
handful of companies that can say it's
in the business of breakthroughs and not
elicit laughs I also think Park is
notable in the way it combines deep
technology with the study of how people
work heal or just park their car and
that allows them to create applied
technology that can move things forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
