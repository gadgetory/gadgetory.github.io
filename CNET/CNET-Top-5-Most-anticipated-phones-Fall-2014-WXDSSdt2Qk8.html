but not so much when it comes to phones
sure we got the galaxy s5 and the HTC
One m8 but many of the hottest phones
have been saved for last
I'm Donna Bell and in this top five I'm
coming down the most anticipated phones
for fall starting off at number five the
Sony Xperia z3 Sony's next-generation
flagship Android phone is expected to be
a lot like their last one and that's not
a bad thing 20 megapixel camera a quad
core processor and Sony's unmistakable
fit and finish this time around though
let's hope the Xperia lens on a carrier
in the US number four the Moto X plus
one another flagship phone that's
expected to only get a modest bump
faster processor bigger screen maybe a
64 gigabyte option and a handful of
customization options like the last one
but my favorite feature of the Moto X
was its $299 contract-free price
let's hope they keep that around coming
in at number three the Nexus 6
apparently this will also be a Motorola
phone currently codenamed Shamu which
coincidentally was my codename as a
chubby grade schooler fun times
now with the Nexus name comes Google's
full blessing and the likelihood that
this phone will be the first to ship
with Android L a true whale of a phone
comes in at number two the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 look for an even bigger
screen faster processor improved S Pen
functionality and most of the goodies
from the galaxy s5 moved over it won't
be cheap but the note has remained the
king of the phablets and there are a lot
of people waiting for this next
generation almost as many crazy fans as
there are for our number one most
anticipated phone for fall you guessed
it the Apple iPhone 6 we've been waiting
for a major refresh of the iPhone since
2012 for many Apple fanboys wait for the
iPhone 6 is about as close as they'll
get to tantric sex
it's an excruciating wait for what will
probably only be an incrementally larger
screen faster processor and some new
style of champers bezel that Johnny I
will take 10 minutes explaining to us in
a
that is only slightly not totally
condescending so there you have it the
five yet to be released phones everyone
is getting excited about now for all the
latest smartphone news head over to
phones at cnet.com and more top fives
