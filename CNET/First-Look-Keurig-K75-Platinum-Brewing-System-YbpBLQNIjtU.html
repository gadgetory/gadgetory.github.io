next to the Keurig k75 Platinum brewing
system this is a really nice looking
machine as you can see it features these
really nice blue LED lights that
highlight the 72 ounce reservoir which
is removable for easy filling and it's
matched over here by this LCD screen
that highlights the control panel and
all of your options to brew a cup of
coffee on this machine is really simple
you simply have to pull up on the lever
drop your k-cup and then close push brew
after you select your settings and it's
as easy as that
cleaning is pretty easy as well you can
remove this drip tray and this makes
room for either a travel-size mug or if
you want to clean this both parts are
100% dishwasher safe and it is easily
replaced just like that the k75 allows
you five size options for your beverages
ranging from four to twelve ounces the
k75 cruz coffee with k-cups but it's
worth noting that it doesn't brew k-cups
as well as other machines on the market
it produced a cup of coffee that was
kind of burnt and watery tasting and had
a bitter finish all of which are
attributes that you're not necessarily
looking for in your morning cup of
coffee there are other machines that we
tested such as the Cuisinart SS 700
which brewed a much better cup of coffee
with the cake hub if you're looking for
more of Keurigs newer technology they've
patented the Vue cup which brews a very
nice tasting cup of coffee if you're
looking to stay within the Keurig line
of products one of the complaints we had
about the k75 during our testing process
is that the construction seems a little
bit lacking compared to other machines
we looked at this is a faux chrome
handle and it is pretty stable I'm sure
it's fine but it feels a bit flimsy when
compared to some of the metal parts
featured on other machines so you
definitely want to keep that in mind
when shopping
overall this machine does everything
you'd want it to do as a coffee maker
there's nothing wrong with the mechanics
of this machine or how it function it
just doesn't prove a very good tasting
cup of coffee which if that's important
to you I would definitely look out
such is the bun my cafe MCU or the
Cuisinart SS 700 but if you are
interested in this model you can find it
on the manufacturers website for 179
dollars again this is the Keurig k75
platinum brewing system I'm Katy
