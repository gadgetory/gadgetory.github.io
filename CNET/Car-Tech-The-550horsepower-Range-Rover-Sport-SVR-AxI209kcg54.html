Sport SVR
what happened when the guys that
Landrover get tired of watching the
Jaguar engineers have all the fun of the
Nurburgring and build a sports car of
their own with its five liter
supercharged v8 engine this is the
fastest Land Rover ever built top speed
of 162 miles per hour and it hits zero
to 62 miles per hour in just 4.2 seconds
now underneath all of that we've got
Land Rovers excellent four-wheel-drive
system which features a new dynamic
setting for on-road handling fuel
economy is terrible here you're looking
at about 19 miles per gallon at best on
the highway about 15 point 4 on average
now it's interesting here is that the
right high end suspension appeared to be
unchanged from other Range Rover Sport
models we still sit pretty high up off
the ground which sort of diminishes the
feeling of speed and invalidates the
extra 40 some-odd horsepower but for the
extra money you're also getting an svr
body kit that looks a lot more
aggressive absolutely massive Brembo
brakes that bring this thing to a stop
on a dime and a revision to its 8-speed
transmission that helped it shift up the
40% faster
oh yeah you also get a button that
activates the sport exhaust something
similar to what we've seen on Jaguars
that makes this thing a lot louder now
the bass SVR starts at about one hundred
and eleven thousand dollars that's
significantly more expensive than about
the 80 thousand dollars you spend for a
Range Rover supercharged we've got a
bunch of options including carbon fiber
trim adaptive cruise control and this
$1,800 X toriel blue paint that brings
us to an as-tested price of one hundred
and eighteen thousand dollars yes you'd
have to be absolutely nuts to pay this
price tag but the kind of person
interested in this sort of car is
already there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
