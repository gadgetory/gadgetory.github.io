standing here beside canary this is the
all-in-one home security device that did
quite well on IndieGoGo about a year and
a half back now the big question here is
how is canary doing because back in
January it didn't seem like the device
was quite ready for primetime testing
about now runs pretty smoothly it's
pretty easy to use the app it was pretty
easy to get it set up and the camera
works almost all the time but one thing
I wasn't pleased with as I do back into
my test with this thing was that there
still isn't an auto alarm function you
want this thing to sound the 90 decibel
siren as soon as it sees someone enter
your house the middle tonight right well
the reason for that is because the thing
is really sensitive we ran it here in
the office for a few nights and we have
lights that go off on a staggered
schedule it would pick up each one of
those lights going off and send me an
alert saying hey I see something and I'd
say no it's just the light going off now
that's kind of a good thing you want
this thing to be able to catch the
smallest detail but you want it to be
able to differentiate between irrelevant
data and actual threats and canary is
supposed to learn but canary hasn't
really picked up on those differences
yet the canary team tells me that takes
a couple of months so you'd have to
spend a lot of time just tagging these
video clips before you'd ever expect to
see any sort of improvement in that
sensitivity which by the way you can't
adjust this means that when canary sees
something while it's armed it's going to
send you an alert on your phone and
leave the decision to turn the alarm on
up to you another big problem is that I
never receive notifications when canary
went offline when the power went out so
this means that if someone unplugs it
before the alarm gets raised its
basically blind it's dead and you don't
get that alert and you don't get that
video log in your canary app what would
happen I'm going to pull my app out here
and arm the device the light the bottom
turns green there that tells you that
it's armed and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to wave my hand in front of it
here and trigger that motion sensor and
then yank this cord out real quick and
you see my phone doesn't give me an
alert my phone doesn't say hey your
canary is offline suddenly if someone
were in the middle of burglarizing my
home I'd have no idea all in all this
device is still not as thorough an
option as I would want to protect my
apartment I'd rather have the I smart
alarm I camera keep I'd rather have
Dropcam I'd rather have the Piper NV
which is very well doing basically the
same thing that canary does given all
those other options for cameras
now I just don't think this is the one
that you want thanks for watching check
