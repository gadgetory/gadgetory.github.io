and today we're taking a first look at
the ZTE anthem 4g for metropcs available
now this handset costs 199 and is
available for purchase without having to
sign a stifling wireless service
contract now metropcs says the ZTE
anthem 4G provides Android 4G LTE and
enough speed and power to blaze a fiery
trail across the Internet well perhaps
the carrier didn't put it like that
exactly but it does come close to this
language on its website it's a nice
thought but I have a feeling that it's
week one point two gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor and 512 megabytes
of RAM will cool the anthem 4G down a
bit I assume it's week since both
metropcs and ZTE suspiciously avoid
mentioning the exact class of CPU the
handset uses I suspect though that it's
an older Snapdragon s3 or some sort of
variant another feature that leaves me
cold is the old android 2.3 Gingerbread
software the phone runs hey it's over
two years old and not getting any
fresher on front of the anthem 4G is a
small 4.3 inch LCD screen with a low 800
x 480 pixel resolution above it is a VGA
front-facing camera below are for old
style Android menu buttons which are
capacitive and backlit the left edge
holds a volume rocker and micro-hdmi
port while on the right are the power
button and microUSB port up top is a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and on back is
the phones 5 megapixel camera and LED
flash unfortunately the camera app is
very basic and has no frills or fancy
features this soft touch striped surface
here looks pretty wild though almost
gaudy the anthem also features dolby
audio technology which makes viewing
movies more engaging even better the
phone comes with the full kung fu panda
2 movie stored on a microSD card tucked
into its slot underneath the battery
door I'm Brian Bennett and this has been
a first look at the ZTE anthem for gene
