made the design it starts with this new
finish we call jet black the new
integrated antennas are built so subtly
you can barely see them at all anymore
there's a second new black we call it
simply black well the new iPhone 7 also
looks beautiful in gold and in silver
and of course rose gold number two
something we use hundreds of times a day
the home button and we've completely
redesigned it to make it more responsive
more reliable and even customizable it's
now force sensitive solid-state and it's
amazing because it can be programmed by
third-party applications and the
applications that have started to work
on iPhone 7 taking advantage of this
taptic engine are creating new feelings
and experiences that could not have been
created before in a smart phone number
three the new enclosure and iPhone 7 and
iPhone 7 plus are water and dust
resistance number four let's talk about
the camera everything about it is
entirely new there's an optical image
stabilizer in all iPhone 7 and 7 plus
helps study from shaking hands
there's a wider F 1.8 aperture lens that
lets 50% more light onto the sensor
there is a new six element
lens so you can get a sharp image edge
to edge without 1.8 aperture and there's
an all-new 12 megapixel sensor that is
large pixels it's 60% faster and 30%
more energy-efficient even the flash is
all-new our true tone flash and here's
an example of low-light photography so
much improved it's really great
developers are really excited that in
iOS 10 you can now capture raw DNG files
directly from the camera sensor and do
even more complex editing we also have
the best camera we've ever had on the
front side as well there's a new seven
megapixel FaceTime HD camera for those
selfies and those FaceTime calls who
make this is up from 5 megapixels the
sensor includes new pixel technologies
that we've used on the backside like
deep trench isolation do you remember
what that is that helps us get sharper
images as the pixels get close together
it also captures wide color images so
throughout the system we're applying
white color and does an auto image
stabilization so this shot that you see
up here on the screen that was taken
from the front side camera unedited
exactly as it can take a beautiful
selfie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
