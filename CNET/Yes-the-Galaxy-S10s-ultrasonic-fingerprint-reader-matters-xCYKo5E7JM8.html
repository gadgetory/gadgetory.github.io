the technology promises to be extremely
accurate secure in speedy unlocking your
phone almost instantaneously it won't
matter if your finger is greasy sweaty
wet or tacky and you won't have to
blindly fumble around trying to find the
target on the back of the phone the key
to all this is your fingertip which just
like a regular key has all these tiny
ridges and valleys that form a unique
pattern that only you possess Qualcomm
ultrasonic in screen fingerprint reader
claims that it will do a better job
unlocking your phone by mapping a 3d
image of your print using sound waves so
how does it work and why is it
considered better than an optical sensor
that's already on some phones optical
and ultrasonic fingerprint readers both
start with the sensor just point to
millimeters thin that's located several
layers of technology below the surface
glass when you touch the glass your
finger sends a tiny electrical pulse
that wakes at the sensor to scan your
print now the important part is how that
sensor performs the scan an optical
sensor basically takes a 2d photo of
your fingerprint it uses the display to
light up the area around your fingertip
and sends up a light wave that hits your
fingers ridges and valleys before
bouncing back down to the sensor below
the data is then interpreted as a
fingerprint that the phone will match to
the one you already have on file an
ultrasonic sensor on the other hand is
different because it uses high frequency
sound waves to detect the details of
your fingerprint this is similar to the
ultrasound technology that generates
pictures of babies in utero and it's
also related to how dolphins emit sound
waves to locate their prey on the phone
it works like this you touch the screen
the sensor wakes up it sends sound waves
back up to your finger that can read for
millimeters into the outer layers of
your skin because sound waves can
penetrate through liquid it will work
even if your finger is wet or gummed up
with lotion or french fry grease when
the sound waves bounce back down the
sensor module converts those wavelengths
into electrical signals that are then
used to identify your fingers ridges
valleys the finished product is a
detailed 3d image that is theoretically
harder to fool than optical sensors also
phones that use an optical sensor can
take up to a second to unlock rather
than verifying your identity in under
200 milliseconds like an ultrasonic
sensor can but these ultrasonic
fingerprint scanners have an important
limit they will only work with flexible
OLED displays and for now those are only
on certain high-end phones as all a
displays get cheaper it's possible that
Paul combs technology will make its way
to more phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
