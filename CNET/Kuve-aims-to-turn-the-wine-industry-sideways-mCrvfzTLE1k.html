winery in starlight Indiana taking a
look at the cuvette smart wine bottle
this is how it works you order each
cartridge through cuvee which is
partnered with about 14 California
wineries so far the cuvette bottle fits
over the aluminum cartridges and
activates the valves in the neck of each
cartridge but only when you tilt it to
port that way though normally you'd be
exposing the wine to air and it would
start oxidizing in the bottle with cuvee
it doesn't
thus the wine degrades over 30 days
rather than the typical two or three
it's a cool concept and from a tech
journalists perspective it works
decently well but i'm no somali ace so
we came here to get an expert's opinion
on how well this thing actually extends
the life of an open wine bottle and to
see how well they do in a blind taste
test do you want to talk a little bit
about what oxidation means for wine for
us and the winemaking feel that's oxygen
is kind of the enemy of wine we want as
little oxidation during aging as
possible so we preserve the fruit
character of the wine and the flavors so
essentially what we're gonna be doing
here is taking you over to a table and
doing a taste test if you're okay with
that and basically taking a look at this
device that helps avoid oxidation for
wines after they've been opened do you
think you'd be up for that I'll do my
best
all right so essentially what we've got
is three wines here they're all the same
same vintage and everything this right
here is a newly opened bottle and then
these two are both three days old but
you don't know which one has been
preserved and which one has okay so if
you want to start off you can just try
that one and talk a little bit about the
tasting as you do it it's very nice it's
full-bodied has good structure it's a
very nice bottle of wine so if you had
to guess between these two over here
which one was which what would you think
the number two is the preservation
system and the number one is the bottle
that's been open for three days okay so
you think that number two is closer to
the just open bottle of wine yes so
number one is actually the
preservationist system you can see that
that color and the the aroma of number
two are somewhat more muted and you get
more of the oak and not as much of the
fresh fruit
how do both of them compare to the
freshly opened bottle the aroma is just
a little bit more fresh in number one
than there were two compared to the
freshly opened bottle of course the
freshly opened bottle is is in my
opinion better than either one of the
other ones but at the end of the day the
cuvette bottle retains some of the
flavors and the aroma of the wine better
but the other bottle retained other
flavors better so neither one really
lived up to the newly opened bottle of
Chardonnay so right now for me I'd have
to pass on this product until the
methods of preservation improve for the
people at Huber's who hosted us and
participated in our blind taste test
we'd like to give you a big thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
