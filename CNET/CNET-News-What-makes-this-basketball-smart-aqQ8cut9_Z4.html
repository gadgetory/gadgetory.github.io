basketball but this one has something to
say the 9450 smart sensor basketball is
designed to be digital coach in the
shape of the basketball the 9450 smart
sensor basketball by inpho motion sports
aims to improve how players shoot and
handle the ball as players run through
drills to build muscle memory they
constantly hear and see coaching tips
through an app 9 sensors inside the ball
in the bluetooth radio that speech to
your smartphone are all designed to
instantaneously measure the forces you
put into it once you start getting that
feedback now you can feel the right way
of doing something rather than guessing
the most difficult part of creating the
basketball wasn't designing the
technology but protecting it it's like
taking your cell phone and throwing
again it's a ground a half a million
times a year and hoping it doesn't break
have to have special engineering on the
ball to get the sensors in there protect
them make sure they don't break the ball
charges on a wireless pad and sinks to a
smartphone or tablet with four bounces
while the technology is meant to impress
the most jaw-dropping aspect may be the
price more than ten times the price of a
regular basketball when you compare it
to what the alternatives are for
learning if that is your goal it's
actually an incredible value because it
comes out about 40 cents a day you can
use it every day whenever you want cnet
senior editor brian Tong took the ball
out for practice it's not like all of a
sudden you give me Michael Jordan or
LeBron James with this ball if you have
bad form this ball is not going to
necessarily help you but it will help
you get that ball over the rim and into
the hoop thanks coach in San Francisco
I'm sumida cnet for CBS News
