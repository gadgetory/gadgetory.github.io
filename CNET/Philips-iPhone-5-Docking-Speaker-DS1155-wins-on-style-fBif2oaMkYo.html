cnet.com and I'm here with the Phillips
iPhone 5 dock this also goes by the
model number the ds1 one five five
Phillips made a previous version of this
with the 30-pin connector but this has
the Lightning connector so it does work
with lightning equipped iPhones and
iPods
however this dock does not fit any sort
of iPads it's obviously very small its
compact it has a built-in clock which is
nice however there's no alarm however
you can use your iPhones alarm so that's
not a huge deal what I liked about it is
its design also reviewed a JBL unit this
is a little bit sleeker looking that
unit but that JBL on beat micro sounds a
little bit bigger it also has a little
bit better feature set than this for
instance there's a USB port on the back
of this stock but it's really only for
charging another device such as another
smartphone you can't stream audio
through that connection the other kind
of cool feature worth mentioning here is
that there's a bit of lighting on the
bottom of the unit there's a few LED
lights and so it gives off a sort of
yellow glow you can turn it off or you
can leave it on at night but it kind of
gives it a nice cool halo effect as far
as the sound goes it's fine it does play
bigger than you think it would but
compared to that JBL on beep micro this
one offered a little bit thinner sound
didn't have quite as much bass and it
wasn't quite as clear so in terms of
pluses if you're thinking about buying
this this does have a sleeker design it
does cost slightly less than some of the
new lightning equipped to speaker docks
out there but its sound quality is a
step below the JBL I'm David Carr noise
and that's the Philips iPhone 5 speaker
dock also known as the ds1 one five five
