Nakia in Abu Dhabi taking a look at its
new Lumia 1320 say six inch Windows
Phone 8 device with a fairly affordable
price tag
now that six inch display makes a 1320 a
really big beast of the phone if you've
got quite small hands it's probably
isn't for you but it does give you loads
of room for watching videos and checking
out your photos they have a 720p display
which isn't quite the full HD of its Big
Brother 1520 but it still seems fairly
sharp and it's bright and bold around
the back you'll see the same
polycarbonate design that you'll find on
a lot of real active Windows phones
serve a little in white in orange yellow
or black if you're not too keen on
colors you'll find a 5 megapixel camera
on the back and it's repowered by a 3400
milliamp an hour battery which should
keep it going for plenty of time so you
the latest version of Windows Phone 8
which crucially allows you to have three
rows of tiles that makes a lot of sense
on a phone this size as you can really
crammed in a lot more information
it's powered by a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core processor again not
challenging the quad-core of its bigger
brother but it should give plenty of
juice to the essentials doesn't have the
same impressive specs as its bigger
brother the 1520 but at $339 it is a lot
more affordable or find out a bit more
about the phone when it goes on sale
towards the end of the year I'm Andrew
boil for CNET and this is the Nokia
Lumia 1320</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
