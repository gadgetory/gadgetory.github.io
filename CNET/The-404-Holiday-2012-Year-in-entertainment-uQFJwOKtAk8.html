special Yuletide 2012 episode of the 404
show I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm Justin you I'm
Zack Weinberg and I mariela nunez today
ladies and gentleman we're going to be
recapping the year of 2012 in
entertainment in TV in movies and in
people speaking of people that we like
44 was graced in 2012 with a brand new
guests that we seem to enjoy we seem to
thank you Zack Weinberg has become quite
the part of the four hole we love them
for that as if we needed another Jewish
looking guy on the program Jewish
Italian really good looking yeah thank
you know what you will call it what you
will what you will you've you've made a
splash on the 404 this year and people
seem to like you for reasons unknown I
don't get it I don't get it either but
today you're gonna help us recap the
year in movies and TV and other
miscellaneous entertainment sure 2012
was I think 20 and I'm just going to say
this off out of the gate I think 2012
was the best year for movies hmm and a
decade in a decade yeah I mean think
about it you you know from the beginning
and especially as Oscar season heated up
from the summer all the way in to where
we are now in the end of December well
right now i'm excited for a bunch of
movies that are that are coming out I
think this December has been huge i
rarely i'm on a movie snob but and I
rarely go out of my way to make a list
of movies I want but I've started doing
that and I know movies are good when I'm
going out of my way as not a huge movie
fan with a big enough movie fan to
actually make a list of movies that I
want to say right um and there's a bunch
of coming out in December some have
already come out but I mean everything
from from Lincoln to django unchained
which everybody's going nuts over
Quentin Tarantino's new film is coming
out Christmas Day have you hurt you the
reviews were ever you
have already people are we going nuts
over Django Unchained yeah um the the
zero dark thirty movie about the raid on
Osama bin Laden which is too soon which
too soon hahaha to see the UM Bigelow
who directed Bigelow I forget her first
Oh Kat her from her locker ok she's
directing this film so people are
expecting that to be huge but yeah this
December great gatsby just coming out
and people are raving about that Les
Miserables less miserable you dummy what
what is it love less miserable it's less
miserable A's oh it's less miserable the
hobbit lame is your time I lame is the
hobbit man the hobbit we're not so much
what do you think about the hobbit I
haven't seen it yet not really desire to
but now that I'm looking at the cover
for this this is actually what the cover
of The Hobbit looked like it looks
ridiculous wow that's a lot there's more
facial hair and beards there than and
then a Friday night dance party in
williamsburg poster look at look at this
guy what can you explain something to me
hobbits Justin yeah I've never seen any
of the Lord pride in it wow so is this
is this in addition to know this is a
very cool yeah so it all started it's
it's it's the forging of the ring right
yeah yeah I don't know if it's the
actual forging of it but it's the
introduction of the ring and it talks
about you know what happened to the
global goal goes and gets the ring you
meet I would assume I didn't gonna say
read the hobbit I don't remember like
yeah is this where Smeagol turns into
Smeagol yeah yeah you hear about that
Jared for the ring you want to change
how the ring comes about so don't wait
so you've seen all the Lord of the Rings
creatures ok alright so but so the
neither of you have interest in seeing I
mean yeah I see it but the big thing is
it that it's in is the new 3d technology
48 frames per second but I don't I mean
I I don't want to see it as badly as I
wanted to see Lord of the Rings don't
you feel obligated at this point you
that's the jugglers time to see a series
that but the thing you know it's going
to be two hundred and eighty-seven
minutes you know it's going to be this
like really drawn out thing but it'll
probably be excellent you're knee-deep
in this whole franchise to begin with
might as well just finish it out too
much time invested just quit now the 48
frames-per-second thing does sound kind
of cool those reading a lot about it I
guess people getting nauseous from see
it's becoming a lot of stuff but also i
read basler done i read that in the
movie looks a lot more fake yeah because
uh you know like with the quality being
so good 48 frames it looks like the
swords that they're carrying a little
bit too light they look unrealistic the
lightsabers yeah exactly the thing is
what people don't realize and I think
they do but i think they sort of forgo
that it happens with television as well
when you get to those tvs that do the
artificial framerate enhancement like
the hundred twenty Hertz is any I don't
want to interrupt is that the what I
what I will is that the whole soap opera
effect that people talk about where soap
i watch a show when it looks like a
movie you watch it and it looks like
you're like this is weird get then and I
can't watch these own the way it works
is it's basically inserting frames where
the source material didn't contain them
so if you're watching a 30 frames per
second movie which is how i'm sorry 24
frames per second which is how film is
shot uh this is basically bumping it up
to an artificial 60 frames per second
which is uh the best thing like the best
analogy that that people might be able
to understand is a game like call anyone
who plays call of duty those games look
ultra smooth because they run at 60
frames per second most games run at 30
film a shot at 24 frames per second
video can be up to 60 frames per second
so it has this artificial sort of what
is hamid NGO so that's 48 because that's
a whole thing with 3d in that and 24
frames per I yeah without getting too
technical the end result is this
weird-looking sort of showing the thing
is with the hobbit though the hobbit it
all the source material was shot at this
accelerated frames per second when you
look at a TV or something that when you
see like a film brought up to 120 Hertz
it just looks artificial yeah just to
reel to reel like it's just not there
it's very unnatural you know things seem
to look too smooth you know one that's
and that's when it gets weird yeah as
long as I don't have to pay extra money
to get the 48 frames give me a
yet you know whether I can only process
so many yeah I don't know what the
threshold is but the hobbit I do want to
see it um but look let's look back yeah
on 2012 okay you got the dark knight
rises hmm let's not forget about that
epic movie you got the Avengers you got
our go remember our grease into our got
Erica life of pi people are really
enjoying that Lincoln seven psychopaths
wreck-it Ralph Skyfall Moonrise Kingdom
all right looper people forget about
looper bruiser a lot of people really
enjoyed looper um I we just talked about
moonrise kingdom I really enjoyed I
enjoyed that I hope it does well come
Oscar time you got Ted don't forget
about ten toes good uh was the hunger
games this year yeah it was the
beginning of this year and Prometheus
was as well Hunger Games beyond the
best movies of twenty twelve minutes
anyway even if it was people really
liked it yeah it was okay like the book
I didn't dislike it I thought it was
good i thought it was a good adaptation
um Zack I saw on your list and took a
peek before the shows yeah that jiro
Dreams of Sushi is a standout hit that's
my time I list you gotta think netflix
for that right i don't i show you a
feeder oh you did I live right I'm Audi
uh well you bring sushi into the theater
huge loser no that's like bringing a
tuna fish sandwich onto the subway no I
I live right near Beekman theater okay
near 66 street and they always they only
show to Thea movies at a time but
they're always showing off be you know
somewhat indie films and there you and
they usually show them a couple of weeks
before they they come out to the general
public and I saw that I was bored one
day I remember was the beginning of the
year and this movie jiro Dreams of Sushi
i watch the trailer about it and I'm a
big sushi fan I love sushi I'll eat a
few times a week and I never even heard
of this guy or the restaurant but
apparently it is known as being the
greatest sushi restaurant in the world
and it's in japan right outside of a
subway station and Jiro is this crazy
sushi chef that's 80 in his 80s and he's
been doing this his entire life and it's
an art form to
only 10 people can sit in the restaurant
at a time you have to make reservations
months years in advance it's almost
impossible to get and there is no menu
he just brings out whatever he wants and
just the whole I highly recommend the
movie it's just it's crazy because he
gets so obsessed over this mood you
can't believe there's a whole story in
history behind it it was one of the best
films of the year the attention to
detail in that movie was what impressed
me the most we talked about how his
60-year old assistance which is really
going to be here offenses that are 60
years old that are massaging the rice
for an hour after yeah who would have
thought that just making rice and the
way that you make it's crazy you know if
forget about going to Harvard for your
MBA you you've gotta study under 0 for
four and a half years just to learn how
to make rice probably yeah but the
outcome of it is just the most superb
apparent I have no idea i've never been
this the most it's and the most
unbelievable experience you will ever
have right as far as consuming a certain
food is concerned it really after
watching that movie kind of ruins sushi
for you because you kind of don't want
to eat susan anywhere i'm never gonna
have as good as an experience or so he
or so it seems like they're close yeah a
lot of people like the raid the rate oh
is that the i saw the trailer fan I
never saw that the one with the building
where they have to go up and he'll
everyone a lot of people really dug that
a lot of people dug sessions a lot of
people dug the master with the film
happen inspired by the whole Scientology
thing then you gotta be they didn't say
it was directly based on it is everybody
Gary obviously a people were upset Tom
Cruise apparently watched the movie got
a private screening months before it
came out yeah and it completely God went
ballistic on the director we thought it
was for a his angel wings just can't you
just be just uh upcoming oh this is 40
is coming out i think that's good i'm
looking forward to stuff like no you
don't that's okay yeah i'll go see it i
want to ask you guys uh looking back to
the past again did you guys see marley
the two and a half hour documentary
about me did you hear about it yeah it
is really yeah i heard it was really
good to punch my friend saw it none of
them remembered actually seen the movie
mr. video is pretty good it's on netflix
right now it's more that's right that
damn Marley I got a recommendation where
people probably didn't see this film
Bernie
burn oh right if we talk it'll actually
recommend that one to Jack Black an
excellent little indie feeling sort of
movie yeah I would check that out if I
were you too that's that's not what the
list I got four movies though but real I
mean I could you know 365 days ago when
we were talking about the films of 2011
we were like why did they even bother
talk about a night and day difference
year-over-year in the quality of films
it made this year made me a believer
yeah it made me a believer in that there
are some original ideas out there and
you know it's not all lost yeah so I
think this year was an unbelievably
successful year for film even though no
one went out to the movie theatres and
went to the theaters not it's the the
box on the in terms like the box office
but you did have two films that almost
did 200 million in a weekend this year
which is a big deal The Avengers in Dark
Knight mm-hmm um all right let's switch
gears you have you have your worst
movies i've got my 50 films when i get
my knives that made a couple list for
things so let's hear your best and worst
I so will do will do best yeah the best
I do want to hear your worse to know
we're a cynical or a cynical group you
sure so we will start with the good
stuff and that will end a bad note of
course when we when we do the list all
right so for my five best films of 2012
all right number five Dark Knight okay
number four Ted really yeah I like you
gotta see hell what with all the other
it's just the the the poop jokes and I'm
to me that I mean and it was good it was
done well McFarland knew what he was
doing MacFarlane Seth MacFarlane and the
bear was hilarious it's the sort of
movie that you sit around on the couch
in like that you should make a movie
like this when you and your buddies are
just sitting around doing nothing and
they find your way to nothing and I
finally did it doing nothing those are
the doing nothing ya know you're just
doing doing you're doing nothing anyway
number three number three I have Lincoln
he said it was unbelievable you know
what like i didn't understand most of
the dialogue because i don't have a law
degree where a lot of people are saying
you have to be smart and I'm sorry bro
I'm not
smart but the whole the whole Daniel
day-lewis just brings you into this
world by his acting is just remarkable
so Lincoln just it was it was phenomenal
okay um my number two movie jiro Dreams
of Sushi speculation you gotta go see it
yeah if you like sushi or you just
appreciate detail or somebody that's so
passionate about something just go see
the movie right I mean my number one
movie of the year was moonrise kingdom
nice by what Cyrus tell that it was
awesome it really was excellent it was
light it was simple dialogue was good
the cameos were good it was just an
entertaining young love story that just
goes oh right he's just there's you guys
can never make fun of hipsters ever
again what you're saying that you love
that movie is like the hipster movie a
versatile first week Amy Boy Scout
uniforms is like the most popular
Halloween thoughts with Williamsburg Wes
Anderson yeah started that he's starting
today so he is super hip it's super hip
but it had a record players in the movie
talk about hipsters before the show
today such hypocrites but I understand
your it's a weird sort of defensive I'm
just saying you guys shouldn't talk crap
on history oh no we most certainly
should i bring it on pretty well you're
not even on me I'm just saying go ahead
yeah anyway ooh nice King right movie
retarded and I think it's gonna win
something I really do I think I think I
think I think this year is gonna be Ben
Affleck here though are you gonna give
him an Oscar I just do I feel like the
buzz is playing up it's gonna be a great
Oscar show into early 2013 all right
let's get hit can I want to hear your
work all right so for me I'm not a movie
snob like i said earlier so when i go
into every movie and I pay the 13 14
bucks i get the ten-dollar popcorn every
movie I see these are the greatest movie
I could go I can be seeing tile a tire
Tyler Perry hey gonna see a Tyler Perry
film and be you know what goddamn it
this is going to be the greatest movie
I'm ever gonna see I'm taking two hours
out of my day to go to the movie theater
and watch and so for me it's not the
five worst movies of 2012 it's the five
most disappointing of course of twenty
twelve i'm so so number five killing
them softly but you said recently saw it
with brad pitt g fini was bad awful
really do you like somebody owed
somebody a favor and holler
that's why birth james gandolfini maken
rumor for you he comes in he's this
awesome alcoholic funny surprise yeah
cases all he's an alcoholic sex addicted
he comes in he's this great huge
character huge force on screen him and
Brad Pitt have great dialogue back and
forth bantering in this restaurant in
this hotel room and then he just leaves
the movie never to return yeah it was
the sort of film that where people SAT
around and they were like you know what
we can get Brad Pitt on board will have
a really cool trailer will play a
rolling stone song in the background
people see it and that'll be it right
that's number five Number Four looper
just knocking like enjoyed you know like
about let's not worry I don't get it
what you don't let me let me just say
watch with time travel movies you always
have to known it I'm not gonna give
anything away though he's like of you
whatever you have a movie that deals
with time travel there's always going to
be some loopholes that you have to just
attending you have to suspend relaxed at
the end or not cuz they put Justin okay
the ending there's a lot of little kid
but you have to admit inspired a lot of
post movie conversation I think that's
an indicator of at least about movie
that's the thing and you know a lot of
people uh they they have problems with
the end of 12 monkeys yeah I think 12
monkeys is epic I think that film is ok
it's not the word this is my most
disappointing I like there as well as I
love jgl Joseph gordon-levitt I expected
it you like prosthetics like his face I
do you do yeah move on number two number
three of the amazing spider-man I
believe that was bad um I'm gonna go
right past the head number two the
dictator it just you know what he set
the bar so bad no you know what I think
you're right with this with that funny
you expected that to be really good
after he well that's what I mean he
shouldn't like bull rat and even on bow
is that what was the other room terrible
okay but the dictator because and you
know what maybe he's done it to himself
yeah coming with these expectations it
just wasn't a problem with the dictator
was that it wasn't all interviews right
it wasn't that you actual it was
actually natural gay because there are
funny scenes in the dictators there are
scenes that are so over the top and so
ridiculous he's gotta stick to what made
him famous right and that was really
pissing people off and yeah embarrassing
party can only assume so many identities
I mean everyone knows who bore it is
Boris is Borat is dead for all hire
better actors or actresses to to you
know to run with him on these jokes or
that the general put you know so don't
have to do something fool us are 10
worst movie the worst movie of the year
most disappointing a thousand words with
Eddie Murphy oh my god Oh might be
thousand words that's the move n that's
it must have forgot about that you saw
that was it a matinee tell me was a man
named Zoe uh it's been a friday night in
the theater yeah look I love anymore can
you stand papa you didn't see that movie
you're full of I did you didn't see
it I saw you saw that by yourself you'll
only loneliness nobody wanted to go with
me yeah a bunch of homeless men in the
theater on sixty-second shirt got to get
it out of the cold that was the most
disappointing that's a pretty good list
though I respect that not sure about
looper I'm gonna hold judgement and
early action until you see it let me
know I heard good stuff about cabin in
the woods near your heart echoes
different twist oh you saw that yep I
did see and you see a lot of movie I did
I saw that what were your personal
there's a lot of independent movies here
like chasing ice was really good it was
about the melting Arctic glaciers that
one was great or AI weiwei which is
about Chinese you it was he was like a
Chinese guy but he was good he was a
Chinese good chinese gay uh it was a
good year for movie it was excellent
there was a lot of movies this year
usually you want movies to fail cuz it's
funny to look at hollywood abajo they
from all this money into a movie and
nobody goes to see a petitioner the
majority of them still our bed yes not
nothing about even with these dozens and
dozens of good films the majority of
something what did you say a hundred
movies come out or I think it's more
than that but I think I think the
majority of them are
it's crazy but there's a lot of good
ones this year all right we gotta switch
gears yeah uh spend the next half of the
show talking about television okay who's
good year for TV mm-hmm uh we what we
all kind of watch a lot of the same
stuff well just doesn't watch TV cuz I
don't have back 12 episode she doesn't
even have a box right exactly did watch
Walking Dead this year and I just you
gotta give it up for walking dead this
year just because they turned it around
in my opinion and I think Justin shares
the sentiment the first two seasons of
The Walking Dead just weren't doing it
and here comes season three in the first
you know they've split up the season so
season three is split up too many
seasons this first mini season of The
Walking Dead was excellent yeah and I'm
using that word with no reservation it
was excellent so definitely give the
guys at that at that show a lot of
credit because they really turned it
around maybe it's because they're
sticking to stories similar to the comic
book a comic book is such a triumph that
it's finally translating to TV yeah it
took him a while but Walking Dead this
year was excellent I also think that was
walking dead this year they examined a
lot more interpersonal relationships
with the new characters that came out in
the first season just felt like I didn't
really know any of the guy right who is
key dog it was distant right moreau just
went away after one episode they had a
lot of just a single dose characters
right here a lot better zombies just
taken over man yeah you know it means
vampire now it's I was gonna say what
what has a quick what's next we world
war z his neck I'm reading world war z
right now did you see the trailer for
trailer for I don't know if I do and I'm
often like these zombies there look like
they're the fast-moving once that's what
they are I want a book that's they're
getting involved in the books I haven't
been well think about it the book is
about a 10-year war with zombies right
the humic yeah humans fought the zom--
zombies weren't like loading up guns
they were just a rampant you know right
pack of people that were going crazy and
they were unmanageable so we had a life
also you did read sections of it the
book is more of like all these different
accounts yeah right it's from different
yes from different perspectives from a
doctor and what chinesey a little
backstory people don't realize the guy
who wrote World War Z is mel brooks's
son haha max brooks max Bruch he
so did I think he might have done
graphic novels before orographic now but
he also did the survival the zombie
survival dinosaur how to survive a
zombie apocalypse yeah it's just more
funny huh World War Z is messed up horsy
is crazy and that comes out in june you
know brad pitt and i read brad pitt and
leo dicaprio were in a huge bidding war
over the rights that is not a bad couple
of people to be arguing over you're
right they should just let both of them
play may never done you can have that
one you have the first one you have the
sequel back to uh TV though would you
guys think of girls mmm like girl too
real you know I was just gonna say that
it almost made me feel uncomfortable
yeah now being a 20 something year old
guy living in New York has been dating
in the scene and going out you almost
watch it and you cringe a little bit
because for so many years it's been easy
for girls to see what goes on in the
guy's mind through TV shows you even
watch entourage and girls have been able
to sell that's what they're really
thinking and that's what they talk about
and they're just with the boys yeah and
girls has finally opened up our minds
and our ears to see what goes on in a
girl's head know were dating and texting
and sexting and gchatting and all this
other stuff and it was kind of like he
gets the point where you're sitting on
the couch like ah yeah I want to shut
this off right i know i don't know i
think i've been watching girls too and i
mean it's it's really interesting to get
a glimpse into a female's mind from that
perspective but also i just think it's
too real because i have a lot of friends
at fit into these archives and that's
the saddest part kinda depresses me that
I have not a maybe room it might just be
my own daily stretch of real ya
that everyone just seems to be
floundering in this like post-college
mediocrity and that's what really
depresses me but the thing is too though
I think it's also a little too regional
specific yeah I think New York is a
bubble we could say it's it's
pretentious spoiled white girls on the
show yeah the thing is is that i'm not
sure someone in you know omaha nebraska
you know can like really appreciate that
doesn't order six trainers right you
know realities and that there's no it's
also completely unauthentic because
they've gone an entire season without
meaning one non-white person right i
mean yeah that'll do not you been to New
York
just wipe all white people only if you
watch friends and girls you are aware
that everyone has great apartment yep
and no one's friends with black people
and they don't have any real jobs but
somehow they can afford places that
require a five-thousand-dollar monthly
span which is monthly payment right so I
but I think theirs is like entitlement
thing that translates and girls which
for better or worse needs to be exposed
I did think it was good though it's good
all the good shits good you can you
please seriously can take it to serve
her credit for getting naked man give
you forget that get naked a lot
half-million-dollar book deal she just
yeah doesn't matter man I'm just saying
she knows what she's doing she's got a
corner on the market but it's it's
bogeyman and I'll I like that ya know
she's got she seems cool she knows she's
doing you know she would you want to
hang out with her yeah I'd want to hang
out and get drunk with her why not yeah
would you want to hang out with no
should I don't like yeah that's good I
guess we gotta mention breaking bed I
don't watch breaking bed I I don't know
enough about the show but I know it's
excellent and I know I need to watch it
it's just one of those programs haven't
gotten to you yeah the same thing
happened with me with breaking bad that
happened with weeds I just got bored um
I did man yeah I didn't want to have to
look back at four seasons of breaking
bad i mean after he just stopped getting
cancer the story just seemed irrelevant
what the fated for me no it's not it's
not a root it's not a ruining thing it's
just he doesn't ever talk about having
cancer that's a major same time as you
still have it I don't know he somehow
seem to have miraculously like we're
just not about bringing the meth than
him making the meth for he's kidding you
just ruined the lion you know I'm out of
here yeah we Zach and I obviously have
to bring up the best show on television
hands down and it's not my number one
but it's okay for my sons of anarchy so
so Justin I believe this is this guy he
had such a weird honeymoon period yes
sons of anarchy you watched a few like
us little the first time she loved it
yeah I really like I really liked it and
then I got caught up to when it started
airing on TV again and i just stopped
and this is more just a symptom of me
not having cable television and not make
any way to consume it and that's the
problem i just didn't want to have to go
after every week and download a new
epoch Justin's a tough tough critic
yeah it doesn't really read is not the
thing that's really important you know
what that is yeah a cable box even on
this episode maybe actually I think you
like the required equipment but I don't
disagree that is a great shape it was it
was good this year you know it was good
you hate on it and it's a love hate
relationship you want to find never
really you know Jeff that's when you
know you really love sure you start
looking for the littlest things a pickle
mean look such as whether the walking
dead were that some seasons are great
tomorrow they're all very good they're
all very good when you when you compare
them to the to the national average okay
okay there in like the 99th percentile
yeah it's utter knows reason they it is
written marvelously it is written uh
brilliantly it's it's there's something
about this show that it I think the
acting is really good too i think the
acting in the first season was maybe a
little suspect but I mean they're not
afraid to pull out punch that's not
afraid to do him he'll kill off a main
character in the snap of a finger he
doesn't care that's what Kurt Sutter
does he'll he'll throw in more than just
a monkey wrench over phone a freaking
army tank and not you know not care
about it and I mean he'll do it with two
seconds left in an episode right it's
great that's what he does I I can't say
enough good stuff about everyone who
listens knows how we feel about it let's
run through a few other things here a
lot of people really are digging
homeland but there i'm hearing in the
second season has been a little suspect
after watching that SNL skit where they
made fun of everybody's little weird
habits on the show I couldn't watch it
and I know a lot people I can't watch it
anymore because of that yeah the main
cats small mouth that I can't get over
that it's like he's sucking on a warhead
yeah the entire time and he's looking
into the Sun and he's just like is it in
French Anouar what's her name is always
crying morning yeah you know what though
you look at you look at an actress like
that in the career that she's had yeah
and then she comes back headed nowhere
and she's I'm not a big issue it is
impressive like good for her I mean that
is I don't even know how that works I
don't know how you've taken ten years
off yeah let's bring you back you make
you the biggest name again in Hollywood
you brought up another show that I
wanted to talk about you SNL I think
ethanol has really
really made a comeback in 2012 in the
late 90s early 2000s it was trash and I
think everyone was trash even up to neck
last year I think this room was great
josh brolin episode is really funny
Joseph gordon-levitt was great and a
ball when he was great no then I before
nians episode to save had a lot more
solid skins that back we like drunk
uncle a lot we love drunk a lot of
people were upset when a lot of the cast
members left right like a nice amberg
kristen wiig both left in 2012 and i
thought that was gonna flounder after
that it didn't it's actually improved I
think the seasons been ok I think the
premiere was Seth MacFarlane was great
awesome uh it's been ok yeah i thought
the one this past weekend was i just
hate the weekly Update with Seth Meyers
which Seth my the weekly update he's
just not it's not fun like yeah I don't
like the week the update ok but people
are definitely divided over all right up
I want to get to things that are also on
your list so it looks like tell me
you're bad so we'll do best TV shows and
we'll do like we did before follow suit
yeah alright so best TV shows number
five I have workaholics I love it you
know it's such an easy after working all
we all week all day you get home which
is something you can watch 22 minutes
and you're done number four curb with
Larry in New York right Susie Angeles
this season was great with Larry in New
York I'm glad you brought that up number
three it's still my favorite after all
these years South Park sarcastaball was
good raising the bar episode with james
cameron do you catch anything she just
no i didn't sound far this year was
excellent was very good on number two
sons of anarchy okay and my number one
show of the year Louie nice to me it is
just the most the epitome of if you if
you are either young if you're younger
than 4 and you just want to see what
life will be like a zit divorced 40
something year old man with two
miserable spoiled girls just watch louie
it is the most you talk about girls
being real and louie i think is even
more real than what great real but at
the same time Lou that show does a lot
of David Lynch II Woody Allen sorta
fantastic that's not a bad category to
be a bet either I'm just saying there is
a lot of realism in the show but they
also have this car blog where they just
go off the rails and like a sci-fi nhi
it's like twin peaks thing all I have
friends I won't watch it because a lot
of them said I'm into
pressing dark sort of TV shows a Six
Feet Under using my favorite show but I
have friends that all that won't watch
louie are there because of how they're
put because you don't know how you're
gonna feel after you watch some people
watching at the end of the episode you
like so you have a couple drinks and you
watch 0 for a wall right never to return
from God forbid people feel emotional
it's good runs a great show i don't know
if it's number one but it's for me i
would just switch sons in louis i would
look worse the five worst number five to
view the skill you watch this part that
just like looked on the TV gun is like
what do I what do I hate basically you
okay number four what would Brian
Boitano make that's a show that's a show
I wasn't show on Brian Boitano the
famouser biggest eat okay yeah over
private and promote on I didn't she was
here right now seem Lak kanessa to never
saw the South Park movie no I didn't not
a huge fan but ok oh yeah watching him
cook yeah that's we that's it number
three keeping up with the kardashians
nice is still the worst show on as far
as I'm because I'm one of the worst
shows on television good i hate that
number two toddlers and tiaras for
introducing us to honey boo boo child
and that is that number one no that's
number two but honey boo boo should be
number 10 because number one is even
worse than honey boo boo what 16 and
pregnant Oh beautiful I mean these are
just scum of wisin I advise Jersey Shore
not on there you know what well this is
this is my jersey coming out yeah now
you don't look jersey shore you know
what you're really getting yourself into
with it and there's no hiding behind
that they're cursing they're fighting
they're well you don't know no but you
know what the way they try to make you
think that there really is a storyline
and a family that really cares about
their well-being Jersey sure you know
they know the characters on what they're
getting themselves into as do the
producers yeah honey boo boo they're
trying to make it in ethical they're not
and 16 and pregnant they're not yeah I
mean these are 16 year old girls that
are just don't like where we've evolved
you I don't like raising the bar the
South Park a bright don't know how low
we've set the book but it's just and I
don't know maybe it's that we're getting
old maybe because I turned 30 this year
I don't know what it is are you with me
in re oh I got you like I don't watch I
just it's really really bad and you know
that's not
say there's not good stuff as well but
the stuff that's bad is almost the
depressing feelings i get from the stuff
that's bad almost overshadow the joy i
have four things that because you start
hating things so much that it's
impossible to enjoy the good that's that
alright you also made a list I didn't
know that about people about just what
you call a point wait real quick i
wouldn't say one more thing about
telling saloon and i want to talk about
late night TV and that's sure that i've
gone really wrapped up in recent watch
literally right i watch late night with
jimmy fallon almost every day so you're
a big Jimmy Fallon fan I think it's
funny but more so than that the music
this year and in the past few years has
been amazing well they're getting a new
audience you've got a new audience the
music director has gotten acts like
Bruce Springsteen to come back again
refused you remember that band refuse
that core band from the 90 s they were
on Jimmy Fallon they were all just
reunited for Jimmy Fallon they had I
just think that late night with jimmy
fallon has been doing a lot of risky
things too like they had odd future on
for the first time they're the ones to
break that they had Frank Ocean on
whatever he knows i was like tyler
theater yeah I the creative I'm just
being a racism vision the fugees
reunited on late night that was amazing
to me i was out of my seat market for
now like you said they're they're
getting a younger a younger demographic
to watch the app and also there's a lot
of game stuff too yeah yeah they're
putting this stuff online the next day
they're in these performances and that's
huge to it's all aggregates all you know
it's just a way for them to promote the
show but the music is huge yeah it's
also started to watch these episodes or
these late night shows simply for the
musical moments that's going to be on
yeah right speaking of tyler the creator
i really liked his adult swim show yeah
oh um that the home game at all there's
like a Metalocalypse types types no it
