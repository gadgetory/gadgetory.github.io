at the Guggenheim Museum in New York
City where Apple has announced new ways
that you're going to be getting your
textbooks and course materials on the
iPad it starts with an update to the
ibookstore there's a whole new category
now for textbooks they have some really
cool rich engaging interactive
experiences and this is one here I'm
going to pinch it up to full screen so
you can see it better and now when I tap
we zoom in and we see animated 3d models
of the structures inside of a cell and
they've even introduced an app called
iBooks Author that makes it really
simple for people to make textbooks and
you don't need to have any programming
skills but if you do have programming
skills you're going to always take it up
a notch with animations and unique
features but with really simple tools
all you have to do is drag and drop
photos drag and drop movies and drag and
drop the text itself it's all
automatically formatted Apple is hoping
that this makes textbooks more enjoyable
the learning experience more interactive
for classrooms so I'm really happy to be
the first to tell you that the new
iBooks Author will be available for free
there also is another announcement the
iTunes U has its own app now itunes you
will now have entire college curriculums
not just the PDF or a lecture video now
you're
syllabus all the materials you need for
class the professor's can even send
assignments to you and you'll get
notified in the app and check off what
assignments you complete it let's take a
look at my next assignment this is to
read a chapter and as I tap on it it
opens up and shows me the book and just
tapping on it switches me over to ibooks
and it opens me right to that spot in
the book the apps are free and those new
interactive textbooks are going to start
at 1499 or lower iTunes you will even be
introduced to a K through 12 level so
it's not just colleges anymore from the
Guggenheim in New York City I'm Bridget
