the portable wireless Bluetooth speakers
here at CNET these days it's a very
crowded market and a lot of the products
aren't all that different from one
another
it's nice then to come across a product
like JBL's pulse which attempts to shake
things up by throwing a multi LED light
show into the mix the pulse has a
similar design to JBL highly rated flip
and charge Bluetooth speakers but it
plays a little louder and sounds a
little better with slightly better bass
response however it doesn't offer as
much battery life as the charge which
incorporates a USB port for charging
mobile devices the flip is a $99 speaker
while the pulse is $199 you're not going
to get double the sound quality but you
are getting a much flashier speaker
literally of course not everyone is
going to love the visual element but I
found the light show fairly mesmerizing
even without smoking anything as far as
the lighting goes there are a few
different pre-program modes to choose
from and you can also go with a custom
light theme or just turn off the LEDs
altogether and listen to the pulse like
you would a standard wireless Bluetooth
speaker what's also kind of cool is that
when you raise and lower the volume
you'll see it reflected on the speaker
I'm happy to report that JBL has fixed
one key shortcoming of its earlier
portable Bluetooth speakers the post
charges be a standard micro USB
connection instead of using an AC
adapter which is easy to misplace
battery life is rated at 10 hours for
audio only and five hours if you fire up
the light show there's no speakerphone
capability but you do get NFC the tap
tap air option for devices that support
it and JBL has an iOS and Android app
that gives you a little more control of
playback though the app isn't required
to use the product in this price range
you'll find the UE boom and Bose
Soundlink mini both of which are very
good portable speakers I would say this
JBL sounds better than those speakers
but it does sound quite decent fruit
size and the light show is a killer
feature and maybe a gimmick but it's a
good one and makes the pulse a worthy
contender in a crowded market I'm David
