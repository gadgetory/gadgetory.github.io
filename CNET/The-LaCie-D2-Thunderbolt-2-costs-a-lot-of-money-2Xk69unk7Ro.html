d2 thunderbolt to drive formula C now
this one is quite special for a few
reason first it's a very first order
market that is a single volume external
hard drive meaning you have only one
internal drive on inside yes it
supported the Thunderbolt 2 standard now
obviously the speed of the internal
drive on the inside is so much slower
than the speed of 30 boom 2 which is 20
degree per second but this means the
drive here can be used in a daisy-chain
setup with other son of all two devices
second is a design it come with the base
right here with a many many little
rubber feet that help keep the vibration
away and also keep the drive stay flat
on the surface without moving around too
much but the main reason quite special
because very expensive now this top
capacity here
SiC terabyte costs some 500 dollars in
u.s. or 390 pounds in the UK or some
second and 50 dollars in Australia and
if you want to spend more and why not
right
you can also spend money on this SSD
upgrade kit now this one here cost some
three hundred dollars in u.s. itself
basically it just swap out of the back
of the drive just like this and by the
way using the kit also means you do a
way that you speed through Pingo port I
guess I'll see one to make the upgrade
kit that's also a doubt quikrete at the
same time now the kit after another 128
gigabyte to the drive you would have two
separate volumes though one superfast
for hot data and the other for long term
storage a bike up and speaking of speed
the d2 here which were very fast in my
testing with the sustain real one speed
of some 180 megabyte per second for
writing and some 200 megabyte per second
for reading when used with the phone of
all when used with USB 3.0 it offers
some 135 megabyte per second for writing
and some 140 megabyte per second for
reading and when upgraded the PCI
Express solid-state part can offer more
than 1000 megabyte per second that's
crazily fast the d2 is available now in
three four and six hereby for morning
check out my full review at cnet.com
basically is a
expensive start device but in this case
you pay for what you want to get and to
many of you I believe this little blue
ball right here is clearly a nice bonus
not me though but because I'm don't know
and this has been the first look at the
d2 thunderbolt to drive policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
