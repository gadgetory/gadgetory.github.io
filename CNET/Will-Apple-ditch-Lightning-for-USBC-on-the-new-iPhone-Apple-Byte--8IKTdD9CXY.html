with the Apple buy for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple yes we
missed last week's show it's what I call
a vacation now the big story that caused
the most confusion this week
has to do with the next iPhone of course
it does a Wall Street Journal report
says one model of Apple's next iPhone
will have a curved display with Apple
ordering enough flexible OLED screens
for mass production
now those screens will allow for a curve
at the edge of the phone just like we've
seen in Samsung phones now we've heard
all this before but then the journal
also reports the next iPhone will
feature a USB C port for the power cord
and other peripheral devices instead of
the company's original lightning
connector now then the internet decided
to run with it and started screaming the
iPhone is ditching the Lightning port
the iPhone is ditching the Lightning
port that's not how I interpreted it the
journal statement is ambiguous at best
and doesn't outright say the iPhone is
getting rid of lightning I think the new
iPhone is going to have the option for a
USB C power adapter just like the iPad
pro see a lot of you might not know one
even exists because not many of you have
the iPad pro it's the only iOS device
that can take advantage of the full
twenty nine watts of power it's a
must-have and I bought it because it
charges two-and-a-half times faster than
that standard janky 12 watt one that
comes with it
oh yeah thanks Apple for making me pay
thirty five bucks for the cable and
forty nine bucks for the power adapter
to get the best charging possible that's
a bad apple now do you really think
Apple is going to all of a sudden just
ditch its proprietary connection the
answer is no and sure there's a chance I
could be wrong but I don't see it
happening so let's just calm down now
take a deep breath okay it's most likely
for the power adapter and not the
complete removal of the Lightning port
on the iPhone are we good now okay yeah
we're good all right Apple had their
annual shareholders meeting where a
bunch of rich guys with Apple stocks can
ask stupid questions a Tim Cook like
asking for a super smart dumb round
phone seriously that's what happened to
which Tim Cook responded not sure we're
going to create a round phone but there
were also some takeaways cook talked
about
the air pods and said Apple is making
them as fast as they can and called me
wireless earbuds quite the cultural
phenomenon okay Tim you're drunk come on
I don't even see one out of 100 people
wearing them in the Bay Area you know
what was a cultural phenomenon Pokemon
go or let's go away back way back to
this dance craze called
the Macarena hi heck even salt Bay is
bigger than the air pods now air pods
are good really good apples best product
of 2016 but Tim stop making stuff up now
cook also pushed back that Apple is to
Consumer Focus and said Apple will do
more in the Pro area and that the
creative field is especially important
to Apple hey Tim just a reminder we're
at three years and two months since the
last Mac Pro update brah I'm Axl right a
year and a half so I'm pretty sure your
priorities are actually somewhere else
now when asked about merging the iPad
with the Mac he reiterated that he sees
them as separate and that the iPad will
do more and more so that more people
will view the iPad as a laptop
replacement but not a Mac replacement
translation don't expect the hybrid OS
that the iPad needs and we want to ever
come all right Google now has a live TV
streaming service of their own called
YouTube TV that will cost $35 a month
and offer a bundle of channels from the
big four ABC NBC CBS and Fox and
channels related to those like ESPN
Bravo and more now pay TV only networks
from Viacom AMC and Time Warner won't be
a part of it but come on Apple now
there's PlayStation View sling TV 18
teams right now and YouTube TV but Apple
still has absolutely nothing to show for
when they could have been ahead of this
a long long time ago you know what I'm
tired of throwing out bad apples over
and over for this it just makes me sad
now like sad Apple
now in case you missed that Apple's new
campus will be officially called Apple
Park and it's one thousand seat
auditorium will be named after Steve
Jobs Apple parks 175 acre campus will be
ready in April for its 12,000 employees
to start moving in the campuses
ring-shaped 2.8 million square-foot
building is entirely covered by the
world's largest panels of curved glass
this is part of ashnnaise legacy and
really one of the most impressive
buildings you'll ever see it's also the
world's largest naturally ventilated
building that requires no heating or
air-conditioning for nine months of the
year no word yet if the ventilation
system is strong enough to handle really
stinky farts and the Nintendo switch
it's coming out this weekend but believe
it or not there is a connection to Apple
see both the Nintendo switch and the
MacBook Pro feature a USB C port so Mike
Murphy on Twitter decided to connect the
two I found out that if you plug the
switch into the MacBook Pro the switch
charges that a laptop and not the other
way around so just a little power tip
for all you out there all right that's
gonna do it for this week you can email
us at the Apple bite at cnet.com or to
me at Brian Tong thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
