studio what's going on brian Tong here
and welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
um Jamie are we good now yeah just stop
being a little all right well guys it's
a rumors galore plus will reveal the
winners of our griffin stylus pen laser
thingamabob giveaway now let's get to
the stories and what would our show be
without a new report from digit times
that says their supply chain sources
tell them pegatron technology has landed
orders for assembling the 6th generation
iphone that won't be called the iphone 6
and the report it's planning to launch
in September guys that's my favorite
season you know just as the leaves
change colors and they fall off the
branches in the autumn so beautiful
alright digit times also throws in a
mention that the 7 inch iPad is
launching in August as well just in case
you didn't know it was coming but
there's more earlier in the week they
also claim to Apple will be releasing a
seven hundred and ninety nine dollar
macbook air in the third quarter of two
thousand twelve to combat PC makers
hopes of pricing upcoming ultrabooks
around six ninety-nine guys please don't
buy anything right now unless you're
real desperate until Ivy Bridge
computers come out now I'm not planning
to buy one because I'm just glad I
recovered my lost macbook air for my
Disney vacation that I left
in the refrigerator is it's a true story
but we're still not done with the rumors
after a cult of mac reported that their
own source has seen a prototype apple
HDTV in action the source says what he
saw look like apples current LED
backlight cinema display but it's much
bigger could that be because a 42 inch
display is larger than a current 27 inch
LED display that's crazy now the source
says the apple TV prototype has a
built-in isight camera for facetime
video calls and it also has Siri
integration we still don't know when or
if this product will actually reach the
market but analysts are now saying the
apple TV likely won't debut until 2013
just like we've been saying since
december of last year they should really
watch the Apple bite I'll write in some
pretty cool news and something that we
can actually look forward to Apple has
recently awarded a patent related to the
way a 4G antenna is housed in a laptop
get ready for the macbook 4G in the
future and there's real evidence to back
this up it's the 13th patent Apple is
one relating to display integrated
cellular antennas so now let's just save
up for those awesome data plans all
right guys let's shift gears and we're
big Spotify fans here I know plenty of
you are too so we've got a killer tip
for adding your own music files to the
Spotify app on the iPhone
Spotify the music subscription service
is a great way to discover and share
music and with their mobile app and a
premium account you can take their huge
library of songs with you anywhere you
want to go but every once in a while
you'll think of a song you want to hear
that isn't available on Spotify but you
know it's on your phone somewhere on an
android phone you can use the Spotify
app to play any of your locally stored
music but on the iPhone or iPod touch
Spotify can't pee contending locally
stored files you transferred through
itunes but with a little extra work you
can meld your music collection into the
Spotify app and leave the iphone stock
music app behind for the first step open
up Spotify on your computer and check to
see that you have a premium account by
going to your name and clicking account
you'll see the account status here if
you don't have a premium account and you
really want this feature now is the time
to upgrade next head over to your local
files this is going to show you all the
files on your computer that you can sync
over to the Spotify app there's a total
at the top if it seems a little off go
into the Preferences menu and make sure
that the folder where you keep your
music is included on the local files
checklist I had my itunes music folder
in a location other than the default one
so I had to add it manually now here's
where the magic happens make sure that
both your iPhone and your computer are
connected to the same Wi-Fi network open
up the Spotify app on your phone and you
should see it pop up under the devices
here on your computer Spotify app from
this view you can tell Spotify to
transfer your entire music collection or
individually select which playlists to
sync over Spotify will now sync your
files over Wi-Fi and you'll see a
running tally of how much space is
available on your phone at the top once
transferred you'll see your tracks pop
up under the local files listing on your
phone and now all of your favorite songs
are all available in one place and you
can listen to them here without having
to leave the app all right good stuff
there Donald cuz I don't save by the
bell
not funny guys all right more stories in
I'm sure almost every single one of you
bought an iPod between 2006 and 2009
well you're now part of a class action
lawsuit against apple after Thomas
Slattery filed suit in 2005 claiming
Apple is violating antitrust legislation
by forcing users to only purchase music
through iTunes and preventing the
playback of songs purchase from real
networks now you'll be notified your
part of the class action suit you don't
have to do anything but you'll probably
end up only getting ten bucks out of it
which arose to buy an iTunes all right
to the quick bites the big a released
iOS 5.1 point one with bug fixes for
that cruddy network switching on the
iPad it fixes bugs for some airplay
video playback improves the reliability
of the HDR option for photos taken with
the lockscreen shortcut and a few more
things also if you've logged in to
icloud.com recently it looks like Apple
is testing notifications through the
website according to MacRumors which
could be useful for calendar alerts new
mail or new services we haven't even
seen yet and in a fun story from The
Associated Press orangutang zat Miami's
Jungle Island have been using the iPad
to communicate as part of a mental
stimulus program using software that was
originally developed for people with
autism now a trainer will name one of
the objects on screen and the orangutang
presses the corresponding button proving
that any a / monkey can use an iPad
alright let's get to naming our winners

want to mention a disturbing trend we're
more than a handful of you right in to

creed gender sexual preference or even
android user can win let's announce our
winners congratulations go to alex wu
