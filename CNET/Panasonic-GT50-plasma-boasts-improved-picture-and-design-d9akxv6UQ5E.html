is the Panasonic VT 50 series this is
Panasonic's flagship best picture
quality TV for 2012 we really liked its
predecessor the VT 30 from last year
which we named the best overall picture
quality of n of any plasma TV the VT 50
promises to be even better I've been
told that panasonic has pumps their very
best picture quality features into this
set there's a new spark when they fire
the pixels that actually allows the
black levels to be even dimmer than
before so that was really one of the
best things about the VT 30 from last
year was that really deep black level on
the VT 50 it should be even better TV is
also more efficient and can achieve a
brighter picture so really Panasonic
says you get the best of both worlds on
this set the VT 50 also offers THX
certification for both 2d and 3d which
means you can get a one-click
calibration if you want to set it in THX
mode speaking calibration the set also
has more picture controls than the
step-down GT and st series meaning you
can go in and tweak a lot of those
settings especially if you have a
professional calibrator come with the
house to set up the TV just right in
terms of design the VT 50 is one of the
nicer looking plasmas we've seen it has
a thinner bezel than last year it also
has a one sheet of glass design so the
edge of the screen blends right into the
screen itself for a really integrated
very slick look finally the VT 50 series
is active 3d compatible but unlike last
year there's no 3d glasses included in
the Box you're gonna have to buy those
separately moving the VT 50 series is
available in a 55 and 65-inch series and
will be available towards the may/june
time frame of 2012 that's a quick look
at the panasonic tc-p VT 50 series i'm
