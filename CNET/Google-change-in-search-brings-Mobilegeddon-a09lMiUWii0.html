forever some are calling it mobile get
in I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update if you use google search on
your phone the search results may not
pull up everything you're looking for
that's because google has changed how it
ranks websites when you search on a
phone Google will only give you links to
pages that were designed to look good on
a phone screen so if a company never
made a mobile-friendly version of its
website it gets no love from google on
your phone if Google makes mobile web
searching a better experience you see it
can sell more ads to people browsing on
phones Google has a tool to check if a
website is mobile friendly now this
change can be a pain for small
businesses which may not have had the
time or the money to make a mobile
version of their website but it's not
just mom and pop shops the website for
California Pizza Kitchen a chain
restaurant didn't pass Google's
mobile-friendly test change is also
coming to Twitter the social network for
sharing your thoughts with the world now
let you share private messages to
strangers it's now possible to send
direct messages to anyone regardless if
the person follows you opening up direct
messages benefits companies and
marketers because those accounts can
privately chat with people without the
customer following the brand but it also
means if you opt into doing this you
could get harassed by strangers or spam
so turn it on with caution harassment
and abuse is a problem on Twitter where
some people spew hating threats as they
hide behind anonymous user names twitter
is making some changes to fight back
against trolls and make the network a
safer place Twitter changed its policy
to prohibit not only specific threats of
violence but also promoting violence
against others and Twitter canal lock
out an abusive account for a set amount
of time to give back in you may have to
give Twitter your phone number for
identification and delete the offending
tweets on the other side of things
there's an app trying to help you delete
tweets from your past that you may
regret a new app called clear for iOS
promises to comb through your Twitter
Facebook and Instagram accounts to help
you find things you posted that may be a
pensive it looks for keywords things to
do with race or negative emotions
political figures or even just the word
America in case you wrote something
about the country that a future employer
may not agree with you then have to
review which messages to the leech
obviously a nap can't stop you from
posting stupid things that make you look
bad and a computer right now can tell
what is offensive but it is trying the
company is working with IBM's Watson
supercomputer to learn the tone of a
tweet and what makes something offensive
the app has a waiting list to use it's
still in a testing phase that's your
tech news update you can head over to
