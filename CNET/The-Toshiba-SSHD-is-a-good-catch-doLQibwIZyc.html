all-new to shiipa SS HD or so state
hybrid drive now before we dig deep into
this let's find out what an SS HD is
well first we have a regular hard drive
like this one right here let me open it
up on the inside you see there is a
bunch of disk speed very very much like
a spindle of CD right here is mechanical
is slow but it's very affordable which
is why you can actually buy one yourself
and open it up now the drives damaged
but the fun is worth the money and then
we have a su state drive like this one
right here it's very expensive but it's
also very fast and has no moving part on
the inside and that's mean you can also
open it actually safely open it because
right here the drive still working as
you can see it has only memory chips no
moving part again so it's very similar
to the system memory right here now if
you take a little bit of so state memory
like this one right here and put it in a
single box together with a regular
spinning drive you have yourself a
solid-state hybrid drive which the
Toshiba is now back to the Toshiba here
it comes with 8 gigabyte of solid-state
memory and come in for capacity 320
gigabyte 500 pickup by 750 gigabyte and
one terabyte the dry use a regular 2.5
inch design and support the standard
sha-3 sickly bit per second it also work
with SATA 2 and SATA basically it works
in applications where existing regular
hard drive is being used however it's
best to be used at the main storage that
hosts the operating system now the dry
come with two thicknesses 7 millimeter
for the lower capacity and nine point
five millimeter for the higher capacity
and that's mean apart from standard
laptop and desktop it also fit in some
ultra poop and some even tablets now
sshd is not new because Seagate has a
few bees all such as this laptop thin
drive I have right here but in my
testing
the new Toshiba drive actually faster
and when I come by gigabyte by DT by is
also cheaper than the Seagate
counterpart and at $80 for one terabyte
is a lot cheaper than a solid state
drive of the same capacity now you can
expect the full SSD performance Alban SS
HD drive but in my testing the butum and
application performance were actually
hugely improved to find out more about
this drive check out my phone with
Viacom one more thing remember this is
very much still a hard ride on the
inside so do not open it for fun or drop
it in fact let me show you what happened
to it if you drop it there we go which
are again I guess I just cannot drop it
my reflect it's just too damn fast so
like all things you have to take my word
for it and be happy with your life and
that's because I'm down low and this has
been the first look at the Toshiba solid
state hyperdrive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
