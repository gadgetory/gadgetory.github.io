buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
Nokia and 800 internet tablet now this
little job II is following the latest
trend of packing everything into a
single gadget let's let Bonnie cha break
down it's actually just a mobile device
that lets you browse the web on the go
and also can make VoIP calls and instant
message and also has some multimedia
capabilities also they built in this
little kickstand so you can set it on
the desk it also has an RSS news feeder
there's also a media player music and
video it's also not a cell phone still
high it's not right it's like low carb
bread it just doesn't make any sense why
can't I have everything I want all the
time and now for the news if you hear
only one technology news story in 2007
it'll be this one Windows Vista is
finally here and Microsoft is putting on
the full-court press to promote the
latest version of its operating system
or to promote all 19 versions of its
latest operating system anyway not
surprisingly security experts are
already poking holes in vista reporting
various bugs and crashes and I'm sorry
to say that Windows Vista has already
claimed its first victim around 5
million people downloaded it that's
right they go they in essence have
stolen your that's the beta version what
does the beta version is that will that
in any way make them sterile well how
does the how does the beta version work
oh no Windows Vista crashed jon
stewart's it's so awkward
no you know actually it was pretty weird
and sort of painful to see bill gates on
The Daily Show certainly everybody was
talking about it plus Microsoft has put
up this kind of funny little guerilla
marketing site with comedian and Daily
Show correspondent Demetri Martin take a
look I just handed me this piece of
paper
it says say Windows Vista okay Windows
Vista Vista or Vista as Vista beast is
dead
Spanish version yeah so you guys are
trying pretty hard here huh but here's
the thing um it's Windows we're gonna
buy it but there's no way you're gonna
make it cool okay a 16 year old boy
who's being sued by five record labels
represented by the Recording Industry
Association of America is fighting back
Robert Santangelo says that the labels
are in collusion with each other
violating antitrust laws and that they
use extortionate threats in order to
force defendants to pay settlements
instead of taking their cases to court
in a statement the RIAA responded
exactly oh wait is that bad you may have
heard that this weekend is the Super
Bowl and this year there's a chance that
some geeks will actually be watching
because rumor has it that there will be
a big new Apple announcement in the form
of a Super Bowl commercial well we here
at the buzz report have gotten an
exclusive first look at that very
commercial and here it is we don't
we saw
On February 24th Apple will introduce a
new Beatles Edition iPod and you'll hear
why 2007 will sound just like 1967 Wow
yay for 1967 right of course
Apple is hardly the only company doing
the Super Bowl shuffle this year get it
bears Super Bowl shuffle oh yeah sorry
geeks I don't know what I was thinking
several technology companies are
spending big bucks on commercials this
year including hewlett-packard and Chevy
is taking another stab at user generated
advertising by holding the Chevy Super
Bowl college ad challenge of course in
hopes of avoiding another debacle like
the thousands of user generated ads
making fun of the Chevy Tahoe last time
they tried this this time the company
will screen all the applicants choose a
winner and then remake the ad using a
professional advertising agency smart
plus at this point if I see any Chevy ad
that doesn't feature that freakin John
Mellencamp song I will probably buy a
Tahoe myself
okay that's just kind of my issue huh
I'm Hollywood and uh suspend the buzz
report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
