I'm the speckled James Kim yes I do have
my glasses back yes good and this is the
show where we're gonna take a look at
the latest hottest and raddest dopest
fattest gadgets to hit the streets
sickest gadgets y'all anyway this is
episode number 4 which means we have
tons of stuff to talk about from the
crave blog and yes the blog at crave
done sina.com
yes I saw something very interesting
just a second ago I was driving trying
to get here really quickly and I saw
this guy on a big motorcycle pumping the
tunes he had all these speakers on it
Oh was it the purple purple motorcycle
yes it was oh my god I know that guy yes
anyway San Fransisco delight there but
on the crate vlog there were actually
two from the ministry of tech they're
actually little tiny speakers that look
like little missiles that you mount on
the handlebar and it's pretty darn nice
for a motorcycle or a bicycle a
motorcycle or bicycle you know it
doesn't sound too safe to me it's really
a good idea to listen to music while
you're I don't know what I don't know
what Veronica's talking about because if
you're listening with headphones it's
even more dangerous so if you're blaring
the music out in front of you at least
you can create a party distract other
drivers I don't know they're not very
very strong I'd walk in your Jeep I
think they're like 10 watts or something
looking at you check it out so what do
you got well okay so if you have a lot
of music like you say you do you're
probably gonna want a way to organize it
and one great way is to use barcodes Oh
like the carrot yeah so the flick media
organizer it actually takes a scanner
that you buy and you scan the barcodes
on the device and I not have those words
it into a library on your PC and it
comes with software and everything it
comes with software yeah and so it
checks up all the database of the items
online uh-huh download cover art and
book cover oh that's pretty cool so you
clean up your media library basically
yeah you're basically organizing all
your cool stuff well speaking of clean
did you see that the shower the cool
shower with a wall that's like all
jungly it's basically this from lost
yeah I know but it's a prototype wall
and I don't think it's even a video wall
or anything it's just it's backlit and
it has
the soothing jungle in the background
and on the crave blog basically you know
you just get in the shower yeah I got
some acts effect on you I think this
whole nature bringing nature into
technology thing is really cool what I'm
into it
well okay so something you might not
know about me is that I'm left-handed
okay you're South Pole I am a South paw
awesome and this has really nothing to
do with the gadget I'm about to talk
about but it is kind of relevant to me
because whenever I write I smudge I
smudge myself so when I'm taking notes
like with a pen or a pencil
obviously I smudge all the writing on
the paper it's been happening that okay
so we're not at all so if you have the
digit memo a 402 402 not 420 no no this
will solve all your problems what it
does is it's a pen and so you write on a
regular standard like eight-and-a-half
by eleven sheet of paper and it records
all your notes and all your doodles
into the computer okay so you can go
back and edit them digitally later so
did you see that uh fridge that dope
fridge fridge yeah I'm into this one
because it has a built-in bar a built-in
bar so it has a little like door on the
other side of the water sprinkle area
and you just have your drinks there and
it cools it and it keeps remotes ready
to go and although you can sort of
always open your refrigerator and pick
them out anyway
I think this feature is really cool it's
definitely for the bachelor pad and all
of us yeah that's more into like the
Internet connected fridges where I can
be like okay this item is missing from
my refrigerator I'm gonna automatically
order it on on stop and shop or safe oh
oh you're down there I don't know you're
down to under a half bottle of Hennessy
that's the way it works well if you have
stuff that you want us to check out you
can do so by emailing us at crave that's
unit abuse we want to see all your links
and videos and pictures of cool stuff
that yes found on the Internet you've
been sending him to us keep sending them
and by the way have a teaser really
quick I was going to construct this
thing in about 20 minutes but I couldn't
I want to do it justice but this is
Rover
ro ro ro bot watch this is the
Mindstorms from Lego this is the latest
one it just came out instead NXT
it's got Bluetooth baby I don't know so
I'm gonna construct this and I'm gonna
bring it on the show and show you how it
operates next week
