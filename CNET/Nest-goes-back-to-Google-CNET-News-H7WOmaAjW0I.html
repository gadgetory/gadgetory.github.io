umbrella alphabet announced it would
fold nest back into Google after two
years of operating as a separate
division you might know nest from its
line of smart home devices nest
thermostat nest cam doorbell nest hello
now secure nest protect but Google
purchased the company in 2014 and parent
company alphabet spun it out from Google
in 2016 so why bring it back what
changed
to words Google assistance google says
nest is now part of its hardware team
and will be part of the company's plans
as it rolls out deeper integrations of
its assistant in hardware Google's
hardware chief Rick Oster lo says quote
all of Google's investments in machine
learning and AI they can very clearly
benefit nest products it just makes
sense to be developing them together
it's the natural thing to evolve -
unquote don't worry though
your nest cams and thermostats won't
become obsolete or end up left in the
dust yet both austere low and nest CEO
Marwan foul was insisted the reunion
would supercharge nests mission I'm
guessing you'll likely see nest products
in the next few years start directly
integrating Google assistant into its
hardware by default that's exciting for
you Google assistant users out there I
get it but it's a little less clear what
will happen to the Alexa skills
currently offered for nest product
owners who prefer Amazon's voice
assistant the battle for the smart home
ecosystem is starting to heat up and
that could mean leaving some people who
like stringing together different types
of devices out in the cold nothing is
set in stone yet though so we'll be
keeping an eye on how nest and Google
plan to develop Hardware going forward
what do you think nest and Google should
do continue to welcome other assistants
with open arms to grab as many consumers
as possible or close the ecosystem a
little bit to develop products that
might work more seamlessly drop your
