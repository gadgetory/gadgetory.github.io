be made but even by square enix
standards ten years is a ridiculous
development cycle not only that but
final fantasy 13 was a bit of a letdown
and since 2006 we've seen a bunch of
artistic projects take too long to be
made and suffer because of it think to
nukem forever detox Chinese Democracy
the last ten years have been a scary
time for Final Fantasy fans so when I
first booted up Final Fantasy 15 I was a
little bit concerned the first few hours
were like a tutorial but not a tutorial
I mean there was a explicit tutorial at
the beginning but then the first thing I
was pretended to not be a tutorial but
it's still pretty slow thankfully at the
end of it the story begins to pick up
then around chapter 3 the world opens up
you get access to side quest feels like
a final fantasy again and I was hooked
you'll play as Prince Noctis who's
trying to take down an empire that
betrayed his father and Kingdom things
have very complicated from there which
is pretty standard for the franchise
square even made a prequel film called
King slave which I highly recommend sets
up much of the backstory of the game and
is itself quite fun your party in 15 is
composed of the three friends ignis
prompter and gladiolus in between
slaying monsters with these dudes you'll
stay at campsites hang out at diners and
go on road trips I didn't like any of
the four as much as franchise stand
outside both you Lauren but the
relationship feels authentic and it
works as the game's emotional core fans
of the franchise won't be let down by 15
story but even with a prequel film it's
not in the same level as fun fantasy 7
or 10 thankfully though it's a big
improvement over the very forgettable 13
I don't even remember anyone in that
game other than lightning and the dude
with chickens in his hair I beat the
game at around the 30 hour mark in about
10 hours of that was side quests I saw a
lot in about 30 hours and while it
technically is short for a final fantasy
game didn't feel short in a good way
final fantasy does turn-based combat
better than anyone but a fully real-time
system is a fresh take for the
franchise's the game's combat isn't as
deep with previous entries but i found
it satisfying it's actually more similar
to kingdom hearts than other final
fantasy games katsia Nomura served as
Final Fantasy 15 s director for about
six years and he also directed kingdom
hearts so it's not surprising you don't
get to control ignis prompter or
gladiolus but it feels like a team with
everyone doing their part often joining
knocks for powerful team attacks that's
not all this new though there are no
major so you'll do most of your healing
with items and smells aren't cost
instead your log balls and magic at
enemies it's hard to call the new system
a step forward but it's something
different and it works someone's are
back although they were completely
differently you can't call them up
strategically anymore you'll get a
prompt every now and then on your screen
turn call on up there are no real cringy
moments even in the emotional scenes
which is more than I can say about
previous Final Fantasy game looking at
you Titus in you know you probably
shouldn't laugh anymore one real
downside to the game though traveling
around eros can be a bit of a bummer
walking is too slow to get anywhere
chocolate boys are out for short
journeys if you've got a long trek to
mate you'll have to drive there like in
game ad breaks whenever I couldn't fast
travel I found myself checking Twitter
making food or watching something on
YouTube I was 14 when this game was
announced to had 14 y'all Daniel feel
about it I've enjoyed it more than any
final fantasy game since I was 14 says
good start being sketchy a few years
with fun fantasies back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
