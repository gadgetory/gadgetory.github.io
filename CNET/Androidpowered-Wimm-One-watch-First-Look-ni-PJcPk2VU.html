cnet.com and right now we're taking a
look at the whim one from wim labs this
is a SmartWatch device that is actually
running Android it costs 199 at amazon
and it basically lets you run lots of
apps it talks to your smartphone it has
Wi-Fi bluetooth as well as a whole bunch
of features that are built in so first
you notice on the on the watch itself it
has a one inch by one inch LCD screen
that's also by modal which means that it
can operate both in outdoors in the
sunshine as well as has a backlit color
screen that can be viewed when it's dark
also the device itself comes with a lot
of different apps that are pre-installed
so here we got a pedometer we also have
some apps that folks like to use like
the weather app which gives you detailed
forecast you also have the calendar as
well as world clock timer alarm and
stopwatch so basic watch functions but
what's really interesting is you can go
online or open up the companion whim app
for Android and iOS and basically add
new features I can get new watch faces
there's a whole bunch of choose from you
can see you've got these custom ones
that people have basically designed
themselves and women's also designed a
few so you can choose any of these
you've got this funky one over here
which is a really a geek one which is a
binary watch that runs on base 2 which
takes forever to figure out I won't use
that you also have like more traditional
ones like a standard analog watch face
like this you can also one of my
favorites actually is this one which
uses the atomic weight of elements to
describe the time so basically this
device is
just a watch it pops out of the supplied
a band here like this just push it on
the sides and the actual module comes
out like this and you've got a small
little device that is basically just a
square and the only controls are the
power button on the right side we've got
some contacts for charging the device
and the touch screen that's pretty much
it it's very small fits in the palm of
the hand now wim also wants people to
design apps for it so they can build a
platform around the product and also
they're going to be hopefully launching
some other applications and accessories
like lanyards and bike mounts all this
kind of stuff hopefully you know it'll
take off as a platform if you want to
read more about this product be sure to
check out the full review at cnet com
I'm Brian Bennett for cnet com and this
has been a first look at the whim one
