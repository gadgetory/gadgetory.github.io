is one of the most powerful and portable
laptops on the market and it screens
pretty nice too but in today's episode
of cracking open I'll show you why it's
also nearly impossible to upgrade a real
pain to work on and lacks what many
consider an essential Pro feature
there's a lot to like on the retina
MacBook Pro it's thinner and lighter
than the traditional MacBook Pro it has
two USB 3 ports and a full size HDMI
port it sports an Intel Ivy Bridge Core
i7 processor and an Nvidia GT 650 M
graphics chip and as its name implies it
has a gorgeous 2880 by 1800 resolution
Retina display unfortunately as I
mentioned in the intro all of these
positives are offset by some serious
negatives for starters this is the first
MacBook Pro with pentalobe case screws
you know those annoying tamper resistant
screws used on the MacBook Air and
iPhone 4s Apple doesn't want you inside
this machine and once I popped off the
back cover that's all why unlike the
standard macbook pro which is designed
to be upgraded and serviced by you
should you so choose the retina macbook
pro isn't how so let's start with the
battery instead of being a single
removable unit each cell is glued to the
machines case this makes the battery
nearly impossible to remove without
damaging it or the components underneath
it also means you can't get to the
components under it like the trackpad
the situation doesn't really get any
better
when we look at the motherboard there's
a proprietary solid-state drive which
means you won't be able to swap it out
for a larger third-party one and the RAM
is soldered to the motherboard so you
won't be upgrading that either and if
all this wasn't enough Apple also
dropped two features that set the
MacBook Pro apart from the thinner but
less professional MacBook Air and
Ethernet port and optical drive now I
don't think losing the optical
five will angered mini Pro fans I have
an optical drive on my 2011 pro and
can't remember the last time I used it
but the Ethernet port is another matter
when I asked tech Republic members if
they or their co-workers still needed
machines with an Ethernet port a
resounding 88 percent said yes sure you
can use a thunderbolt to Ethernet
adapter but that's one more thing you
need to buy and carry honestly this new
machine is more like a MacBook Air than
a MacBook Pro and as such you'll need to
plan your purchase carefully
it may be pricey but make sure you buy
all the RAM storage and processing power
you'll need for the life of the machine
now as of this taping Apple still sells
traditional 13 and 15 inch MacBook Pros
Ethernet ports optical drives and all
but I can't imagine they'll keep both
pro lines around for very long once the
price of solid-state drives and the
Retina display are low enough all
MacBook Pros will probably look like
this one at least until all that
hardware will fit into an air for more
information on the retina macbook pro
including performance and battery life
