the bit of a late start to episode 306
of the 359 but thanks for hanging out
with us on BVG and here your host today
Ben Fox Ruben Roger Chang and Alfred
Inge we got a busy busy got a straight
today y'all my name's Trey word gets
around
I'm not making favorites here alright
anyways what do we have loaded on the
docket today we've got quite a few
things we're gonna delve into the Google
pixel to Excel screen problems that's
what we're gonna start off today's
podcast with and then Twitter having an
issue with Artie and Sputnik they
decided to ban both of those Russian
media outlets that just came out earlier
like maybe half an hour this morning and
then we'll wrap up with a quick preview
on Amazon's
earnings which are coming out tonight
without further ado sending your
questions and comments to BVG he'll get
to as many as he can at the end of the
show let's get moving here we go in
three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Reuben
I'm Robert J I'm Afra dang the Google
pixel to excel just started shipping and
it already has problems reports have
cropped up this week that the phone's
displays are showing screen burnin which
are basically ghosts of images staying
on the screens now granted this isn't as
bad as exploding as exploding phones but
it's still not that good for Google no
it's kind of a it's a real sore spot
right because the pixel to excel is the
phone that you know it's got the slimmer
bezels it looks nicer it's a bigger
phone it's presumably the one you want
if you're a power user and to have these
kinds of burnin issues it really makes
you think well maybe I should go with
the Samsung is it is it a sore spot
though I thought it was kind of like a
October like Halloween promotional thing
like oh yeah yeah well no so far it
hasn't we've actually been able to
replicate the problem usually these
problems they happen to a small
percentage of these phones so oftentimes
our review units don't have those
shoes we actually were able to replicate
I think of two of the five units that we
tested yeah and yeah it's there it's
legit it's yeah and for anybody that has
been in on on the market for a Google
pixel to excel you probably want to hold
off until this whole situation gets
resolved Google said that it's actively
investigating the issue next up Twitter
announced this morning that is banning
advertising from Russian media outlets
RT and Sputnik saying the US
intelligence agencies found that quote
they attempted to interfere with the
election on behalf of the Russian
government
twitter is also donating nearly two
million dollars it got from Artie Alfred
what's your analysis on this decision
well here's the thing about this so
they're only banning sponsored content
which has been what the scrutiny from
Congress has been about essentially you
know you took money from these
organizations to help spread propaganda
you're basically making a profit off of
propaganda so they're basically saying
okay fine we're not gonna take their
money anymore but it really doesn't get
to the root of the problem which is the
fact that propaganda still exists on
your social network right well we were
talking about this too is that Artie and
Sputnik weren't banned from Twitter just
advertising banning them from the
platform they're banning them from
putting advertisement on and if you
really want to look at how like fake
news and you know propaganda spreads
it's not through advertised content it's
through like botnets and people posting
you know just just general like getting
fake news spread around it's not gonna
be because you know oh I saw this ad for
an RT link well it's also important out
there I mean the timing of this is very
suspicious given that Twitter is set to
testify before a Senate hearing a
discussion about Russia right yeah so
they're there China and there's
obviously there's been a lot of talk
about the government coming in
regulating these companies mase book
twitter google so it seems like it's
twitter tryna like throw the regulators
are boned to kind of ease off yeah i
suspect that you know a lot of these
companies i've already looked at you
know Artie and Sputnik with a lot of
suspicion as far as you know accepting
ads from them but Twitter is kind of the
first one to basically say we're not
taking any of these ads at all
like period alright last to switch it up
a bit Amazon is reporting its earnings
tonight its first since buying high-end
grocery Lutz for 13.7 billion dollars
hopefully we'll see a little bit more
about what it's done with the new
business so far it seemed like they've
increased Whole Foods traffic by
lowering the price of avocados so good
for them yeah I mean I wonder how
sustainable this all is this is a
completely different business from
Amazon this is definitely lower margins
it's a lot more competitive its kind of
puts Amazon in a different place right
yeah I long as they continue to have AWS
which is their cloud services business
that's really gonna be the big profit
driver for them and I don't know who
sees and who knows exactly what's gonna
happen with Whole Foods going forward so
yeah well maybe get a little bit more
answers tonight if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Roger Tsien I'm
Alfred Inge thanks for listening so it's
time to jump into the chat and I'll
start farming out some of your best
questions and comments for the guys to
floor but until then what advice do we
have for people who have the pixel too
and they're already experiencing these
burning but just to be clear it's just
the pixel Excel the Excel excuse me a
bigger specific bigger one the pixel two
uses a different display uses the AMOLED
display which doesn't have any issues
the the issue here or the difference is
the two Excel using something called
plastic OLED Peola which is a new yeah
it's a different kind of material and I
think that's that's a difference here we
do have a story on CNET that
specifically runs down all the different
scenarios that you might be able to use
basically if you bought this phone
through Verizon within the past 14 days
you can do a return no questions asked
the same thing with Google if you bought
it through Google over the past 15 days
and I would save you if you call and
complain to Google their customer
service is pretty good even if you got
beyond that time frame like they'll
probably try to make it right so what
attentionally the same thing with
Verizon mostly like a hardware issue
though right like this isn't like like
they can just patch it the resolved no
no it's like
have to basically yes once you have burn
in on the display display or they'll
place the phone entirely yeah so you you
could make an argument if you are a
pixel 2xl owner that this is a defect
even if you bought it past that like 14
or 15 day window and then hopefully get
a replacement or just you know switch to
a different phone I think we we actually
recommend that particular 4 pixel phones
you should buy directly from Google I
know
Verizon is their official you know US
carrier partner and you can buy through
Verizon but it seems like Google's
customer service has proven to be pretty
good over the past few years so it's
recommended you to buy drove me through
them yeah I mean I kind of feel a little
bit bad for Google this is like the
second big problem that they've had with
some of their newer stuff coming out
like we were just talking about the
Google home Mini came out recently that
they had like just like phantom problems
with that one - yeah hardware is a hard
game but if you think about it now both
of their issues are both ghosts related
so I still think it's Halloween
promotion totally could be a Halloween
together after how we pass is like the
foes magically fix themselves just
kidding everything's fine
there's Thanksgiving related problems
start smelling like Turkey you know what
I would definitely buy Google home Mini
if I started out or if it like randomly
started smelling like Turkey absolutely
so in the chat conquer and several
others are in the midst of their
pre-order limbo do you think they should
cancel they're gonna fix this it'll be
an easy fix and manufacturing I just
declare if you're if you're pre-ordering
a pixel of 2 you should be fine but yeah
if you're if you're looking for that
pixel 2 X 2 XL if I'll probably wait it
out a little phone ly they were way to a
better version it's coming to like delay
the pre-order we're like you still keep
your pre-order but like only send it to
me one like you know the fixed version
is available right yeah because they're
gonna have to cancel their pre-order and
then like order it again once it's
available and do that who's to say that
it's available like you know that
they'll still be guaranteed one once
that
right it's unfortunate yeah tell us a
little bit more about what Amazon's
gonna do do you think they're gonna have
a shiner year been a shiny thing like
they've had like a pretty wild 2017 we
were just talking last week about the
Amazon lottery as it's being called
where they're gonna build the second
headquarters in another major city in
North America
and that just like sparked so much
attention and like all these major
municipalities were jumping through
hoops trying to get a Hasan's attention
and these like very thirsty in
ridiculous ways so on top of that
Amazon's just had like a pretty strong
year presenting itself and like granted
they're a major tech company anyway but
they've really like shown themselves off
especially this year mmm yesterday a bit
of a stumble with Amazon key though so
yeah there were some reactions the
backlash on social media has been pretty
relentless yeah I would say that was as
if people don't like strangers climbing
in their home no I I continue to believe
that people will vote with their wallets
and there might be like a bunch of
people that aren't commenting on Twitter
about this that do actually want to use
the service they buy it and then Amazon
will actually know if there is a market
for my friend was actually talking about
how great it because he always like asks
us we all live near each other and he's
like hey can somebody come to my house
and get like my package I'm at work
right now it's on my doorsteps well you
also get packages delivered to you yeah
office so like there are a lot of people
that I think this could potentially end
report II bucks for that or 250 yeah
that's ridiculous I'm just gonna go to
the post Docs you fifty gets you get you
the camera and the hardware in the
installation yeah oh and I can't even
install it cuz I don't own like the
house yeah I don't exactly I don't think
it's even available in New York City
yeah there's like too much complication
with that but what's interesting is like
in home delivery and in-home services
are Amazon's not even the only one
that's trying to do it so if it does
change if people start getting
interested in used to that I mean like
the potential of like not having to wait
at home for the Cable Guy it just gets
taking care of on its own there is a lot
you would trust the cable guy to show up
and you'd let them in so the idea of
Trust is another issue entirely but
having to work from home for the day
right and have to sit there and wait for
a four hour window for the cable guy to
show up for something that's very simple
yeah something like this understand
what's no does that work if you're
working if you're working in your office
right and the cable guy shows up
what do you remotely let him in and
trust that he comes into your oh yeah
there's a camera you can watch him the
whole time yeah I mean I think that's
some it might be a big leap for people
exactly great I think that taps into the
real concern and where the people just
don't want strangers in their home yeah
but like there are also people that use
Airbnb where they let strangers in their
home weekend some paid to do it
yeah just vacation know who those people
are yeah that's nice stranger you're
you're approving them coming into your
yeah and for let's be honest for all
these Airbnb hosts there it's not their
homes right it's like there's ii totally
so yeah there's less of an issue there
and I don't know I think that's and I
think that's why Amazon has a bit of a
hurdle like at least if you just look at
the reaction on social media people just
are creeped out by the ideas well they
like you know they're immediately
referencing murder like it's not even
like this is kind of creepy they're like
I'm gonna get murdered by the delivery
guy that so you have any sense because
if their home they wouldn't be using
that service in the first place true
unless they don't unless they go in
there sneak in and just stay there
though fine social media is logical it
makes sense for this to work if like you
get a notification one day unlock it so
you can like watch them yes the thought
of the phone being like oh there's
somebody in your house with like and I'm
okay with it
mmm it's something you've got to really
think about I feel like I like this I
like this for like like I'm sorry the
example you gave was like with your
friends it's your friends are coming in
like letting them into the home they
need to pick up something like approved
like key holders or something yeah but
if you have a smart door lock you could
do that already anyway I'm
you just give them in the passcode
there's no real reason to have the
security-camera the idea like it make
sense if ready for like pretty like I'm
not trying to get you to just spend
money you had mentioned like that there
they'd be interested in something with
like dog walkers - yes yeah there's a
lot of things that could possibly work
and that would be great for like getting
my cat's fed wait a minute all right we
should get back to like the primary
issues but yeah thanks for the general
question about Amazon and obviously that
resulted in a lot of conversation about
Amazon key what else we got we're still
talking a lot about it there's still
conversation going on the - says well
some apartment dwellers already have to
deal with inspections while they are at
home but the thing about that is that
your landlord allowing something so
that's re - the property owner or
manager who's that liability yeah but
that doesn't mean that you're not
unaware of strangers being in your
domicile to some extent now that this
has happened to me like that's that's
part of apartment living sometimes we
got some commentary from alien or Sutan
and this is a thought that never even
occurred to me but like where do you see
someone follow the male driver around
and use the opportunity to barge into
the house after he gets the door open is
being oh thanks I'm home thanks for
bringing my package and oh yeah think
about that window of opportunity but you
got a thing with with something like it
really with time I mean someone would
have to like no trust me people people
in my neighborhood like have figured out
the timing of the delivery trucks and
totally I kind of follow that around
edges right there's got to be a - a
liability they should be able to like
confer with you or that person to say
show me your your app identification you
know like an uber they have to check who
you are because I've gotten in the wrong
mover before yeah totally and then ended
up in Maryland no they still put you out
no I well ironically ended up going to
the right place
oh really so you're good at the wrong
goober they like took you to the right
place yeah it was the weirdest thing me
sure you were just in the right Hoover
car no absolutely 110% do you have an
identical twin no me myself and another
person waiting on the same block waiting
to go to the same place somehow
so weirdest thing I've ever experienced
all right I think that's kind of where
we gonna run out for the day but that
things up a little
we had the week go quick today but
