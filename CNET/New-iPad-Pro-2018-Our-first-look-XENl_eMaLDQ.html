but it's got an update today the new
iPad pro is available November 7th and
here it is it's actually the twelve
point nine inch version I took a second
to figure that out because it's smaller
it's about a size about an eleven eleven
by eight sheet of paper there's also an
11 inch iPad pro that's the same size of
the 10.5 before the prices are Pro
prices 11 inch starts at 799 this one
starts at $9.99 with 64 gigs of storage
you can go all the way up to a terabyte
now which is a alive this is kind of
like the iPad 10 because much like the
iPhone 10 there's space ID here but you
may not notice it because there's no
notch this display is continuous it's a
curved corner display LCD using a
similar type of display technology
that's on the iPhone 10 are they you may
have just noticed I detached the pencil
from the side it magnetically stuck
that's how it charges now there is a
unique magnetic connector on the side
and the new pencil not only will roll a
little less but it will attach now and
that little flat side has tapped zones
so you could use it to zoom in and tap
and control things otherwise similar in
terms of its pressure-sensitive
capabilities lightening is gone but USB
C is here which is great because that's
now going to work with a whole bunch of
accessories it's also going to work with
5k external displays and it will even
reverse charge so you could charge up
your other USB C devices or your iPhone
you can charge up your Nintendo switch
with your iPad you're slaying crazy
that's a really nice upgrade that brings
it more to a computer type level also
new is a new type of folio case this new
keyboard folio attaches to be a little
more lap friendly the 11 and 12 point 9
inch iPad pro are thinner and they both
have a 12 X processors now that's a leap
over the a 10x before and the graphics
and processing lead should be really
significant that's the main proposition
for this is people who want to do art
people who want to be using Adobe's
upcoming Photoshop tools a superior
graph
and drawing experience will it
necessarily be a laptop replacement
we'll have to see but it sounds like a
similar proposition in the sense that
you're going to be using it with
keyboards you're going to be using it
with pencil and you're gonna be taking
advantage of the larger screen and
better processing power on this another
thing that the a 12 X can do is better
AR Apple is very bullish on AR and the
capabilities that can bring now on this
iPad maybe that's for things like
Adobe's AR based design app that's
coming next year or it could be for all
new types of immersive tools that work
for the iPad also games but are you
playing games on an iPad you might be or
we might be using a console or something
else also keep in mind I just noticed
there's no headphone jack on this iPad
pro just FYI you're gonna have to use an
adapter or use bluetooth so the
proposition on these iPads is a computer
but it's a kind of a parallel computer
or to work in combination with Macs and
the starting price here is entering that
laptop range there's also a macbook air
that's 1199 there's a Mac Mini that
starts at $7.99 Apple is also keeping
the ten point five inch pro from before
at 6:50 so that might be a middle ground
that you might want to look at but Apple
is pushing the boundaries here for touch
for face ID and maybe at some point
these things will find its way in other
computing devices too but if you're
looking for something like the iPhone 10
in an iPad to take it up a level and get
that bigger screen this might be what
you're looking for is the iPad pro my
very first look at it here at Apple's
event in Brooklyn
gonna get knocked out
sorry about that yeah I'm sorry sorry
about that thank you no no it's okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
