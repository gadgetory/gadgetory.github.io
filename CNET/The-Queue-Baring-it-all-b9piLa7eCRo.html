rooting out malware and lawn care in
bikinis it's so blatant it must be the
cute hey there what's going on I'm rich
demuro with Cena TV and you are in the
queue the best tech video with a
suspiciously English sounding name
you'll watch all day long first your
must click moment just take a little off
the top a Memphis lawn service now
offering bikini cuts and the video might
be more popular than the actual service
for a premium fee Tiger time lawn care
will send a bikini clad cutter to your
home getting your lawn in shape while
putting your mind in the gutter okay
after watching this video does anyone
else think it seems a little dangerous
to cut lawns in a bikini that's they
didn't think about that moving through
the queue think you're addicted to email
while you're not alone a well has this
survey to prove it according to their
third annual email addiction survey
americans love their portable email
we're now using our handhelds to check
messages anywhere and everywhere
including the bed cars bathrooms and
even church thank God I got that email
washington DC the most addicted city in
the country followed by Atlanta New York
San Francisco and Houston to growing
issues checking your messages on your
handheld in the middle of the night yes
a lot of people do that and checking
every single time and email arrives I've
seen this so many times their blackberry
buzzes every time they get an email and
then it's like from a mailing list
nothing irks me more than that then this
checking up on a friends computer and
seeing all kinds of malware on there you
know that stuff can be really hard to
get rid of and even when you think
you've deleted it all its back McAfee is
detective program might be able to help
the free rootkit detective goes deep
into your windows registry to find
compromising programs a quick scan
reveals hidden files processes and
registry keys your spy sweepers and
virus scanning software might have
missed you can then safely remove or
disable those problematic programs a new
kind of advertising hopes to tap into
picture taking the message isn't visible
to the human eye but it shows up on your
snapshot the technology is called
camouflage it adds an additional layer
of information to the data captured in
photos basically using a color spectrum
not visible to humanize the result extra
info that shows up in Prince camouflage
says they have applications for movies
advertisements and even clothing time
for the beta so you have one of those
fancy new phones with unlimited 3g data
and still nothing to watch it's buzz
wire to the rescue sign up for buzz wire
from your PC and it will deliver
personalized streaming content to your
super fast 3g phone there are more than
2,000 audio clips and a thousand videos
on whether TV shows and even those cool
viral video clips the service is
available free and direct to consumers
during their beta the buzz wire does
have plans to link up with carriers and
then charge a couple bucks a month for
access so get it all top that's it for
