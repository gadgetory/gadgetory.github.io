that's about to change starting right
now the Chinese company made its big US
debut here in San Francisco and we do
mean big the star of the show is this 85
inch TV called the you max 85 it's
packed with high-end technology
including a full array local dimming
backlight with 448 zones and decoding
for both types of high dynamic range
content HDR 10 and Dolby vision of
course it has 4k resolution and low eco
claims 90% coverage of the DCI color
space the Eco also touts its quad-core
processor and 64 gigs of storage as well
as a Content ecosystem based on Google's
Android TV that means it has access to
all the apps in the Android TV store as
well as the nifty cast system used by
chromecast
a big selection of feature content
partners is also on board from
Cosmopolitan to machinima the price is
big too at 5 grand but that's actually
not bad for such a massive set TV this
big from Samsung and Sony cost thousands
more and don't have this level of
high-end TV specs the Eco is debuting
three smaller 4k TVs at 65 55 and 43
inches to their spec sheets aren't quite
as potent and their prices not quite as
aggressive all four of the newly eco TVs
go on sale the company's website
