hello and welcome to another fantastic
i'm calling it at the top of this joke
fantast mean no it might be really bad
it's very possible will fall off the
rails and you know derail and go nuts i
don't know it's not gonna happen though
because today is friday November 6 2015
it's 90 degrees outside really i wanna i
want to uh who is it's not november
whether it's not november whether if
there's only if there's one person that
can fix the weather cloverfield monster
it's you r us fresh psychic i probably
couldn't miss i'm elected president I
will tell winter and fall to act
appropriately aura Noah ever know above
80 degrees don't you think somebody
should really troll a Donald Trump and
be like mr. Trump what do you plan on
doing to fall to whip it into shape so
that it's displays the correct
temperature well what's great is that I
know for sure he would answer that
question look we have a great we have a
great set of seasons here okay we're
going to do is we're gonna take fall
we're gonna put fall we're gonna put in
a bathtub we're gonna put it behind a
wall it won't bother us anymore do you
know what's the trouble making season we
just don't want any part of it I will
dig deep into false paths find out all
false secret and when I do not expose
fall for the piece of season truly
is i will then having a situation where
has to act like it's correct season i
don't i don't mind could you say
something could you say so first thing
and I nobody breathe I'll be brief I
promise you'll be briefed of this but
fall needs to play ball okay what do you
mean to rhyme there but life has great
bridges a bumper sticker fall used to
play ball make those shirts yeah that's
it and you like that you like my Trump
impression no it's not that it is on the
verge of being someone it's okay it's
based off that guy from who does it from
the UCB oh I haven't seen that it's
spectacular he's a little mumbly he's in
May he's amazing yeah he doesn't I don't
think anyone does it better than yeah
his name is Anthony something it isn't
any good good giving him credit I'm sure
he deserves it he does I don't have any
problem with fall it's the winter that
it is a downer and bugs me what do you
you'd like winter you're okay with
mentor
I mean you ski that the only reason
winters the best they're all this ice
skating as well but you I nothing is
better yeah then being cold when you
sleep yeah but you could be cold with
air conditioning i'm not i'm looking for
an all natural okay solution to marry
sleeping i need to be cold yeah you know
the only thing about fall that really is
the downer is the loss of the hour of
light cuz if it were you its target for
call you a flower who cares who cares
downer first of all sad daylight say
these a whole whatever and i don't
want to go on Iran here I agree that's
crap it's it like it actually
has an awful impact on on human life
what's the worst part uh Pete that it
can actually make you like depressed
that's what I was just saying you
ignored it I'm just saying that is do it
right that's what I'm saying yeah crap
yeah and I father next thing getting
dark early as part of that I think today
they do it there's like a ten percent
spike in traffic accidents and probably
suicide uh we go that far well what is
it Sweden or one of those countries
that's like a really high suicide right
because they only get like an hour
daylight during the winter yeah but they
just they do it better than we do even
if they're okay James I better they do
it all better more effectively so
apparently uh Sweden does suicide better
and Japan does Star Wars trailers better
I wouldn't know but I'll take your word
for it i miss thought is very weird this
morning i'm on twitter and there's all
these all this training is like jap
japan star wars yeah and i'm like what
the what is that like what what's going
on yeah apparently a regional exclusive
trailer japan international trailer but
only japan well the it's got japanese
subtitles okay it's not dubbed it's not
dubbed it's all in English got it and
they do it a relatively different
trailer than the theatrical one that we
all saw was that last week yeah I mean
item it's very different it's very
different and they show different scenes
do they say true bacchus on no that's
that's borderline insensate I don't
think it is
it's mr. Tuvok oh that's what that means
Chewbacca's on is that what a salaryman
han solo mi if it's offensive i'm sorry
but i don't think it is we're just
having fun um you put like it's crazy
right again it's weird that they
generally they'll do like a big for a
big tentpole like this they'll do the US
release of the trailer they'll do an
international trailer but the
international trailer will have like one
or two like different shots or something
like that but for it to be dramatically
different which is what you're saying it
is as far as i can tell i only watch the
first one that came out twice cuz i'm
just not that much of a crazy person
sure and i just watched this one it's a
little shorter but it's very different
there's one see more like kylo Ren no no
no no no no stop stop so do we talk
about theories what I do talk about who
i think kylo Ren is no we did not talk
about can we do that is it based on any
like interview this is just your brains
Jeff ok go for it I think kylo Ren
remains is Jar Jar Binks re incarcerate
kylo Ren yeah is either Darth Vader's
clone okay sure lame but okay that's not
that's bit well within the there are
there is cloning mr. onanism it keeps it
in the family yes I think like yeah
looks like he's gangly like Luke
Skywalker right okay maybe they may be
like Luke has a weird brother maybe he's
his brother well he would be all sort of
nice in a whaler he would say I mean if
it was dead yeah a close owners down
right this is like some metal gear
right here um I never want to enter that
from of metal gear is there anything
else that you're basing no no this is
all speculation i want to say i also
read someone propose something similar
online uh it was a big theory i read
about Jar Jar Binks being a Sith Lord
that's a parody but it was like a
well-researched there yeah and you can
in Viet come on I hate I hate that stuff
I don't think they were being a holy
serious but they did I like it was a
joke I hate when they're trying to be
serious yeah I'm just like back
to the Future predicted 911 like
that uh uh yes I don't know it's fun to
have your own fan theory though yeah so
this trailer go check it out if you know
we're talking about um it's very it's
very good there's what yeah yeah I am in
my I'm in it to win it I was I won't
watch the trailer I I do feel bad that I
can't have a substantive discussion it's
benign I feel like you just did a really
good job researching yeah George Lucas
has said that he wants to see nothing of
the new movie because it will be the
first time he experiences a Star Wars
movie like anyone else right and it'll
be better than anything he ever did do
you think he can acknowledge personally
like this is so much better than
anything that I could do I'm making
again a very uh premature judgement yeah
but I I feel like I know I'm gonna like
episode 7 I think I will more than any
of them even like Empire which again
through writer direct right i'm gonna i
know i'm gonna i just tell certainly be
more modern and more like a more fitting
of modern tastes in terms of movies i
just think i don't know i think they're
doing it right ah speaking of Star Wars
there is a cnet tech tie in here oh boy
uh if you have been to a newsstand in
the last a couple of days you will
notice that mr. John boyega John boyega
that he is on the cover of Cena magazine
I saw that uh this is a stormtrooper as
a storm trooper and t-shirt of
stormtroopers you don't even know his
deal cuz you've seen no I mean all I've
seen like so for what it's worth I saw
the very first trailer and instantly
regretted it just cuz I got excited I
didn't wish I hadn't seen anything but
there is a shot of him in a stormtrooper
outfit like in the very first like the
first shot helmet off right anyway and
it's clear it's clear that he liked
defects or something happens but yeah
pretty rad that we got him on the cover
of cnet magazine very cool there's
actually it is a good get there's a
variant version of the covers well
there's one in white and one in black
ass very cool ah go check it out it's
really good stuff talking to John boyega
about his role as Finn
you know the force is too much
information I can't tell you what his
name now his name's Finn Finn isn't
gonna pay no fence is he gonna write on
a raft oh noes what does that the
huckleberry finn river oh my god I it
used to be okay you and they I know what
what's happened it used to be all right
uh all right so there it is star wars
the force awakens Japanese trailer
international trailer go check it up for
yourself and let us know what you think
um we wait hold on put on your hat Russ
put on your your business hat okay take
it thank you mrs. happy I mean you are a
fox business veteran are you not yes
what it tell tell the people what you do
sometimes I've been on fox business a
lot you go on like weekly yeah I've
probably been on about 60 or 70 times
okay so that's a lot as a la um and a
big business thing in the tech world
happened yesterday it's true Activision
yes bought King digital yes the makers
of candy crush big game for 5.9 billion
dollars yeah okay with Abby now uh we
talked a bit about this on the Beast
cast as well this week but uh what what
so now what's your knee-jerk reaction
because you know you there's been a lot
of acquisitions with in the mobile space
yes Zynga had that like year when
they're like well we gotta buy everybody
and it kinda didn't work after them I
getting long run sure but Activision
Blizzard is a massive company that's
having a great year yep King digital
actually not so much there's not there
there they've been not tanking but there
haven't been in in the in the best of
financial situations as of late yeah big
they get acquired for I believe and I'm
just trying to remember i believe it was
twenty percent below their IPO i think
it was a premium actually of where their
stock price wise i think was a
20-percent premium on top of the IPO I
thought it was their initial offering
they're getting 20 below it I don't know
maybe we research this or something but
either way the takeaway is that King
hasn't been doing great yeah
Activision's doing real well yeah and
they bought him for almost
six billion dollars yes so now what's
your knee-jerk will need York reaction
um I think it's a smart move for I do I
think it's a good minority most of the
criticism has been against that so this
is why I think it's a good good idea is
Activision has never solved the mobile
thing for themselves like they have not
done a good job on with mobile you know
the only thing they've had a huge hit
with this hearth stone but in terms of
like broad mobile appeal it hasn't
happened yet I feel like hearth stone is
not a blip on the raid it's not above on
the radar but it's one title and that's
the issue King granted has candy crush
they have number of other titles these
are not quote good games I'm not
estimates as much as three million
dollars as how much candy crush makes a
day oh yeah without a doubt I mean the
last the official estimate that i heard
the official like numbers that were
reported was about one and a half
million that was like a year and a half
ago so those are all numbers so and and
that's not the only game that's making
money now the thing about all these
games is that they're super super low
overhead to just maintain they exist and
they just make money you don't need to
staff them you don't need to constantly
create new content when you do need to
create new content it's like a dude in a
room setting up some fruit that fall
like it's literally not work are these
you downplay it that much it's but we're
that's like making a level in like a 3d
world to compare that to a patch to The
Witcher right exactly it's much less
work and um it's this broader appeal
thing what Activision is doing is
essentially they're trying to corner
every area of the games industry yeah
you're I'm sorry just interject real
quick the 18 dollar per share proposed
purchase price does represent a
20-percent premium over Kings closing
price on october third that's what I was
like yeah such as but it is still four
dollars and fifty cents per share lower
than its IPO right definitely and I
think that was the issue that they're
having was the king as its own company
is so sustained by these big spikes
these big successes that they have that
in those dips that's where you see the
share price dropping but when actors in
comes in activision has these big
properties that they can sort of rely on
and say okay these are going to
constantly make money
and you have this under layer of all
these mobile games and they might not
all be huge monster hits but they're all
making my guaranteed profit yeah so I
think it's a very conservative safe move
which is ironic for such a big deal it
would take a major shift in the mobile
game space to make this like a really
bad investment because right good
because smart the trajectory at which it
is pointing which is traveling yeah
would say even in a short to medium
length of time like this is a smart move
totally one hundred percent and then if
you want to get into like the numbers to
of like how Activision is actually
paying for this it's not as much out
it's not like six billion out of their
pocket right a lot of it is coming from
like offshore stuff yeah because it is
an international acquisition king is
Irish wanna say i feel like king is
based in iron and i know where their
base let's look this up real quick i
believe in again if you're listening to
pcs and for for a little bit of overlap
here but King digital is and it's an
Irish King digital let's find out their
wikipedia uh yeah they are not an
American company they are based in
Dublin that one Ireland yeah and they
have an office in Sweden as well yeah I
mean I think it's a good move for
activision i realize i'm a little in the
minority but it's it's not like a super
it's not like when activision brought
bought blizzard and it was like of
course blizzard this monster crazy
company that's on the upswing for the
last 15 years of course they're gonna
buy them it's again kind of crazy when
you're talking about a six billion
dollar acquisition but it's a very
steady conservative good investment for
activision because they're just like
making a baseline and saying okay this
is our mobile solution and it's just
going to constantly make money for the
next five years for as little amount of
effort it takes to update something like
candy course they still have roughly
1,400 employees yeah which is a lot sure
it's a lot of people Activision might
cut some of those basil yeah for sure
that's probably almost guaranteed so so
yeah some of the money is coming from
sure uh because we're talking about like
if they were to bring that money to the
US they have to pay taxes on that so you
gotta look at it as like a deal in that
regard and then the rest of it i believe
is alone from like banks yeah bank of
america and freaking goldman sachs yeah
pretty crazy who's good with this isn't
that weird it's a weird I guess I mean
Activision again stable company monster
public game publisher I wouldn't mind
giving them alone and getting some money
back in the end so if you really want to
know just what the Freak King digital
makes like what what mobile games
they're responsible for ya on iOS
they've got 11 games and these pretty
much overlap one to one with the Android
offerings bubble witch saga yeah bubble
witch saga to the return candy crush yep
candy crush soda saga yeah what is what
you play so decide I don't know i mean
i've played them just to like look at
them but not regularly they're all saga
Diamond digger yeah saga farm heroes
saga Papa Bear saga yeah pet rescue saga
so when you type in saga it comes up
with all their games but that's alright
there's other games that have saga in it
pyramid solitaire saga and then let's
not forget scrub-a-dub isaga and then
alpha Betty saga I've only heard of ba
candy crush yeah just prints money
apparently yes I mean they all make a
lot of money well they all do well so
right so if you can if you can detach
yourself from the fact that this is an
acquisition for the game in the mobile
space let's look at like so i have a
thing where like I i put a stigma on
these types of games okay cuz they're
freemium game sure and they are
essentially uh you know they kind of
bleak money a little bit from there
navara yesterday put it he called them
like cash extraction module I understand
right sure their end goal is to it's
like those coin like when you're in the
arcade and they have that coin pusher
thing right it's like one of those so
now I'm glad you made that analogy
because those remind me a great deal of
casinos sure
and you know you have a lot of
controversy lately with draftkings and
FanDuel not saying can Christakis in the
same category yeah but what I'm saying
is like these are gay these are things
designed to make you spend money that
maybe you would not be willing to going
in now not now that nothing shady
happens there's never point in the game
right it's like stealing your credit
card sure and you're unknowingly giving
it money yeah but they do sort of know
how to operate along the lines of like
oh you liked that didn't you right we
can like how that made you feel didn't
you well guess what first ones free next
one's five down but the thing to keep in
mind is like you unlike draft kings and
stuff like that there's not a there's
not a potential win money which makes it
a big difference like this big leagues
not gambling and it's not gambling it so
that's where I would say it's not really
a casino it's just like feed me fun
feelings right essentially which is
almost like worse and it's weird because
I think people in the games industry are
like so aware of it and what they're
doing that you're sort of it like
doesn't really work like I don't really
pay for like freemium stuff in those
games right neither do I&amp;amp;I wanted I want
to know who those people are I think
because I don't know your people and
there's enough of them that that is
pulling in 3 million dollar and not only
it's not like oh I'm gonna buy five
dollars every three months it's like I'm
gonna drop a hundred hours on this game
and it's the people that are like only
playing candy crush only on their subway
or whatever their commute or whenever
they're playing it and they're like this
is the only game I play I don't feel bad
paying all this money and because of the
way that it's drip fed they don't feel
bad cuz it's like oh I'm not paying a
hundred dollars a month i'm paying five
dollars every week or whatever you know
what i mean it's a filthy habit it's
it's filthy but it's it's monetarily
very effective it's enjoy a lot of money
yeah and again like I'm not trying to
say like now we have to stop freemium
gaming I'm not playing that card because
there are good ways to do it obviously
hearthstone is a great example yeah
freemium game you can I
played a lot of horse stone without
paying and it's you can still have fun
you can't really be competitive in the
like ranking system okay without paying
I mean you have to grind and grind and
grind and grind but you know they were
there have been people that have made
decks with only free cards and they
actually did pretty well so there are
games that do well but there are
probably ways that they can monetize
hearthstone even more and they're not I
feel I just feel like I don't know maybe
I need to like just come to terms and
say hey or maybe we all collectively
need to just be like you know what you
know what the we need to put these guys
in a different category what does that
mean I don't know I don't know what do
you first of all what do you mean by
these guys let's break mobile freemium
game okay and what do you mean by
category I don't know I sound like I
won't like segregated and so we gonna
put them in camps yeah like that's
 oh that's not what I mean oh my
god it's terrible i I just I don't I
just feel slimy talking about this kind
of it just so the shame of it to me it
feels like what we had the way I view
the lottery right like I view the
lottery as a tax on the poor yeah that's
how I well I would say its attacks on
the stupid but and that's kind of how I
label candy crush attacks on the stupid
or and I mean and I'm not saying you're
getting a service right and I'm not
commenting I mean they were you mean the
person who's listening to the show right
now first getting all defensive being
like why I give candy crush ten bucks a
month right screw you Jeff you're just
stupid idiot right I'm not trying to say
that and I don't think any less he and
you just want to put them in a camp I
get up to sing up with like the
collective you know holy i think
the bummer of it especially for people
that work in the games industry is that
you see all these indie developers with
amazing ideas being creative and stuff
like that and very rarely does that
stuff bubble up into financial success
on the app store right because like even
if you do something like what the hell
is that like MC escher game oh you mean
not now can't even think of it right you
know i'm talking a journey journey face
forward with the adventure
on my phone King monument valley
Monument Valley yeah which is like a
really beautiful stylized fun to play
yeah uh artsy single player yes no ads
yes thing made a lot of money made a lot
of money but like once you're done right
that's it whereas I by TLC you could buy
DLC but my point is like it didn't it
wasn't this freemium thing right where
it's like it's the gift that keeps on
giving where I could keep you having to
pump quarters into the Machine and it's
also there's a design element to those
games the freemium games that like banya
value would not work as a freemium game
because the idea of like oh I get to
play one more level is not enough of it
you know benefit for people right it's
not enough of an incentive maybe I'm
totally wrong and I'm not looking at it
proportionally maybe someone out there's
thinking look listen to this dickhead
yeah who's complaining about candy crush
saga and the willingness to like feed
the drip machine rental thing when this
kid probably grew up going to arcades
we're like half of those games are
designed to make you pop in a quarter to
care for you is it the same thing well
what was it the reason pinball was
deemed illegal for anomalies because it
wasn't game of skill and hello until it
was proven to be a good skill I don't
know I think we're talking about some of
the same stuff yeah I know what you mean
this is definitely not a skill thing
although there is skill involved like
most of the games are built with the
mindset of like oh we're gonna make this
just hard enough to make people pay look
there are ways to make money and make
money and premium and not be like super
slimy super like demanding two dots is a
good example of a great game that's
freemium it's on Android it's on iOS
that is excellent and you can pay money
if you want to and there are whales
obviously in that game but you know what
can i say is it's it I i get the
frustration um it's just it there there
needs to be more of a conversation
better right is that yes so I just don't
know how I'm gonna convince someone that
plays candy crush every day and that's
the only game they play
not give them all I'm not again I'm not
I don't wanna like stop people on the
subway and be like a ma'am if you need
to stop what you're doing or here's the
for your kids cancer like dating in
today I'm not trying to do that I'm just
trying to get it all out there now I
know all right so that got me thinking
and South Park a couple months ago or
last year did a fantastic episode about
freemium gaming yeah and part of the
thing was like yeah the whole thing with
freemium gaming is that you pay not to
wait right so that got me thinking
yesterday hey it's the year twenty
thirty eight and now you don't have the
time to wait and see a movie yeah well
you can pay my service and my service
2038 that's now 2138 2138 it's now what
like that exists right now on video on
demand mmm okay mom sorry I'm jumping
ahead you are okay and you're ruining
this is going a hundred years in the
future 120 years in the future yes 120
years ago at your my service at every
high-tech will let you yeah have the
memory of the movie without having to
actually watch and see it so this is
like eternal sunshine essentially no
eternal sunshine the opposite is in our
memory eraser we're giving you the
memory all right it's the opposite of
lacuna why would you because now it's
good now maybe it works for like books
too okay but that's like it's like yeah
you're uploading information to your
brain sure I so you don't want to wait
to see Mad Max 48 yeah I'm gonna let you
have seen it for more than the price to
go watch it you're sundar Stan at what
point cuz you guys the freemium network
boy do you get your esta Mars is my
question wise have to go to I have to go
to Mars because it's totally go through
you this is totally epistolary colors
have you never seen totally I have what
it's not about is total recall it they
implant the whole company total recall
is about they implant good memories into
your brain but they fiercely use it to
make him realize you ladies someone else
uh-uh it's essentially don't worry oh my
god that you hmm did I just try and redo
total Rico dead no but you get what I'm
saying right I get weird name I'm doing
an armor I don't know why you would do
movies though it seems like you could do
much more fascinating things it can't be
like experiences why I
can't that the company we have this is
the beta we haven't figured out how to
have isn't a movie watching a movie and
experience no it is it is okay it of you
going to the theater my experiences
there you go you're done it but I'm not
offering the movie-going experience okay
I'm not offering the theater-going
experience I'm offering just the by the
the open and shut instance okay of that
film from start to finish you you your
brain jar then have that memory of the
film nothing else you won't be able to
if you got pretty where you see not you
won't be only one think back what you
were wearing when you saw it okay you
will just have the memory of the film so
it's like reading the wikipedia page
kind of but you can but you have visual
memories you can you like I remit you
see a movie you can you draw back to it
you understand what you saw you process
the visualization of it so it's like a
two minute recap of an hour and a half
long it's like mental cliff notes mental
cliff notes that could exist like next
year it's entirely five I don't think we
need to jump 120 years in the future you
be like the idea and I know what you're
saying is that I like I want to watch
the whole season of Fargo I want to see
all breaking bed I can sit on my ass and
pay and pay her twenty dollars all that
time or i can give you 50 bucks and then
I've experienced all of breaking bed
without have that conversation that
amount of time right I'd like the idea
um yeah I don't know it doesn't seem
that advanced to me you're crazy like we
I'm not saying we won't get there what
is it it's essentially like a memory
download thing bro it's right it's the
whole idea of like using our brains is
like infinite hard drive right language
like I'm sure we're a circuit whatever
put Johnny Five reads the book in like a
second right and he's like that was good
book right but he that's like an OCR
thing like he's using a optical
recognition right and understanding it
whereas like I'm saying no no it's just
all that information it's implanted
neroli like the matrix sure we're like
you know you know kung fu well guess
what now you know all seven seasons of
breaking bad I like
that's it's just the most worthless
think I know make you ignite have it be
anything else why is it's too dangerous
yeah but you know people would you're
like all we had that cuz out that back a
large legacy I come in early the plot of
total recall recall and is that it
starts as an inane I can go on a
vacation right I can't really I get it
it's more like vanilla sky and we're way
to have never seen those guys like you
when you die you get like transported
into like a vacation okay I think you're
on vacation for her like they kick your
soul yeah excuse me and do that pretty
good but I'm yeah this is fun this is
fun don't talk about that III think it's
an interesting concept and I like the
idea of boiling down the use of time
like this all this time that you're
wasting doing these things that you
enjoy but it's just a lot of time you're
wasting so why not pay a premium to not
spend so much right and that's my rules
right like you couldn't do it for a
video game because video games
interactive thing those experiment you
do for like the story of a video can you
can do for like only the cutscenes here
but like for me I think the cool thing
the cool rule with this is like no no
it's only for content that's consumable
like a TV show movie I don't know if you
could do a book why because a book a
book is interpreted differently by
everyone because you're just reading and
your the words yeah but if you're
getting let's say a visual picture of
know now yeah right yeah so you're
getting a visual picture of all the
letters on the page doesn't work like
that when I think back to a book like
when you think back to a book you've
read do you think to what the words look
like I'm really good fun haha Potter for
all right I'm glad we had that
conversation we're gonna take a break
when we come back more 404 hey it's time
to talk about softlayer clouds and soft
layer whoo that's all you got I'm
excited why its clouds confuse me and I
hope that there's a company that could
explain them to me I don't think
software is gonna clear the air huh when
God they're not going to explain close
to you they're just gonna do a badass
bang-up job at providing you clouds
built for scale awesome for your
business and all your computational
applications and your
workloads software's got you covered
there an IBM company and they use IBM
that is soft layers cloud infrastructure
for all their foundation in the cloud
alright that's great so awesome all
kidding aside if cloud infrastructure
something you're interested in as a
listener of our show you can get five
hundred dollars off any of their
services by going to softlayer calm /
podcast that could be bare metal servers
virtual servers storage networking
security services all of that five
hundred dollars off go to cloud no
there's no don't go to Clown go to
softlayer calm / podcast tell them the
404 sent you you get five hundred
dollars off hey welcome back to the 404
show uh we do not do drugs on this show
no but not on this you may have thought
something was involved in that last
conversation uh which leads us to our
next topic cuz it the great state of
Ohio oh boy and what they didn't do yeah
so I we don't talk too much about pot on
the show now I'm sorry we reference it a
bunch occasionally ah don't do drugs is
number one yeah number two it's kind of
shocking to me and this is just like a
one-off thing we can move on quickly
it's a little shocking to me that Ohio
um rejected the recreational pot do you
know how close the vote was I do not cuz
it surprised me in general just because
there's so much benefit for the states
like that's what I don't understand I
believe I read something recently that's
a Colorado officially made more money
off taxing pot than alcohol yeah that
might like once you read stuff like that
yeah you kind of go huh the only thing I
can think of is if it sort of depends on
how powerful the police unions are
because you take pot off the market and
the cops get a lot less to do and that
might be an issue I'm you know that's
sort of like a very simplistic way to
look at it but I details and I think the
point i think the whole point of getting
that kind of legislation passed yeah is
to avoid them
having to deal with the pot so they
could work on other stuff yeah so you
can have bigger I fish their concern was
that they would get less funding if they
don't like if you're in the middle of
nowhere Ohio and you don't have a cartel
down the street and all you have is a
bunch of kids that deal pot every once
awhile now you don't have that anymore
and maybe you'll get less funding and
Mabel cutback cops I don't know I don't
know but all I slippery's Ohio refusing
to legalize marijuana as shocking as it
is and you know hi Oh is is Ohio
historically a red or blue state I feel
like me it's a it's a sweet swing state
all right so they may be they get a pass
I mean let's be honest Louisiana is
probably never going to legalize pot
it'll have to be a federal thing which I
think Bernie Sanders just put forth to
make it to ban federal labels a federal
criminality of pot right well that's
always up for conversation either way
you slice it in 2016 the presidential
election year ten states are going to
probably bring that before voters
including Nevada California
Massachusetts Michigan Arizona Vermont
mean Florida Missouri I'm sorry Missouri
and rhode island so there's ten more
states are going to have their chance to
not look like total jackasses I feel
like someone's just gotta make a stand
federally and be like yep we're gonna do
it or no we're not good I don't get this
in too much of a political thing but
like if I'm a strategic Republican
politician yeah helping out one of these
guys that might get the nomination I go
look there's a bunch of things that we
disagree with that the vast majority
come right in favor of ya gay marriage
which is right we can't find that final
all right and then legalizing pot on
birth control yeah she like you want to
look like the good guy right you wanna
you want to get people who would never
even consider you that's just what I'm
saying well that was the plots of and
that's low how was the last season of
The West Wing was that plot well you had
a moderate Republican that was like pro
a bunch of stuff that like most people
were Pro right it's just something to
think about you know think about it
politician think about it no one
died from overdosing on pot think about
that I did yeah it's it is people do
need to be careful though because you
have all these dispensaries opening up
people you be careful with what with
have you tried overdose and like died
but you can overdose it like really is
it lose it of course like really do
something and and driving while really
out of it illegal I did write wonders
and it is illegal right um but need to
be careful and I think yeah yeah the
concern is that you have all these
dispensaries popping up and they sort of
have it's not like alcohol where people
sort of understand for the most part
this is going to get me drunk I know how
much I'm gonna drink that's going to get
me drunk one drink an hour whatever it
is um with weed especially with like a
brownies way tougher to understand you
don't know what the content of the
consistency is how much is in there etc
so yeah you got to be careful at least
get marijuana off the schedule one yeah
it's it's crazy you know what else is on
schedule one what heroin that was a
brand name actually for pink or heroin
yeah is right yeah they have vicodin
scheduled to that's below pot bikes they
called on the street bikes greenies
we're greenies in this acid yeah same
categories marijuana ecstasy yeah ever
see what that does to kids no good
all right we're going to get rid of the
pots up this is an amazing discovery
this cash that Russ found last week that
we did not have time to because we were
with jordan hoffman who by the way it
was excellent alight at the White I
don't have any like interesting factoid
about John Hoffman used to be a new york
city tour guide so knows all these crazy
facts about New York City history that's
weird yeah like the guy on the bus this
is the guy on the bus Hey look to your
right there's a city hall yeah
underneath that is Canal Street because
there's a canal under there there you go
that's cool so uh this okay totally
different subject um or at least be
totally passed yeah um so Russ you on
earth yep a thread
from Mac forums which is a very highly
frequented Mac up enthusiast website yes
and you pulled up a thread they had in
their forums from october 23rd 2001 yep
do you know what happened on that day no
I can't even believe this was a website
right in two thousand key is in the
diamondbacks were duking it out in the
World Series and uh it was a month after
I love it alright that's about but
something very big did happen that day
and that was the official reveal of a
new Apple device called the ipod so this
is crazy this is like a time capsule
yeah fourteen years ago almost to the
day of this like thread where people are
like what is this really bizarre so now
why'd you put in any way better in here
there's some really interesting
commentary commentary from people that
didn't know anything I mean that the
whole thread is just called Apple's new
thing and then ipod and parenthesis and
people were saying like I poop I cry I
was hoping for something more great just
the world what the world needs another
freaking mp3 player go Steve where's the
Newton oh wow were you barking up the
wrong tree what about like forged
dollars for an mp3 player I mean that's
still not unreasonable asst all you
wussies waiting for a newton replacement
I told you it was a media player charged
by firewire god that sounds crazy in I
love these old threads they just like
it's such a relic of another time 20
gigs yeah they're all freaking out about
the forger dollar price tag and they're
talking also about like the competition
right so they're already two products
similar to this on the market the Nomad
jukebox yep I remember that thing and
then the archos jukebox this is good
this guy traveller says we live in the
year two thousand one not 6,000 not
6,000 years from now when ridiculously
awesome technology will exist no other
mp3 player has a hard drive like this
five gigs yeah
a real about the same size has 64 Meg's
I mean that is really telling yet that's
a crazy yeah that's the thing oh how
much more memory this thing and and if
you remember in hindsight's
twenty-twenty but if you remember when
that when the ipod debuted I'm my buddy
Bobby got one yeah I think he had the
first one and I couldn't under a BB it
was thick it was oh yeah this thing is I
was like almost like a deck and a half
of cards yeah I would say it's about a
deck of cards he was man i think it's
bigger dat bigger it was like a mini VHS
tape uh that thing had so much more
memory than anything else yeah and it
was so much that you didn't like I was
like what am I gonna do with five gigs
that's an outrageous amount of space
obviously now not so much but and and it
like looked good like all the other mp3
versus a movie it was he a super sexy
and it didn't have to touch it or was
just but now is just hard buttons headed
for screen has a dream to color screen
or one color screen here's a really good
post number 41 from beholder of truth
you're all a bunch of imbecile nimbus
i'll cry babies oh my god Peppa driving
is all in bold yes olive Oh put your
avian gone over the specs and all you
can do is whine and cry because you
didn't get a Newton get a life as I'm
about to just you know diarrhea out why
I'm such an apple fanboy I bet all you
do is troll Mac BBS is criticizing apple
and how they can never meet your stupid
way out of this world expectations new
line all caps this thing is amazing it's
not just another mp3 player it's a
breakthrough mp3 player let's go over
this number 15 gigabyte ultra-slim hard
drive all on a tiny and beautiful
enclosure the size of a deck of cards
there's so many does any mp3 player out
there you have anything like that I
don't think so only huge crap-ass ones
like a nomad jukebox I mean you think
this was steve jobs doing this thing
fits in your palm or in your pocket and
then the next one all caps firewire
edited by Steve like Steve in the
factory in China doing this Steve
transmitted one gigabyte of data onto
the
device in about two minutes one gigabyte
does any mp3 player out there do this
didn't think so you've doing five hours
on your Nomad to load up 20 minute is
good for thanks I mean it goes on it
does go on doubles as a storage device
10 hour battery auto think apples
beautiful and intimate I mean say what
you will i mean this guy was right and
so far as it was a pretty groundbreaking
thing he's very excited about it is he
yeah a little mixer i think a little
excited the whole post it's like 500
words the whole post is in bold it's
yeah he was very curious which is like
when people do that a message board you
like who's this guy enough already yeah
uh yeah it's funny i wanna if anyone
knows of other forum threads from like
big days in tech posted in the in the
subreddit or email us because we
definitely kind of fun looking at these
old threats if we can match half of the
awesomeness of this one yeah it's pretty
great i would love to do it all right uh
we're stealing this next topic from our
/ our thoughts if you've never been to
reddit com / r / showerthoughts it's a
bastion of weird crap that people think
out of nowhere and I I would hope some
of them actually do come from the shower
I have weird thoughts the moment of
clarity in there yeah when I'm fighting
fake insects alright when you're not
hallucinating uh this is pretty funny
this came about 12 hours ago from the
time we're recording this the the title
is Batman is also all of these
showerthoughts are just like simple one
sentence ideas that are just like whoa
ya know Batman is a one percenter
beating up the mentally ill criminally
insane yeah I think criminally insane is
like the better way to say it I mean
that is but he is a one percenter
there's no doubt about that definitely
one percenter and he does beat up people
back he does give back and maybe he
doesn't just beat up the mentally ill
even though I or maybe he doesn't be
definitely I'm all of his villains are
pretty sick in the head right they're
not they're not well is there like one
Batman villain that's like a kingpin
it that's just like I just wanna see my
penguin like penguin doesn't seem to be
he's got that parents think he's thing
with his parents got abandonment issues
what about um yeah I guess calendar man
yes like crazy he's obsessed with
calendar yes uh mr. freeze mr. dad's
wife got everyone so emo and they've all
got some little baggage they gotta deal
with uh there is no oh what about
Falcone Falcone is probably not mentally
oh right the crime boss crime boss
Falcone Falcone is that anyone who does
not go any right like that he seems to
be stable enough yeah cuz it's only
priority is just like committing crime
and make money is that case Falcone
cannon or falconis yeah he's like a
character in there yeah well he's a guy
yeah yeah it's crazy so I think he's the
only one but that's true I mean it's
probably merely a schizo what about like
Harley Superman is everyone he fights
crazy they're mostly like alien Lex
Luthor's like mad with power yeah but I
wouldn't say he's he's mentally ill he's
not yeah unless you like one account
like megalomaniacal as mental illness
but and that's more of just like a don't
know if that's in the DM five or did
whatever the dsm-5 no that's in there
probably not yeah yeah that's uh you
know Batman's trying to do the fight the
good fight but it's true that he does
have some he just wants to convince them
that what they're doing is wrong and
they're they're not having it Joker's
like now I'm gonna do what I want the
the comic book now the new 52 yeah well
right what is it the do Jim Gordon is
now been here about that I guess it's
kind of a spoiler but if you like it's
fine if you're not reading that if
you're behind to fast-forward a minute
uh in that story line right now Jim goes
bad so Bruce Wayne dies yeah the Batman
dies has he died before uh I don't know
he died it's kind of animal he's
fighting Joker her after this thing
called end games like the ark I think
they called it and him in the Joker fall
like underneath Gotham near like the
Lazarus pits ok
and they're fighting and they both kill
each other they both died okay in like
an ultra punch it was like that both KO
are they're done uh and then Jim Gordon
yeah is like we gotta keep we got keep
the sheep on Batman alive for bama
becomes this like government contracted
entity okay where Batman was like a suit
and Batman just stands for something ok
Jim Gordon gets fit gets bought yeah and
assumes the suit and now he's Batman
he's got like a team of people and help
him out and still got the mustache yeah
ok he's like shaves his head cool but
new twist Bruce Wayne's back obviously
cuz he got killed by the Lazarus Pit one
of course a lot with no memory of being
Batman Oh No so what does he remember he
just from he I don't know what he
remembers it's it's is he like a
ten-year-old boy again no he's like a
he's like an older dude but he just
doesn't remember anything and like he's
hanging out with this girl and she's
trying to convince him he's back at
Wayne Manor and he understands his
legacy but he doesn't remember the
Batman side ok I feel like what they're
gonna do is they're like I'm like fake
kill his parents that's the only way to
do it I'd be good yeah it's cool you
have to cast for that or i don't know i
guess the pearls yeah you gotta really
make sense and work but that's where
that that uh that comic is headed right
now that's in Crime Alley was that the
official name of that street was crying
out I think that was the nickname they
gave it okay well because he go cuz you
know yeah because there's a an issue
with her talking about it again crime
alley yeah alright so that's that we're
going to take one more break when we
come back we'll finish things up with a
this and that various things with some
monkeys hey with some tech stuff whoa
and the product hunt game of the week
stay tuned more for for right after this
hey do you need a website i do my I've
had that construction gift playing for
about 15 years you can't make that joke
again Russ did I make a checker I feel
like you've done that but it does sound
like the sort of joke i would make ah so

welcome back to the show I'm loving this
one today ma'am rockin and rollin
feeling good you called it I I was
skeptical but we're making it happen you
know when they think bakalar they think
clutch they do they think delivering on
his promise right they do they do
exactly that uh so we did a shower
thought now we're going to
talk about something about this is like
a technical thing yeah so this is weird
so whenever i watch TV on and they
always have the TV on here at the CBS
office and they're always playing
obviously CBS right during the day CBS
runs out they do the prices right they
do they're like a deal they do their
news but then they do soap operas yes I
always wanted to know why does it seem
like soap operas have better picture
quality better HD definition picture
then perhaps regular TV programming what
is all that sure and they have this glow
about right better is obviously
subjective but it looks weirdly crisper
right like I don't like sharper and like
more bright so I've always wondered like
just what the hell's going on yeah so
there was a great post about this on the
explain like I'm five subreddit we're
obviously pulling from reddit quite a
bit today but that's cool they make good
content and the post was essentially why
do soap operas seem like they have a
higher definition picture than regular
TV programming and this guy SS six am-6
is his username apparently says it says
this he says soap opera lighting is the
major reason that shows look the way
they do backlighting part of the
three-point lighting setup often used in
television production helps lift actors
out of the background so it makes them
more dimensional right this is
especially useful productions that are
shot on lower quality medium or in small
interior sets which soaps often are so
essentially by lighting them a certain
way it's taking away the backgrounds
which are kind of shoddy and like crappy
like they could do this on like SNL
right and they're out and they do
essentially yeah you know it's using
similar lighting techniques actors the
foreground often wind up being very
noticeably backlit something that
doesn't often happen which shows on lar
with larger sets or shows that a record
on film right and the video stuff
changes things to I I don't think a lot
of shows are shot on film anymore yeah
but that dad used to be a thing this is
also interesting so soaps and other low
pitches also look off because
they're more evenly lit across the
entire set because it allows them to
shoot from multiple cameras at once so
ordinarily when you're like a shooting a
breaking bad there's just one camera and
you have to do it multiple times but
with soaps and obviously like three
cameras it comes like friends and
whatever they are using multiple cameras
at once so they don't have to like
constantly reduce stuff so they can get
it done really quick so the whole set
needs to be late not just the part where
the camera is pointing at the moment
right so it's interesting I I never
thought about that but very fascinating
wonderful world of lighting for TV that
is not an easy job I mean it is tough to
light and you know even the the freaking
videos we do here in the studio next
door but you gotta got like thirty five
lights on a grid sure and it's still not
good enough like you still got a
maneuver and MacGyver stuff and make
stuff work yeah but you got to imagine
for like a soap opera they have very
consistent sets of course and and
essentially oh this is a two-person seen
in such and such as apartment and this
evil twin is going to come through the
door and this is our lighting setup for
it and it's got to be pretty consistent
right obviously I mean need to make
changes is not easy work but I don't
know that they're doing a ton of like
okay let's try to figure this out every
scene you know right I don't know how
they does the amount of shooting
that they do for like law and order on
the streets blows me away because
there's so much logistics required for
that it's like crazy to me yeah you just
walk outside and it's law and order I
think as for you chilling out so we're
in a lot of really awesome developments
in lighting for uh production yeah
there's all those like hanging Chinese
lantern looking ones they're like Blum
lighting realize we're like are just
first bait lighter they just like space
real well they're like almost like hot
air balloon yeah that are like it's
really impressive stuff and they can
they eat they light evenly and yeah I
mean there's just really awesome stuff
out there and I guess the lenses have
gotten better yeah I me like you don't I
and believe it or not like a lot of
stuff they don't always use lights
anymore really yeah like not everything
is shot with lights I know Kubrick shot
one of his movies with just candle light
right I don't know I think he did but
that's pretty impressive I'm not saying
you know lighting is going away I'm just
saying like
with a lot of really awesome you know
low light detection with cameras yeah
they don't allow you to have this
amazing right it's it start like you can
choose to do it don't want think it's
got it can be done with just your iPhone
sure but it's not necessarily you know
something you always have to have all
those gaffers out of the job well
they'll be okay poor gaffers they'll
figure it out um all right I'll let's go
to uh this story about the Boston Garden
and there's just like myth about the
Boston Garden monkey yeah I've never
heard of this I need you to I didn't I
didn't hear about this until very
recently I need you to tell me just what
the hell the Boston Boston Market and
said the Boston Garden monkey is yes he
real what is he what is you represent
and why are we talking about so the
Boston Garden first of all let me say
weird animal facts done all right very
right the Boston Garden was the old
Boston arena it's where the Celtics
played probably other sports teams
played there too whoo the Bruins may
here you go okay they play there as well
great hockey hockey so that garden it
closed 20 years ago actually back in
September was the anniversary of when it
closed but there was this rumor going
around when they were dismantling it so
they're taking apart 20 years ago and
the rumor was that the construction
workers found a mummified monkey in the
rafters of the building rafters they
were in yeah that's above it yeah so is
it was above it in the upper section
instruction workers encountered
something but to a peculiar in the
garden about halfway through the
building demolition workers found the
remains of a monkey in the rafters
Thursday and they were even moved to
pause for a moment of silence a hard
hats in hand so this happened no one
like people are like skeptical of
whether they actually found the monkey
people were trying to figure out what it
could have been so like in 1998 they
were speculating that Ringling Brothers
when it came to the Boston Garden maybe
there's a monkey that vanished Ringling
Brothers denied that they even looked
too
apparently in the 1930s there's a new
story uh here's the headline monkeys
evade capture hold own circus amid
Boston Garden rafters oh my gosh back in
the nineteen thirties uh and a bunch of
monkeys escaped uh and we're like
causing a problem another headline
monkeyshines continued at garden bananas
trap only two of the truth so they're
using bananas to try to trap these
monkeys in the 1930s unfortunately they
did some DNA testing and it turns out
the monkey that they found the mummified
monkey was not um was not one of these
monkeys ok so they went to the when they
went to the extent of DNA testing yes so
it's freakin gross it's weird it's gross
what is it what so what's going on so
they found they really did find a monkey
right and what's even weirder is that
the guy one of the guys who was the
senior vice president of Mercia diesel
which i guess was in charge of
demolition totally denied this actually
happening so we have the construction
workers saying we found this monkey we
even there's a todos airport photos yeah
well at this point there were no photo
they hadn't surfaced yet right and the
guys like absolutely not I was in charge
of the project and believe me I would
have known it's an urban legend there
were pigeons there were rats there were
no monkeys like and what's the like why
not admit that there's lucky likewise
lonely well there so we're gonna find
out in a second so so that's how the
story ends this Boston Gore boston.com
story which came out in September
apparent out it works out uh-uh so this
is a follow-up story from Boston com um
that was published actually just I think
a day ago yeah yesterday I'm sure is
today this is earlier this morning and
this is from the construction workers
along with photos of them finding the
monkey and yeah posing with it around
the stadium including one picture of the
monkey on the fleet center sign which
was the stadium that was gonna ruin the
Boston Garden it upsets me that they
were like throwing this carcass around
they even talked about the fact that
like why didn't the guy know that guy
from Moore's diesel who was in charge of
the conundrum why didn't know so they
said we hid it from Morris diesel for a
couple days and they came looking for it
we
actually put it in an electrical panel
where we parked our cars we hid it in
there Oh My they're hiding the monkey
cuz there were they were gonna get in
trouble or whatever this is so weird
really bizarre but this is legit like
there's been speculation there's a lot
of proof and a lot of mump a monkey
mummy photos here leaning up again they
like posed it in various spots around
the garden it's terrible that they posed
it it is sad so it but they don't know
where it's from no they still have no
idea what the source the monkey was that
I I think it's gonna be circus my guess
would be Ringling Brothers probably
wouldn't admit to the fact that they
lost the monkey because they might open
them up to like litigation right so by
who I don't know the Kong family yes
king and his wife had weird it's a weird
one Russ even this one he's like to take
a photo with a monkey in like a weird
like wooden chair yeah it's it's
a weird story maybe i'll link to this in
the show no too weird ones we can get
with I want to know x yeah i wanna weird
animal facts oh you know you never know
how whoa how it's gonna go but i need to
know where this guy came from and was
there any sort of like legend attached
to him like did he was he responsible
for like a dearth of championships well
it's but the problems they didn't find
the monkey until it was being demolished
and also the celtics did pretty well
yeah so you know who knows no I guess
the Bruins probably were pretty good 24
I don't remember how the Bruins were in
the Andes ah but yeah that's so if so if
you know anything about the monkey if
it's your monkey it's okay it's been 20
years that your limitations is done you
can come forward let us now so we're
just very odd so weird for monkey what a
story what a story finally we'll finish
things up with the product hunt game of
the week Russ what uh okay product on
Game of the Week is a game called the
room three okay so i usually when you do
these they're like I've never heard I'm
like okay great this game will be flavor
the week four seconds and then we'll
move on with our lives yes but I really
like the room okay because the room uh
is a really cool sort of puzzle is I
guess it's what we call like a puzzle
like I'm interactive toughest but like
less
like obtuse and annoying it's just like
you got open a box yeah and you gotta
figure out your like moving levers and
like holding down secret it's like a
puzzle box and you like hold down secret
elements and yeah and slowly but surely
you open this box and each layer has
like a new puzzle for you to solve and
it looks gorgeous and yeah the second
one was great too and this is the third
entry in the room series now I was
excited up until a point where i was
told i cannot play this game that's true
why can i not play this game because you
are in an apple newton know you're on an
android that's not on android so for the
record the room one and two are on
android yeah but i don't think they
launched on android no they don't wait
until like three years from now because
the the developer of the room hates
Andrew fireproof games now they don't
hate Android they just know what that
means right that's the thing you release
and they probably got really good
promotion indosiar app store I'm chef
I'm sure by being exclusive how much is
it I don't know actually I don't really
think about these things cuz I don't pay
for games just happy answered I play
four games no I know you do what uh how
much is it's five bucks okay i was gonna
say that's the sweet spot for 99 right
yep yeah you can't like hat and how many
hours do there's anywhere ever say how
many of the um uh no i don't know how
many hours but the first game was i
would say probably about two hours maybe
an hour and a half second game was it a
little bit longer than that so i would
say in that realm so it's not gonna last
you forever but I you know it's not know
five dude five if I get an afternoon
yeah it's like Monument Valley yeah I
would say that's great so check it out
