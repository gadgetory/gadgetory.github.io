report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week
sweet sweet honey comb the lights are
back on in Egypt and you will be less
naked the next time you fly but first
it's the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the LG optimus 3d that's
right even the phones are doing it now
LG plans to show off the Optimus 3d at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next
week and since I won't be there and
maybe you won't either let's check it
out now there are hints that it will be
a dual core smartphone but for sure it
will have a dual lens camera for taking
3d video a 4.3 inch touchscreen capable
of naked eye 3d display a 3d capable
hdmi output and DLNA support for media
sharing around the house LG says the
phone addresses the lack of 3d content
by basically being a one-stop shop for
watching and creating stuff in 3d so
expect early buyers to delight their
friends with lots of videos of them
going like this mmm I mean 3d coming at
you and now for the news Egypt has
restored internet access to its
protesting population after plunging
that connected country into the dark
ages for almost a week as you probably
know there's been violence and unrest in
Egypt in recent days as citizens their
protest over high unemployment and
government corruption now the crazy part
about this is that most of the world
didn't even care about the Egypt protest
until Egypt turned off the internet
never mind that most of that population
lives on like two dollars a day they
have this repressive dictatorship that
horribly oppresses women tortures
citizens and rigs every so-called
election in favour of the 30 year old
authoritarian regime that's just like
life over there but then they turned off
the internet and the whole world was
like dad is wrong do they can't even
tweet how are they going to read my cake
blog how will they get their Bieber news
all right back to our pampered Western
tech lives Google held an event this
week to show off honeycomb the new
version of Android that's specially made
for tablets and i gotta say apple better
look
out the honeycomb temos took advantage
of the dual-core motorola xoom and
delivered amazing graphics useful
widgets multi-touch support and cool new
video chat just like FaceTime hey and on
how are you man hey was up + honeycomb
is way more like a real computer OS than
iOS even with that 4.2 multitasking oh
and google unveiled a new web-based
version of the android market that lets
you download apps from the web and then
automatically delivers them to your
android device whether it's a phone or a
tablet or whatever i'll tell you this
much folks nobody at Google was wearing
a black turtleneck on Wednesday but they
did just fine without it speaking of
Google though there was a tech giant cat
fight this week Google accused Microsoft
of stealing their search results for
Bing seriously they set up like a big
sting and everything okay well it's not
exactly like the Bing folks just googled
everything and then copy and pasted it
it's a little more complicated than that
but there are a few interesting
coincidences now Microsoft said they are
not copying search results they are
insulted by Google's accusations and
they think that the Bing sting is pretty
damn shady as a matter of fact although
the way I see it come on they probably
did copy some results in some cases you
want to know why because Microsoft ain't
stupid and now they're like hey Google
thanks for all the free advertising
after all who knew Bing was so scary in
other headlines this week amazon is
reportedly going to roll out a netflix
tile movie and TV streaming service that
would be free for amazon prime members
like me roll it out roll it out rupert
murdoch unveiled the daily his ipad only
newspaper it'll cost 99 cents a week and
forty dollars a year and it's customized
for ipad viewing with lots of video and
interactive photos and of course the
fact that it's news you can only read on
an ipad man i cannot wait for a future
in which i have to pay per device to get
content that sounds awesome doesn't it
speaking of devices Android this week
overtook Nokia to become the world's
biggest global smartphone platform hey
but no really Murdoch make a paper for
the iPad why not and the TSA is testing
software that will make the images taken
by its full body image scanners a lot
less naked now your picture will look
more like a stick figure than a Playboy
centerfold so that's nice and everything
I guess they didn't do that in the first
place because pervert and finally let's
see what's clogging the tubes this week
TLC's increasingly ridiculous lineup of
shows gets a little good-natured ribbing
in this YouTube clip the best part is
that for the first few shows you almost
don't realize it's a joke coming up next
little people tricky fridge followed by
12 wives 12 problems follow the small
dogs big dumps followed by dwarf
hoarders and our Tuesday night lineup
uterus cannon followed by toddlers and
taxes followed by cake whores and at
nine super quick weddings followed by
the divorce horse and our wednesday
night lana idiot family followed by dr.
Drew's second chance bad odds followed
by a ste home surgery followed by whole
face new vagina and 11 a special episode
of 9 fat kids one dessert only on TLC
The Learning Channel for some reason
it's funny because it's true also uterus
cannon would be an awesome band name I'm
just saying and that's the buzz report
for this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for watching
Microsoft for its part said it is and
not copying search results they are
insulted by google's app app blue pluck
