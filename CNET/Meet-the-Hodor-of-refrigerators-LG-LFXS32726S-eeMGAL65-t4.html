you think this fridge behind me costs a
pretty basic looking unit stainless
steel nothing tinted no door and a door
no smart features nothing too special
well if you guessed $3,600 you're
exactly right it's a very expensive
fridge from LG the reason it cost so
much is it's one of the biggest French
door fridges you can get 32 cubic feet
inside of it but like I said nothing
that much is special about this fridge
nothing distinctive nothing new or
unique if it's gonna cost so much and it
doesn't have anything special about it
it sort of has to pitch a perfect game
the interesting thing is this fridge
sort of does take a look at this heat
map it shows the average temperatures in
each region of the fridge during a 72
hour test of Iran and if you look
they're all very very close very close
to that 37 degree target that's a very
good result speaks to how consist in the
perform of this thing's
it also takes great advantage of all the
space that it offers there's a lot of
neat drawers that hold things like your
kids snacks this deli drawer that pulls
out is a very nice thing to have it's
nice and tall with its bulky items down
there a lot of other drawers like it
aren't quite as tall you can't put as
much in it
so all in all this fridge does great
with performance and with its interior
design it just looks a little boring on
the outside I don't think I'd buy it a
$3,600 I want something more distinctive
but if you catch it on sale maybe go for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
