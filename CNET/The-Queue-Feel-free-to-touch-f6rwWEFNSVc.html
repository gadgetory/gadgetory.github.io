demuro with Cena TV and you are in the
queue all the tech news we could squeeze
into your YouTube attention span but
first let's get you started with your
must see moment surface is a new
tabletop computer from Microsoft that
responds to touch the 30 inch display
does without a mouse or keyboard but
goes way beyond your standard
touchscreen use your hands to finger
paint or manipulate photos documents or
anything else hotels casinos and retail
stores will be the first to get their
hands on surface die coke adds vitamins
and calls it plus now Apple has drm-free
tracks for sale in itunes plus the copy
protection section of itunes now live
offering songs from the record label EMI
for a buck 29 / track that's 30 cents
more than standard songs but you can do
whatever you want with them there are no
restrictions on how many computers or
players you can put them on or how many
CDs you can burn with them click over to
the site and iTunes will let you know
how many of your tracks can be set drm
free and how much it'll cost you Google
is picking up for a 9 left off and
adding some awesome street views to its
maps the new feature gives you 360
degree views of streets in various
cities including New York San Fran Las
Vegas Denver and Miami more to come the
image is supplied by company called
immersive media how do they get those
uber cool images a special car top
camera captures 11 high-resolution video
streams at once stitching them together
for a 360 degree view the data is
encoded with GPS coordinates so far the
company has captured 40,000 miles we're
keeping our cell phones longer these
days maybe because we like them or we
just don't feel like selling out for a
new model which brings us to our quick
quiz about how long our customers
keeping their mobile handsets is it 15
and a half months 16 and a half months
17 and a half months or 18 and a half
months take your time and if you said 17
and a half months that's right according
to JD powered associates we're holding
on to our phones 5% longer than the last
survey last year mainly because our
contracts are getting longer so which
handsets we like the best Motorola and
Sanyo
tied for top cell phone satisfaction
finally the beta sure there are lots of
ways to convert that board document into
a PDF but cool wire makes the task as
easy as sending an email just attach
your file to an email and send it to
cool wire and get on with your work day
a few seconds later your PDF is emailed
right back at you ready to go cool wire
doesn't add any water marks or anything
else you wouldn't want on your resume it
handles Word PowerPoint Excel rich text
JPEGs and gifs rich text I like the
sound of that and nothing to buy
download or install that's enough to
make me a convert consider yourself all
cued up I'm richest a mural with seen at
TV in new york city and i only use real
sugar in my coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
