in San Francisco and today I'm taking
the first look at the sony Morpheus well
actually not the first look is actually
my second time seeing this I saw it last
year at GDC but you know Sony has made
some improvements since then is it
something you should be excited about
well I'm gonna answer that right now so
Sony has made some improvements to the
Morpheus it's a little bit more
comfortable you can adjust the visor to
like kind of pull away from your eyes
which is I really appreciate it even
having it on it was just kind of soft on
my face so it wasn't that uncomfortable
it's still a 5.7 inch screen but now
instead of being LCD it's an OLED screen
I would say the graphics they're running
at 1080p but the graphics aren't that
impressive they're a little bit Jaggi
and look maybe not PlayStation 4 quality
maybe PlayStation 3 quality this is my
opinion the demos that I saw saw two
demos one of them you know you're just
in this kind of futuristic kind of
cartoonish kind of world you can kind of
shine the light emanating from your
controller on these robust and they
interact they kind of they kind of close
our eyes when you're trying to light
them that was kind of cool you know it
made for a kind of a good demo for the
uninitiated for people who don't know
what VR is the one that I really like
however was a demo called London heist
so basically you start off you're in
this kind of warehouse you're being
interrogated by this really tough guy in
a in a tank top he's about to probably
do some really bad stuff to you and
you're using the move controller so you
have a move controller in each hand you
have a trigger for each hand and it was
actually really immersive there was a
few times where the guy kind of gestured
towards me the virtual guy in the world
kind of gestured towards me and I have
to say I flinched a little bit you know
that might be it's a little bit
embarrassing but I did it was it was
that immersive there was definitely a
sense of tension that I felt when I was
playing that game well it's a demo and
not necessarily a game hopefully it is a
game hopefully it's something that you
know
can kind of kind of inform Sony and and
other developers and how VR games should
be made because you know I didn't have
to move around that much there was no
danger of me tripping over a bunch of
things it was just in this kind of like
very small location that I could kind of
interact with Tessa Sony Morpheus those
are my impressions sony is we're gonna
release this in 2016 s for the
PlayStation 4 there's no price yet but
they do say to look forward to e3 for
more information so I'll definitely be
looking forward to that I'm Eric
Franklin at GDC in San Francisco and
this has been a first look at the Sony
Morpheus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
