from town legit now tough because it
well it's tough for example you can put
it in three feet of water for some 30
minutes it will still work fine well
check it out but most importantly is
really fast in my testing this one
terabyte SSD version here as a sustain
will will copy speed up some 460
megabyte per second the fastest ever
seen for a single ball on portable drive
in fact is so fast that you might just
want to trust in the error excitement I
do it and guess what is survived as it
turned out this thing can withstand
repeated drop for my height and I'm
quite totally but when city so that's
impressive
now the drive has an USB C port here so
we've been what whatever computer that
has a ton about three or s pc port and
by right away i mean if you have a mac
because if you use a Windows computer
you will have to first reformat it which
take a few seconds it also comes with a
second USB cable here for it to work
with all existing computer including
those would you speed 2.0 and by the way
this outer casing here is removable so
if you want to chair to a different one
of different color to miss your test you
can do that too so basically this is a
great purple drive so question is how
much does it cost
well it's not cheap this SSD version
here costs five hundred dollars for one
and terabyte
but if you can live with slower speed
you can also offer this two terabyte
hard drive version that go for $180 and
don't get me wrong this one it's not
super slow it has a sustain copies 340
megabyte per second too bad both of them
share the same toughness
so here the deal you should always
handle your data would care and if you
do that the top dry is kind of overkill
for it but you cannot do that like to
work in a rough and dirty environment or
you can't afford anger measurement like
my good friend behind the camera here
this drive is great for you and I mean
it here dream take them both
Wow and tell your wife she's welcome and
for everybody else I'm dumb no and this
is the tough purple drive from candy gee
what's wrong with you anyway I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
