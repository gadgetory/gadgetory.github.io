charlie cooper and i'm here with my
colleague from cnet news com josh
lowensohn it's been called the trial the
patent trial of the century which given
the fact we're only twelve years into
the century might be a little bit of
Silicon Valley hype but it's apple vs
samsung and you've been following it now
Josh for the what will be the first two
weeks of scheduled four-week trial more
or less correct and it's too early to
say who's ahead on points but do you
have a feel for what's been the biggest
surprise to date sure so far it's really
just been this avalanche of evidence
that Apple's unveiled a wolf on their
part and on samsung and that includes
internal product designs and really
points that that samsung was looking at
Apple devices to kind of feel what it
wanted to do with the next up two or
three phones that they're working on and
Samsung's just to recap Samsung is
defending itself from charges apple
claims that Samsung basically ripped off
their ideas to produce their I their
iPhone knock off to their smartphones
and their tablets and of course this is
going to be going to a jury we're not
talking about a judge it's a jury these
old layman who presumably aren't experts
in the ins and outs of Technology when
you folks are sitting there watching the
jury listened to testimony you have a
feel as to whether or not they really
getting it I think the arguments they
understand or that Apple thinks that
Samsung copied technology that includes
early iPhone and early iPad designs at
the thing I don't think juries get are
the real nitty-gritty parts of patent
law things like whether designs look
alike or whether you get this look and
feel on devices and how far the law
protects that those are really
complicated matters that are very
suffocating out with simple terms what's
Apple's basic argument they just saying
look here is design a and here's their
design you can see the difference that's
exactly how they're doing it they're
basically taking Samsung's devices
before the iPhone the iPad and showing
afterwards and just trying to paint this
picture that without the iPhone the iPad
these could have never had
it okay and as far as for the boys and
girls in the press box and the bloggers
give us a sense of what it's like to
watch the proceedings are they buying
the arguments of one side versus the
other or are they treating it all as
well it's all a bunch of baloney well
the beginning of the trial is really
exciting because Apple brought up these
really kind of super strong witnesses
they brought out people in charge of the
creation the iphone they brought in
markers they brought in designers it's
really kind of shifting more towards a
patent trial now to where we're getting
and sort of the really depths of the
argument for the the jury they've
actually they were almost worn to get
some caffeine the other day because they
were kind of falling asleep I mean it's
getting really complicated this is the
stage of the trial where your eyes roll
in the back of your head exactly with
another couple of weeks left in the
trial what should we look forward to we
really can expect that Samsung is going
to attack back so far the trials really
been Apple attacking them with a bunch
of evidence and a bunch of expert
witnesses and Samsung has played defense
as much as they can they really get to
hey more after apple with a couple of
their own patents and a couple of their
own arguments that they haven't really
had the chance to articulate in full
good stuff will be looking forward to
your reports thanks Josh for cnet's
