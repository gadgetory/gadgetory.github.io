computing voting is a rare hold out
which unlike banking and shopping hasn't
migrated to the Internet some say it's
only a matter of time before all
Americans cast ballots online we're
seeing it in other parts of the world
Estonia is allowing citizens to vote
online and states are starting to
experiment with voting online unions are
allowing their members to vote online
the technology is getting smarter the
security is getting better besides the
potential benefits including increased
efficiency greater ballot counting
accuracy and higher voter turnout voting
technology could improve civic
engagement but online voting must first
overcome very valid concerns how do you
prevent hacking and fraud someone takes
money out of your bank and the banks at
full will put the money back in I mean
banks haven't have insurance or self
insure they have processes in place but
if an election is hacked we don't really
have a way to undo it while we may not
be voting online anytime soon there are
ways technology is changing the voting
experienced my fair election calm lets
you report on conditions at your polling
location like irregularities or broken
machines at turbo vote calm you can
register to vote and receive reminders
via text or email on Election Day it
will take more than sophisticated
security software and clever apps to
change a centuries-old voting process
but greater voting engagement is a big
win no matter what your political
leanings in San Francisco I'm Sumi das
