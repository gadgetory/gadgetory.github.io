seen at top five some of the most
popular episodes have been the most
boring too right actually not much you
can do to jazz up a list of Android
phones likewise my favorite episodes
personally rarely got the love they
deserve so as I say goodbye to my time
here at cnet I'm leaving with my
personal list of my top five top fives
starting off at number five top five
signs Tech has made you dumb how ironic
that the widespread use of smartphones
has seemingly lowered our collective
intelligence take the thing away I can't
spell I can't find my way around and i
can't remember anyone's phone number and
you just wait until we have smart homes
and real smart cars our children will be
idiots it's probably what our parents
said about us at number four the top
five sci-fi inventions you really don't
want clumsy title sunk this one but I
still stand by the concept can you
imagine what the world would be like if
any moron could just buy a working
lightsaber at walmart you bloodbath I'll
select this video because I got to call
the Star Trek holodeck an interactive
masturbatorium so someone let my parents
know that English toffee wasn't for
nothing at number three the top five
worst things about Facebook the irony of
smartphones making a stupid wasn't bad
enough he's seen how much this one
social network turn us into a bunch of
voyeuristic self-absorbed shut-ins my
video felt less like a top 5 and more
like a public service announcement but
it was cathartic and it did well on
Facebook number two on my list of
favorite top fives top five phones with
the highest radiation now this one
sounds like it would be a PSA but it was
really just a solid platform for jokes
about phones of radiating your junk I'm
not sure what the tolerable limit is for
gonna add jokes but I'm pretty sure this
video set the bar so let that be my
legacy better yet if I can leave you
with just one top 5 video that really
came from the deepest depths of my nerd
heart at number one top 5 ways to watch
Star Wars
especially relevant this year now that
we're building up to Episode seven I've
got five different movie viewing order
strategies for the original trilogy and
the prequels so if you're thinking about
starting your movie marathon with the
godforsaken episode one please take a
minute to view this video quite possibly
the pinnacle achievement of my eight
years here at seen it so there you go my
five most beloved top fives it's been a
fun ride and I want to give a huge
thanks to my producer Sarah Harvin
without whom this show just wouldn't
have been funny at all and a tip of the
hat to Brian Cooley and Tom Merritt the
master craftsman of shows about lists of
five things my friend Ayad Akhtar will
be taking over the show so I leave you
in good hands and you can keep up with
me on Twitter I'm at Donald and as
always thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
