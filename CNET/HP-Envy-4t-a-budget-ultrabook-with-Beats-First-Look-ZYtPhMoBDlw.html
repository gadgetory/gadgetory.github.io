for a laptop this time of year one word
comes to mind Ultrabook ultra book ultra
book if you haven't heard it already
you're seeing tons of laptops showing up
now in the thin and even affordable
space trying to sell you an interesting
package that's portable and maybe even
affordable and one of the ones that
comes to mind right now is the HP Envy
now the HP Envy was a top-of-the-line
brand before in the HP laptop spectrum
now it applies to a more mid-range set
of laptops the HP Envy for Ultrabook and
there's also a 15 inch model and then
making this a little more confusing
you've got the sleek books which are AMD
powered laptops and sometimes even HP's
website didn't seem to quite get it
right I think this is called the sleek
book when I look for it last
nevertheless what the ultra book term
means is that there is an Intel
processor inside and sleek book means
AMD which generally means more
affordable and we did review a sleek
book on our site a $5.99 model very
affordable for what it contained inside
in a 15.6 inch screen size this is a 14
inch screen size it's selling in Best
Buy in a retail configuration or 679 now
for an Intel powered ultra book that's
really good but you have to consider
what it contains here there's a core i3
processor from last year it's an older
processor that's showing up on a few
models you're starting to see that on
some of these budget models including
the Asus Zenbook ux301 you get in here
is still pretty good value you got a 500
gigabyte hard drive four gigs of RAM
that's basically all you need plus the
core i3 processor does pretty well but
it's more equivalent to that AMD
processor than to some of those faster
core i5s from this year that you start
to see all over the place in a lot of
ultrabooks and the MacBook Air now
you're also getting a thicker slightly
heavier ultrabook here there's a 14 inch
is a slightly different size weight in
fact it looks a lot like other HP
laptops now this has an Ethernet port
this has an SD card slot USB 3.0 and a
really good battery life of about 6
hours but
a lot of other ultrabooks have that too
so that's not quite as unique and when
you consider that this has Intel HP 3000
graphics not 4000 which is the newer one
games really don't play well in this at
all so don't rely on it for that but if
you're looking for an all-around laptop
and you want to get under $700 you may
want to take a look at this just
consider that you can configure a
variety of other options and get
yourself a little bit faster if you want
or drop down to an even more affordable
price with the AMD processor another
feature on the HP Envy that makes it a
little bit unique is Beats Audio
although Beats Audio shows up on most HP
products at this point in this instance
it's a speaker bar that's up above the
keyboard that pumps out supposedly
better quality sound I think it's better
in an equaliser forum for headphones
than in the speaker bar which is loud
but not the best speaker quality that
I've ever heard hopefully that gives you
a little bit of a clearer idea of what
the budget landscape looks like right
now and a pretty good budget choice in
the HP Envy for 10:15 DX that's the
configuration model for this I'm Scott
Stein and that's a look at this
particular HP Envy for Ultrabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
