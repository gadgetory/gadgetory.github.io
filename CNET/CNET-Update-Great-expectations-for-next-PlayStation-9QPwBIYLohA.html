gaming I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update it's likely will soon
get a first look at the PlayStation 4 on
Wednesday during an event that Sony is
hosting in New York the buzz is that
it'll have new plane options but what
could that mean Sony could push the idea
of multi-screen plane options such as
incorporating the screen of a Vita
tablet or smartphone it will also be
interesting if Sony is going to do
anything to build upon the idea that the
game console is the center of your
living room entertainment perhaps we'll
see some sort of new TV watching or
recording option and there might be a
different controller gaming site
destructoid posted an image of what is
rumored to be the new controller with a
touchscreen but reports are saying this
is just a prototype it's interesting
that Sony is unveiling this so early and
that it could come out by this holiday
that's unheard of in the gaming world
where it takes more than a year for a
system to hit stores after its first
unveiled this could be a major holiday
for gaming because it also seems likely
that the next xbox will be revealed soon
skype has a new feature that lets you
leave a video message for a friend that
is busy or offline the feature is still
in beta so it could be buggy but it's
available for users in the US and UK
this option is in the recent software
update for the app on Android iOS and on
max Windows users can still receive
video messages but they appear as a link
the new search feature on face book
called graph search will filter the
results if you're searching for
information about minors Facebook is
taking preventive measures to make sure
they don't run into issues about a
child's privacy teenagers won't have
info displayed about their location or
age and other miners will only see the
search results of their friends and
friends of friends Twitter will soon be
judging if your tweets are important or
not the site's programmers are adding
code that will note a tweet is having a
value of none low medium and eventually
high value the idea is that search
results can filter out tweets that have
more influence because of more followers
or retweets although there are a high
volume of tweets it sure doesn't seem
right for a company to fill
tweet because they don't think it has
value remember the app bump well we got
our high back on it because a new update
added new ways to move files between
iPhones Android phones and any computer
a file transfer can now be sent in any
direction phone to computer or computer
to phone and it includes any kind of
file or multiple files you just have to
make sure the data is less than 30
megabytes who needs a thumb drive if you
could just use your smartphone that's
your tech news update you can find more
