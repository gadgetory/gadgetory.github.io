Sumi das joining me as senior editor
brian Tong BTW thanks cooking with us
always always alright so as i said on
twitter this morning let the hype
commence Apple has sent out invites for
an event on March ninth we can give you
the facts that's the date yeah the venue
is a place here in San Francisco the
yerba buena center for the arts yep and
they've done events there before they
have and we can tell you what the invite
said which was just simply spring
forward and we know apples really clever
about these things where they like to
try to be clever right really what this
points to is that on Sunday daylight
savings everyone is moving their clock
forward spring forward a function of
lime you say their clocks or their
watches or whatever they got it's a
function of time you know me I don't
know I mean what have they been working
on and that is a function of time maybe
this Apple watch could be so obviously
we're expecting to see that in addition
to that we know that Apple is a
marketing machine of a hemat if you look
historically what they've done in the
past the ipad when it first came out
they let everyone know that they were
gonna have an apple announcement right
after CES the very first ipad well guess
what they're doing now Mobile World
Congress this is the showcase for
samsung samsung geh the other phone
makers were makers and smart watch
makers right there we're expecting to
see so sorry Samsung's gonna have a yes
which apples dropping another bomb on
them saying hey guess so everyone you
might be talking about these things but
we know what you really want to see
apples watch on March 10 nights so cuz
they're not gonna be out of the world
they were lucky they will not be there
people and arson are gonna be talking
yeah and they'll be buzzing about it so
on the the date is very strategic it's
apples way all right so we first heard
about the Apple watch back in September
right the last big apple event and we
didn't really find out a whole lot about
it there's still a lot of lingering
questions what's the information that we
can hope to find out on March night I
think the biggest piece of information
that every once everyone wants to know
is how much will the athlon see now they
intimated that the starting price will
be 349 this is without any band
accessory but let's talk about the 18
carat gold watch people estimating this
thing could be anywhere easily over a
thousand dollars people
walking five thousand maybe if you add
another one of their specialized straps
with more 18 karat gold in there right
we're talking about a very high-end
luxury product there's been talks about
how they're installing specific safes at
the stores to store these watches it's
gonna be a very specific stuff yeah so I
think that everyone wants to know how
much the price is gonna be I want to
know what the mid-range price that the
middle tier one is gonna be I'm hoping
it's around 500 they might even push a
little higher because it's Apple we
don't know you were saying what 700 ish
maybe if they think it's gonna go as
high as 700 if you've got gold in there
if you've got some diamond ills I think
I think that gold one's gonna be a
thousand minimum yeah I think they're
gonna really try and push this as a
high-end luxury product and let's not
forget they're probably gonna release a
new one in about a year and a half or
two right right this one is dependent on
the phone yeah we want one that's
completely in the phone in the future
right you don't have to take your phone
with you you can just go for a run or
with your thousand that's what other
manufacturers are doing right now right
any other features that we are hoping to
see that we are were sort of question
marks when we first heard about it yeah
well Apple has never really showcased
fully what this watch is capable of
doing there we can hint dropped there
was a hint right Tim Cook was out in
Europe and he talked about how he wears
it every day even in the shower now
that's all the details I need to know
right but it is one of the points is
that this will be a truly waterproof
device that at least you can wear like
that much like some of the fitness
devices yeah other things that we've
heard but have never been displayed or
shown off is the fact that this apple
watch will be able to work with your
Apple TV you'll be able to control it
that way there's a rumblings of a
walkie-talkie like feature that Apple
has never shown off maybe little truly
like a Dick Tracy type feature right and
we know that there's gonna be a lot of
app makers that they're going to
showcase some of these apps they're
gonna use the phones in ways that Apple
hasn't even intended on doing watch is
definite and or not yes like a
ninety-nine point nine point nine nine
nine point nine but there could be some
other products that they unveil as well
and what are the suspicions that we have
we've been waiting for this rumor
12-inch MacBook Air with a Retina
Display this has been a product talked
about for over a year easily but also we
might see refreshes to the macbook air
line as a whole okay um I don't know if
we're gonna see full on macbook pro
lines yet sometimes I save that
like a July August time period but at
the very least we will see something in
the mac line getting announced I heard
something about an ipad pro what do you
think about that rumor I think if they
do an iPad pro there's gonna be a
separate event alright well we've got a
lot of questions and we will have
answers for you when we raised a lot of
questions they're still too you know
exactly so just log on to cnet on March
ninth and we'll have full coverage of
the apple event BTW thanks for being
honest i should say your name officially
right tong senior editor of cnet thank
you for a silly for inside scoop I'm
