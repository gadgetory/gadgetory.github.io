on today's show an insectoid robot
inspired by desert ants demonstrates a
new kind of robotic navigation
researchers at Purdue University have
developed a new way to turn plastics
into fuel and finally we talked about
how deep mines new Alpha star became the
first artificial intelligence entity to
master Starcraft 2 let's get into it
and bots might sound like the title of a
sci-fi Channel original movie but
they're real and they're changing how
robots get around researchers drew
inspiration from desert ants these
resilient insects can't rely on
pheromones to find their way home like
other ant species can due to the extreme
temperatures in their environment
instead they rely on step counting and
observing polarized light from the sky
to orient themselves these evolutionary
miracles have led researchers to robotic
innovations in the form of ant by ant
bot uses a new kind of optical compass
made up of two pixels covered with
polarized filters to orient itself the
compass turns mechanically to be able to
observe more light with less pixels
drastically reducing production costs
with this optical compass the ant BOTS
can measure its heading to within point
four degrees of precision even in cloudy
weather these new navigation
technologies have clear applications in
the automobile and aviation industries
though ant BOTS developers say the next
step is to get it operating at night and
over longer distances plastic or
permanent garbage as I like to call it
is everywhere all the time and the vast
majority of it is never recycled the
World Economic Forum has predicted that
if we don't change how we use and
dispose of plastic there will be more
plastic waste than fish in the world's
oceans by the year 2050 thankfully a
team of researchers at Purdue University
has a new solution for making use of our
permanent garbage the process works for
number two and number four type plastics
these numbers can be found inside the
little recycling triangle on the bottom
of plastic goods
the plastics are converted into pellets
which are then dissolved into a solution
via exposure to heat and pressure in
this state the plastic materials could
be converted into fuel or other useful
products researchers say that the clean
fuels generated by this process could
someday satisfy up to four percent of
the demand for gasoline or diesel fuels
when we last checked in with deepmind
technologies the artificial intelligence
company owned by google's alphabet
conglomerate it's AI had mastered
classic board games and now it's
mastered Starcraft 2 Starcraft 2 emerged
as a natural next step for deep minds AI
development since the game is played in
real time with imperfect information
these new challenges required a new
method of learning to master chess alpha
zero played itself to master Starcraft
alpha star played versions of itself a
process deepmind calls the alpha star
League deep mine brought in top tier
Starcraft 2 players to challenge alpha
star and alpha star beat both of them 5
times in a row though alpha star was
eventually beaten during an exhibition
game at Blizzard it was very stubborn
wasn't it like you did it really didn't
want to leave like the game was over for
a long time as deep Minds AI learns to
master more complex games it gets better
at long-term planning risk management
distribution of resources and other
problem-solving skills
deep mines eventual goal is to someday
craft an AI capable of solving the
biggest problems facing our world today
and mastering Starcraft 2 is another
stepping stone in the right direction
