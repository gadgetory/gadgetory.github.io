tech in your home right now is your
Wi-Fi router there's nothing fun about
buying a new one and setting them up can
be a real pain but if you think about it
every gadget in your house relies on
your router in order to get online
tablet your laptop your smartphone your
TV it's only gonna get worse so help you
out here are five of the best values and
home Wi-Fi routers all price under $100
and selected by CNET networking guru and
all-around sexy guy don't know starting
off at number 5 the links is e 1200
priced around $50 this guy gets high
marks for simplicity and understated
design it supports 802 11 n it gives you
basic wired networking options on the
back it's not the fastest thing out
there nor does it have great range but
it's a good simple choice for a small
office or an apartment at number 4 the
dealing dir 605 L cloud router hard not
to love this little guy especially with
a price around $30 $30 now you can
imagine for that price is fairly bare
boned single band no guest network no
Gigabit Ethernet but it does have this
one cool trick this guy comes with a
mobile app that lets you set up and
manage it remotely you can even reset it
from the app no more getting on the
ground and yanking out the power supply
and cursing and sneezing from the dust
and hitting your head on the cupboard on
the way back up not that that ever
happens to me but I could imagine for a
more robust option you can try number
three the neck gear our 6100 comes in
right under $100 but this is the newest
router on this list the net gear made
its debut last September and supports
802 11 AC in fact it's the only router
we'd recommend under $100 that can say
that no Gigabit Ethernet but it's fast
attractive easy to set up and as plenty
of bells and whistles one of the coolest
ones being a USB port that allows you to
connect a hard drive and stream media
anywhere in your network the whole
package is enough
to make your current router leap but to
really rub it in try number two the
d-link HD media router 1000 now I know
what you're thinking you're thinking
Donald is there an HD media router 3000
because that sounds considerably more
badass than 1000 well yes there is and
it cost $180 this guy currently on
Amazon for $30 that might be a momentary
fluke but if you can smash this thing up
for under $100 you're in good shape
you get Gigabit Ethernet ipv6 support
guest networking and even an SD card
slot Plus this in HD somehow but if you
had to press our C net labs Manager and
networking expert Domo on the number one
Wi-Fi router to buy under $100 he'll say
the asou are TN 56 you price right
around $90 this router delivers that
gigabit ethernet connection dual bands
great range fast speed and an intuitive
web interface for setting the whole
thing up and managing it also you get
that USB port the less you connect the
hard drive and share the whole thing
over your network and it's pretty just
saying it's pretty so there you go five
routers for under $100 that are a great
value and a worthy replacement for that
clunker you're using now for more
recommendations including the best 802
11 AC routers head over to C Netcom
slash and for more top 5s from me
top 5 C Netcom Donnell bail thanks for
