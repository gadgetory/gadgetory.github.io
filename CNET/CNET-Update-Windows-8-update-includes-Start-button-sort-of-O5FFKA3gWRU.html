of I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update ever since windows 8 came
out with its new interface users have
cried out that they missed the classic
start button so Microsoft answered with
a few tweaks to an update to Windows
that's coming out later this year
windows 8.1 will not have the true start
button but if you're in the desktop mode
there will be a little start icon on the
bottom left corner that'll take you to
the menu of tiles it's still not the
familiar Start menu but it's something
and there are few other perks coming
users will be able to have the desktop
mode load right when you start the
computer there will be the option to
save files directly to the SkyDrive
online storage and you can better
customize the Start screen background
samsung has unveiled the smaller version
of the galaxy s4 smartphone called the
galaxy s4 mini and it's for people who
want to save a few bucks and save some
pocket space since the 5-inch screen of
the s4 can feel big to some people this
mini version has a 4.3 inch screen you
can do the same things on this phone but
the hardware specs are a slight step
down like a 8 megapixel camera instead
of a 13 megapixel camera we don't know
how much this will cost yet or when will
be on sale but you know galaxy products
are always hot we'll probably know more
about this phone later in june apple is
selling a new cheaper version of the
ipod touch on its website this new
version is two hundred and thirty
dollars saving a 70 bucks but it doesn't
come in those bright colors it's cheaper
because it has half the memory at 16
gigs and it doesn't have a camera on the
back but you can still get the camera on
the front google's voice search is
getting smarter as the days go by and
now Google's adding the option to ask
nutrition questions from your google
search app on your phone or on your
desktop using the latest version of the
Chrome browser so if you're on a strict
diet you can pull out your phone to
quickly ask questions like how many
carbs are in corn or how many calories
are in popcorn linkedin is getting into
the photo sharing game now the business
focus social network is allowing members
to
post status updates with images
documents and videos from other sites
and the traffic app waze has updated its
apps to give you quick directions to
your Facebook events if you sign into
the app with Facebook it can give you a
route to any event that you've rsvp'd
yes to on Facebook the app specializes
in telling drivers about traffic and
hazards and let you know where your
friends are if you're both using the app
