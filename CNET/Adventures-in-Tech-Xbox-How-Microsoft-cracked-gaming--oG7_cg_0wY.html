become responsible for halo adventures
in tech explains how Microsoft found its
cool and created the very first Xbox
no one expected Microsoft to reshape the
world of video games for starters it
wasn't the kind of company that made
awesome games machines it was the kind
of company that hired the cast of
friends to make ill-advised Windows 95
promos anyway when Bill Gates revealed
plans to build a console we all enjoyed
a good chuckle but while Microsoft had
no experience making consoles
I knew more about gaming than many of us
assumed several years earlier Microsoft
had forged Direct X a series of tools
for building games for Windows
developers were already used to using
these tools thanks in no small part to
Bill Gates himself extolling their
virtues from inside a game of Doom's
these games were getting really
realistic DirectX had already made a
console appearance as part of a Windows
CE eversion that Microsoft built for the
Dreamcast in the end though it was only
used by handful of games something more
drastic was required for members of the
DirectX team built a prototype console
and pitched the direct Xbox to
Microsoft's head freeze the project took
off with a shorter name and a few years
later we got our first look at the Xbox
which was shown off looking like a
massive silver X it's a good job they
changed it because that design would
have made for a problematic sequel
Microsoft built the Xbox on Windows
cutting down development time by using
off-the-shelf or barely modified PC
components like its Intel Pentium 3
processor it was the first console to
come with a built-in hard drive and even
had its own Ethernet port it was
powerful to Microsoft boasted its system
was more than three times as graphically
capable as the ps2 pushing 300 million
polygons per second hardware was only
half the battle
gamers wanted games as such Microsoft
invested some of its cash in a title
that would become a global phenomenon
developed by Bungie Studios halo was
first shown off in 1999 by Apple Steve
Jobs and was intended to run on Mac and
Windows when Microsoft bought Bungie
halo became an exclusive Xbox launch
title one that hit a million sales in
just four months that incredible success
was replicated in 2004 with Halo 2 which
provided a perfect launch pad for the
Xbox Live online service halo 2 became
the fastest selling media product ever
making 125 million dollars in 24 hours
just in the US and leaving Sony
scrambling to think of a blockbuster
shooter of its own
Microsoft drafted the ailing Sega to
publish a slew of games for the Xbox
also nabbing some neat exclusives over
the years the system would play host to
plenty of great games and by the time
the Xbox 360 was out sales of the
original had hit 24 million units the
Xbox wasn't perfect it had the world's
chunky ax stroller and by the time the
360 took over the ps2 had outsold it by
roughly four to one that didn't matter
though because Microsoft had managed
what nobody thought possible
establishing a foothold on the mighty
mountain of console gaming perhaps
Microsoft's greatest trick was not
overthinking it they made a console that
was basically a PC in a box and ensured
it had plenty of great games today the
Xbox one has Kinect TV integration and
much more but you have to wonder whether
Microsoft has lost sight of the simple
principles that made its first console
such a success did you own an original
Xbox and what do you think of
Microsoft's gaming powers today let me
know and check back next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
