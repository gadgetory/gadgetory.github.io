racing team it is a one hundred percent
solar-powered race car it has a top
speed of about seventy eight miles an
hour although the team tells me that
they won't go that fast again it's
usually driven right around 30 miles per
hour and even that is a little faster
than I was willing to go okay all my
favorite part helmet time I'm part of
the team all right okay whoa okay no
problem this is awesome this is a
perfect okay that's on okay the sun is
shining I'm shoved in here like a
sausage and strapped in and then they're
gonna close the lid and I'm off
okay here we go
there now we go now we're talking
here we go over shifted gears
this is awesome I feel like I'm doing so
bad
in the future cars will obviously need
to be more energy efficient I'm probably
going like 15 miles an hour we're
already seeing more efficient cars today
like electric vehicles and maybe solar
could make those electric vehicles even
more efficient
let's get her all right I'm ready to be
freed how was it and it's pretty great
actually okay it's okay let go kart a
mini cooper s no problem alright alright
ratings whoa I've forgotten what it
feels like to have full range of motion
no it's that is actually that's a blast
it's really fun yeah it handles like a
dream it does we were racing it on a
track and it can take corners better
than real cars it's really surprisingly
responsive yeah so where's all this
research headed into actual street cars
this technology you could apply directly
to something like a Tesla Roadster you
could panel the top of the vehicle with
solar panels and then that would give
you an extra boost in range so you would
be able to go another three four hundred
miles on a charge later this summer the
cal team will take this car on a
three-day track race against other
schools the goal of the race to see who
lasts the longest then they'll follow it
up with an 1800 mile road trip these
races are an experiment in green tech
they're testing the limits of what a
solar car can do so tell me what's going
on with this car what is it what are the
specs here so it starts with the solar
array which is off right now so we can
look at the car and then the solar array
comes into that box right there okay and
so this box is the power trackers and so
that takes the energy from the Sun and
converts it into electrical energy that
we can use at the right voltage and
power and that's just standard solar
energy collection that everyone's pretty
familiar with yeah that's fairly
familiar from that it goes into our
battery box so if we look in here all
these white strips are our batteries
give us a total power of 44 amp hours
and so that will run us about three
hours into the night with no electrical
power from the Sun and what kind of
batteries are there these are with you
my own cells okay and so that goes
directly into this box right down here
this is the motor controller ok so our
motor is actually a three-phase 1.6
horsepower motor as an electric motor
that is actually in the wheel right back
there 1.6 horsepower yep that doesn't
sound very racecar it doesn't sound
right race car but
fine for us we're built for efficiency
right and so the lower horsepower means
that we can go with a lot less power
it's not so bad it's hotter than blazes
in here
a Tesla Roadster without the range
anxiety nice actually once i get to 10
or 12 miles an hour count me in driving
around on a lawnmower it's like a riding
lawnmower
except powered by the Sun a riding
lawnmower powered by the Sun this thing
looks freaking
