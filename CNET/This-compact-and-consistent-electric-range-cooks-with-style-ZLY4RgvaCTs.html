appliances and right now we're taking a
first look at the Frigidaire Gallery 30
inch electric range the first thing
you're going to notice about the gallery
30 inch is that it has a very handsome
looking stainless steel finish you also
have that on the handle itself on the
front of the door and you also have a
nice sturdy handle on the bottom where
the warmer tray is there's also a very
nice looking badge right there that
gives the whole stove and oven a
professional look opening up the 5.5
cubic foot oven you're going to see that
there is a hidden baking element that's
a nice touch because that will prevent
excess oil or other debris from hitting
an exposed element and causing lots of
smoke also nice is that the oven has a
self-cleaning mode you can set that for
three hours or as short as two hours
looking at the cooktop you've got four
main burners you've got two small as
well as a quick boil special burner to
boil your water and other sauces faster
they also have a large burner for bigger
pots to be clear though at this price
you're not going to get a true
convection of it another thing i don't
like about this particular range is that
the panels are located on the back that
makes it a little tricky to actually
manipulate if you have to you know reach
over the burners it can be a little
dangerous I also don't like how these
dials here are kind of flimsy feeling
they're made out of plastic and they
actually feel a little loose so I'm
afraid they might even pop off you crank
them too hard or twist them with a
little too much force another let down
to is that the preheat mode doesn't
actually display the temperature that
you are currently at so you don't know
how long you have until the oven is
fully preheated for nine hundred dollars
the Frigidaire Gallery 30 inch electric
range certainly doesn't come cheap but
it does offer a lot of style in a very
compact package I'm Brian Bennett for
seen it appliances be sure to check out
my review of this
oven as well as other ranges at cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
