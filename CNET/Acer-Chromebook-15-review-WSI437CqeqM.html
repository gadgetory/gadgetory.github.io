with perfect pricing starting at 399
dollars it's a decent performer that
packs a 15.6 inch touchscreen
loudspeakers Blog battery life and a
relatively slim and lightweight design
especially for a large budget laptop it
has a stylish aluminum lid and metal
chassis with thick silver bezels that
resemble a MacBook the backlit keyboard
is comfortable to type on and the
touchpad is silky smooth with chamfered
edges to match the rest of the laptops
design it definitely looks more
expensive than it is running Chrome OS
the Acer Chromebook was built for using
Google's cloud-based apps like Gmail
Google Docs and Chrome browser
it also has access to the Google Play
Store that means you can download apps
like on an Android device so instead of
just using the laptop for browsing the
web checking email and streaming video
you can post to Instagram download video
for offline watching using the Netflix
app or download games to play when there
isn't a Wi-Fi network available the 15.6
inch screen has a full 1080p HD
resolution that's nice and sharp
although a little dull in color
saturation viewing angles are solid in
the laptops 180 degree hinge helped
achieve an optimal viewing angle there
are two speakers located on the left and
right edges of the keyboard they're
surprisingly loud and crisp and easily
fill a room however like most laptop
speakers they lack bass since the
laptops big screen and loud speakers
make it great for watching video it's
unfortunate that the laptop doesn't have
a 360 degree hinge that would allow it
to prop up like a tent or flip the
keyboard over as a stand for a better
viewing angle the Acer Chromebook 15s
performance was as expected based on its
internal specs it smoothly handled many
open chrome tabs and a few apps open in
the background before it started to slow
down
battery life was impressive lasting an
entire workday on a full charge in
battery testing looping a 720p video it
lasted 13 hours and 45 minutes if you're
interested in buying a Chromebook with a
big screen you don't have a large
variety to choose from thankfully the
Acer Chromebook 15 is an excellent value
for the casual user making it a very
easy choice to make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
