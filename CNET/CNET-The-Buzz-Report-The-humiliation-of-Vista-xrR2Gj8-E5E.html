buzz report this week trouble in
electric carlin net neutrality
blockbusters crazy business plan and
there's no time for the gouge of the
week because I've got a new segment
coming up with Brian Cooley but first
some headlines Tesla Motors which has
finally started commercial production on
the electric cars we've been waiting for
for like three years is suing Fisker
Automotive for stealing trade secrets
and design ideas and introducing a
competing vehicle in response Fisker
said hey let's be honest who you thought
Tesla was ever actually gonna put out a
car so ants the incoming CEO of Virgin
Media Neal Birkin recently announced
that net neutrality is a load of let's
say hooey and that he totally plans to
tear his internet service and anybody
who wants their content delivered to
users in a speedy and efficient way
better pony up or else they're gonna end
up in the bus lane wait he said that
bustling huh you must not live around
here because on my freeways the bus only
lane is cruising and they don't stop for
tolls either
I guess he understands the highway
system about as well as he understands
the Internet let's take a quick look at
what's clogged in the tubes
an internal Microsoft sales video hit
the web hard this week featuring the
most embarrassing fake music video
you've ever seen in your life
Microsoft sales team brats and we're
gonna keep rocking with SP and in the
big news of the week struggling movie
rental giant blockbuster made an offer
to buy struggling retailers Circuit City
because blockbuster things that can
build a set-top box that will deliver
movies on demand and then that plus a
new TV bought at Circuit City will
combine for a killer 18 billion dollar
company no word yet on what their plan
is for the millions of you who have TiVo
Apple TV Vudu Xbox 360 a cable company
that provides movies on demand or just a
computer that you stream Netflix movies
on or all the rest of you who just don't
want another stupid box on the shelf or
what Circuit City is gonna do with all
the merchandise that they have that
isn't a TV that they haven't really been
selling very much of I think actually
the plan boils down to this - dinosaurs
are much more likely to survive an
asteroid hitting the earth than just one
dinosaur because they can snuggle and
finally I'm pleased to announce a new
segment on the bus report this week what
the hell with Ryan Cooley I recently
started seeing pink unicorns and too
many martinis so I had to quit Facebook
I joined the second most talked-about
social network after it seemed like most
of the grown up fully formed mentally
balanced colleagues of mine were also
doing so I saw it as the perfect middle
ground between the sewer that is my
space and the often dull tool that is
LinkedIn and within hours I was getting
networked news items about my colleagues
trickled into my profile page John
wanted to know if he's like me Jane sent
me a pink unicorn huh done bought me a
martini and Jim was flinging poo at
Debbie and of course they were all
playing Scrabble Asst what the hell is
this
up until Facebook these were normal
interesting working pros I respect it
and enjoy being in contact with but I
thought millions can't be wrong yeah
they can look how many BOTS Chevy Vegas
now they say Facebook connects
as a society no it reminds us that many
of us never really left college we just
graduated so I'm off Facebook if you
need to connect with me buy me a real
martini in a real bar or just ride on
over on your pink unicorn I'm Hollywood
and I am NOT a poof roller thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
