sink phone it's got all the things
including elegant curved sides and a
really precise built-in stylus which you
can use to own that meeting Giada to-do
list bond with teenagers cut down on
smudges express yourself make an
animated gif and tap with more precision
than your fat finger unfortunately the
stylus stinks and playing pokemon go but
I could update spreadsheets and docs
from my lunch break and I'm pretty sure
I saved an entire stack of post-it notes
from meeting their doom not all the
built-in apps students my life but I did
appreciate some of extra since the note
7 already does everything that the s7
edge can do you can set up speed dial
for calls and shortcuts your favorite
app
so that's work/life covered but the node
7 is also great at everyday life I'm
talking about taking pictures and plenty
of storage for all my photos and videos
there's no removable battery but there
is wireless charging if you can't find
your new USBC cable and it lasts pretty
long to more good news both the phone
and the stylus are water-resistant so
don't even sweat those flashing the node
7 is also a looker with those killer
symmetrical curves and despite its large
5.7 inch screen it feels surprisingly
compact even a little bit heavy sounds
pretty good right it is but there's a
big catch and it's called the price
because if you thought that the s7 and
the s7 edge we're expensive then the
note 7 will make your eyes water the
thing is there are other good simple
phones out there for half the notes
price most people don't actually need
the stylus a lot of people won't even
use it but if you really love writing
and drawing by hand and you have the
cash to spare this is a great phone and
there are some cool things that you can
do with it that you just can't do on any
other device I was pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
