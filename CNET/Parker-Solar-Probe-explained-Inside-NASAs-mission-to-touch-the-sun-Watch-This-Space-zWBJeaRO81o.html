probe and it's zooming on its way
towards the Sun what will we learn when
we get there how is it gonna survive the
heat and what does this all have to do
with aurora borealis I'm Claire reilly
welcome to watch this space good evening
from the CNET studios in sydney i'm
claire riley and this is watch this
space the show that tells you everything
on earth you need to know about what's
happening in space and tonight we're
getting up close and personal with
Parker the little probe that's going to
touch the Sun the Parker solar probe is
named after Eugene Parker the
astrophysicist who first developed the
theory of the existence of solar wind
above the size of a small car the probe
is the first human-made object that will
ever pass through the sun's atmosphere
the corona latin for the word crown the
corona wraps around the Sun like a crown
of burning hot plasma kind of like that
seen in Game of Thrones but in space
it's 300 times hotter than the surface
of the Sun and extends millions of miles
above the surface it holds the key to
some of the solar system's biggest
secrets like solar wind and Aurora here
on earth thanks cliff
she's right just like your friend at
every summer barbecue you've ever been
to Parker is heading straight for the
corona the space probe blasted off from
Florida in the early morning of August
12 in front of Eugene Parker himself and
this lady who was super psyched to be
there it's set to shoot past Venus
getting a gravity assist from our
planetary neighbor on the way to make
sure it gets nice and close to the Sun
in November Parker will have its first
solar flyby getting within 15 million
miles of the star but it won't stop
there it's going to pass by the Sun 24
times during its seven-year mission we
have a few more boost from Venus just
for good measure eventually getting
within 3.8 million miles of the star
that's about 4% of the distance between
the Sun and Earth when it does it will
be traveling at four hundred and thirty
thousand miles per hour setting the
record for the fastest ever object
created by humankind sorry Jimmy you
just lost the track mate so what are we
gonna learn when Parker starts
fraternizing with the Sun well it's all
about solar wind and we're not talking
about the kind of wind you get here on
earth
solar-wind describes the charged
particles that are emitted from the
Sun's corona and blasted out into the
solar system on earth the charged
particles that make up solar wind zoom
past us at a million miles an hour
quite literally but we managed to dodge
most of the damage thanks to the Earth's
magnetic field without that field the
solar wind would tear through our
atmosphere and strip away things like
our ozone layer which protects us from
ultraviolet radiation unless of course
you live in Australia where ozone
depletion means you can literally get
sunburned 365 days a year
but we don't miss all the effects of
solar radiation down here on earth
the charged particles that do make it
through our atmosphere a responsible for
natural phenomena like aurora borealis
so next time you're chowing down on a
nice meal of steamed hams and watching
the Northern Lights
you can thank solar wind for that
according to NASA the primary goals of
the Parker mission are to trace how
energy and heat moved through the solar
corona and to explore what accelerates
solar wind and you can't do that from
down here on earth that's why NASA needs
to go partial smashmouth and start
walking near the Sun which means going
right through that corona it's gonna get
toasty in there we're talking 2500
degrees Fahrenheit or almost 1,400
degrees Celsius now Parker is packed
with four main instruments that will
gather data in the corona studying
magnetic and electric fields measuring
particles and imaging the solar wind
itself but these space instruments are
going to need protection when they start
passing through that blazing plasma
crown for that nASA has designed a 4.5
inch thick thermal protection system
made from everyone's favorite material
carbon well more accurately a quote
carbon-carbon composite sandwiching a
lightweight carbon foam core that's a
lot of carbon it's also been sprayed
with a special white coating to help
reflect the sun's energy
thanks to that design nASA says the
front of the shield will be able to
withstand up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit
while the back of the shield will be
able to handle a more temperate 650
degrees so while a trip to the Sun is a
straight-up 10 out of 10 on the Galactic
death scale for us humans Parker is
going to be a-ok which brings us to the
space weather over to you Claire that's
right Claire NASA says that this mission
should help researchers better forecast
space weather events
which can do everything from knocking
out radio communications to harming
astronauts in orbit and even affecting
the power grid which leads us to our
space weather forecast for today Cloudy
with a Chance of plasma it's going to be
a long and intensely hot journey for the
parka Solar Probe but from all of us
here at CNN we wish that little guy as
Sonny expedition safe travels Parker and
take it easy on the Coronas that's it

it happens I'm Claire Riley for CNET
goodnight and Godspeed corona are we
doing are we sponsored by them now okay
alright Oh borealis did somebody say
that they were getting steamed hams for
lunch because I would I would be in on
that Linda's a vegetarian what would she
know I want I want pure steamed hands
you make sure steamed the park of Solar
Probe is named after Peter Parker the
first man to theorize the existence of
the spidey-sense we change that did we
