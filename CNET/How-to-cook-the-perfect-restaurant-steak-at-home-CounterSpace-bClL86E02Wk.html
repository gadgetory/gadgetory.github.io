steak in a bag in a tub of water it
sounds gross but it's actually the most
precise and efficient way to cook a
steak to the exact doneness you want and
once you've had a steak cooked like this
there's no going back this way of
cooking is called sous-vide and it
literally means under vacuum in French
it describes a method that involves
sealing or vacuuming the air out of food
in a plastic bag then letting it bathe
in temperature-controlled water
sous-vide cooking seals the foods
flavors so nothing is lost to direct
heat or evaporation and the precise
temperature means you can cook any food
to its perfect temperature for a long
period of time there comes a moment when
you know technology that's used by
professionals starts to tip and it
creates like consumer goods out of the
same sort of technology and I think it's
gonna be the year of Sue B
the fried chicken here at wait for
tavern because it sous-vide when it
comes up on the line it takes about four
minutes to cook which is the reason we
can do about 160 orders a day and it's
perfect every single time now it's
starting to kind of carry over into the
hole which i think is super exciting
because it's really just a new era of
slow cooking but you don't need the slow
cooker you are if you think there's too
much tech in the kitchen now wait to see
like the real kitchen of the future
which I would think it's less than a
decade away here's what you need to cook
sous vide an immersion circulator like
one of these a large vessel like a pot
or container gallon sized freezer bags
and a cast iron pan to cook this rib eye
medium rare we're going to set the Joule
immersion circulator to 129 degrees but
there are other immersion circulators ah
there's nothing like a 145 degree water
bath after a long day
how you feeling no me just live in su
vida loca baby su vida loca the na Miku
ananova can also be controlled with a
nap but if you'd rather control the
temperature on the device you can do
that too so you don't have to rely on
your phone but back to the steak the
steak goes into the freezer bag along
with salt pepper olive oil garlic and a
thyme sprig the only problem is that
there's a lot of air in this bag so
we'll have to remove it by dropping it
into the water and letting the pressure
from the water push the air out science
after 45 minutes the steak is almost
ready it just needs that crunchy seared
outer crust crank up the heat on the
cast-iron pan add a little butter or
olive oil and add that steak
once you get a nice crusty exterior it's
time to dig in
in the end what you get is a perfect
medium-rare steak that's pink throughout
and not just in the very center there
are a lot more ways to cook sous-vide
but my favorite is getting that
restaurant steak without ever leaving my
house</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
