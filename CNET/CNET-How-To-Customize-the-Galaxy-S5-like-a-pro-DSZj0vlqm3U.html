couple of quick tips to help you
customize your brand new Samsung Galaxy
s5
just the way you like it now you may
recognize a couple of these techniques
from previous Samsung phones but if you
are brand new to the s5 of course there
are the usual moves like reassigning
wallpaper with a pre-loaded sample a
download or a photo from your gallery
I'm also going to guess that you know
how to change the lock screen wallpaper
in the settings and add in delete
widgets did you know however that you
can change the phone's font to do this
open settings then display then tap font
and finally font style to scroll through
a short list of options if you want even
more pressing download brings you to a
collection of options you can buy most
of them for about a dollar though some
fonts can cost as much as four dollars
the small font size is perfect for my
eyes but if you'd like it larger you can
change that in the settings too you know
that row of icons at the bottom of the
screen that remains static when you
swipe through home pages well in many
countries you can customize this area to
press and hold an icon to drag it in and
around this icon row you can even create
a folder around it
speaking of folders they've been
reshaped on the Samsung Galaxy s5 going
from a circle to an icon of a square you
make them pretty much the same way you
always did but this time you can assign
them one of five different colors blue
grey maroon brown or green here's
another quick little trick for you
changing the animation you see when you
swipe between the home screens find a
blank space on a home screen and press
and hold until you see controls appear
tap home screen settings and then
transition effect it's set to card stack
as the default but you can also choose
3d rotation which makes it seem like
you're turning a box around an axis or
you can choose no transition at all this
settings menu is also the place to turn
off the my magazine feature that acts
like a newsfeed to the left of your home
screens back in the display settings is
control over another favorite of mine
the daydream screensaver it's been
around since Android 4.2 but not as many
people take advantage of it as they
should here you can choose from a
soothingly colorful animation to various
options that turn your sleeping phone
into a photo frame or
Flipboard newsstand what's particularly
nice about the photo frame and photo
table options are that you can rotate
images from the editing tool called
studio as well as from a folder of
favourites or screenshots and here's one
final tip having your phone greet you by
name in lock screen settings tap owner
information and then enter your name or
a message like smile Jessica well that's
it for now folks for even more tips and
tricks on how to root your phone or
download third-party apps to liven up
your homescreen go to how to see Netcom
