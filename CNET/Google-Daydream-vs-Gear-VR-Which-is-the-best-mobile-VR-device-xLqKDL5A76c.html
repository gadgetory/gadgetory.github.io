another reality both Google and Samsung
you're selling portable VR headsets that
are similar in many ways you need to
choose get one get any and how are these
different than other types of VR unlike
oculus rift or PlayStation VR or vive
you can't walk around with your VR
daydream these are headsets you put your
phone in and you look around but both
are better than cheaper Google cardboard
type options Google daydream costs $80
but you also need a Google pixel or a
pixel XL phone other phones are going to
work too but expect future phones be
better bet than current ones hopefully
more will work because it's easy to use
just drop your phone in and it instantly
connects no plugs a dream also comes
with its own excellent remote control
that's like a magic wand and can point
at things in VR and play games a dream
runs Android apps like YouTube and
Street View and it connects to Google
Play but there aren't many other apps
yet daydream feels soft and cuddly but
it straps and fit didn't work on my face
all the time and it didn't always block
out light and the VR effects sometimes
look distorted Samsung gear VR costs
around $100 but you need one of
Samsung's Galaxy Note phones obviously
you can count out the note 7 it fit my
head a bit better but it's bigger
bulkier design might not be for everyone
it has hundreds of apps all of which run
be an oculus Store app that's on the
device games videos and plenty of great
experiences are there to try but it
doesn't tap into core Google Apps like
daydream does but it also has more
awkward controls and on headset touchpad
interacts with apps where you can pair a
separate Bluetooth game controller but
that doesn't come in the box daydreams
remote is a lot better gear VR requires
plugging in your phone to be a microUSB
which is nowhere near as effortless as a
dream sadly both daydream and gear VR
are not cross compatible and if you like
Google cardboard compatible VR apps like
you might find on your iPhone or Android
and there are tons of those you're not
going to be able to play them on gear VR
and they don't really work on daydream
yet but they should eventually a dream
might have longer legs but right now
gear VR is the better experience
