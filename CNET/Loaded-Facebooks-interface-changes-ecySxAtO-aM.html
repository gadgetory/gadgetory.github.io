Wilson Tang on cnn.com and it's time to
get loaded new changes to Facebook again
switching between a list of top stories
and recent posts is a thing of the past
now top stories and recent posts are
stacked together on users main wall with
a little blue corner to mark what
Facebook thinks is a top story for you
but for those updates of lesser
importance there is now a moving ticker
on the right-hand side scrolling through
recent comments and likes from your
friends hover your mouse over and you
can interact with all related comments
it's like Facebook inside of your
Facebook Apple and Microsoft might be
anti adobe flash but adobe is like the
honey badger it just don't care the
software giant has announced a new
version of flash and air which would be
able to render graphics 1,000 times
faster than the previous software the
company is focusing on games advanced
online video and data-driven apps flash
11 and air 3 will be available early
October but the updates come during a
time when Apple has banned the Flash
plugin from its iphone and ipads and
microsoft's new internet explorer 10 for
windows 8 in the metro touch interface
won't support any plugins at all
regardless adobe pushes onward with
support of the game makers like Zynga
and EA images and details of the
motorola atrix to have been released by
the boy genius report the tech blog says
when it comes out around Thanksgiving it
won't support LTE 4G but we'll have a
dual-core processor and an eight
megapixel camera with 1080p HD video
recording and gingerbread 2.3 point 5
images show that it looks pretty similar
to the first atrix at ATT released in
March hipsters get excited the
smartphone app that makes everyone's
photos look like they were taken by a
Polaroid camera in the 70s has added new
features instagrams free app update lets
users see the effects of a filter before
they snap the picture it also saves high
resolution photos has four new filter
effects plus an instant tilt shift for
that depth of field look vimeo the video
sharing competitor to youtube released a
new music library today making it easy
to add legal music to your videos yes
that is right it is
not legal to slap some jack johnson song
on your wedding video and post it as
your own creation but now vimeo has
45,000 tracks to pick from about 11,000
are free and others that cost just a
dollar ninety-nine attract for personal
use songs were professional or
commercial licenses cost $98 track and
in other music news remember kazaa yes
yes it's a legal service now but this
week it released its first mobile app
for iOS the streaming music service is
competing with companies like spotify
and rdio the kazaa service is free to
try for week but after that it costs ten
dollars a month for unlimited streaming
and downloads those are your headlines
for today I'm Wilson tank for cnet.com
