take place on Wednesday September 7th an
invite went out to the press and as
usual offered very little in the way of
actual details on what to look forward
to but we've got some ideas on what to
expect based on leaks speculation and
previous Apple events will definitely
see the newest iPhones unveiled with the
most talked-about feature not a feature
at all no standard headphone jack other
potential updates include a flush home
button that's pressure-sensitive some
water resistance and redesigned antenna
bands they'll look super similar to the
iphone 6s and 6s plus however the iphone
7 plus looks like it's toting a dual
lens camera of course that's if a recent
picture of taiwanese pop star jimmy lin
holding the new iphone is legit Apple
will also likely introduced us to an
updated Apple watch and spend some time
refreshing our memory on iOS 10 and all
the updates it offers for iPhone and
iPad users there are some apps getting
major overhauls particularly Apple music
and messages and we'll definitely see
more demos showing off the software
updates features home kit may also play
a large role in the event as Apple is
making a big push for smart home
connectivity to the iphone of course
we'll see all the standard apple event
happenings that are my favorite to Tim
Cook offering up stats Craig federighi
hair continuing to be on point and
baasma st. John giving me life while
demoing Apple music I personally curious
how Apple will generate more excitement
about its newest iPhone since it looks
almost identical to the 6s and 6s plus
but you really never know with Apple so
maybe they'll surprise us that's it for
this tech news update I'm ashley Esqueda
