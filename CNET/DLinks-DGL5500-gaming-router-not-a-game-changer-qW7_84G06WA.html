Vegas the only place where I can drink
and rapport at the same time alright
that's enough hi guys don't go here and
I wish me speaking very professionally
as CES 2013 in Vegas about how great
this dealing DGL 5500 gaming router
would be here they say what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas and after some
eight months now the only thing remain
the same is my shirt the rest I change
for example the bottle is empty now it's
been empty for a while and the new
router here is not exactly as good and
it was cracked up to be at least for now
now this is the third 802 point elvin AC
or AC for short router foam dealing and
it's very different from the previous
two for a couple reasons number one it
used only the second tier of the AC
standard offering up to 867 megabit per
second and not one point three agree to
a second and secondly it can be a very
special feature called stream boost now
shrimpies automatically Taylor you
internet bandwidth for uni now this one
is a gigabit router with four gigabit
lan ports on the back here to connect to
the white clients and one gigabit WAN
port to connect to an internet source it
also has a USB to panel put here to host
one peripheral device now in my testing
the railroad work well they're not
impressively well it comes with a new
web interface that's robust but quite
different from the interface of previous
dealing routers this means dealing fans
will have some learning curve to deal
with using the new interface you can
quickly view the entire network which is
very cool even manually move the
connected clients on the priority list
now the stream boost feature actually
work very well in a nutshell it
automatically gives all of your devices
and application the bandwidth they need
at any given time on top of that built
amplification chazz chazz video chatting
or a like gaming take the highest
priority video streaming take the medium
priority and not so important
application such as downloading take the
lowest priority
now unfortunately this router he doesn't
give you everything you expect from a
high-end router for example it does not
give you the support for dynamic dns
service and that's mean you cannot
remotely manage your network with the
internet and it's very hard to set up a
customized server in your network such
as a teamspeak server for your gaming
and it does not support the my dealing
cloud service either dealing told me
that dynamic dns will be added in the
next firmware upgrade which is great but
that's a future for now the router here
is good but it's not quite good enough
to justify it's very expensive price up
two hundred dollars from on the router
check out my food with us calm if you're
wondering what else also happen and stay
in vegas next time i were there well let
me tell you this i intend to keep see
that TV pg-13 for eggs very content and
more you have to follow me on twitter
facebook or google+ you will not be
disappointed that's because i'm dumb law
and this has been the first look at the
dealing DGL 5500 gaming router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
