welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
this week it's my reactions to yes the
home pod the new iPad pro iOS 11 and
everything else from WWDC 2017 now we
won't be able to cover every single
thing but let's just dive in right now
okay first up the star of the show has
to be the new iPad pro paired with the
all new iOS 11 it's really like its own
iOS and I know the iPad isn't Apple's
most popular product tablet sales have
declined the past three years in a row
but I'm one of its biggest fans and they
surprised me with the all new
functionality with a dock for apps the
new files app with third-party support
for my Dropbox and others and come on
we're getting drag-and-drop all over the
place you can drag images you can drag
text you can drag URLs you can
multi-select and multi hand drag it's a
drag fest okay Craig I'll give you that
one since the product is awesome now
does the surface pro technically do more
as a hybrid tablet and PC absolutely but
apples approach is clear we're making
this an iPad and you won't interact with
any device like this one and that's what
I love about it now that Apple pencil
that Apple avoids at all cost to call a
stylus now of course everything I've
done so far I've done using touch but
with iPad pro we have the best stylus
that's ever been made
whoops see that's okay infinity photo
guy you have an amazing app so I'll
forgive you now I'm drooling over that
new screen with pro motion a 20
millisecond latency is unmatched and
it's finally made the Apple pencil worth
the price of admission
that's a rad Apple yeah so yes
mainstream media isn't even talking
about the iPad they're talking about the
home pod and other stuff which we'll get
to but the new iPad pro with iOS 11 was
the standout of the keynote we'll just
have to see if people end up buying them
all right this year's WWDC pack with so
much stuff and as for the operating
systems it's more of a refinement year
especially for the new Mac OS hi Sierra
now we talked to the guys and we said
there might be this might be
misconstrued but they assured us this
name is fully baked
so thanks Craig but I think you meant
buckles oh yeah
yeah he ain't going away anytime soon
kids now max across the board get kb
lake updates for better performance the
iMac updates were a total surprise but
welcome for all of you who've been
waiting for an upgrade but then Apple
dropped a bomb on us with the iMac Pro
it's sessi and all that Space Gray no
doubt the power in this thing is a match
with the option for an 18 core Xeon
processor now the good thing Apple has a
machine for companies to develop VR and
AR content natively on the Mac it
remains to be seen how many will but
guess what they should our kit is
powerful not because of what it does
we've seen this type of stuff before for
years but Apple just instantly created
the largest platform for augmented
reality without the need for anyone to
purchase a single piece of additional
hardware that's a big deal but let's be
real not too many of you are going to be
able to dive in on this with a starting
price of $4,999 this is for
professionals but that's what was
sobering for me this iMac was clearly
the vision that Apple had in mind for
their next Pro machine like they didn't
do squat with the 2030 Mac Pro for over
three years because their vision was
that this iMac would be the next Pro
machine now that all changed when they
realize they were alienating guess who
their pro users it took them three years
to realize this and they announced back
in April that they made a boo-boo so a
new modular Mac Pro will be coming maybe
by the end of this year but let's be
honest more likely like 2018
now I'm really hoping we get more from
iOS 11 when it's featured with the new
iPhones in September
Apple pay person-to-person payments in
messages is nice but I'm not a fan of
the new control center it looks like
this mishmash of widgets like a modern
art mural but that's not what I want
with a control center I don't know maybe
it's just me all right the big iOS 11
feature they didn't talk about in the
keynote you can now add more control to
your air pod the settings will now allow
you to use a double tap to either go to
the next track or previous track on
either ear and yes you'll still have the
single tap
option four pause and play or ciri now
it's much needed
and next up volume control in 2018 see
that's funny at first until you realize
that I am probably right
alright the biggest letdown from iOS 11
Siri I was really hoping this was a
chance for Apple to show us their vision
in the artificial intelligence and
virtual assistant game and maybe maybe
they're holding off until the iPhone in
September I'll give them that but this
is a Developers Conference and it's all
about the software now they mentioned
machine learning a few times they gave
us a demo of a Siri boys that's more
conversational here's to the forecast in
the next 10 days
Sun Sun and sunny three different ways
to say sunny very powerful okay but they
never fundamentally showed us how much
smarter Siri really is WWDC was a golden
opportunity to show us the details of
Apple's AI and vision with their
platform and ecosystem moving forward
like is it really that much better they
didn't talk about it and more
importantly they didn't brag about it
and that tells me it's not everything is
moving in that direction Amazon and
Google they have better assistants and
people who keep telling me Siri is good
enough try using those other devices on
a day-to-day basis Siri is really behind
by a lot and that's a sad Apple now it's
where things are going in if we don't
hear anything about it in September then
yeah a bad apple is coming out in full
force but let's talk about the home pot
apples three hundred and forty nine
dollar home pot I have no doubt this
will be the best sounding smart speaker
on the market with its four inch woofer
seven tweeter array whose guts kind of
look like an imperial probe droid now
its ability to analyze a room and adjust
the sound for optimal quality will have
to be tried out in person but that
sounds neat Apple positioned this as a
music speaker first the focus wasn't on
the smart aspects of it it has Siri
built-in but it was another opportunity
to tout its improvements that didn't
happen now did you know this isn't
Apple's first rodeo with the home
speaker that was apples iPod hi-fi that
also retailed for 349 in 2006 now come
on the Internet always is the best
when it comes to new Apple designs like
here check out some of these hot takes
like for example the home pod looks like
a scratching post so if you have cats
you might want to stay away some people
already found they have at home pod in
their bathroom it also comes in many
colors if you know you're shopping at
jo-ann fabrics and the first thing that
came to me the home pod would be perfect
at a campfire roasted now Apple was
showing it off after the keynote at
their demo room but it was hands-off a
reporter's so I gotta admit I like the
glowy top that I'll never see from a
distance because it's on top but the
Apple crew is able to infiltrate apples
headquarters and I snuck out one of
their early prototypes for the home pod
so check it out here you'll notice some
of the details like the first attempt
that the mesh fabrics and then we have
these these two things here for cable
management and I don't know it's just
like this form factor it looks familiar
but I don't know I just can't place it
yet alright this is going to be
available in December and of course I'll
buy one to try but we'll see if I keep
it all right that's going to do it for
this week's show we couldn't cover
everything but we'd love to hear what
you thought about the WWDC keynote email
us at the Apple bite at cnet.com or
tweet me at brian tom thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
the bite of the Apple
oh my gosh oh cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
