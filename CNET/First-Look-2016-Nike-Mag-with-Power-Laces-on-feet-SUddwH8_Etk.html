Nike mags these are really the shoes
from Back to the Future to where you saw
Michael J Fox just pop them on and this
Power laces automatically gripped on his
feet this is actually life imitating art
now we have the shoe where you put it in
and it detects your heel when it presses
the bottom then you'll actually see the
laces tighten over the top of your foot
and then really kind of get a snug fit
you can adjust them with buttons
there's even its own button where you
can turn on the lighting on the side and
also on the strap which makes it kind of
really glow and pop we also got a chance
to talk to Tiffany beers and really
she's the brains behind all the
technology that's packed inside the shoe
everyone expected it to operate exactly
how it did in the film so how quickly it
tightened how it tightened and so we
held the line on as much as we could and
definitely on the aesthetics of the shoe
so we didn't change anything aesthetic
wise it's been an almost a decade of
working on this off and on and it just
it's awesome to see it like in the flesh
right now and see everyone trying it on
now the way to get the shoe it's not
going to be easy you can't just buy
these at the store you're going to have
to go to Nike comm and it's going to be
a raffle system basically it's $10 per
raffle ticket all proceeds go to the
Michael J Fox foundation for Parkinson's
disease but that is the only way you'll
get them they only come in size 7 9 11
and 13 there's only 89 pairs that are
going to be available so these are
extremely rare but this is one of those
cool things where technology gadgetry
geekery they all combine in a one thing
that just gets us juiced up sneaker
heads alike come on you know you love
this so this is just one of those cool
moments and things where everything
comes together and there you have it
it's the first look at the Nike MAG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
