hopefully landing on your phone in the
next few months here are my top 5 new
features in the update number one now on
tap
press and hold your phone's home button
and boom Google now appears offering up
extra information on whatever is on your
screen you'll get links and app
shortcuts relevant to whatever you're
looking at so if a friend texts you
about dinner and a movie you can get
information on both without any effort
now on tap is arguably the best new
feature in Android marshmallow number
two app permissions no longer do apps
have carte blanche access to every inch
of your phone now you can turn off
access app by app to your photos
contacts and more just go to settings
apps and tap the gear icon then pick a
feature like location or microphone and
decide which apps can use it number
three fingerprint support finally
built-in fingerprint support this means
we'll hopefully see more Android phones
with fingerprint scanners in the future
and fingerprints are a much more
convenient way to secure your phone
without a password or a pin plus the
feature allows you to pay for stuff in
an app on your phone and authorize the
payment with your print number 4 doze
mode your phone spends a lot of time
resting on a table in your pocket or in
your bag when your phone's sitting idle
it will now use less power
blocking background processes that drain
your battery this means if you're not
tapping on your phone all day
it may even last until the next morning
number 5 a redesigned app drawer the app
drawer is a bit smarter these days
showing you suggested apps at the very
top that Android thinks you want right
now based on the time of day and your
habits there's a search field to to
easily find what you need head over to
cnet.com to learn a whole lot more about
android marshmallow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
