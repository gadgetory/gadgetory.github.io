your local hardware store recently
you've probably noticed that light bulbs
have changed and appearance somewhat
today's new LEDs have new builds and
heat sinks and they don't look exactly
like the bulbs you probably grew up with
the incandescent of years past but this
bulb here which looks just like one of
those incandescent is actually an LED
this is the saffron LED 40 watt
replacement as you can see it sits in
that same classic glass curved bulb it
looks just like an incandescent and is
designed especially for people who don't
like the way LEDs look these days if
that includes you you're probably pretty
happy with the way this bulb looks
sitting beside me looks just like an
incandescent both on and off in terms of
performance this bulb uses just 6 watts
to put out about 375 lumens so less than
the state is 400 and less than the 450
lumens that you probably want from a 40
watt replacement bulb so disappointing
in the brightness it's also got a color
rendering score of 78 which is right
below that benchmark point of 80 that
you really want an LED to hit
additionally this is a non dimmable
bulbs so you can't use it on a dimmer
switch without some pretty intense
flickering you want a cheap strobe light
it'll do the job just fine but as a
dimmable light bulb this is not an
option you want to consider at $12 it's
more expensive than the options you'll
get from cree phillips and oz room and
it's not as strong an option as those so
that reason the pretty tough bulb for me
to recommend unless you are absolutely
in love with the way it looks as
incandescent look-alikes go it is the
closest we've seen so far so I've got to
give it credit for that thanks for
watching and check out the rest of my
life old smart home and appliance
reviews at cnet com / appliances for
seen that I'm right Chris
