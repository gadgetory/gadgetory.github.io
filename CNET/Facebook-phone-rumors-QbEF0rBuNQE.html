and it's time to get loaded this weekend
the internet went nuts over a rumor that
Facebook was working on their very own
phone the thinking was that it would
compete against Apple and Google and
possibly run Android facebook came back
and saying that this was just a rumor
and that there is no such thing as the
Facebook phone but seeing it has
confirmed that Facebook did reach out to
hardware manufacturers and carriers
about a potential Facebook branded phone
facebook said they're not building a
phone but did not give a response about
whether or not a Facebook branded phone
is in the works free is releasing a new
service that lets you call anyone in the
world starting at one cent per minute
the service is available for nokia now
and is coming to iphone and android soon
and amazon wants to educate gamers on
motion gaming the online retailer is
releasing a motion gaming 101 section
for anyone looking for advice on which
system to purchase it'll have game
recommendations customer reviews and
interviews with developers and producers
explaining details on the PlayStation
Move Microsoft's Kinect and the wii if
motion control is your thing check it
out the ipad is relatively new but apple
com is selling refurbs on their site now
you can find the tablet in the special
deals section and if the word refurb
does not scare you away you'll still get
a one-year warranty and fifty bucks

worth mentioning that Apple includes
free shipping on all refurb purchases an
HP is releasing their own pocket cam in
October it records 1080p video and has a
2 inch LCD on the back and a gyro to
help with image stabilization since
