laser tag I used to a long time ago and
those toys have still been around for
years it turns out that hasbro is
finally tact iOS compatibility onto them
with the new laser tag that's coming out
now through the fall these new blasters
have believe it or not an iphone or ipod
touch bracket that allows you to plug it
right in there and use your iPhone or
iPod touch as a heads up display in
combination with playing multi-person
laser tag wherever you are strange idea
well kind of gimmicky but when you use
the download iOS app it shows you some
built-in augmented reality targets that
interact with what you're shooting at as
well and provide a strange Kwazii video
game like laser tag experience that's
definitely not like anything else has
been out there and for forty dollars for
one of these or 75 for two it's not that
expensive to get on board compared to
other iOS toys and accessories so how
does it work well we grabbed 10 people
it accepts up to 24 players and we tried
it
you
and one
goodness i can review themselves with
so we tried a mission here 505 I'd say
was a bit of a mixed bag we did have
some people who didn't have iphones and
we had some people that original weapons
and we had a lot of systems crouch on us
maybe thats the beta software but some
of them seem like they weren't quite
registering others seemed like they were
all i know is i won so i feel like i did
a great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
