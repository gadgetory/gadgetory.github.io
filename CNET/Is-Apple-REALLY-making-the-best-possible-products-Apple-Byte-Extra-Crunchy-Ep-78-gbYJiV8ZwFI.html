building in san francisco california
siapa by Dexter country podcasts with
your host mr. Brian Tom whoo what's up
everybody we are back hey man you're
Mike is messed up can we are you still
crunchy there crunch okay here we go
welcome to the show boys and girls
ladies and gentlemen children of all
ages we are back in the original studio
things are a little dusty if it gets
crunchy we're gonna fix that it's it's
called the apple byte extra crunchy for
a reason Steven what is that sound that
what what is that that is a preamp over
here that you know we had like all this
construction on the sixth floor for
seven months yeah for seven months and I
covered this whole room in plastic but
still dust gets in places and there's
dust in this preamp behind me and that's
what's causing Brian's boys and a
cracker crunchy some told I think we're
good now okay don't jinx it okay yes
anyways ladies and gentlemen welcome to
the show it's apple pie extra crunchy
episode 78 for those of you joining us
first time listeners this is a
complimentary p store apple byte show
we're doing a little early this week but
guess what uh you can't not talk about
what happened with the galaxy s eight
and how it stacks up of maybe what we
have now and what we've seen we do want
you to also be a part of the show like
you always are we have people on youtube
live stream and periscope watching live
if you guys ever want to check that out
you can check out my Twitter at brian
Tong but to call us and be a part of the
show because it's all about you all 1
800 61 62 63 8 leave us your name where
you're from look if we even show you the
graphic right here yeah there it is it's
on the screen now so you guys guys and
gals can call you message will work on
bringing back live calls we're easing
back into the old studio so let's talk
about it yesterday i was actually
off-site doing some cool stuff that will
be able to talk about later like in a
few weeks but the s8 dropped it was
everything we expected but when i look
at the whole entirety of that keynote
there is really nothing about the s8
that would tell me a large group of
people whether they're on a Google
Axl an iphone may be a 1 plus phone
there was nothing about the s8 that
would convince me that flocks of people
will draw it will jump ship and change
platform for the s8 I know there will be
some but just not a lot and 44 right off
the bat before you think I'm hating on
this 8 that is the best screen and the
best design on a phone that we have
today but when you look at kind of the
other new features the Bixby virtual
assistant it's actually still half baked
it's not completely there it's going to
be better the ability for it to pull up
general information questions that you
typically will ask Google or a theory
it's not as good at doing that and it's
really going to be more about
integrating into the OS making access to
your apps easier being able to use that
easier but again it's still half baked
like when we got our hands on there
early versions it wasn't working
completely and so it's gonna be take
time first to see really how good Bixby
is I'm curious what you guys and gals
all think like was it was Bixby even
compelling enough because right now as
it stands the Google assistant is still
better than Bixby and arguably Siri at
this point in time it's a little you
know maybe flip a coin but Siri might be
actually better than Bixby at this right
now at this point in time and you don't
want to talk about that when it's a new
feature that you have just launched you
want it to be the best well yesterday we
were watching the keynote and they they
talked about Bixby they barely talked
about it was like just like I mention oh
we got this new thing here it is what it
looks like that was it we didn't really
mean I don't really recall a demo
happening either yeah it's it is there a
I will see how it flows you know comes
together but when we talk about the
perspective of the Apple you know Apple
nation because that's who this show is
all about you know I'm just wondering if
you all felt threatened about it do you
think how about this Stephen do you
think the based on all these crazy
rumors do you think the iphone will be
better looking than the galaxy s 8 which
really looks amazing with that screen
it's tough to say because I have seen
every a lot of people on Twitter and
else
are saying the new galaxy s eight is
amazing it looks beautiful you know I've
have seen that comment a lot yeah um we
don't know what that bold iphone is
going to look like but people are saying
it's gonna look like the four so are
people going to just be like oh it looks
like a phone we've already seen before
you know it's hard to say how people
gonna are gonna accept the new iphone I
think either way right you have a
built-in built into man that is already
part of the platform of Apple it is
continued to show us that people are
willing to buy the next generation of
the iphone whether you're on the
two-year cycle now even on a one-year
cycle with their Apple upgrade program I
just don't see any this number this
market share balance isn't going to
change like the last time I saw I
believe Apple was just like just
slightly ahead of Samsung you know with
with shipments from the last quarter of
two thousand sixteen it was like seventy
nine percent versus like 17.6 percent
apple / samsung barely oh yeah which is
barely right you have your the lines
have been drawn now we are integrated
into we are committed to these
ecosystems we always talk about that so
we'll see I I did but I do got to give
them props that screen looks amazing
again is just a better looking phone
enough for you to switch over I don't
think so yeah another another thing I
kept seeing people make comments about
was just like all smartphones look the
same now I'll just the same form factor
like there's not much difference in them
they're black they have a screen like
you know what else can you do people
really feel that way now you know this
is a really mature space and it's just
hard to say that there's a significant
you know innovation but that infinity
screen yeah take me there look cool yeah
take me there Apple can take me there
I'll be happy about that yeah well that
was kind of like remember we had a voice
mail last week where a guy was talking
about how they're gonna extend the Bell
you know the bezel is going to disappear
on the iphone it's going to go out to
the edge so it could be look a lot
similar to this galaxy s eight and I'm
sorry I don't want to hate on you know
people that make these videos but it's
like the instant video that comes up
which is total BS is galaxy s eight vs
iphone
aight you idiots it's not even out and
it's like I'm sorry there's things that
are being worked on in this building not
i'm not one of those that are like oh
let's talk about what how the new iphone
is better than the essay i'm like the
new iphone isn't even out all these are
unconfirmed rumored features that
literally are not even remotely official
and you're gonna make a video on that
yeah like that bothers me I'm sorry as
someone who cares about this that
bothered that's why people get turned
off by some of the stuff that just in
general is thrown out there yeah yeah
I'm you know in in their defense a
little bit that iphone 7 when it came
out like every rumor that we heard was
true sort of right I mean like there's a
lot of rumors that came out that ended
up being happening so maybe people are
just kind of trusting in that you're
you're right but I guess I come from an
old-school world where I'll talk about
the rumors and completely treat them as
rumors but I'm not gonna headline
something that makes it sound like it's
facts yeah yeah and alternative fact
y'all it just bought it I'm sorry well I
saw that I saw that same argument when
the Nintendo switch came out cuz a lot
of people were reviewing it before the
actual ship version of the switch came
out so I saw a lot of back and forth
about that too it's similar similar
situation you know and guess what the
videos that come out first the way that
SEO and search works they get the most
views oh yeah right it's it's it's a
it's a run for clicks and views and fine
I'm just saying I wish that we were a
little smarter about it I just wish but
hey that's right or was it early worm
nope early bird early bird worm fine get
all the worms you want and I'm
criticizing us in house too okay I'm not
criticizing I'm everyone it's everyone
okay let's talk about other things right
now we're gonna transition a little bit
over to iPad stuff but sometimes people
get all sick about iphone this iphone
that we've got more ipad stuff the new
ipad 9.7 inch is available for personal
pick up at stores and it's kind of funny
because i fix it who is known for
basically dismantling this stuff did a
teardown of the new I
had again this is a new version okay how
about this let me let me remind and
explain this we had the ipad air 2 this
new ipad is the same thickness as the
original ipad air it removes the error
name it brings in a faster a 9 processor
chip so i fix it tore it down and
basically said this looks just like the
original ipad air in the inside as it
does on the outside so what was the
difference like just a chip it's it's
really a strategic market thing where
they're bringing in a 9.7 inch tablet at
329 which right when I said I'm like
that is the best value the best 9.7 inch
tablet you're going to find on the
market now it's not the bet it's not
from a price standpoint it's the best
way I never said its feature wise the
best but it kind of bothered me when I
looked at this iPad tear down because
there it's like okay they are outright
saying this is exactly the ipad air with
just like a faster processor and then it
brings me back to how the philosophy is
Apple has completely changed because I
remember all the time and don't say
don't be that old dude talking about
Steve Jobs would always say we're making
the best possible products that was what
he said and damn that is what he did
right we had one iphone we had one
iphone visitor during his entire reign
okay we had one ipad join his entire
reign alright desktops laptops that's a
little different now when I see this
iPad which again is a great value but to
know the fact that there's an ipad mini
there's an ipad there's an ipad pro 9.7
there's an ipad pro 10.5 there's an ipad
pro 12.9 tim's philosophy is when he
says we're making the best possible
products i think this is really what
he's saying tim cook in my mind is
saying we're making the best possible
product at multiple price points hmmm
and that guess what Apple is raking in
the cash that are making more money than
they ever had but
don't when he says oh we're making the
best product possible he's really saying
we're making the best product possible
at multiple price points but when you
really break that down that means you're
not making the best possible product
right yeah you know you've got five
iPads bro you know Steve Jobs just a
hard act to follow man so Tim Cook is
like doing everything he can you know to
keep Apple profitable and keep them up
on that higher echelon that they are so
you know I kind of get it I kind of get
it but I I get your argument to there's
like so much it's becoming like like I
remember in the when Android first came
out we're always like oh it's what was
the word we use all the time on it you
know there's just so many Android
products just started to get a fragment
fragmented yeah I fragmentation so
that's kind of what happened what's
happening with apple now you know and
and steve jobs is an amazing salesman
and Tim Cook doesn't have that same kind
of you know he doesn't have that that it
and that's how it thing here's the thing
that's okay not to have that it okay no
no I'm not saying bc jobs all I'm saying
is that don't say the same stuff he said
yes not true yes I agree right yeah like
that's you know when they're still
borrowing lines from the script but
thank you wholly different you know yeah
sales and it's an a-hole marketing
things different you know when you when
you again so that's that's all I'm
saying I just want to use it as another
example of where it hit me and I'm just
like man this company has changed and
yes they're super profitable and fine
investors be happy and I still by lord
knows how much Apple stuff right like
it's a you know I'm the guy who buys the
ipad 12.9 inch okay yeah I'm that guy
ipad pro but at this dude in the YouTube
chat room he says OSH I'm gonna slay his
name i'm sorry ab I've he Scheck vu pula
Gopala he says Tim Cook is a Salesman
Steve Jobs was an innovator but I would
argue Steve Jobs was both a dative a
Tyranus a library big time I nearly
agree so again um that that whole iPad
in just the fact that and guess what as
a supply chain guy you're using older
parts
is that you have to sell a lower cost
product which is just you know kind of
business 101 when you talk about
clearing inventory but damn the day that
I see Apple literally doing that like
actually doing that kind of hurts I mean
I know we have the iphone SE right yeah
that people love that from you and
that's still popular form factor it's
just a different world and I'm still
having a problem dealing with it still
having issues dealing with it I just
want to be honest with you all and I
know some of you are I know some of you
are there too so whenever someone says
oh they're not innovate like it goes
deeper than that you know well another
guy in the chat room just said Tim Cook
is afraid to take risks that Steve
wasn't I'm gonna call BS on that too
because they put out the air pods I mean
that's a huge risk they took the boat
the headphone jack out of the phone I
mean that's a giant risk that's like not
secretly you can argue that's innovating
but it also like freaked everybody out
yeah same time w one ship was the best
innovation from 2016 I've said that when
it came out I'll say that now I think it
still holds water um the w the air pods
are going are like I said they're a
really really really really good product
I will never call them a great product
cuz they don't do everything yet but
damn they're really good and over time
you'll like them but again they still
look fugly yeah and they're still
there's you know it's not a come that's
not the best possible version of the air
pods know like i know this yeah i mean
that they know it too the design they
could have changed the design just a
tiny bit man i'm a little different than
the air earbuds yeah you know and I you
know I think they were might have even
been you live a little more popular you
know like I was hating on the air pods I
still hate on how they look you made a
whole music video about but if you those
who saw the video which is very well
well produced and mixed by my friend
over there Stephen thank you um you know
we at the end we say we disclaimer dit
lyk until they're in stock and I did say
positive things about the air pods in
the video for the record technology you
know but Apple was technology anesthetic
say they did good on the technology part
and everyone's calling at me out for
being cheap because I don't want to buy
air pause for
170 bucks right but come on 170 bucks
that's a lot of money I want to yeah 160
with tax 162 attacks all right we'll
we'll keep on moving around in the show
because I know you don't want us to sit
here forever talking about that with the
cup that could almost be every show here
that could be every show here I'm not
sure if you all heard about this maybe
it did there was a laptop ban on planes
that came after a plot to put explosives
in iPads this recently just happened a
few days ago earlier this week and
monday or something yeah the us-uk ban
on selected like this is from The
Guardian this article that were pulling
from but the US UK band on select
electronic devices from the passenger
cabins of flights from some countries in
North Africa and the Middle East part
was partly prompted by a previously
undisclosed plot involving explosives
hidden in a fake iPad according to a
security source so now the UK has a ban
on tablets laptops game consoles and
other devices larger than a mobile phone
that came into effect on last Saturday
it applies to inbound flights from six
countries Egypt Jordan Lebanon Saudi
Arabia Tunisia and Turkey now theres
also 6 UK airlines that an eight foreign
carriers that are affected including
british airways easyjet jet to monarch
Thomas Cook and more now it also follows
a similar move in the US which applies
to flights from 10 airports in eight
countries they do say and of course at
least with the US these are Middle
Eastern countries Jordan Egypt Turkey
Saudi Arabia Morocco Qatar Kuwait and
Qatar Kuwait and United Arab Emirates so
the security sources both said bands
were not the result of a specific
incident but a combination of factors so
if you are traveling to and from those
areas and you're like um yeah I'm not
I'm not gonna give up my ipad pro dude
I'm they're gonna have to wrestle that
away from my cold dead yes like that is
my favorite gadget yeah you can't take
it that's such a bummer you again taking
on the plane and watch a movie when I
first heard that story and my immediate
thought was like oh someone tell
legends agency got a tip about some
laptop exploding or something so you
know better to be safe than sorry there
also is a weird discrepancy about this
because see the reaction to this is
different from the UK and the US right
there's not all the countries are the
same on both lists and it was kind of
what the article kind of dug into is
like they were suspect because they were
raised questions how did they arrive at
different conclusions if this was
something that they were both worried
about clearly these two organizations
share these two countries share more
than enough information between each
other so why all of a sudden is like oh
yeah we're going to have a few different
countries than you you know the
suspicion is that because of you know
the current administration that runs the
show here decided to maybe throw in a
few extra just cut from travel man yeah
yeah because we obviously have different
think we meaning administration has a
different idea of what is which
countries should be on that list or not
but it's just a little reminder that
there the article also stated how
terrorists are trying to use more
innovative ways just yeah and explosives
like remember there were shoes there's
the guy that got caught for putting like
an explosive like in his underwear yeah
what that was an underwear bomb that's
right and it was like sitting in a seat
in his underwear were exploding but I
guess he wasn't moving or any he was
just kind of sitting there waiting for
it to happen and someone was like that
guy's on fire of there so that is
terrifying if you're on an airplane and
some like that's happening that is
terrifying so just just be lookouts want
to let you know there has been no
resolution to this but this is where the
kind of the ban on electronics larger
than a mobile phone from the UK and US
specific to certain countries is
happening at the moment just to also
follow up on more ipad news i know it's
like ipad all the time right now it's
kind of like the thing you if you want
to listen to more iphone talk just
rewind about 10 minutes ago you can
listen to that um the 10.5 inch ipad is
entering limited production but a spring
or WWDC or even fall launch remains
unclear that's according to forbes
magazine um yeah there it doesn't mean
that it's not on the pipe
but again the all rumors indicate that
we have some sort of an iPad
announcement in April we're pretty much
getting to April people said early April
I there's plenty of time I'm not going
to really hold Apple to like oh it's
gotta be an event this now i do want to
see the ipad at 10.5 inch come out i
think in a weird way if the screen is
roughly the same size as my 12.9 inch as
long as i can see comics and the
full-page proportions that they're meant
to me and that doesn't happen on a 9.7
inch ipad i might have to give that
thing a look my to give that thing a
look but honestly I'm going to stick
with the twelve point nine inch line I
love that big screen but the article in
the Forbes continue to kind of add on
the initial production is limited but
apples been known to do fairly fast ramp
ups in the past it's also possible Apple
could do a limited launch initially
adding countries as volume allows nice
so we're down with that a low-cost iPad
remember that kind of talk about the 9.7
inch we talked about earlier last week
we talked about how or a couple weeks
ago we were talking about how new
identifier for new ipads had been
discovered you know from some of this
data analytics with identifiers i
clearly point to this new family of
iPads the low-cost ipad that just came
out is now available to pick up in
stores was not one of those oh really
yeah that it was not part of the logs
that has been confirmed so there's
another one in the work yeah so this is
I mean this is exciting I whenever you
see these product identifier numbers pop
up in logs by developers and other
analytic websites it's always a good
thing so iPad 71 72 73 and 74 were the
ones that were found in the logs which
currently do not exist at all hmm pretty
pretty dope so we'll see how that
happens um in other new apple
announcements we know this week iOS 10.3
TV OS 10.2 watch us at 3.2 did you did
you update I haven't I haven't I've been
meaning to do it but every time I it
like pops into my head to do it
to do something with my phone so I
haven't done it yet I want to know how
many of you all updated because I have
always been a stickler on this and I
wait like I'll wait like two or three
days before I actually do it knowing
that you know historically they're
typically are some big bugs that happen
but up to this point no major bugs have
been really talked about with the 10.3
update nice so for those of you that
want to play a little catch up at least
with the iOS 10.3 the big kind of two
features is find my air pods that's
going to be part of it the new Apple
file system does that mean it's not my
voice this is your video yeah sorry no
it's okay i don't like clearing myself
on myself it just sounds weird it's
weird right um so we have like the by my
ear pods feature also Apple's new file
system that is optimized for modern
usage we're in the back of the day was
made really for like old floppy drives
hard disk drives we are now in
solid-state drive so that in itself will
help with performance it's optimized for
that it's also a lot more secure and
then a subtle thing that has been
overlooked is iOS 10.3 has reduced
animations they've actually shortened
some of the animations jumping from apps
and from different screens so according
to sources and maybe y'all can verify
this it you know could be snappier
that's good I actually turned off the
animations on my phone me too it sounds
exactly what a little faster in yeah I
hated that it took it took me way too
long so are the funny thing is yeah I
wouldn't even know if the animations
were Stanford because I've turned off
turn them off so that it's the snappiest
that they can be nice um I'm gonna talk
about I works okay are you is can you
believe this along with the opto sorry
you know let me let me get it through TV
OS 10.2 look out it improves the
scrolling it improves the scrolling and
TV OS 10.2 that also has to do with
navigating when you're typing in letters
and also we talked about last week the
ability to rent one time on one iOS
device and that rental movie now showing
on all of your devices as long as you
update TV OS 10.2 and also update your
iOS 10.3 you'll be able to watch a
rented movie across multiple devices
without having to re-rent it which was
the problem that happened before firm
that sounds silly watch OS 3.2 gets the
theater mode option it's basically turns
the sound in the screen off while you're
in a movie theater if you need to see
your screen you can double tap the
screen to turn on but that is specific
to the theater mode that's a new feature
and then also they've added new Siri
implementation that will allow you to do
things like say start workouts send
messages make payments book rides it's
that type of stuff is now coming to your
Apple watch so you can look even more
like awkward in public that's just
talking to your wrist like its threaten
you don't have sometimes I feel awkward
talking to Alexa in my own house you
know I'm like I wish I could do
something else to turn it on like this
way something like when you might have a
nice moment and then you have to say
Alexa turn off below yeah yeah just you
know it's funny sometimes like what so
not hot so not hot all right I works
gets a update and some of the cool
things is like you know keynote Pages
and Numbers I the only I works app that
I use actually a lot is still keynote oh
yeah I actually legitimately use keynote
I think it's awesome you and Brian
Cooley like Brian coolies like mr. Kino
Kino Kino does keynote is a stellar app
to me I don't care what you all say
actually there's no there's no better
looking presentation I think he know
when you put it together yeah that's
that's why aesthetically so they've
added a new feature in this update to
the iwork suite most notably the ability
to unlock password protected documents
using touch ID nice so people that are
working on it on their iPad and their
iPhones you can now have touch ID locked
I works apps and then another thing that
was kind of cool these are all subtle
things but I did want to mention them
and show love to all y'all that love I
work I'm gonna see how many people heart
that right now I'm not I'm not seeing
any hearts right now for I worth fans
but you can also now embed an iwork a
keynote presentation in a website nice
so you've had this ability to like
collaborate and share you know update
and edit a keynote but you can now take
your presentation that you made and
embed it directly into certain websites
that's
that's kind of sick that is because it's
it looks good yeah it looks it looks
really good all right I'm in other news
the WWDC 2017 lottery is open this week
for those of you that want to go I
believe the price to enter so this is
the thing it's a lottery system you're
not guaranteed to go in because there's
such high demand but you pay basically
1599 I'm sorry 1599 don't know this is a
big deal that we have to pay that for
the lottery well yuge enter the lottery
and then if you win then obviously you
get charged okay so tickets are doled
out using a random selection process
again it's been implemented because it's
been so crazy the demand for
approximately 5,000 attendees are
expected at the conference so that's
really you know when you think about
developers that's there's so many people
that want to get a piece of that apple
pie that 5,000 is pretty limited but
again this is specific to developers a
thousand Apple engineers and executives
will be there as well the lottery will
end on friday March the 31st at ten a.m.
pacific time so if you're listening to
this and you didn't even know you better
get on that site get all better get on
it but tons of sessions also i like the
WWDC we typically see at least some sort
of hardware announcements this is going
to go down I believe june fifth is when
WWDC starts through friday jus night and
typically there's a keynote on the first
day so we're also looking at that as a
target date if we don't see any ipads in
april which i hope we do will will most
likely see something in june from them
and if we don't see something to june
then that's really bad like what are you
guys actually doing over there it does
the lottery costs money to enter I know
it's not like for Hamilton lottery we
tell max it's absolutely yeah absolutely
oh and then this kind of fun story
before we wrap up and go to our calls
Apple has been declared the most
intimate brand in a survey of six
thousand customers this was held by what
does that mean well I'll tell you what
it means my friend and there's no apple
panties coming out anytime soon although
i did a search online and they do exist
apple pie
these oh yeah there there's actually a
funny sorry this is my job to do
research guys and gals there's a Apple
thong oh yeah and there's a on the
certain parts of the thong there's a
slide to unlock feature it's pretty it's
green on the panties that's awesome yeah
slide to unlock just look it up when
you're not at work and if you're at work
good luck so M BLM the company behind
the survey said that hard data actually
proves the rankings aren't just fluff
the top-ranked intimate brands can you
need to outperform the SP and fortune
500 in revenue and profit over the past
10 years these are the factors that they
measured it they really measure the
overall positive feelings consumers have
for each brand so here's the factors
number one fulfillment exceeds
expectations delivering superior service
quality and efficacy to identity
reflects an aspirational image or
admired values and beliefs that resonate
deeply three is I know you're like wow
people both those first two make me
laugh yeah I don't make sure so fulfill
yeah it's like Thank You Apple I am oh
yeah my identity I mean something
enhancement becoming better through use
of the brand smarter more capable and
more connected I'll give them that
ritual in graining a brand into daily
actions more then that is true ritual
behavior the brand becomes a vitally
important part of the daily existence
true nostalgia I'll give them that
focuses on memories of the past and the
warm poignant feelings associated with
them sure I guess the nostalgia for me
is deep that's why I'm still with the
damn Brian indulgence creates a close
relationship centered around moments of
pampering and gratification that can be
either occasional or frequent wow so
Apple rated number one Disney at two
amazon at three disney yeah disney shoot
yeah I'm upset with Disney right now
what happened tell me I took my kids to
uh goofy's kitchen when she go to New
Zealand it was like it was last year
like December oh this is still
resonating it's still resonating baby
got a goofus kitchen really bad
character breakfast character breakfast
don't ever go everybody cuz because it
cost nine million dollars and my kid
like he it was just it was a night I
don't even want to get into it but my
kid like cut his hand on piece of
furniture there and then the kitchen
didn't have band-aids and it was just
they told me had to go buy band-aids and
I'm like my son's here it was just
enough I don't even want to get into it
Sorry Sorry Sorry oh don't go sorry I
open up because on the other hand I have
been a character's breakfast is like my
own man dollars it is also nine million
dollars but uh I mean I can see how it's
fun but yeah I'm sorry that you had to
go through that maybe maybe of Disney's
listening they'll they'll throw you a
buy one get one they lit I've dude I
went through all the channels to
complain and they didn't they didn't
help you out no all right so Apple one
Disney to Amazon 3i fine amazon s3 is
very imaging all about the money you
know the savings harley-davidson number
four that's really cool that is ran like
Harley Davidson is that high Netflix was
five Nintendo was 67 is Samsung whole
foods is eight BMW is 10 and Toyota is
I'm sorry BMW is nine and toyota's 10 I
find it funny that Nintendo is six
because I know plenty of people that
love the Nintendo when I'm like yo
there's only one game that came out on
your system lunch bro it's like and I
bought a switch and I haven't even
opened it up yet really yeah you're all
yeah I'm sorry y'all shop dude I've been
trying to find that for my kids no I get
after the whole debacle with the
Nintendo mini retro what was the Renault
classic classic and they no one could
get one and I it's like tried I tried I
went to best buy it like five in the
morning I tried I could not get one I'm
over it I don't even want one I think
that yeah that thought I don't even want
to switch either yeah that stuff happens
um again Apple declared the most
intimate brand nice in a survey of 6,000
consumers cool all right let's get to
the call shall we calls call y'all's ok
we have a first call is from hey Brian
this is james from Washington State and
I was calling to find out
any rumors that the Apple earpods will
be updated this year to maybe a w-2 chip
I just want to get your thoughts on that
I'm thinking about buying a pair but I
want to wait if you're gonna update them
sometime this year thanks guys love the
show by thanks for the call based on the
time you know the fact that the air pods
actually only started becoming available
in limited quantities in december for
them and even they aren't even caught up
to the supply i started the demand and
it's what April already so I don't
expect us to see a new one this year
maybe we might get an announcement but I
don't I don't expect to see in a year
and the fact is that if there is so much
demand even after they catch up with
supply it they don't need to rush out a
new model so if people are still waiting
to get their their order and Tim Cook
likes to slow play Tim Cook likes the
slow play their there they just like to
milk it take their time so if I don't
think we see one this year but if I'm
wrong I'm wrong all right next call hey
guys what up is Jay man from Brooklyn
love your show been a fan since the
beginning generally I always leave long
messages so you guys never play me
that's right Beecham jonathan mcintosh
AKA jay men anyway Brian just wanted to
know I'm in the market to get a new iPad
what should i get the ipad quote 12-inch
like you or the new pro 9.7 or 10.5 or
whatever it is at 349 for 32 gigs that's
it love the show guys keep it going
peace jmac you got in 30 seconds we 31
second we see Jamie um I don't think I
think you should wait for the new airpot
I sorry ipad announcements don't don't
make a decision then I do think the 10.5
is really compelling if you want it to
be a little more portable but you still
get a bunch of screen real estate that's
the one that I'm most curious about but
I love my 12.9 inch imma be I'm 12.9 for
life you know what I mean ipad ipad nice
okay next call i can do it there we go
hello after five
zacks a new trial on the cover in
disgust on Apple TV stuff quick first
the Siri remote requirements that Brian
dislikes on the Apple TV with WestEd
last June so good Apple there but then
some improvements I'd like behind the
scenes Apple worked with luda Amazon and
Google Play to get actual apps on the
Apple TV so i don't have to airplay and
also get the TV app to work with
families sharing better because right
now it doesn't show family purchases
well or just take a lot of extra steps
thanks have a good day thank you for all
that that was that was super helpful
information so i think also the other
thing is everyone's running when is
there is it's been at least a year now
where we had heard that amazon was
actually going to release an amazon
video app on the Apple TV and it still
hasn't happened that's a bummer so uh I
don't know where the we still don't know
where the ketchup is technically it
should still be able to live on Apple's
platform I don't know if Amazon decided
I'll we're just gonna hold it back but I
amazon has typically been very free and
open about just making their content
available everywhere look at what they
did with the kindle um you know which
they put on every platform possible but
the apple TV is the only one where the
amazon app kind of the amazon video app
isn't there so that's what i want to see
but thanks for the call i'm still
waiting for chromecast on that on the
amazon app too yeah yeah yeah yeah so
they all hate each other all those
companies in each other I mean they're
trying to protect themselves I get it
but whatever come on just make it
everywhere man exactly okay next call
hey Brian isn't any from Texas and I'll
just wanted to give you a call and about
the samsung si si plus unveiling and
when it to ask if you could speak to
someone that may want to get my galaxy
that may already be in the apple
ecosystem it just what are some of the
features to someone we have if they got
a galaxy and wanted to have their ipad
and imac and some of those other Apple
devices under for me being able to text
on all the different advice different
device
just really handy and how pictures would
work so if you could just kind of think
to someone who's in the apple ecosystem
and considering getting one of those new
Samsung positive features and how all
that might work I love the show from the
middle of a tornado yes that was windy
but I think your points are good and
clear look with the galaxy samsung I say
you're right on my everyone that I known
that has switched at least off of Apple
for whatever reasons they miss a message
across all of Isis yeah like come on
your computer to your tablet to your
phone cheer watch like it's ever it'll
pop up everywhere yeah you will miss
that I look the advantages of the
platform is if you like Android and but
you specifically you have to like
Samsung's flavor of Android i prefer the
pure Google pixel experience I think
that's the best Android experience I
think most people will tell you the same
the Google assistant is there so if I
was if someone was gonna jump over to
Android beyond just having a
gorgeous-looking phone that only goes so
far for me I know the Google pixel isn't
the best looking phone in fact it looks
like an iphone right like you're talking
about Jim yeah but to me that is the
best android phone on the market right
now and just to know that that was their
first attempt and their second one it's
probably gonna be pretty ridiculous I
would just wait out and see what they do
before you make a decision but I know
there's plenty of people that you know
love Samsung's platform and I think it's
great it's just not the one that I like
yeah yeah but uh so you'll be missing
you know you will get the best damn
screen on planet earth that's for sure
um you know you won't have 3d touch I
don't know how many people really care
about it I think that's a polarizing
issue every time I say I kind of use it
but not really people get mad at barely
is it but i would say the majority of
users are i would say maybe thirty
thirty to forty percent of people react
i would say maybe thirty percent of
people really use it all the time and
care about it like that they would
defend it i think the rest of us don't
really use that much and might use it
once a blue moon or accidentally use it
i accidentally used it on Instagram the
other day oh okay
oh I could pick a pop pick a pop now you
know my parents have android phones and
i have an iphone so like texting with
them there's always like this weird
communication breakdown you know like
sometimes they don't get pictures or
videos and you know it's just it's
always kind of weird you know and then
and then what it comes down was like you
end up using a 3rd party app that cover
that but it's not as integrated like
you'll alway there's always ways to get
around it but you know it's look the
ecosystem has power no matter what side
of the coin you're on yeah yeah the
Google ecosystem has power as well
totally you know they just make it at
least a little easier to you know you
can use you can't use the Google
assistant on an Apple phone yet I Paul
apple iphone yet but you at least still
have access to google voice and all of
that it brings totally so i would just
wait it out I'm a pixel boy if I have to
go android mmm all right last call hey
Apple bike hey I just want one more bad
apple about the Apple TV not just the
fact that it's not in 4k but I set up my
TV system I wanted to get the fastest
streaming possible so I set of mine TV
with my router and one of the wire
everything's I wired my playstation and
then wired my app my apple TV right into
my my router thinking that that's going
to be the fastest but then I started
streaming some stuff and then I realized
it's lagging a little bit and lo and
behold the apple TV this is the newest
model doesn't have a gigabit port on the
back it's only to 100 so my internet
because I got new internet was three
minutes after so I what did i do I
unplugged it now i'm using new using
more Wi-Fi for my apple TV that six
inches away from my router so bad apple

that because I mean why go wireless if
it's right next to it but anyway good at
