checking out the Lenovo yoga tablet 2
with Windows now this is a 10-inch
tablet with a pretty nice screen a
quirky design the 2 to dwell and a
bundled Bluetooth keyboard dock all for
a starting price of 369 99 now it isn't
perfect but if you don't want to show
off for a surface pro 3 and they're
curious about that hybrid laptop tablet
design this inexpensive little gadget
could fit the bill
now let's start with the tablet the
tenant's display has in 1920 by 1200
pixel resolution and it's powered by a
quad-core Intel Atom processor coupled
with 2 gigs of RAM it'll tackle
streaming HD video and I spent some
quality time with tablet friendly games
like halo Spartan assault no complaints
there but don't expect miracles and this
hardware isn't going to be able to stand
up to demanding software tasks like
heavy photo editing and the like there's
only 32 gigs of storage but you can add
a 64 gig microSD card for a bit more
room the tablet also has this quirky
fold-out hint that spins out from the
cylinder running along the base you can
use it to prop the screen up at
different angles there's also a hole for
a hook so you can hang your tablet
somewhere I have no idea why you'd want
to hang your tablet but it doesn't
detract from the experience so why not
the pair of speakers sound fairly good
and their front facing which is awesome
you don't need to worry about blocking
the audio while you're holding the thing
or having it propped up the noble claims
you'll see up to 15 hours of battery
life - now unlike Microsoft Surface 4-3
the keyboard is bundled so you don't
need to worry about paying extra and we
know what makes great keyboards this one
connects via bluetooth and it's really
thin but the keys still offer just
enough travel distance so when you press
them typing feels comfortable the keys
are really spacious to my hands
personally is still a little too big for
it but even so I had a good time now
there's a touchpad here and while I
generally prefer to use this touchscreen
instead it's definitely serviceable if
you've got a tablet and a keyboard but
they're separated and here's where
things fall apart the keyboard connects
the tablet by way of these really weak
magnets on the lip here now it's obvious
based at how top-heavy this is that you
shouldn't grab it by the keyboard but
I'm still tempted to grab it by the
screen and the keyboard weight is enough
for it to just flop right off it's also
supposed to double as a cover for those
weak magnet strike again it's always
kind of sliding about it just makes me
lose
into the whole thing now this isn't a
deal breaker we've got an inexpensive
tablet that performs fairly well and
it's bundle with a keyboard that's
pretty great too
had there been some way to lock the
keyboard to the tab it securely so I'm
not too terrified when I'm carrying the
thing around this would have been a
winning budget by as it stands it's a
great device with a really annoying flaw
but maybe you'll get over it
