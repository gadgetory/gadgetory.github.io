and this is the Electrolux Peugeot
rapido power this $229 stick vacuum sits
in the lower price range but it has a
lot to offer similar to the ultra power
studio I also reviewed this has a nice
design it has a cute little clear
viewfinder so you can see the brush but
this model is lighter than the ultra
power studio it's less expensive and it
offers more features actually it's just
kind of strange but I really prefer this
model to the other the most obvious
difference is that it's a two-in-one
machine so instead of the ultra power
studio which is just a stick vacuum this
actually doubles as a handheld vacuum so
you can pop this out and use it on your
couch or anywhere else you might want to
use a handheld vacuum it performed
better than the Electrolux ultra power
studio but it still didn't perform as
well as some of the other models we
tested especially the hoover linx which
is a hundred and seventy nine dollars
it's definitely a cute machine it's
maneuverable it works pretty well and if
you like Electrolux I would get this one
over the ultra power studio but if you
want a solid upright vacuum for less I
would go for the Hoover Linx and if you
really do want to stick vacuum with
other accessories like the handheld
option I would recommend the dyson dc50
9 it is a lot more expensive at $499 but
it offers a ton of accessories and its
performance was great thanks for
watching i'm megan Willerton for CNN
appliances
