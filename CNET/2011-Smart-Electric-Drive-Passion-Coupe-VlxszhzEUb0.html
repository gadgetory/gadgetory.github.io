hate him like every time it shifts but
there are no shift when there is no
gearbox aha let's drive the 2011 smart
electric drive and check the tech the
electric smart is the same as the gas
engine one with five changes electric
motor replacing the three cylinder gas
engine
Genki transmission removed entirely a
lithium-ion battery pack from Tesla
lives under the seats a charger and port
are added an electric power steering is
installed okay just like a gas engine
for to all the businesses in the rear
under here is your now electric motor
same apparatus though in terms of the
arrangement on the gas engine car it's
all sitting sidesaddle driving the rear
wheels only now in this case we've got
here is a 30 kilowatt electric motor to
a one speed reduction gear so that
god-awful transmission in the gas engine
car is gone that's the best news now the
bad news 30 kilowatts is 41 horsepower
even for a guy this size that's not a
whole lot you're gonna get 0 to 60 km/h
in six and a half seconds that's 0 to 37
miles per hour top speed on this guy is
limited to 60 all out and your energy
efficiency is 87 mpg a that's that new
number that gives you the equivalency of
electricity to the energy found in a
gallon of gas kind of funny number but
it's the best thing we've got to go
apples to apples these days
now one of the issues I have with this
car is it makes a lot of strange noises
you'd say electric cars are silent but
maybe because this one's just so short
coupled or it's the stuff they're using
that it makes all kinds of weird whining
grinding howling sounds I wasn't really
crazy about that
okay so let's go for a drive is this
little guy simple situation turn the key
it's still in the Saab position down
here and again you've got a PRN D
shifter but there are no gears it's
either engaged or it's not even reverse
has no special gear it just flips the
polarity of the engine and runs it in
Reverse now the throttle is a little
little insensitive it kind of starts off
with kind of nothing for the first bit
of travel and then it kicks in unlike a
lot of electric cars you don't have this
massive lovely torque that we like so
much it's just isn't that powerful
that's kind of a little motor back there
now once you get under way and once you
get past that initial sort of Numb
tip-in on the accelerator I hate to say
this cuz all the smart haters will seize
on it but it really drives like a golf
cart it has that same sort of porpoising
thing because it's got a short wheelbase
you hear that electric motor pronounced
Li just like on a golf cart it's about
the size of a golf cart all it needs is
a little Surrey topper and a little bit
of that Dingle ball fringe and it's a
golf cart I'm on a grade now going up a
I don't know what is this seven eight
nine percent gray just a guess cars
having a hard time with this I'm floored
and there's an extra click in the gas
pedal or the accelerator I should say
that pours on extra oomph it goes from a
standard Drive of 20 kilowatts to a
little extra click right there when you
tap into all 30 kilowatts all 41 massive
horsepower it's just enough to get up
hills or to do passing maneuvers but
it's never as much as you'd like now
just like the gas engine smart fortwo
I just think it's a fun car to drive
it's sensible packaging not as your only
car for most people but as that second
sort of get around commuter ride I still
like this vehicle but it's underwhelming
on the electric side now those two pods
on top of the dash are gonna be a key
interest every time you drive this car
the one on the right is how much power
you're using when the needle swings to
the left its power delivery and how much
regen you're capturing when you're on
the brakes or coasting that's when it
swings down all the way down to ten so
this car can regen to a maximum strength
of 10 kilowatts but can power itself to
30 obviously regen is not equal to its
ability to power itself that would be
almost a perpetual motion machine
the one on the left is your battery
capacity it's the nearest thing you have
to arrange gauge this car doesn't tell
you how much range you have left on a
long grade on a freeway which this car
just barely handles you can watch that
needle on the left drop it's a little
unnerving electric power steering in the
smart electric because obviously there's
no where to power a hydraulic unit it's
always on unlike some cars like the BMW
7 hybrid the electric power steering
dies when the engine shuts off at a stop
sign which was a weird kind of a glitchy
thing for them this car always has
electric steering on and it's an
exceptionally tight Turner just like all
smart fortwo is the cabin tax nothing
special we've talked about that before
if you want to get a good read on that
go see our video on the standard
gas-powered smart fortwo okay charging a
smart electric is pretty routine like
most cars you've got what people call a
charger it's not it's a charge adapter
and cable the charger is in the car it's
kind of a complicated apparatus here's
our charge door here you recognize the
traditional SAE charging port this
handle is also common to all the
charging cars today from a Tesla to a
volt to a leaf to this guy now when you
get this plugged in it's going to take
12 hours to fully charge it 12 hours or
more on 110 and by the way I found out
the hard way it will not charge on a non
grounded 110 outlet so there goes
several million pre-1960 to homes unless
you've had all your wiring upgraded what
you really want to do is bring a level
two charger a 240 outlet out near the
car because you can't use extension
cords with this and that's gonna get you
a much better charge time from 20% to
80% in three and a half hours is how
they communicate it smart has a full
tutorial on getting one of those level 2
chargers installed at your place
honestly it makes it look like a real
drag once you do you'll find the charge
cost varies widely by your utility rate
plan and time of day you charge but here
in San Francisco for example at best
rate it would cost about a buck for a
full charge that should take you 60
miles 60 slow miles running the numbers
doesn't really work right now
estimates have you saving 460 dollars in
energy per 10,000 mile year compared
with a gas for two but you'll spend an
additional forty four hundred on the
lease for a net disadvantage of almost
four grand
even if gas prices keep soaring let's
say you're at least a couple grand in
the hole
that's why smart is quick to mention the
full production version of this car that
arrives in 2012 will be a lot cheaper
okay let's price this guy sit down
forty five six that's right forty five
thousand six hundred is the base price
about three times the cost of a gas
powered smart fortwo
the good news is you won't pay that
because you can't buy it you can only
lease it six hundred bucks a month for
the hardtop 650 I think it is for the
Cabriolet
now it's a lease as I mentioned which
means you probably won't qualify for
most if any of the various rebates and
credits out there that are typically
given for purchases as I understand it
it's an odd little bird but the leasing
does take uh some of the shock out of
the price and if you really want an
electric car you've only got a few
choices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
