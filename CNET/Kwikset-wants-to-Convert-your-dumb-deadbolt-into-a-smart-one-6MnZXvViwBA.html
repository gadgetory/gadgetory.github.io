been busy testing out a new smart lock
no it's not that dumb deadbolt but
rather a retrofit device that's attached
to it on the inside of the door it's
called the quick-set kevo convert and
with it I can use the Kibo app to lock
or unlock my door with just a tap at 150
bucks the Kibo convert is a little bit
less expensive than other smart locks
most of which cost at least $200 and
over about a week of testing it worked
really well installation was a breeze
thanks to the Kibo apps Illustrated
instructions all you really need is a
screwdriver in about ten or twenty
minutes of your time and don't worry if
you don't use a quick set deadbolt the
Kibo convert actually comes with
multiple sets of parts and adapters that
will let it work with a wide variety of
common residential locks so why would
you want to give your dumb deadbolt a
brain well for one it'll let you use
your phone to get in if you ever forget
your key or if you just need to check
whether you lock the door or not after
you've climbed into bed it'll also let
you share digital app enabled access
with others you can share as many of
these eqi's as you like and they can
even come with time restrictions or
expiration dates now pardon the pun but
there are also a couple of key
limitations here first of all the Kibo
convert uses bluetooth which means that
you can't control it remotely if you're
outside of Bluetooth range you can buy
the Kibo plus Wi-Fi gateway to fix that
and access it from anywhere but that'll
cost you another hundred bucks
and while the Kibo convert will connect
with a couple of notable third-party
products and services including nest
those connections seemed pretty shallow
to me for example you can connect the
lock lift but you can only use it to
trigger your if recipes you can't use
those ifs recipes to trigger the lock
you also can't connect the kevo convert
to any other larger smart home platforms
no smart things no twink no apple
homekit support and sorry alexa but
doesn't work with you either all that
adds up to a pre basic smart lock that
might be a really good fit for renters
who aren't allowed to ditch their
existing deadbolt but one hundred and
fifty dollars still feels awfully
expensive to me and probably not enough
of a disk
to keep me from spending a little more
on something with better features and
integrations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
