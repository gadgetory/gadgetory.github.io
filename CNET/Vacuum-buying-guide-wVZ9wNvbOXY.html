vaccum buying guide so the first thing
you want to think about is what type of
vacuuming you need to do there are so
many models available today that it can
be kind of overwhelming the most common
type of vacuum today is the upright
model prices for upright models can vary
a lot but it's usually between 50 and
about $700 that means that there are
also a lot of different features
available typically though the features
range from brush attachments or the
ability to vacuum on bare floors as well
as carpeting canister vacuums are
another popular model they're a bit more
versatile than the upright because you
can pick them up and take them with you
wherever you go so if you need to vacuum
stairs regularly they're very very
useful the only problem is that they
average to be about 10 pounds so that
might be a little too heavy for some
people to carry also prices for those
models range between about 60 on up to
$900 there's also robot vacuums which
are gaining popularity they're usually
under 10 pounds and they can cost
between 90 up to $600 it won't replace
traditional vacuuming but it is a great
supplement
there's also handheld vacuums which are
like the cute little dust busters that
you've seen they're really great for
cleaning bits of dust or clumps of pet
hair or one time spills they're also
really lightweight about five pounds and
a lot of them are cordless that's great
if you want to use at other places like
in your car there's also the stick
vacuum which is a smaller version of the
upright models they're lighter weight
and less expensive usually under three
hundred and fifty bucks they don't
typically come with all of the
accessories and features of an upright
model but they're really lightweight and
they still get the job done so they
might be great for a senior citizen the
last one we're going to talk about today
is the convertible vacuum convertible
vacuums offer great value
because they're kind of a two-for-one
you can get both an upright and a
canister or both a stick model and a
handheld all-in-one package
the shark rotator Pro lift-away vacuum I
recently reviewed is a great example of
this it's an excellent value it has tons
of features and accessories and you can
switch between upright and canister mode
