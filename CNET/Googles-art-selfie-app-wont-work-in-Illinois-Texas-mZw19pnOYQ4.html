the Google Arts and Culture app matches
your selfie to famous works of art and
it shot to the number one spot in the
Apple and Google App Store charts but
the app is drawing some privacy concerns
and depending on where you live you may
not be able to scan your face to see if
you resemble a Renoir google has
disabled the feature for residents in
Illinois and Texas two states with
strict laws on the use of biometrics and
facial recognition scans the Chicago
Tribune reports that some residents are
sending their selfies to add a state
friends to run their photos for them the
arts and culture app matches your selfie
against portraits and sculptures from
more than 1200 museums spanning 70
countries the feature has been around
for several weeks but it just recently
went viral over the long holiday weekend
the app uses machine learning to analyze
the person's face you'll notice
different results based on if you smile
or if you change direction but in a
statement to the Washington Post Google
said it is not collecting our faces to
build some giant face database and that
it's just doing this for the artwork
match but if you do care about more than
just sharing fun selfies the app also
lets you zoom into details of famous
masterpieces and take virtual tours of
famous museums and read interesting
stories what's your take on the
facial-recognition selfie mania share
your thoughts in the comments I'm
