to worsen I get up and I wash my hands
before I start eating all the bread this
is what I do so I get up I'm not a real
good Brent like a good local side
pretzel bread forget it oh we have like
a bunch of that in our freezer it's
amazing so yeah it's very fancy steak
house on that I get up I walked to the
bathroom and the gentleman sitting right
before the hallway entrance to the
bathroom I catch a glimpse at him for a
second and I continue on my way and as I
enter the hallway to the bathroom like
that was Michael J Fox and I like froze
in the hallway cuz I was like oh my god
that's Michael J Fox right there just
right outside the bathroom right outside
the bathroom just having dinner with his
lovely wife and another couple look what
weird was this i don't know if i should
like say the rest is a little I don't
want to be that guy to like but in your
neighborhood it was in midtown Manhattan
I'm antenna yeah that's safe I just was
curious if this is like far away or
close by right no it's definitely close
by I walked over there for dinner and
this funny cuz Stacy had gone to the
bathroom before me so I go in and I beat
her outside and i'm waiting there
because i want to tell her so I'm like
camped out the late outside the ladies
room she comes out and I'm like shh and
she's like what what's going on I'm like
when we walk outside you have to look
and I literally like drew a map on my
palm of palm of my hand to like show her
where he's sitting and not to look that
obvious when she goes out and just sort
of glances at him so so this works yes
health plan were totally worked and I
learn so I you serve like turning and
making it okay to give a map you're
holding in your basically so I'm like
I'm like I'm like just just act normal
I'm gonna act calm and when you go
outside he's facing our table and this
he's sitting in the adjacent booth like
he's right next to us okay crazy so like
I go go I'll let you go like 30 seconds
before just look casually he's right
he's right
here I had a whisper cuz I was scared he
might even hear me yeah so she goes head
jets yeah she goes and I wait 30 seconds
I sit down and like see here at the
booth and she's just like a smile ear to
ear Lee I don't know I've gotten to meet
a lot of celebrities in my time I've
never and I didn't meet him I just saw
him I've never been so starstruck like
that's Marty McFly man that's pretty
cool I've never met him before I've
never seen him I didn't know what it's
like and then so we said and we're at a
party of six so we're sitting down in a
booth and there's these two booths that
are adjacent to each other they're both
facing out towards the street and I'm
like I basically like duck down in the
booth to all the the rest of the people
that I'm sitting there I'm like guys
guys everyone Shh microphone shut up
shut up for a second the loud restaurant
he couldn't really like just shut up
okay behind her head one of the people
were with like don't look right now do
not look right now but Michael J Fox is
sitting just having dinner just enjoying
himself and he looked great and he just
he just seemed like such a good dude man
I just I was like I had to stop myself
from like going over there and hugging
him did this like set you up for the
whole weekend this is like this is it
this is rocket launcher the weekend
you're still on that I I am because I'm
reliving it now and the funniest thing
was this first thing I thought to do I
don't know why it was text my mom
because I knew if there was one person
that was gonna get a kick out of it she
would just lose her moms can be
really good at that so does my mom
doesn't really care that's always like a
downer but most of the time it's a good
right good first attempt and she knows
how I feel about Michael J Fox I know
how she feels about ever who doesn't
like my coach ever so I text her and she
freaks out okay and she goes say hi to
him and I wrote and that's why that and
all of a sudden I was like man am I glad
she's not here yes because that would
have been the word we like I'm already
gone I can't expect it was like a family
errand with the celebrity that's a tough
one you'd make ask him about this move
yeah ask him this one thing exactly for
me go there's a certain unwritten law in
Manhattan
you don't do that you don't maybe on the
street you say hey hi and you keep
walking you keep walking you don't even
stop you should you should but in a
restaurant money's with a fam no you do
not you can you can get a little peek
maybe a smile but you ever love to push
in there actually a couple things we had
dinner a long time ago and Paul Simon
was at the restaurant family theater
adding my family is one right over and
talk to him right they were just like
mr. Simon we love your music yo talk was
he upset no use he was happy it was it
was like the you know they paid
reverence without being quite too much
the elevator guy it's a there's a I feel
like you don't wanna miss Farley
elevators a fine line yeah oh you know
my parents my parents ran into jon
stewart in Red Bank in New Jersey yeah
and they were able to like successfully
make it happen I thought there's a fine
line though dude we were in an elevator
my dad and I in Las Vegas once with
Roger Ebert right we got in it was just
us three we were going up to some floor
I think to our hotel room my dad loved
Roger sure uh the conversation did not
go well oh really no it was tough my dad
was very gushy about it and was really
excited and he was there for a cab at
shire good backfire well you just kind
of I'm here for a convention very very
cool and and it seemed okay but just
kind of seemed like he was busy and then
my dad was just mentioning stuff and he
wasn't as excited he wasn't as excited
to meet my dad surprisingly haha you'd
be you'd be amazed their recent actually
I went to a wedding in California
similar moon tears I walked past Arnold
Schwarzenegger for what happened then
Atherton California and I freaked out
because I was with my mom and my sister
and we're just talking and then coming
just right walking one way and down the
other way is just our neural
Schwarzenegger talking this is it and
I'm just like looking at him as I walked
past and I don't want to tell my sister
I turned her afterwards it was Arnold
Schwarzenegger right so why didn't you
tell me right and then coming back from
the cafe we saw him again walking he was
just strolling up and down the street
but uh yeah I was pretty I was pretty
stunned yeah it's always such a weird
situation what you do arielle you ever
run into anyone like that that's an
amazing yeah I have stoled energy
I mean I've ran into a lot of
celebrities in like musicians and stuff
yeah but I've never really gotten
starstruck the one time I did was when I
met Mohamed Ali oh man yeah and I was in
LA I was just walking down roadeo or
something like that some rich area of LA
and he was just right there just
standing there but I didn't say anything
I just kept going because it's ongoing
yeah cuz he's you know he's older guy
and there's a crowd forming so I was
like I could tell he doesn't want this
for sure that's amazing that was my
excitement for for the weekend at all it
all happened on Friday that's uh that's
fantastic I was pretty good so I'm
excited for this I'm excited for that

Jets football I'm sure they weren't
playing that you're 0 for anyway Arielle
moon is in the control room what's up
Arielle how are you good good ah man I
hanukkah's weird because Hanukkah is the
one holiday they're like jumps around a
bunch well they all jump around for the
most it's skittish tsk you do know it's
like make up your mind Hanukkah yeah it
always wanted a way do you want to be a
thanksgiving thing or do you want to be
a christmas thing do you want to just
freaked everyone out and bleed into the
new year like kind of once at all it
wants to be like don't do anything just
my month anywhere I could be anywhere
we're it now we're it's like too late
we're going away I feel like we're not
really gonna celebrate it properly uh
and for the record when does it start
cuz I I do not know the 17th oh my god
here's my here's where my grandparents
roll over in their graves we was hyping
in windows Hanukkah start we was at a
plan with my in so with the kids and my
cousin and my sister yeah we de plan all
this stuff so Hanukkah begins the
evening of December 16th okay that's a
week from tomorrow yeah yeah how about
that and ends on Christmas Eve see it's
just a fluid this year just Hanukkah as
the preview not for the same religion
but yeah you have this connection we
celebrate both on both sides of the
family you know what I'm getting from
Hanukkah this year no oral surgery Oh
awesome wait on the first night I was
like sounds I this is the first night
waiting for the second that finale for
me the Chanukah finale I'm actually
giving and not taking yeah they're
removing something from my face they're
also removing money from your from your
account yes hopefully that's well I
always always get nervous about like
making sure I've enough to cover that
anytime there I never know what's gonna
happen it's like you're right it's a
wrap you could be free it could be like
no this million dollars are free yeah
the most men are not even had like
serious dental work in a very long time
and I know I need to go it's just crazy
because they don't they have they really
have no idea like what each company's
gonna cover they're like this could be
three hundred dollars or five thousand
dollars all right well as long as it's
that small of a range of prices do you
find I hate what I go in they tell me I
pay what I think is the amount that it's
gonna cost ya and then like a few weeks
later some other letter arrives and
they're like this is the amount you owe
your like those like a fake nude boy
yeah they're whatever they said
apparently Spanish prisoner total lie
like what the hell good man you just yet
they don't want to tell you that to your
face and then you have to arbitrate
they're so cryptic it's like all of the
alts like all of America's you know
Medicaid and medical insurance passes
through the North Korean government and
then comes back here to be deciphered my
family are mostly doctors i always ask
questions about this type of stuff and
never one answer yeah cuz it says it's a
sore subject yeah um alright I I didn't
think we were gonna have to bring this
back and I brief Scott before we got
going today okay I didn't think we're
gonna have to revisit this awful topic
but it's just it's just kind of blowing
up in Discovery Channel's face so hard
that I just want to reopen that wound
we're talking about the butthead from
last night's eaten a live episode
obviously if you listen to our show you
know how we feel about this so the guy
who was supposed to get eaten alive by a
20-foot anaconda okay author Paul
Rosalie is his name if you're looking
what to like inspiration for genius to
like angry angry memes right I'm gonna
put that in there he was only briefly
munched by a 20-foot anaconda before he
got Oh a little scared dude what did you
expect what nature's most fearsome sort
of predators and you're like oh man wait
it's really eating rate that was a
terrifying idea from the get-go
it it encapsulated many people's worst
nightmares uh so yeah we thought it was
I was gonna transcend that I thought it
was going to show us here yeah it's like
you know what you're gonna tell me the
nightmare clowns not under my bed and he
was like now I'm not gonna do it
nightmare clown that you want any eden
by an anaconda it was he worried at the
soup I'm worried that the suit would
leak you'd say an econo ass and he said
it was yeah that it was preventive
against digestive acid but how do you
know if you're in there and sounds like
wait guys guys my arms back shame our
was being eaten right there's a leak
digestive juices on my arm how do you
get out the but the best is the quote
though like sweetie see the whole thing
you just laugh at because it's like man
what kind of jackasses are really
running this network because let's be
honest this was the most jackass idea
I've ever heard for a television show to
get that far and come on discovery
channel to like let's never forget that
let's never forget this is under the
umbrella of the disco seems painfully
invasive for the Anaconda yes right like
that magnificent anaconda right you
should have an anaconda protection or
it's amazing what they say they go they
go ultimately after the snake
constricted Paul for over an hour and
went for his head the experiment they're
calling it an experiment and not like
just playing with fire the experiment
had to be called when it became very
clear that Paul would be seriously
injured if he continued on the safety of
all as well as the Anaconda was always
our number one priority I'm
sorry man how can you say force-feeding
in anaconda a human in a weird suit is
in any way in the safety safety interest
of said anaconda like how Li not at all
not at all but I think you're right
maybe what happened was I'm just
thinking if you went through the first
experiment those have really strong
muscles right they can like crush a car
my first thought would be so you'd be
protected in the suit it would break
your spine or do something you would get
so contorted in there that's why would
he began to realize was like oh wow my
head's being
that backwards so that I wish I shall
die because I'm going into an anaconda
well I don't know maybe that's it it's
insane I just had it impossible it's
crazy we'll never get to the point where
we were able to be suave an anaconda
family we have hit our limit God it
pisses me off so much I just don't
understand and that's the only reason
I'm bringing up because the guy after
all this after all the weeks and weeks
leading up to us and the protest and
everything he got cold feet and he puts
that I think first of all you could if
you were smaller you think you want like
a smaller adventurer to wear the suit Oh
somebody gonna agree in torsion is let's
hear for someone who's just like can fit
like like acrobatic if into a tiny box
he I don't think he was that type i
think it was like a guy i want to smell
like he could do this i want to see if
this offends you but you probably
because we've was an offensive thing we
were talking about this okay week we got
crazy we went totally off the deep end
with like other ideas they could do and
we're a back out of people not back out
of but we realize i think would be
interesting like maybe a very large
person could house a very small person
if that does it sort of like duckies
I'll wrangler Ninja Turtles if you will
swallowing within swallowing yeah with
all of them with cameras yeah well total
21 like inner space but to the max I
think like a three or four level like
camber to that's stomach camera three
let's go up to one and then vomit them
all that be actually that doesn't offend
me that's interesting I think that's a
movie pitch more likely in centipede
sorta stay yeah that's like that's gonna
get made that movie is gonna get made
now probably next year right oh I think
for sure inspired by the end of Conda
story like like a man nested swallowing
it's unbelievable I'd watch a few
minutes of them maybe I don't know I I'm
so glad it ain't that thing last night
the time of day we're gonna keep things
a little light today I want to bring up
this I'm not a huge fan of grumpy cat
you know about grumpy cat I know that
it's out there I've singing grumpy cat
like I did watch the movie so there was
a movie okay so tell me about this movie
before you tell me what does anyone else
feel like grumpy cat is like the
equivalent of seeing the face of Jesus
in a piece of wood
I think them Jesus and a piece of wood
is more profound yeah sure that seems
really seems like a more like this seems
like it's doing it too much justice
right like this cat's face is just like
stuck like this and this is just what it
looks like and we perceive like it being
grumpy when clearly a cat like the cat's
not bummed out it's like I just looks
bum it's just its face looks gross she's
never seen happy cat so it's like to me
it's not like I'm looking at lots of
smiling cats all the time we're just so
cheery and this one is yeah that's
that's the weird part you're never gonna
guess how much money grumpy cat has
actually made its owner Tabitha bun-bun
dicin the 29 year old a year old owner
of grumpy cat has revealed that she's
made around a hundred million dollars
what what off of this furball I was
thinking would be a hundred thousand
maybe I thought maybe like a three
million or at Red Lobster once their
feet thirty-five dollars in valuable
coupon it's it a hundred million bucks
hundred off at that face is stuck like
real dollars like I'm dreaming real
doubt real dollar is that from from what
part from ads or it's just from
licensing deal yeah licensing and yet
t-shirts and our celebrity appearances
and I'm sure there's some licensing
that's happened if you recall the move
the Lifetime movie deal right which is
real talk about tell me about okay I
just heard about this on on Twitter one
night and I thought okay I'm always good
for just randomly tuning it my wife was
not on board with this I don't remember
the name of it it was like happy
holidays with grumpy cat or something
grumpy cat's Christmas grumpy cat's
worst Christmas ever because grumpy cats
always bummed out right so you have uh
what's-her-name you of Aubrey Plaza yes
in this as the voice of grumpy cat so
I'm already feeling like among all
lifetime movies I'm much closer to
watching this now than anyone before but
I actually get bad timing I caught the
end of the movie before the beginning
started again bruh is like on endless
screening loop so i watch the last five
minutes and it wasn't very good and then
i watched the first 10 minutes and then
i decided then
then that was the the wifely like you
know she's like get off the TV there's
other things we should be doing now with
our night like we should watch other
show sure mystic let's move on with her
and exactly get onto other shows that
are better than this so that was it and
I thought the opera plaza casting
decision was a really bad one who seemed
seemed totally uninterested but it
wasn't even like in a good viral way it
was like she is like that great acid
style that's that's awesome but it
somehow it didn't even work for this how
did how does it not fit even this I
don't understand did you ever see that
netflix movie about the talking cat you
know nose like a cult movie about it's a
terrible the room style movie about like
a talking cat never so terribly voiced
over sort of felt like that in car um
but not as good it's worth noting though
that hundred million dollar mark is
being contested like it's worth noting
like a lot of people you don't believe
it I don't believe um I can't I have a
tough time swallowing that as well the
owner this Tabitha woman says she will
gladly divulge and discuss how much
money she has made off of grumpy cat if
the price is right for a right for an
interview for Angelina I'll reveal is a
self in prophecy though that is how you
will discover it's funny though that
that that that's the number that sort of
floating around is a hundred million
obviously anyone with who's maybe
thought about it for a little bit done a
little bit of research realizes wow that
seems like a crazy amount of money but
yeah I mean I have a tough time
believing it too I guess has the price
now been set for uh for exotic viral
animals yeah this little er yeah cool 10
billion I'm gonna get like angry snake
yeah for sure ever enter that show I
want to hang grease Nick I'll never make
that one I I want to talk a little bit
about two things before we leave the
first thing maybe three if we have time
the first thing is VR stuff oh yeah okay
so approach CES as we approach the yes
and I guess this will be like some of
the tech stuff we talk today it's light
it's a Monday um what so you've been
seeing a lot of this stuff lately I have
and we were talking before the show
started like there's there's like
inherent technological hurdles that VR
has
I like what's the best VR you've seen
what did you just see and and what was
that cool number you threw out oh yeah
so the big announcement today or big if
you've been following VR stuff you know
Samsung's gear VR which is a phone-based
accessory that goes on to the samsung
galaxy note 4 right is like an extra VR
headset there's a partnership with
oculus that is now available to order so
you can buy a ER headset to work with
your samsung phone with just your note
for just the no 4 just what does it do
why do I want it well you we have had a
couple of years now firstly like what am
I gonna do with this thing yeah besides
look ridiculous right you got this gut
you know you got this like you know ski
mask goggly finger to put on put stick
your phone in it yeah Oh your photos in
it your phone goes in it culex feel like
keep selling me annika almost there
again yeah yeah they're just wait
there's more cost two hundred dollars
250 you get the version that also comes
with the gamepad they've a bluetooth
gamepad great yes says all right love it
I in all fairness because the easy thing
is to say what why am I gonna come on
man not gonna get this er hat already
has an awful PR ditch to dig itself out
of there are a ton of problems and make
smart watches look like like an easy run
right when you look at the are you do
this massive thing on your face but your
after year you know okay so the big
other competitors are competitors but
the companies that are getting into this
right now oculus rift obvious still
doesn't have a product still have a
product in year after year you see
what's really impressive looking
immersive VR but no product yet and no
clear sign of one's going to come out
right once again they'll beat Seattle
beat CS and yet thing will happen like
the next iteration toward something
right and then we've seen project
Morpheus which is the PlayStation 4 10
works of different accessories like move
accessories yeah and again when is that
going to come out right is it going to
come out what you know so the year after
year III three you're seeing these
things getting trotted out sure playing
them again so people are selling once
it's going to happen well this is the
first one I can think of that you say
well this is the commercially the
commercially available yeah but it's
called innovator edition it's clearly
their labeling this alpha experimental
you know just for enthusiasts right
they're not planning on selling them to
make money they're just sort of getting
it out there's putting out there and
part of that is probably the partnership
with oculus well that's gonna soak oh so
what was like the interesting thing that
you said that a lot of these VR headsets
are falling short because they just are
two pix elated right yeah so when you
put these on one thing that is cool and
then the part isn't cool is that they
really I think they actually feel you
use project Morpheus yeah they feel
pretty immersive yes you say like well
the 3d part of it and how you move your
head around work feels better than you'd
think it would we go oh come on i right
that's going to work your brain has an
easy time buying yeah you sort of like
stare go into the landscaping rice orbit
your their gear VR which is the
impressive part actually for that
immersive pneus feels really similar to
oculus rift and project Morpheus more
than you'd think for just putting a
phone in like the general immersive
goggle thing very similar graphically
are more limited but the pixelation is
the thing so you're dealing with a
really high res screen on the note 4
quad HD which is like was a 25 I mission
it's well above 25 x x 16 like that um
it's really it's really high-end it's a
you know it's approaching like a it's
like a 4k type experience android mobile
type thing sure so that's more pixels
you ever need on a phone but when you
were using this to do 3d first of all
you're splitting that image right in two
and then your magnify projecting it on
your eye looking at through a big
magnifying lens so imagine you're
looking at a screen through that and
you'd see the pixels where you see the
pixels you can see through the pixels
which is the weird thing that is weird
you know so like that you you you get
the idea of like it's like an Atari but
pixelated blocky but through that screen
almost the 3d comes through right but if
you're looking at photos and videos
there's a chance you'd look at it and
think this immersive pneus looks really
cool yeah but it's not going to look as
crisp and amazing as on my phone or on
my TV so where do we have to be in order
for our brains to not be able to tell
difference between VR and real life
right we're staring at and going I'm
looking across the room the 3d effect of
school now I'm lookin at that camera or
this table and man the detail is perfect
I mean remember speaking with with some
folks at oculus and the number that was
thrown out there when I looked at one of
the prototypes new Crystal Cove was it
was it that one I'm getting okay you see
a lot of VR there's a lot of your things
you've gone VR crazy 8k was a number
that was thrown so that that way a
moment when VR would become to really
hit that moment so easily immerse so
what retina did for printed paper and
text communique could do for VR and true
to life that is a photo realism yeah and
so you'd say what I'm ever use a que
displays for well vr is something they
can actually use it or maybe they find
some other way around it right right now
it's it's it's okay but it's it that
pixelated pneus for for lack of a better
word is doesn't feel pixelated so much
is that you can see the actual set that
the graphics are pixelated it's the
actual display you can actually see the
displays pixels right sense so you're
seeing through that you go so if you're
playing like on a on a Morpheus or
oculus I still feel like I can see a
little bit of the screen sure me sure
that's a problem plus processor power I
mean right you're pushing that yeah I
mean we have a hard enough time II the
idea even pushing 4k for anything
interesting like games is gonna take a
really long time it's weird I feel I
don't know how all this VR stuffs gonna
shake out because my opinion just have
like too many different technologies on
different levels of like chronological
to you know advancement and nothing's
really lining up well there's a tailor
attempts to that's the interesting
things is so gear VR you're running off
of this Snapdragon 805 and you're
dealing with it's a mobile Android
system so there are games and some of
them look pretty cool we're like mobile
games better than you might think sure
for rightly they don't really feel that
slowed down but they will feel less
graphically rich gotcha but they're in
3d but then they claim that some of the
picture and video stuff yeah should be
able to go up into other levels of VR so
on a PC side maybe you start creating
these experiences for um I mean they're
shooting videos now using spherical
cameras right and they do is to create
these kind of high mountains look around
and look around that's theoretically
great but getting the set up with that
camera any of a smaller sort of unit
yeah getting enough of that content
made it is going to become tough to me
to justify that I like the idea of
experimenting with this but sure I agree
for the average person it's just not
it's just not there yet and nobody even
on the side of people making this nobody
feels it is they still feels like
there's an idea that this is two or
three years away from even hitting a
moment of wow the Sun you really want to
buy but it's finally becoming and you
can't interact with it so you know you
want to reach out and grab some right
you feel parallel you have to look
around like this is a touchpad yeah and
you click the touchpad or use a game
controller so you're kind of doing this
you're kind of doing like Google glass
you're sure i doing like a little you
just you just look crazy if you see
people playing games on glass I've ever
seen that you know it's like that you're
sort of doing a thing where you're
tapping some technology great great this
is where we are we're the bleeding edge
right upside head tapping but it is out
there for people want to make that stuff
and dive in I think that's the idea that
this is a cheap ish kit that you could
get if you're interested in development
there'll be more on this absolutely next
month at CES if you can believe it in
one month will already be out there in
Las Vegas for for CES 2015 in a month
will almost be done I know it's don't
remind me being a hour tired victory lap
what would I rather you ask me what
would I rather have oral surgery or go
to CES the answer might surprise you ok
swallowed by an anaconda ya sea
swallowed by a gun ah so last night just
real quicks the sony playstation network
was hacked again seemed just like a
takedown hack but for a couple hours
last night it was not working and a
group called lizard squad I'm sorry
hacking groups you got to get some
better names that sound scary being
users pretty scared I don't know if I
find the idea being hacked terrifying
yeah but like it these guys are they're
there hacking and they're doing all this
nefarious garbage and then they're like
gotcha lizard squad it's like how are
you so good at hacking but so shitty at
naming your organization up with
incredibly awesome up with school things
man outsource it to James Cameron or
Michael Bay and have them create the
name for you there's I can
million good names and all the wind
gibson novel yeah he does right right
get ashore what's one cool name off the
top here can you think of one a
wintermute was on wintermute gone yeah
was the hacking group ever you're cooler
than an honor mr. music is terrifying it
and loll second all these guys just get
a better name that's not a lot to ask is
it do some research on all they named it
after a neal stephenson novel or
something can name him after like Billy
Joel albums even they're fine you know
turnstiles done even call yourselves
like the midnight society yeah that's
cooler than lizard squad and mean we
have a ms of a personal meaning or
something might have a son you know I
don't know maybe they're hoping like
Arizona and I will admit I am you're
more skin terrified I've criticizing the
name if their name was axin jihad like
in True Lies I'd be wasting more scared
right I'm sorry so I gotta say it's all
I can say finally it's not my favorite
is it not my favorite name it's not you
could say it's terrible like I don't
think they're gonna target you you could
be laying all others are squad you guys
are pretty scary but your name sucks I
think it's the squad part exactly yeah I
just think it's that part I like the
idea of like I like a name like a web
bright or a net yeah like an all-seeing
you know sort of I like if that were a
logo of a company finally mine finally I
want to talk about more scary sci-fi
stuff a techno paranoia themed show that
you've recently gotten into and I want
myself to get into uni that's called the
black mirror yeah called black mirror
black mirror what's it about it's on
netflix now why should people check it
out yeah this is not available to watch
in an easy way for all for a long time
maybe there was no way to buy it there
was no way to rent in two seasons right
to seasons okay with a third christmas
special on the way cuz of course it hey
no as i love UK television this is a
Christmas special for everything alright
so tell me is like the wire christmas
special machine old ya know they would
totally do that get me the quick like
elevator pitch up it with black mirror
so people can why they should check it
out um it's twilight zone for a paranoia
driven technological bleeding edge
future it's like Max Headroom okay uh
but with the episode length of Sherlock
or close to it five minutes not an hour
and a half okay I can handle you know
you have your classic British TV season
of like three episodes so each each
series is only three episodes only six
episodes total that they tackle
bleeding-edge weird questions of
identity and culture and horrible
situations really wonderfully made and
these are made in 2011 Charlie Brooker's
a guardian columnist to write you know
just say they dove in our writing these
really critically acclaimed pieces I've
looked actually two of the episode so
far both were extremely upsetting really
upsetting yeah they're really world I
mean are there just like their settings
really like what the Hopi I'm sort of
like tell like we're done there's knows
there's no going back sorry much it the
classic sort of we're done there's no
going back it's very much of the like
more about Twitter Facebook community uh
horrible aspects like internet actually
feels more appropriate now for all the
stuff that we've been dealing with in
2014 right on all fronts yeah that
usually happens yeah kind of feels like
it's perfect timing flicks yeah yeah
because I hit 2011 maybe people thing
about the possibilities we've been in a
lot of this stuff now I kinda feel like
there are many things 2014 that could in
Black Mirror episodes yeah that are
black mayor episodes real pretty cool so
yeah you should watch it everyone or
watchin yeah I wanna check it out but
it's you know I don't want to overhype
it but I I I found that it still was was
really great and there should be more
things like that it reminds you that
we're in such changing times that I
wanted a Twilight Zone for our age for a
long time this gets really close to it
man it's so funny you bring that up
because New Year's New Year's Eve is
coming fast approaching and like I want
every year I just binge on that sci-fi
twilight zone marathon because those
episodes are still so relevant and
they're they're timeless and they're
really amazing stuff well it's weird
there were a lot of times with our
limits and other shows and people
experimented with this and I don't know
why I think we're going to get back to
it everything is like black mirror gonna
draw
even like a queer lit with like x-files
to it definitely bleeds into that whole
genre for sure Bryant really until i
binge connected plot lines yeah but I
want to get back to the anthology all
right go check out black mirror on
