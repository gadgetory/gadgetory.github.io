to the apple white for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
start with Apple's rumored March
fifteenth event which has now been
confirmed for marks the 21st according
to recode and other sources not only has
the date change but the product lineup
has morphed a little bit as well now
9to5 mac reports that apple has decided
to drop the five from the 5se and will
simply call it the iphone s ii it's
reported Apple employees have referred
to it internally as the iphone special
edition well some of you called it the
addition when I asked for your ideas
macrumors commissioned designer Thomas
moyano to create a mock-up that combined
the rumoured curved edges of the iphone
6s that you can see here with a boxer
shape of the iphone 5s to come up with
these renderings but really what's so
special about this if it's replacing the
iphone 5s with no new technology yeah
I'm just going to hold onto my bad apple
until this one's official now the March
twenty first event is also expected to
include a new iPad but not a new ipad
air 3925 max sources say the new 9.7
inch iPad will be part of the new iPad
pro line this smaller iPad pro will have
nearly identical features as its big bro
with an a 9x processor Apple pencil
support and the smart connector which
will allow this iPad pro to connect to a
smaller smart keyboard as well stereo
speakers will be a part of this product
but it's an attempt to really simplify
its iPad lineup now the key difference
is that the new 9.7 inch model is
expected to include a 12 megapixel
camera similar to the one found in the
iPhone 6s the current iPad pro the one
that i have only has an 8 megapixel rear
camera that also means this iPad would
be capable of shooting 4k video and
helping to increase the exploding user
base of iPad camera enthusiasts which
scares me now new Apple watch bands are
still expected as well so we'll just
have to wait to officially find out
everything in just a few more weeks we
also still don't expect to see the
iphone 7 make an appearance people are
still all torn up about the headphone
jack situation but a recent
grant it to Apple this week revealed
their plans for magnetically detachable
wireless earbuds for the iphone now
check this out the patent drawing
showcase a main audio cable that's
connected to a device and a magnetic
system that attacted the earbuds on
their own cable to it the main host cord
is described as having the ability to
charge the batteries for the detachable
headphones with a wired audio signal but
once it detects that is disconnected the
system stops charging and activates
wireless communications and even this
the drawing show a version that is just
specific to detachable earbuds this is
sick and we could possibly see this in
the next iPhone all right in the Apple
versus FBI battle the two spent over
five hours testifying to congress over
the battle for Apple to help the FBI
gain access the San Bernardino's
terrorist phone there was no definitive
conclusion but alongside the tech world
the ACLU and three other privacy groups
have put their support behind Apple
saying what the FBI is requesting would
violate the privacy and security of
Americans as it would require a private
American company Apple to act as an
agent for investigations now in a
separate case a magistrate judge in New
York ruled that the government using the
all writs act can't force Apple to
unlock the iPhone and is reaching too
far this case dealt with the drug
trafficking investigation and again a
government request for access to an
iphone but it could give Apple an upper
hand going into its legal battle with
the FBI now we ask you the Alpha by
nation to chime in with your thoughts on
this whole situation for you know a free
sticker harl says Apple shouldn't create
a backdoor for the FBI because that
would be a bad apple now fed for change
says given the feds own problems with
cybersecurity they may come to regret
weakening protections ouch then Simone
culture said my phone my peanut butter
and jelly stay away government that just
made me hungry now on Twitter clean rod
rights since when did a dead terrorist
have a right to privacy and J pichardo
on twitter says I bet if Apple makes a
car they will make a coop so that
and of their products have a back door
yeah NJ it also won't come with windows
rim shot two times okay pay attention
now this might be more important
compared to anything that happens
between the Apple and FBI I introduced
you the macbook selfie stick this is
real you won't be able to purchase one
but it's a creative project from New
York City artist Moises John Yoo Yi and
Tom galley this could be a statement on
where we're going next and how horrible
it will look so you know I had to look
it up and found that yes indeed there
are also I've had selfie sticks
available on the market today that is
just a brutal bad apple however is
making those needs to be knocked over
the head and if I see anyone in public
with an iPad selfie stick I will trip
you and finally one of my favorite video
games of all time Mortal Kombat X just
got a massive update with mortal kombat
x i'll bring some characters like alien
and let the face in that don't hit stage
fatality you can also play the iOS
version of the game that unlocks cool
new costumes in the console and you only
do that if you're like a die-hard fan
that doesn't go out with your friends
and stays up at 1am at night anyways the
good people at Warner Brothers have
given me two codes for both the ps4 and
the xbox one for the pool game just
tweet me at brian Tong with a hashtag MK
XL tell me your favorite character and
why pg-13 cosplay pictures are welcome
as well alright that's going to do for
this week thanks for watching we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
