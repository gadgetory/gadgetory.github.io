Internet if you're a true grilling
fanatic seasonal changes probably won't
keep you from coming outside and cooking
up your favorites and in that spirit we
decided to take the six thousand nine
hundred and ninety nine dollar links
smart grill out for a spin this week one
quick glance of this girl and it's very
clear that it's a premium product but
there's a lot more to it than its
high-end looks for starters this thing
is Wi-Fi enabled and has android and iOS
apps full of recipes that you can use to
track your food remotely then the grill
will walk you through the entire cooking
process it's great for novice grillers
basically setting everything to the
correct temperature for you letting you
know exactly when you need to flip the
corn and take it off the grill most of
these connected features worked really
well I received prompt updates both
through the voice control feature as
well as in the app and everything I
cooked from the recipe database
including corn on the cob beer can
chicken and filet mignon turned out very
well but it's really hard to overlook
the fact that this thing costs seven
thousand dollars and the fact that its
built-in microphone often had trouble
understanding me even if I was standing
right next to the speaker and enunciate
as clearly as I possibly could so do you
need a nearly seven thousand dollar
grill to make a decent meal absolutely
not but the connected app actually did
make a grilling novice like me a bit
more comfortable with the process on the
other hand the voice control feature was
really hit or miss it actually made the
process a little bit more frustrating a
little bit more complicated than it even
needed to be that makes this excellent
performing premium looking girl kind of
tough to recommend in its current state
just because for six thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine dollars I would
expect it to be nearly perfect in terms
of features usability performance and
design
still it's a fair option for folks with
a really big grill budget who like
advanced features like remote ass
functionality be sure to check out my
