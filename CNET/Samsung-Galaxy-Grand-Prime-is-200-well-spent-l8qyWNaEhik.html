phones you can get for under $200 all in
and this one is one of the best I'm
Jessica's all-court for CNN and this is
the Samsung Galaxy grand Prime with
Cricket Wireless now this is a budget
phone so you have to expect that the
specs are going to be okay but not great
good for what it is we've got a 5-inch
display here which is very good however
the resolution is very low for phone
this size 965 540 you would want 720p at
the very least it's got a quad-core
Snapdragon 410 processor 1.2 gigahertz
somewhere between the screen in the
processor videos and games look kind of
choppy it's not going to ruin your day
you can still immerse yourself in them
but this is definitely one sign that
this is a budget device another is that
it's got Android 4.4 KitKat that's not
up to date lollipop is the most recent
however you're still going to find
everything you need like Google now on
the back we've got an 8 megapixel camera
it takes very decent shots especially in
broad daylight
it's got autofocus and flash so those
are very good things impressively the
front has a 5 megapixel camera it's got
a lot of selfie controls of modes like
for airbrushing and also for taking a
wide-angle selfie now this phone does
have a removable battery which a lot of
fans are going to like and there is a 64
gigabyte microSD card slot underneath
that battery so that's going to augment
the storage on here which topped out at
8 gigabyte right now I will say that
this is the best phone that I've
encountered in the sub $200 category so
if you're looking for an inexpensive
device that will still do your proud
then I would definitely take a look at
this one be sure to check out all my
pros and cons and the full review of the
Samsung Galaxy grand prime @c Netcom
