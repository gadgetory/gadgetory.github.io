and down aisles trying to find that one
last thing on our list so Lowe's is
rolling out to new tech experiences to
help make shopping and home improvements
a little bit easier the first is an app
to navigate and find items in the store
with computer vision using digital maps
of each store the app actually works out
the quickest way to get to the items on
your list and then the fastest way to
check out it's powered by Google's tango
technology where special cameras sense
depth in 3d this means tango can measure
objects map a room and see virtual
things in the real world it's already
been used in museums for augmented
reality tours in store a yellow overlay
shows the path to the next item on your
list it's straightforward and the
cameras didn't get confused when I
quickly turned around or put the phone
down to grab an item the only issue is
that there's just one tango phone right
now
the Lenovo fab 2 Pro more devices are
coming later this year but in the
meantime you can borrow a phone in store
to try it out it's launching in April at
two US stores in Sunnyvale California
and Lynwood Washington
if real world shopping isn't enough try
home improvements in our virtual roles
this VR experience on the HTC vive walks
you step-by-step through projects like
retiling a bathroom who would have
thought that home DIY and tiling would
be a relaxing process haptic feedback
from controllers and visual indicators
tell you where you're going right or
wrong before you DIY for real oh well
okay Lowe's is trialing it in a few
stores to start with but eventually the
VR app will be available to download so
you can practice skills at home
this is what happens when you're looking
at your phone screen and nobody knows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
