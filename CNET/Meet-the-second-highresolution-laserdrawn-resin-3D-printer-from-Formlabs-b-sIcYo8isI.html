first look at the form labs form to 3d
printer this is the second version of a
printer that was initially conceived and
funded from a Kickstarter campaign back
in 2012 the company was founded by a
couple engineers and designers from MIT
who raised 2.8 million dollars to build
the first form one but today thanks in
large part to the feedback from the
Kickstarter community and of course
years of research and development
formlabs is back with the forum too now
this one is very different from most of
the 3d printers you see on the market
today
now those models operate kind of like 2d
printers but instead excrete molten hot
thermoplastics from an actual printhead
the form too however continues formlabs
stereo lithographic model stereo
lithography was actually the first 3d
printing technique to be invented and it
uses a blu-ray laser that actually
traces part of the model image onto the
surface of a bed of liquid resin the
orange cover blocks ultraviolet lights
coming in that then hardens the sliver
and the process starts again as the
completed object is slowly lifted out of
the resin bath layer by layer as
complicated as that sounds I checked out
an early look at the model at a briefing
last month with a form labs team and
it's actually a very simple process for
the consumer you just unpack the printer
install the rural print tray and insert
one of the new resin cartridges directly
into the machine like you would any ink
cartridge on a 2d printer the new model
even adds a touch screen display for
managing print jobs and a Wi-Fi
connection that will automatically send
progress updates to mobile devices in
case you want to step away from the
printer for a while or if you're
planning to share it amongst several
users so why stereo lithography well one
thing is that these printers can add a
level of detail that standard fused
filament printers can't and that's
whether you're printing something big or
something super tiny like a ring the
ultra-high resolution also does a good
job at hiding the individual layers of
plastic from plain sight you can barely
even see the lattice pattern formed by
the plastic layers which really makes it
seem like the objects were cut from one
solid piece of plastic you can buy the
form 2 right now for $3500 which
includes a 3d editing
we're resin and a finished kit for
post-processing you can read more
details about the upgraded form - in the
full first take but that's going to do
it for me you just took a first look at
the formlabs form - 3d printers thanks
