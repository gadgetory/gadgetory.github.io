the g37 that's right it's infinities new
2015 Q 50s sport sedan and as you can
tell stylistically it's a much more
handsome and muscular a more modern car
than the g37 was but if you peek under
the hood you'll find that the two cars
quite literally share the same heart
let's hop behind the wheel and I'll
explain more under the hood we've got
Infiniti D Q series 3.7 liter engine
that's a specifically vq3 7vh R for the
Nissan nerds keeping track that's
actually a much older engine than much
of the competition's using it's been in
use in the g37 and the q50 dating back
to 2008 and it's basic design is even
older than that about two decades old
for the VQ series output is about 328
horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque
but it does kind of feel like an older
engine and it's a little bit less lively
than for example the smaller
displacement turbocharged engine that
you're getting from BMW and Audi these
days the Q 50s and rear-wheel drive trim
is good for about 23 miles per gallon
combined which isn't terrible but it's
still about 4 to 5 miles per gallon off
the pace from comparable BMW and Audi
models now that v6 engine is going to be
paired with a 7-speed automatic
transmission which you've got here or a
6-speed manual gearbox 7-speed automatic
does have paddle shifters that are
interestingly attached to the shift
column not the steering wheel so they
don't turn with the wheel that's a very
race car like design it's pretty cool
but it does mean that you don't really
have as good access to them when you're
turning the wheel as I stated earlier
rear wheel drive is standard but all
wheel drive is available as an option on
this vehicle now one area of the q50
that is not an old design is going to be
the suspension platform you notice
immediately there's not a big dead spot
around the steering wheel and that any
sort of small twitches in the steering
position translate almost immediately
into results from the chassis and you
get a very good seat-of-the-pants feel
and pretty good steering wheel feel
which is something you don't really get
a whole lot of in this class
vehicle.now in the dashboard we've got
infinity in touched dual screen
infotainment system now basically the
way this works if there are two screens
stacked on top of each other in the
dashboard both of them are touch
sensitive but the top screen can also be
controlled by a physical controller down
here on the center console you can also
control it with steering wheel controls
over here on the far left now the top
screen is resistive the bottom screen
uses capacitive technology as you can
tell by it it's basically taking me this
long to even explain what the system is
it's very complicated and it can be
pretty difficult to use when you're on
the road things are just kind of
scattered all over you can change the
audio source for example from the top
screen or the bottom screen it would be
better if these things are sort of
located in one simple area where you can
gain access to all of them in addition
to a full gamut of digital media sources
we've also got some really interesting
things like very granular control over
the driver assistant features which
we'll come back to in a second and the
various drive modes for example you can
pop into a menu and independently select
the responsiveness of the steering and
the weight of the steering that's just
extremely precise and something that I
haven't seen in many vehicles usually
they just give you a sport comfort
setting the dashboard check isn't very
good but one area that Infiniti has
traditionally been a very strong
competitor is with driver assistance
technology and if q50 is no exception
we've got a forward collision alert that
basically works like a distance control
unit and basically what that does is it
uses a forward-facing radar system to
measure the distance between you and the
vehicle in front of you and if you get
too close it will actually slow the
vehicle down so that you're not
tailgating them we've also got a lane
departure prevention system that is
going to use cameras to monitor the
lines on the road and if you drift over
the markers unintentionally that is
without using your turn signal it'll
actually use by braking to attempt to
pull you back into your lane the system
is interesting and uses brakes not the
electronic power steering like a lot of
newer models and what that means that
you don't really get that sort of weird
twitchiness out of the steer
that you get with some lane departure
prevention systems but it also means
that the resolution is a little bit
lower it's not as precise and pulling
you back in the line and the
intervention isn't as powerful which
means that it's a little bit easier for
this vehicle to just sort of drift over
the line without you wanting it to and
finally we had a blind spot monitoring
system that will activate that Lane
Departure system if you attempt to
change lanes when someone is detected
and your blind spot
now what's really interesting about
infinity's implementation is that it
puts all of these features onto one
button right here on the steering wheel
it kind of looks like a force field
around the car and that's why I like to
call it the force field button it
basically is an on/off toggle for all of
those driver aid systems so if you're in
situation where you don't really want
any intervention and you want to be in
control of the car you just tap one
button and all of them turn off but then
if you find yourself in traffic or in a
situation where you're a little bit
distracted for example you're trying to
use this very terrible dashboard
infotainment system you can just hit
that button and know that the vehicle is
going to be watching your back
while you need it to the former g37
starts appropriately at around thirty
seven thousand dollars for the base
model however this fully loaded Q 50s
with this tech package is too luxe
touring it's wheel package and more
gonna top out at around fifty four
thousand dollars fully loaded for the
money it's a much better car than the
g37 was even though they share very
similar bones and it's a worthy
competitor to for example Lexus is350
but when you start to compare it to the
German competition the vehicle seems to
lag a little bit behind in terms of
efficiency and technology to things that
are very important for daily driving for
today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
