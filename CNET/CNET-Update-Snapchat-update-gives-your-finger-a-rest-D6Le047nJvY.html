cramps I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update snapchat has changed a
defining feature of it snap you no
longer have to hold your finger down on
the screen to view a message the latest
app update just lets you view the
message right away with a single tap and
if you're in a story you can just keep
tapping to skip through messages the
photos and video will still disappear
but now you don't have to worry about
missing a 10 second message because your
finger slipped here's what's odd about
the change having your finger on the
screen was golden for advertisers
because they knew you were actively
engaged to looking at the screen but
maybe someone figured out that it was
more important to see your message
without your finger blocking the view
although some do complain that with a
free hand now it's easier to take a
screen shot and that's not all
snapchat added new ways to add friends
when your location is turned on you can
see a list of other users nearby but
it's not as creepy as it sounds the
other person also needs to be hunting
for people nearby with the search screen
open for it to show their name so if you
want to add a new friend you met but you
don't want to fiddle with codes or a
user name everyone can just open up the
add nearby screen snap codes also got an
upgrade those yellow polka dotted QR
type go-sees are unique to every name
and it's a quick way for people to add
you by pointing their phone's camera at
the icon you can customize the little
ghost inside with an animated selfie it
loops through several photos and people
will see it when they look up your name
if you stumble across a code online you
can take a screenshot the app will scan
your photo library for the code so you
can add the person and although it's not
as fun the most important update is
2-step authentication your snaps can be
more secure by requiring not just a
password when you sign on but it will
also require you to enter in a shortcode
sent to you via text message it's an
extra barrier in case someone gets your
password you'll find it in settings
under log and verification security
experts are looking into ways we can
verify ourselves without using passwords
which can be easily
compromised and the blogging site medium
is taking a new approach and letting you
sign in using only your email address
and you have to go into your email to
fetch the special link to log on each
time it's as if you permanently forgot
your password and as before you can also
sign in using your Facebook or Twitter
account
speaking of hacks we have another credit
card breach this time the victims were
people who stayed at Trump hotel
properties yes the Republican
presidential candidate Donald Trump now
has to deal with hacking at his hotels
along with all the other drama going on
security reporter Brian Krebs broke the
news and it appears that the breach
extended back to February that's it for
this tech news update but there's always

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
