that's my selfie
here we go I just interacted with
real-life people in the virtual world
and it was pretty crazy
it's called Facebook spaces and it's
essentially your entire Facebook feed
and your friends in VR to use it you
need an oculus and install the Facebook
spaces app then we create an avatar you
can use your existing Facebook images
that you're tagged in select hair color
eye color outfits and more then you need
to enter into the spaces app on oculus
wear the headset you use oculus touch
you interact with the world you can see
other friends talk to them in real time
using audio and you see the entire
virtual world in front of you including
things like 360 degrees photos and
videos so you can essentially immerse
yourself right in the middle of you can
draw you can write to other people you
can of course chat to them and take
selfies because we're in VR why the heck
not you can go through all the media on
your Facebook Timeline and share that
with friends plus send out any of the
content that you create to your Facebook
feed direct from spaces now this is in
Veda right now and I thought it was
gonna be pretty silly when I first heard
about it but honestly when you give it a
try it's a lot of fun you're interacting
with people in a virtual world at first
I thought I was talking to actual like
artificial intelligence creations I
didn't realize there were real people
that's how to catch my mind was but it's
a lot of fun you want to try it out now
and you have oculus and Facebook give it
a go it's called Facebook spaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
