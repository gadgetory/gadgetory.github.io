months ago when it first showed off the
yoga book a super slim hybrid that does
a good deal more than your average yoga
this 10.1 inch two and one is so small
and light it's one of the only laptops
I've ever taken outside without any sort
of bag or case just tucked under my arm
like a paperback one of the reasons it's
so thin is that it has what Lenovo calls
a zero travel keyboard which is a fancy
way of saying it's a touch keyboard no
moving parts similar to the on-screen
keyboard on an iPad but with a little
bit of haptic feedback the yoga book
comes in both windows and Android
versions there are a couple of software
and keyboard layout differences between
them but the components inside are
identical and because it's got the yoga
name you can of course flip it around to
a kiosk or tablet mode and like that
it's good for video streaming reading or
other kinds of media consumption but
consumption is one thing
what about creation the big Holy Grail
tablet makers are always going on about
well Lenovo calls this thing the halo
keyboard and as far as simulated
keyboards go it's pretty good but typing
even more than a few sentences gets
annoying pretty quickly especially when
the on-screen typing
doesn't exactly keep up with your
fingers there's a lot of tapping the
backspace button and the virtual
touchpad isn't great at highlighting and
selecting text so even editing is more
of a pain but there's another kind of
creation where the yoga book really
excels tap the pen button and the halo
keyboard vanishes now you've got a Wacom
tablet service that works with included
real pen stylus why is it called the
real pen I thought you'd never ask
you start out by swapping out the
standard stylus tip for one of these ink
filled ones then put the special pad of
paper over the drawing surface there's a
magnet in the pad to hold it in place
but it's just ordinary paper now thanks
to the layer of electromagnetic
resonance film inside the yoga book you
can draw on the pad and capture
everything in real time on the screen
I've used plenty of drawing tablets and
stylus devices over the years and this
set up felt very impressive with no lag
and very accurate capture the only big
problem I had was with the yoga book
being so slim and easy to carry I'm not
sure where I'm supposed to
the notepad the giant stylus and the
extra tips it's a lot to carry around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
