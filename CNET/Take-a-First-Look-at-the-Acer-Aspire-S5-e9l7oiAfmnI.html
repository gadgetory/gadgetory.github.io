made a lot of waves and 11th one a sir
upped its game with this this says I
mean I feel like with the Samsung Series
nine last year this is kind of like
inheriting that direction as opposed to
the s3 that was last year that was a you
know a little more in that grayish
silver not a sexy this is I mean we're
much more razor thin design 15
millimeters onyx black and it's got that
spit this is the sports car feature of
the show okay I love this watch this
this is the magic flip port or you press
the button here and it it's like a
spoiler that comes up automatically pops
up it reminds me of a DeLorean or
something and then you have access to
all the ports on the back including
Thunderbolt this is going to be one of
those next gen ultrabooks
so so does that mean it seems like
there's weird cage eNOS around Ivy
Bridge right didn't you say okay so it
has Thunderbolt which means it must have
intel's ivy bridge right and then what
happens um nobody wants to talk about it
you say there's an ivy bridge laptop
right and they go is the chip we dare
not speak its name right it's so
socially awkward they just walk away but
it's a clear end up here it's a good
thing I mean it's going I think the more
you have Thunderbolt in devices we talk
about Thunderbolt on on you know Apple
products and how many peripherals do you
have but if it shows up across a ton of
laptops I think you'll start seeing
Thunderbolt peripherals that are kind of
interesting yeah I love this sort of the
curved and very samsung series 9 that's
kind of curved closure there this is it
feels good this little motorized finger
and that's how they get it so thin by
hiding the ports and make a nice another
mechanical part yeah that you know is
they could get some continent okay right
then the more moving parts you have the
more I get worried but Antony looks
really cool yeah can you rig it come
down when the laptop is resti oh it does
it brings then it just sort of like
apparently yeah see what happens I I've
actually haven't seen this it's like the
sport shocks or sick I am rising he'll
raise it up you get a little clearance
on your laptop there I don't know if
everybody wants rear ports but maybe I'm
wondering that's in the future for
something like a dock I'm just guessing
yeah but I you know some people do like
to tuck that stuff out as a nap
have a nice close up here there you go
that's hot it's totally not gonna do
that with that but that's where the whoa
no way not gonna be out until later in
the year maybe with Windows 8 I don't
know obviously with whatever the current
generation at the time of Intel chips so
a lot of the ultrabooks that we're
seeing are things we'll be able to get
right away they're gonna like second
half of the year but not really a
specified release date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
