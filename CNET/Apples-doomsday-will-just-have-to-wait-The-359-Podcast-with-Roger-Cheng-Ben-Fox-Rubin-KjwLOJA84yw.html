july 27th we are here from the CBS
interactive studios in New York City for
the 359 featuring Roger Cheng and Ben
Fox Rubin good morning guys hell of an
intro that was impressive I know I'm
jazzed I was way more bummed that I left
30 seconds again more than I deserve got
lord I agree all right you're gonna
emcee my funeral so thank ya just just
just a warning or a you know just a
warning that everyone where we're gonna
get pretty wonky today financial oh
that's what we're warning people yeah
okay we're talking about earnings doll
earnings all earnings Wednesday Apple
Twitter t-mobile we've got a lot to talk
about let's unpack so expect way too
much jargon yeah we're both former
financial journalists and we're gonna
really we're really gonna lean into
we're just gonna go crazy wonky sorry
sorry I didn't in advance don't
apologize if I for like if you're bored
by money go away now well yes as always
if you have any questions about these
companies Apple Twitter or tmobile or
anything related deftly leave some
questions in the comments Brian will
scout out and check out the bay I will
do the QA afternoon a we got that win if
I keep this one quick actually sorry Oh
50 just realized okay let's make it
happen all right well I could be a
little late to my next meeting that's
fine all right we're ready to roll all
right let's do it and then 32 welcome to
the 359 when we talk about the top tech
news of the day now you have a crap we
want to throw in I'm Roger J I'm Ben Fox
Rubin Apple last night reported its
financial results and things weren't
actually so bad sales declined but not
as much expected and cubby actually
offered a slightly rosier forecast and
expected what do you think then that's
actually so the revenue forecast is
actually saying quite a bit for Apple
because usually they provide pretty soft
guidance that's well below my analyst s
they're usually very conservative right
so the fact that this was actually
better means that maybe they have
something you know in their pocket that
we don't know about that maybe they
expect the iphone to do Byron some seven
plus pro amazing version right so maybe
at least their financial analysis is is
that it's going to sell better than wall
street expects it to look that I mean
the key number still sold 40 million
iPhones still an impressive number it's
a huge number down down from a year ago
but still Matt like no other company
every other couple killed sacrifice her
firstborn to get those kinds of numbers
sure but nobody likes numbers going down
so right ever since 2007 I phone numbers
iphone sales have been up up up and then
for the past two quarters they've been
you know going lower so this is this is
a big problem for them and we'll see if
they'll be able to turn it around
somehow definitely you know it goes back
to the kind of disconnect between Wall
Street and consumers you know the all
the results seem to be bad but stock
went up yeah and you know that that sort
of contrast for when when apple reports
record results and stock goes down and
people scratch their heads it's all an
expectations game however with Twitter
transitioning to those guys their
results were bad and the stock went down
so at least those those expectations are
obviously would anticipate yeah so
basically what happened with Twitter
which also reported yesterday they said
that they're losing advertising their
growth is stalled and the main takeaway
from these guys in their earnings report
was that they offered really low
guidance and only a one percent rise in
monthly active user use yeah yeah so how
bad is it for these guys I mean like it
really bad right like that's there's a
lot of people there's increasing number
of people who are questioning the
relevancy of Twitter right when you've
got copies like snapchat coming in and
really surpassing them what's Twitter's
role I don't know I spend a lot of time
on Twitter and as do I some of this some
of these financial some of this
financial information is definitely very
dismayed because it makes it seem as
though twitter is just going to turn
into a ghost town at some point it's
going to be the next Google Plus so it's
really depressed numbers are important
to realize that it's depressing because
I spent years building up my audience
there they're all just going to a bit
right there all bots anyway what is uh
the chances by the way I wanted to get
to this that they could become a
takeover target because that's a lot of
what people are talking about to it's
pretty likely right yeah like it it does
seem like it would fit under a large
company now then as a standalone
business they can't figure how to make
money yeah all right lastly t-mobile
posted solid results leading the
industry customer growth for a tenth
consecutive quarter news flash free
stuff works there there t-mobile Tuesday
app is really starting to pay off that
was the abdicating free pizza free
frosty from wendy's and for summing free
stock in the company so it's kind of
paid off it's in contrast with really
the rest of the industry like that
they've mostly other players have
struggled to add customers t-mobile's
kind of standing out there how are there
has a bottom line though because for
years they were losing money getting
customers is that at least turned around
yeah they're there the posted a profit
earnings beat expectations and you know
they're they're looking pretty right now
Wow good job t-mobile by the way 646
thousand net new postpaid phone custom
oh yeah weekend wonky nicely done John
the chair that's more than the rest
combined by the way alright y know more
about these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks
for listening and that's a cut on the
recording and we are still here with you
on YouTube looking for your comments
comments questions about money yeah it
doesn't like money yes and by the way
Roger said earlier on the show that if
you don't was it you Brian if you don't
care about money don't listen to this
but you have to follow you have to
follow the money like you know that's
that's what motivates all these copies
if you're just kindly it's good on
Twitter and don't realize that that
thing is in serious trouble like that's
not doesn't especially in teaneck stand
for consumer no I don't think it
automation my hooter given that I think
it was easy we go back to that brand
welcome to do more your internet
computer net brought to you by the
nineties oh my god 3c met people don't
know what cnet stands for no it's I
think it's a code it's kind of mystery
right hmm I don't know the story changes
it just sounded cool
yeah that's probably a cool necklace
sure that's what it is cool that cool
that's cool away all right Brian look
questions what do we got no really I
mean of course oh my god we keep
expecting you do Apple shows you expect
the Apple questions but this one yeah
it's an interesting podcast but there is
like this episode is good that it
supplies information but I don't think
there's a whole lot of users out there
who are dying to like dig deep into a
back-and-forth about the fiscal results
of Twitter that's true that is that's
sad this is kind of a one-way
conversation nothing wrong I also fed
just in general is not love interested
Oh point we got a good one how about
Nintendo how does Nintendo stack up
against these oh yeah intendo has been
floundering a little bit Tendo posted
their results last night actually and it
you know as the kind of warned about the
warned about this couple days ago that
you know the they told investors hey
that whole Pokemon go phenomenon we're
not actually making money directly from
that app just remember that and then
their stock tank in it today they posted
a loss I mean look the results are still
terrible the the business prospects are
still kind of rough because they still
make their money off of console games
and in physical hardware games and
Pokemon go is great but again it's an
indirect relationship they own a third
of Pokemon company which is the holding
company that owns the property of
Pokemon the IP VIP and then reportedly
own a stake in niantic we don't actually
know if they do which is the maker of
the game right so niantic is making
money hand over fist so as Apple
Nintendo gets a little bit of buzz from
it but it actually doesn't make that is
so sad to me because Nintendo was
irrelevant in you know the gaming world
for years partly because they refused to
go into mobay irrelevant I don't know I
said where I thought no one I know I
never know they just never last night
the NX will be mobile okay yes but not
that mean by the way I know technically
the gamecube was mobile because i had
that little handle on it oh come on it's
not it's not a big ol Lester that it's
like a phone app it right like its own
mobile console like but is it going to
be a pocket mobile game boy size is it
going to be something a lot
more multifunctional can you work it in
and get high resolution on your actual
home theater system type thing or is it
strictly a pocket game like they haven't
really been said yeah but does that mean
that they're not going to go all in on
making more like mobile games for
smartphone well seems I think that's
what people expect them to do after
Pokemon go it's an arguably a successful
launch granted it's had its flaws but
Nintendo's officially in the game well
no they're not they're indirectly in the
game fine I said they're more in the
game they didn't they didn't make the
game you know they didn't really have
their hands on that on Pokemon go really
so in the development of the game okay I
niantic just a distal clarify they've
posted a net loss of 234 million dollars
in the last quarter best nintendo that's
intend oh wow that's pretty significant
loss but what's what's the thing I keep
reading about like how Nintendo could
take a loss for 80 years and still be
fine yeah they've got I think there's
that is that a blown smoke I don't I
think that's technically true they had
like enough money to last them for a
while and presumably those projections
aren't assuming that they're going to
lose 200 million every corner so yeah um
yeah so we'll see I mean look again they
still have struggles I think everyone is
hoping that they get more into
smartphone games mobile apps the things
like Pokemon go and actually owned them
and actually owned then they go viral
although that would be nice see people
remember like the very first the first
mobile game that they put out was like
the Wii something me moat me Mia me oh
wait hello were there somehow though
right the I just wear head up no cuz
like they had the miiverse yeah they had
like this good social component you
basically create a mii account and
you're like interacting with other
friends you know it wasn't as much again
though we're gonna game but it was it
was a first it was its first foray into
smartphone kevin says me tomo me tomo
thank you Kevin nicely done nicely done
um I played it for about five minutes I
was very stupid and well I mean I did
like carrying around your little
personal game verse with you because if
you recall Sega Dreamcast did that first
with the vm you could store your files
and essentially became like a keychain
right like almost Tamagotchi h-type yeah
yeah and you could maintain and interact
with certain elements of the game on the
go now it wasn't like Bluetooth wireless
syncing to anything you still have to
come back back into the controller but
the idea was like you had your game on
you in some aspect at all times and
there were little mini games you could
play to accrue points just stock back
into the game when you SAT back down to
the console conceptually that sounds
pretty cool and very advanced for 1999 I
don't think that it really took off
though probably a child is she Sega I
mean did a dreamcast died so the
Dreamcast I'm surprised you even knew
anything about the Dreamcast there are
like three customers for that thanks
Brian he knows that he knows all what
was the guys I guess I wasn't a 90s yeah
i'm ninety-nine ninety-nine ninety-nine
just hit there i avoided that one I did
to get some good games we had we i still
have witnesses really yeah that's the
one I'll always hang on to how dude sell
that on eBay that's probably worth
something by now no I'll be the jerk who
keeps buying them on eBay that's raising
the price yes totally offsetting the
market and then we'll do an episode on
it because this is the financial report
brought to you by the 359 all right we
should probably wrap it up yeah alright
cool we will try to try to entertain any
more yeah we'll do something a little
odd business e topic tomorrow right
