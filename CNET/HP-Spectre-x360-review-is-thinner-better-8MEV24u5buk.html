thicker one with more ports Apple's not
the only one making you choose HP is
replacing the spectre x360 with a newer
thinner model destroying one of my
favorite laptops in the process ah okay
well maybe not destroying the new
Spectre x-360 is good
it's a sleek speedy machine with six
hours of real-world battery life plus
one of the best touch pads you'll find
on a Windows computer I love the way
this smooth glass feels against my
finger ever wanted to login to a
computer with your face the new Spectre
x-360 does that too
and it's got a new Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
branded quad speaker array that comes
through loud and clear and I've got to
admit I like my barely-there screen
bezels as much as anybody
you only get them on the new model but
the thing I liked best about the
previous Spectre x-360 was its a wide
array of full-size ports and you don't
get them here used to be I could plug in
two monitors a mouse keyboard thumb
drive even my camera's SD card into the
spektr without a dongle or hub in sight
here you only get one full size USB port
and two of these multi-purpose USB C
jacks and for what the new Spectre x-360
is only 2.1 millimeters thinner a third
of a pound lighter and a teensy bit
smaller now at 2.8 5 pounds it's still
not quite light enough to pick up like a
tablet hasn't passed that threshold
thankfully for now you do get to choose
last year's HP Spectre x-360 is still on
sale for the same price with just as
much battery life and only a hair less
processing power than the new model
honestly either computer should serve
you well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
