Dan Ackerman at the Computex conference
in Taiwan Asus showed off some i popping
new laptop tech specifically the to
screen no keyboard a I powered project
Precog prototypes say that three times
fast it's expected to come out next year
we'll see we'll see but do you think
this has a potential to be the future of
laptops now I'm gonna tell you from a
historical perspective this is not the
first time someone's trying to do a
thing where there's a laptop we have a
screen where the screen is and you have
a second screen where the keyboard
usually is and when you want to type on
it it puts an on-screen keyboard on
there otherwise you can use it from
other things
Acer was one of these many many years
ago that was an interesting kind of
novelty item yeah though
lenovo 2016 yoga book oh that's that's
totally different that's another one
like that and that's where they had
again it was kind of a small folio and
two screens they had Android and Windows
versions but but Acer and other
companies were doing this many years ago
cuz you could type on your iPad they
figured oh why do we need to keyboard
anymore I've never really worked out I
don't know if this one will either the
thing I like about it is it kind of
looks like those those foldable tablets
on the west-world and everyone's like
these tablets are great why don't we
have these oh here you go
here I don't know if they're running
Windows 10 on Westworld but what do you
think about some of the a RAI features
I'm gonna run through two of them right
now for instance the laptop knows when
your meetings are and conserves battery
life accordingly it also sees where your
hands are located on the keyboard and
moves the keyboard around so you're
actually typing properly or it can put
different things on that second keyboard
screen depending on what you want to do
at least hypothetically I don't know how
much I would attribute that to AI and
more to just good programming you know
anything to keep track of your calendar
and your meetings and ramp up and down
your power usage accordingly I guess
that is a good idea although this thing
had decent battery life you wouldn't
really need that it makes me a little
concerned not the battery life if you
feel like you have to go through those
kind of
extraordinary measures but having done a
lot of the on-screen typing on previous
versions of systems like this it's not
great for you know people who write a
lot during the day you're right I'm not
sure it's really going to work out like
that also this thing looks like it's
probably gonna be expensive so what's
your over under what do you think $2,000
plus oh yeah maybe if it even ever comes
out these prototypes sometimes they do
sometimes they don't the real value of a
prototype like this is it gives you a
lot of concepts that could later bleed
down into more reasonably priced
products definitely at WWDC Apple showed
off new restrictions on online tracking
tech it added to its Safari browser for
instance when you use websites let's say
Facebook with buttons for liking or
sharing stories Safari will prevent
online trackers from capturing that data
unless you permitted to me I feel like
some of this stuff is long overdue
people are getting a lot more aware of
privacy issues and it's nice to see that
a major company like Apple is getting
involved it's an arms race it's a
browser arms race right now about who
can add the most security and privacy
features through their browsers whether
it's Chrome or it's Firefox or Safari or
even edge for a long time the browser's
were competing to display the websites
and properties in their full multimedia
glory so you'd want to use them and they
were playing to the media companies now
it seems they are making a play for the
consumers because so much of that
privacy and data information that we're
worried about flows out through that
browser yeah absolutely and and last up
the embattled Chinese telecommunications
manufacturer ZTE
agreed to a settlement that would lift a
ban on US companies doing business with
it ZTE will pay 1.7 billion dollars in
penalties the change in fortune appears
to be related to the fact that President
Trump got involved so I guess good for
him if you're a ztk ZTE customer then
the company has gotten a lifeline yes so
I mean are they actually changing
anything and how they do business
because of it because right now I just
print out my web browsing history every
month put an envelope sent it right to
China for
if I don't know and I think there are a
few more shoes to drop related to this
so definitely keep an eye out on this
area if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNET I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Dan Ackerman thanks
for listening 38 seconds over I mean
like that's pretty good for us that was
a lot of information and we didn't even
get through to the Zen Book Pro by the
way which ASIS also showed off its got a
5.5 inch screen in the trackpad yeah I
mean it's also not the first time we've
seen that other laughs I think this
stuff is quick you scream laughed had I
think a razor in there big 17-inch had
something like that but it was never
really utilized properly it wasn't a
true like Windows second display it
could only do certain things but we saw
another Reiser prototype at CES this
year where it was a laptop though much
like this one much like this much like
this razor blade out here except for
where the touchpad was there was nothing
it was a big blank spot like an empty
spot and you would take your razor phone
and they'd make a very nice phone that
nobody bought but it's a nice phone just
like how all those other phones out
there where there was a notch there is
not right right and and you you plug it
right into where the touchpad goes and
that becomes your touchpad and then this
laptop shell becomes basically an
Android powered laptop I feel like I
would get so distracted though if the
touchpad is also a screen that's like
telling me stuff yeah you can turn it
off you're like what it looks cool in
the pictures it looks cool but I don't
actually understand what the value of it
would be do people want secondary
displays that's the question do you want
a laptop with another screen that just
pops out from the side and has extra
stuff do you want what Apple has which
is the touch bar which is basically an
oled tiny strip second display that's a
that's a good question do you want a
phone with a screen on both sides there
certainly or or you open it up and it's
screen screen I mean people are working
on all these prototypes under the
conception that you want another screen
you want that second screen experience
but built into your main device is that
true
it sounds dark new it sounds like no you
have no interest in second screen I
but at the same time there's this
dueling issue that okay maybe I don't
think from a practical perspective some
of it makes sense but we also complain
about the fact that phones all look the
same these days or laptops are all very
similar and we want to see innovations
and hardware so I guess I'm really
focused on the fact that like it's the
same thing as the movies is that
everybody wants something new but we
just want the same goddamn rom-com as
before battery life yeah just put Sandra
Bullock and a bigger battery right
exactly that's all we need anyway we
should get to questions if we have some
Brian yeah let's go ahead and jump into
the chat if anyone's got any comments or
questions about aces their ZTE or more
WWDC even though there isn't a whole lot
till to talk about on the couch we have
a comment Jean is a fan of you guys says
both guys are cute and handsome what
it's the beard that's a lie it's the
beard okay I'll take it okay good just
wanted you to know that figure we could
all use a self-esteem booster words I'm
completely fine with it I can't wait to
show that off from an OT let's talk
about quality Dan you could probably
floor this one pretty easily since
you've tampered with every asus under
the Sun a note e says at Asus quality
seems poor they have two aces laptops
both have serious issues with
specifically the monitor and the hinge
now what's your experience Picard number
what I'm sorry to hear that
number two you do this long enough you
hear from readers who have similar
problems with every brand out there
there's always lemons everyone's
customer service is awful the only
exception is probably if you have Apple
care and you go to an Apple store at
least they try to make you feel like
they're taking care of you and if you
buy especially on the lower end the more
plasticky laptops that are under $1000
this is definitely they're definitely
not designed to last more than a couple
of years plastic parts plastic hinges
even when you get expensive stuff they
get very easily I have terrible luck
with this I think for years almost every
high-end electronic item I bought had to
go back and be replaced it was a clunker
yeah but nobody likes in aggregate
nobody likes their laptop brand
specifically about Asus though do you
have a general impression it's tough
because they make so many laptops and
they at least used to be a white label
brand for so many other companies they
even made Apple laptops at one point so
they definitely have the manufacturing
scope and scale and know how if you have
an individual laptop or to them that are
having a problem you have my deepest
sympathy but especially with brands like
Asus it's tough to get service yeah
unless you got it from like Amazon or
Best Buy or someplace and you can just
send it back and still within the return
which is which is a good idea people
should do that let's take one from our
old friend Sir enjoy how far youth how
far you think would the top grade
hardware and futuristic novelty diverge
in the laptop market specifically citing
Asus has come out with a gaming Beast
with the ROG G 703 G Dan yes I mean they
do they do a great job at that they
actually have some very interesting
gaming laptops we just tested the new
Zephyrus which is a close cousin of that
one I think and that has its super slim
when you open the lid a panel on the
bottom rises up like this to give it
additional cooling so you can crank up
that 1070 max-q nvidia graphics card
we're seeing almost the opposite in a
way and that we're seeing big high-end
gaming parts like 1070 and 1080 and
video cards now that they have these
smaller more efficient max-q versions
showing up in slimmer and slimmer
laptops which is great this is actually
a good example right here this is the
new razor blade you can see it's quite
it's quite slim and that's a gaming lab
this has got a 1070 in it and it's got a
15-inch screen now whereas the older
model which was roughly the same size
only had a 14 inch screen because they
managed to cut down on that bezel that
thick border around the screen if you
want a great example of bezel craziness
look no further than Ben's own MacBook
Air right yes but my god prepares for
the comments we all know what the
situation is with the MacBook it's a
very low resolution screen I okay it's
my work laptop I know but then again you
know what I got here's the updated this
design since like 2010 it's it's true
but at the same time
nobody loves it I have a MacBook Pro as
my personal laptop that's like about
eight or nine years old now I replaced a
bunch of parts on the inside of it but
it's also like the design it's it's you
know compared to a MacBook or the newer
MacBook Pros with the touch bar look
they're not as sexy I mean it's it's the
screen resolution it's the bezel that's
the S or two things that really knock
this guy out for right now it's also the
10th anniversary of the MacBook Air so
maybe we'll see a new one later this
year maybe they'll finally maybe they'll
finally rescue it I would literally say
that every year every year every this
year in January which was the 10th
anniversary of the original MacBook Air
which was like more than 2000 hours when
it launched I went back and said wow
that's crazy I wonder who reviewed the
original MacBook Air ten years ago for
seeing that and one looked up the review
and I had no memory of this but it was
made this guy and we we republish the
videos like I seen it flash back so if
you have a big sideburn trigger warning
right there you can go back and watch
that for sure all right more questions
more questions from Ivan Zhang hey guys
did Asus announced the price of the ROG
phone yet I don't think so I don't
believe it look like a very cool phone
but the problem is the same problem
razor had with it's sort of game or
friendly razor phone which is that these
phones have great features
everyone loved especially the screen on
the range of phone everyone likes the
hardware on this ROG phone but
especially if you're in the US there's a
99% chance you're getting an iPhone or a
Samsung phone and that's just it and if
you even go to a third or fourth brand
it ain't gonna be a sustain to be razor
eye it's pixel that's probably you're
totally you're you're absolutely right
by unfortunately and and the thing is is
that right now we're in a cycle where
there are more mobile options out there
there's a new mobile phone there's no
it's true but like Razer did come out
with a new phone
there's the essential phone you I see
something serious companies already
practically had a business right they
said that they're not going to do an
essential you're selling the guy selling
the company that's like this is it's
it's good for customers to have more
options but unfortunately at the same
time this is
the cycles go people don't want more
options they want two or three really
good options and it's like this too big
soda brands there's two big fast-food
chains there's two big blah blah blahs
is a very exploitative and I guess
Nintendo I mean that's three once you
get more than that you you you you hit a
cliff very fast weight the weight so the
pixel will probably stick around because
Google has more money than God and
that's all that will exist is another
that's probably careful there John
Lennon yeah they use that brand in
Chromebooks and other things and tablets
also but you know everyone has ether a
Samsung phone or an Apple phone maybe a
pixel yeah I can't think of too many
people who had something different in
the u.s. other markets obviously
different yeah way I'm kind of curious
what is your perspective who are the two
big fast food chains isn't it now as
somebody who's not been in a fast food
restaurant in probably 20 years I may be
wrong but I assume it's still McDonald's
and Burger King in the US well sure but
again that's yeah okay those are the
800-pound gorillas there are other ones
but none of them have that kind of scale
they are someone who used to as somebody
who used to work in the beverage
industry trade press as a business
reporter covering liquids I can tell you
the scale of Coke and Pepsi and their
respective parent company is is just
Dwarfs anyone else and they frankly own
most of the other brands now anyway how
did we get to this point I was just
curious well I know I totally broke our
rhythm here but I was like two fast food
joints like America is the big fest we
have to change and all those work the
same way really the coca-cola company
McDonald's here not Coco Lee it's really
a franchise company but the bet the
parent companies are basically
responsible for like secret recipes and
marketing wait is it isn't it now though
we're like Mountain Dew and everything
yeah yeah yeah
no totally they own all these other
brands but in McDonald's you buy a
franchise and you run it as an
independent business and you buy your
supplies from the main office and they
handle all the advertising all right
because the same way they make the
secret formula syrup and they buy the
ads other companies actually mix it with
water and put in a bottle and take it to
a store for the record I'm gonna I'm
gonna pull us back to tech stuff even
I'm learning new things about your your
knowledge base so well done for the
record I just want to appreciate that
even though I'm not in the room with you
guys anymore I am being piped in so you
can actually communicate with me to a
speaker embedded in the floor and I like
Dan talks to that speaker it makes me
really feel like I'm there all right
yeah we got some time left let's get
some more actual relevant questions
sorry everybody who got a little
derailed but hey sometimes we have fun
from pratik how good is the new Asus HDR
monitors are they good for consoles and
casual PC gaming it's a good question I
have not tried them I say console I know
we've tested a bunch of HDR and
otherwise monitors for PCs the problem
with HDR is always do you have HDR
content it's a term people throw around
very loosely and there's basically two
types of HDR content that you have to
individually decode and play back that
said a well-tuned HDR screen even
without that specialized content will
look very nice we just saw a Lenovo
laptop for example with an HDR ready
display and it's not gonna have the
right drivers to decode HDR content
which again has to be specifically made
to be displayed that way for a while now
I guess we don't really have a date like
a real nice display same issue is 4k
it sounds yeah even if you have all the
right hardware it's still a matter for
that specific monitor but certainly if
you're if you're moving forward in
getting a new display you might as well
get an HDR compliant one just check the
two it is HDR 10 and the other one is
like Dolby vision maybe look for one
that decodes both nice alright handful
more questions here before we call it a
day syringe Oh Dan a word on where HP
stands in the laptop masterrace bear in
mind this comment was being made from an
HP Spectre x-360 that's a good laptop
right there you know I feel like they do
a very good job they've actually got a
couple of things the top end of the line
that are that are pretty darn good The
Spectre whether it's the clamshell
Spectre which is super thin or the x360
which is there yoga style with the hinge
that
folds back both very good they put some
effort into the gaming stuff but I don't
think there's anything groundbreaking
there of recent and of course they still
do a lot of good business laptops if you
don't have a think pad there's a good
chance maybe you have an HP EliteBook
and that's been one of my favorite lines
for a couple of years now because it's
technically a business laptop but it
works really great as a mainstream
consumer laptop it just looks really
sharp and good construction and they've
got a cool feature that no one else has
yet which is a polarized privacy filter
that's built into the screen you hit a
function key combination and the screen
goes like that and if you're off angle
or a little bit back the screen goes
white and you can't read what's on it
which i think is something that we are
gonna want more and more because we're
concerned about not just regular you
know hacking and eavesdropping and
snooping but this kind of physical
hacking this eyeball hacking where
you're in the airport lounge and someone
over your shoulder figuring out what
keys you're pressing for your password
and where you're going and stuff well
that's a cool feature it is and it's
pretty cool from mark dybul our external
GPUs here to stay people have tried that
I see everyone saved up their PC
questions I know I know I like the
concept we should get the Razer core X
in here any day now and we're gonna try
it with both Nvidia and AMD cards but
people have been trying to make the
external GPU happen for Yee I don't know
maybe almost 10 years and it just ins
never worked for a variety of reasons as
it doesn't integrate properly into this
fine it's the hardware and the
connection number one you need to
through put so much data into and out of
the laptop Dell has a proprietary
connection for their version of it that
they sell but nobody remembers that
works with some Alienware laptops but
it's a proprietary connection the box is
stupid expensive and again with all
these you're just buying an empty box
with a with a GP slot in it and a power
supply you just put your own graphics
card you buy separately for $500 in this
box you bought for 4 or $500 and that's
how they get you that that's always been
that's always been how they how they
worked and then you know razors done an
ok job at pushing this but it's not
really mainstream Seuss's had one
they've tried to sell off and on over
the years it's an interesting concept
do you want to take your you know Matt
book style laptop if not actually a
MacBook because it doesn't have a
Thunderbolt 3 connection and hook it up
to a box with a graphics card be able to
play games and then pick it up and take
it with you
I don't know takes up a lot of deaf
space you could get the same thing in a
laptop that's still fairly thin like
this and this will probably cost you
less than buying slim regular mainstream
laptop ploughin plus a graphics card
plus an external GPU box if anyone can
make it work I guess it's razor but I
don't know if I had the volume
especially here in the US for it there's
a valuable contribution there Ben we
have time for just a couple more from
Sam levy how much better with the ROG
phone be then let's compare it to
something like the op6 I mean I haven't
looked at the speck to the ROG phone
frankly so I I couldn't say off the top
of my head looks nice game people seem
interested in it it's a tough market
though for anyone whose brand name
doesn't start with an A or an S that's
that's always the problem and I don't
see that getting resolved anytime soon
and lastly to close it out one more from
the ROG side of things from Josh Buddha
is the ROG phone coming to any US
carriers also a good question Ben's got
the story open right now maybe fell down
and take a look I don't I don't know
this this thing was just announced so I
still think we're waiting for some
details about it especially with the su
stuff they have different plans and
different products in different markets
they do a lot of different stuff in Asia
in Europe in the US I'm sure this will
get a US release of some kind from them
but they may not do they might sell
directly as opposed to going through a
carrier and you just put in your SIM
card of choice but I feel like it's
gonna be expensive and it's not gonna be
mainstream but that said the razor phone
has it's super hardcore fans I bet this
will also and they may offer in that and
they made an effort to make it look
different and interesting which is
probably why so many people are asking
about it so if it's such a plateau in
terms of phone development everything's
the same glass and metal slab anyone who
does something different definitely gets
a round of applause for me right yeah
but at the same time this is probably
not gonna get I mean the handful of
people that are watching the show that
are asking about it or probably audience
that's the audience a lot of babies
French door and a screw
I don't know we'll have to find out
anyway any other questions no I think
that's gonna just about wrap it up for
today thanks everybody for joining us we
are back on the semi regular now so
sorry again about that hiatus but it's
great to have all you guys back from
Josh - - - sir enjoy - Yahoo - everybody
new joining in the channel Michael Brown
just giving a shout out we love having
you guys we love doing this and yeah
it's good to be back
sounds good awesome should I should I
round us out yeah I don't have the
script anymore I'm just gonna have to
wait script just were 400 episodes in
you don't know what lefties are on it go
with what I feel I'll start doing like a
haiku or something okay the 359 is
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
feedburner google play music the Amazon
echo and of course cnet.com thanks
everybody for watching I can't believe I
did that here go ahead I could throw in
a quick plug dancers know about podcasts
we have a new episode of seen a book
club coming up very soon it's gonna be
very exciting very hot controversial
guest that's all I'm gonna say and thank
you very much for being here and
answering all these wonderful laptop
questions always a joy to have you I
always answer people's laptop questions
