buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's apple's big September music event
Google organizing your mail for you and
the patent troll that could end the
internet but first it's the edge of the
week the gadget of the week is this cool
new thing that Apple announced the day
after we tape this it is the new Apple
TV Steve Jobs calls it a hobby but it's
a heck of a lot more tempting hobby than
it used to be it's 99 bucks now it's
small enough to fit in your hand and it
streams netflix it also streams music
and photos from your computers or from
your iOS devices like your iPad which is
pretty neat you can also rent movies and
TV shows but only TV shows from fox and
ABC so basically if you have a lot of
max iPhones iPads and iPods at your
house plus a netflix subscription and
you're a really big glee fan you have
never been happier than you are today
and now for the news speaking of Apple
the company held its big September music
event this week and we had an ace
reporter on the scene take it away Molly
thanks Molly that's right i'm here at
the yerba buena center where steve jobs
just announced a total revamp of the
ipod line the shuffle gets its buttons
back the ipod nano says goodbye to the
click wheel forever and the ipod touch
gets even thinner if that was even
possible plus it gets the front facing
camera for FaceTime and the retina
display no 7 inch iPad but we do get her
a a new version of itunes another thing
to download the new itunes also includes
something called ping which is Apple's
music social network you can only use it
in iTunes but you can share music
recommendations with your friends follow
artists that kind of thing it's sort of
like myspace music but it doesn't
connect with myspace music or Facebook
or anything like that I don't know why
either back to you Molly thanks Molly
great report and in other tech news this
week Google announced a new feature
called priority inbox that will
supposedly screen your gmail emails for
what's important and then put it at the
top of your inbox less important stuff
like newsletters or email coupons and
the like will go down at the bottom and
then you can star emails for follow-up
it
actually tell what's important to you
partly by how often you reply to emails
from certain senders so you might want
to start sending little thank-you notes
to groupon so you don't miss anything
good just saying also this week
Microsoft co-founder paul allen sued
most of the Internet including Google
Facebook Apple Netflix and yahoo for
infringing on for insanely broad patents
that could cover everything from auto
refreshing status updates to related
news links on the side of a web page and
by the way Paul Allen is sitting on an
arsenal of more than 300 other patents
that cover the rest of the web that he
didn't sue this time around like
Foursquare and Twitter yep Paul Allen
pretty much owns the internet still
think broad idea based software patents
are a good idea Oh Touche Paul moving on
digg got a redesign and in case you were
wondering if people still use dig
apparently all the people who still use
dig hate the redesign more than they've
ever hated anything they hate it so much
they carpet bomb the dig front page with
links to reddit they hate it so much
that interim CEO Kevin Rose said some of
the features they miss like upcoming
stories will totally come back they hate
it so much that interim CEO Kevin Rose
actually just went ahead and announced a
new CEO matt williams from amazon and he
said hey how many email him cuz i'm
headed to bermuda now good call kevin
and finally a sad trombone moment for
myspace which announced this week that
it would connect to facebook letting its
users synchronize posts and other
activity with the obvious social
networking winner reached for comment
myspace said what at least we're not
friends stir we have music whoa keep on
rockin myspace and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone i'm molly
wood and thank you for watching
is the Apple TV you let on the front
there a receiver social here so i won't
cover that up say about that
