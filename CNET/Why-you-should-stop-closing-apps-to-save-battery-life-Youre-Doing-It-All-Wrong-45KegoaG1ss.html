and save battery life you're doing it
all wrong you might think that when you
close an app you're saving battery life
by making sure that app doesn't run in
the background but here's the reality
when you leave an app your phone
actually pauses it in its current state
so all those apps that show up in your
task manager aren't actually draining
your battery they're just frozen sitting
in your phone's RAM or memory that way
the next time you launch it you can pick
up where you left off so when you kill
an app you're actually taking it out of
your phone's memory which means that the
next time you launch it your phone will
have to do the work of putting it back
in the RAM a much better way to extend
your phone's battery life is to manage
how much data they use go to your
phone's battery tool and see which apps
are draining the battery once you
identify the biggest Hogs you have two
options first cut back on any
unnecessary notifications on both iOS
and Android you can do this by going to
an app in finding the notification
settings or if you want to disable
notifications entirely you'll want to go
to your phone's general notification
settings and finally the best way to
prevent any app from killing your
phone's battery is to control how much
data it uses in the background on iOS
you can do that by going to settings
then general then background app refresh
and toggle your options here on Android
the process will vary but on this
Samsung Galaxy s6 you go to settings
then data usage find the app you want to
restrict and then toggle restrict
background data and now you're doing it
