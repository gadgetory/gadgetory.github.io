really good at making phones that are
surprisingly powerful while not costing
very much money can that excellent trend
continue well let's find out we're
taking a look at the new Moto G and the
Moto G Plus let's start with the Moto G
so this is a 5.5 inch display really
pleasingly that's a Full HD resolution
so they haven't scrimped on the pixels
and the phone's body is water-resistant
so this thing should survive being
spilled in your beer flip this bad boy
around that's a 13 megapixel camera on
the back on the front that's a 5
megapixel camera so you should get
selfies that are reasonably crisp which
is important it's got an octa-core
processor so it should be reasonably
quick and it's running Android
marshmallow which is a recent version of
Android now motorola typically doesn't
do too much meddling with Google's own
operating system so what you get here
should be a fairly clean and intuitive
experience moving on this is the Moto G
Plus which looks exactly the same and it
kind of is the screen is the same size
the resolutions the same size and it has
this same processor as well where it
does differ however is the camera
instead of the 13 megapixel snapper that
you get on the Moto G on the back here
is a 16 megapixel camera and that's not
all it also has a laser autofocus so it
should be good for taking photos of
fast-moving subjects like cats for
instance a final hidden treat is that
the G+ also has a fingerprint scanner
you can see it here underneath the
screen so - pretty good all rounder
Android phones but let's talk about the
price Moto G is going to cost only 169
pounds when it goes on sale in the UK in
early June while the G Plus is going to
cost 199 pounds when it goes on sale
shortly after in mid June that means
that both of these phones are pretty
affordable we'll have to wait until the
full review before we can find out
exactly how capable they are of course
but my early impressions are that 30
pounds isn't that much different to get
that slightly better camera
