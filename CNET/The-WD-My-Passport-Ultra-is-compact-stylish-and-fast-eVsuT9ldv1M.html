people say I see arrogant that's kind of
untrue because the truth is I am
arrogant if you don't like that
bye but if you're still there good for
you because I happen to be a show-off -
and have something today that it totally
was showing and that is the oniy my
passport ultra drive from WD now WD has
released many my passport drives
including the my passport apps that came
out last year the old try here look
exactly the same as the edge but it
comes with a few new things and that is
first is now available in two terabyte
and secondly aids come in four colors
including these titanium here and also
the black one that I have here and the
blue and I have it too there's also one
more color that's red that I
unfortunately don't have just kidding of
course I have it there you go
almost the entire spectrum of colors can
remind me that I'm in San Francisco now
the color is the least interesting thing
about the drive they all tried the first
drive from deputy that come with a full
pro version of the W smart way this is a
backup sub weathers very effective and
easy to you for home user but even that
software is not the best thing about the
drive either
what makes this drive here very special
is the performance in my testing it
actually the fasted you speed 3.0
portable drive on the market that is
very fast the old truck drive here come
which is one USB 3.0 port right here and
it includes a standard cable and that's
all you need to make it work the cable
here works both for data and power now
the question is how much does this new
drive cost well is released today and
come with the suggested retail price of
$100 for 500 gig and $130 for one
terabyte now that is a suggested price
and that means the street price gonna be
lower than that and now come the second
big question that you might have and
that is a mister know if you are such a
hard shot where the two terabyte drive
well here's my answer
yes I'm hot
and can be a cool shot too but the
Tutera by my passport ultra is not
available until the third quarter of the
year I did think about using my personal
time machine and to get for you today
but I didn't want to break the
space-time continuum just yet that would
be out of control which I'm not and
that's because I am down low and this
has been the first look at the my
passport ultra turbo drive from doubling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
