a look at the Toshiba Cosmo X 875 this
is one of the only new windows 8 17-inch
gaming laptops that we've seen and like
the handful of other examples of this
desktop replacement with discreet
graphics category that we've looked at
in the post Windows 8 era it doesn't
really feel like it's made for Windows 8
because it does not have a touchscreen
like pretty much every other Windows 8
laptop so far now for gaming you
certainly don't really need one you're
probably gonna spend most your time
using steam or another system like that
and maybe having a gamepad plugged in or
at least using a mouse and basically
going through the old non Windows 8 UI
desktop that being said the rest of the
time when you're not gaming that not
having that touch screen kind of makes
it harder to navigate around this tile
based Windows 8 UI you spend a lot of
times kind of trying to swipe off the
side of the touchpad like that
now Toshiba makes one of the only kind
of mainstream super high-end 17-inch
gaming laptops out there they've made
these Cosmo systems for many years this
latest version has nvidia geforce 670 m
graphics card a quad core full voltage
not low-voltage Core i7 processor and it
comes in a bunch of different
configurations this is kind of a
high-end one about 1800 bucks and what
you're paying for with that is a blu-ray
recordable drive which you don't see
very often a 3d system with invidious 3d
vision so you get the 3d glasses with it
not that you're likely to watch that
many 3d blu-rays or play 3d games on it
and a hybrid hard drive that's a one
terabyte hard drive actually this - one
terabyte hard drives and an SSD cache
you can actually dial out of those
settings back and get the base model of
this system which has the same graphics
card and this thing your CPU but none of
the other bells and whistles for about
1199 that's actually a pretty reasonable
deal if you want something that can do
really well playing games but isn't
gonna cost a fortune now of course with
any desktop replacement laptop from the
gaming side of the
the components are very up-to-date and
we've seen this not just from Toshiba
but alien wearing other companies the
design it's a little dorm room chic
there's like red chromed highlights it's
big and thick and boxy it doesn't have
that sort of aesthetic minimalism that
you find in other even very high powered
laptops that's kind of the trade-off I
think we need to make right now until
somebody comes up with a really
great-looking Windows 8 gaming laptop
with of course a touchscreen I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Toshiba Cosmo
