look back on the biggest technology
stories of the year cyber security
shoved its way into the national
conversation with major attacks hitting
every month hackers targeted politicians
and voting machines the Equifax breach
exposed to social security numbers and
personal info of half the US population
and there was Yahoo which announced the
largest data breach in history with
three billion users compromised
2017 also brought greater awareness of
fake news in social network feeds
Russian propaganda campaigns use social
media and search algorithms to spread
fake outrage and created artificial
viral moments uber could not steer away
from multiple brand tarnishing problems
which led to a new CEO in the driver's
seat
Amazon became bold enough to ask for the
keys to your home a new service lets
delivery workers unlock your front door
to drop off packages inside your
residence
and Apple's iPhone 10 and the face ID
biometrics are shining a new light on
facial recognition and augmented reality
in our personal devices we managed to
avoid major gadget fires like exploding
hoverboards or exploding phones but
there were some electronic fidget
spinners that caught fire
Thanks 2017 to see what next year has in

coverage of CES 2018
