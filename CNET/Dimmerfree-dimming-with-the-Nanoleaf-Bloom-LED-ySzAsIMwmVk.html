nano leaf bulb last year it was a
crowdfunded bulb looked a little funny
looked a little like this well this is
the follow-up this is the nano leaf
bloom and like that bulb it's a 75 watt
equivalent that puts out a lot of light
using just a little bit of power but
what's new about this year's bulb is
that it dims using your regular on-off
switch how does it do that well take a
look when you first turn the bulb on
it's going to fade up from zero over the
course of a few seconds if you flip your
switch off and then on really quick
during that fading up period it'll lock
in at that level of brightness so all of
a sudden you've got a dimmable bulb on
what was previously a non dimming switch
circuit that's kind of an interesting
feature once the bulb is on you can fade
it back down by flipping the switch two
more times so just like this if I flip
it twice it'll fade back down very
slowly and if I want to lock it into the
particular brightness I just do a double
turn and boom it's locked at about half
brightness right now now if you want
this bulb and its unique take on dimming
you're going to need to pay forty bucks
because that's what the Kickstarter
campaign is asking of you and that's not
a great price for a 75 watt equivalent
LED a year ago it might have been but
this year prices have come down to
twenty even fifteen dollars for bulbs
like that and I don't think that that
extra dimming functionality is enough to
justify the jump to forty dollars there
are smart bulbs out there that can do
really nice things with dimming and then
also bring things like
automation and scheduling to the table
and they feel like a better value to me
if I was really concerned with dimming
and wanted precise nice dimming control
you can't quite get it with this you can
sort of approximate it and think you're
getting about halfway on or about ten
percent or whatever you can do that
really precisely with a smart kit or
with a remote or even with a standard
dimmer so it's not an ideal solution
it's a cool solution but not the best I
do appreciate the look of the bulb the
inside-out sort of diodes on the outside
appearance that it's got going is pretty
cool and makes for an attractive
conversation starter so if that's the
type of thing you wouldn't mind paying
for maybe give this bulb a shot but
otherwise I say keep your eyes open for
smart bulbs that are coming down and
praise as well for seeing it I'm right
crist
