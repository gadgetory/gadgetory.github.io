the kindle fire is finally out and today
we're going to compare it to that other
ecosystems driven tablet the ipad 2
allows the mate of the kindle fires
browser silk and the techniques it uses
to deliver web pages fast but the proof
is in the pudding so we'll go to a
couple of sites to see just how sweet
that pudding is as a side dish will
download a good sized app on both
tablets and compare the speed of doing
that as well hungry first up cnet com
there goes the ipad 2 that was very very
fast ok now the kindle fire is done but
it's about 10 seconds behind the eye
tattoo going to cnet com now we're going
to businessweek com amazon recommends
this site as it takes Business Week
really fast on the Kindle Fire any ipad
2 is done again really fast now we're
waiting for the kindle fire is taking a
sweet time and there it is it's done so
again about 10 seconds behind the ipad 2
now we're going to download an app it's
angry birds HD free and ipad 2 and angry
birds rio on the kindle fire we won't
count the test ending until we can
actually be launched both apps both apps
are about 18 megabytes in size
ah there goes the ipad 2 okay angry
birds rio is finished downloading on the
kindle fire but we still can't launch it
so it's not the end of test yet oh and
there it is the kindle fire definitely
took his time and loading and
downloading that app you know i'm a bit
surprised the kindle fire didn't put up
more of a fight here now we're recording
this before the official release of the
device so we don't know what effect
prefetching will have on browser seeds
until war users are using the fire we're
prefetching the fire will prefetch web
pages you'll most likely click Next
based on what other users have already
done in the past since we're recording
this before the release there's
currently no data to go on how else will
keep testing it over the coming weeks to
see if its performance changes and if
there's an increase we'll let you know
also check out a much more detailed
companion blog to this video on android
