have a special interview a special guest
let's just describe them first magician
TV personality comedian actor everything
Justin Willman here in the house what's
up Justin hello thanks for having me on
yes sir all those titles makes me sound
very schizophrenic very important to
write I mean I will every important or
you know jack of all trades master of
none my business cards very wide Nelly
me on know without a doubt now Justin
people that may not be familiar with
your work or may not know you I I kind
of like do this thing you're familiar
with the simpsons and they always had hi
i'm troy mclure you might recognize me
from so maybe if you could help out the
audience and tell them where they might
have seen your things that you've done
before okay uh hi my name is justin
willman you might recognize me from my
comedy central special sleight of mouth
which airs tonight at midnight uh I've
also been on The Tonight Show Ellen
Conan uh Chelsea Lately and then I
hosted Cupcake Wars for a long time do
you get recognized a lot for Cupcake
Wars cuz I mean you've been doing that
for a while right recognized a lot for
Cupcake Wars because now it's on netflix
and the logo like when you're scrolling
through is like my face like this not
bad and uh yeah and I'm wearing like
some horrible pastel shirt and which I
never look I never look like that but
people still spot me and I also like a
lot of young like teenage teenage girls
watch that show so like 12 and 13 year
old so and they're not they're not shy
about saying hey are you the guy or hey
cupcake boy I'll get that a lot cupcake
and the pastels colors not your choice
wardrobe not your choice not too much
the frosting wardrobe not my choice
exactly got you now tell us about slate
of mouth this is exciting for you it's
dropping tonight like you said midnight
I think it's 1130 central time but on
the East Coast and on the west coast
we'll see it does just give that little
you know what are what can people expect
to see out of the show and really what
is it so the show it's like it's a you
know it's a half-hour comedy special but
it's comedy via the art of magic so it's
like a half magic half comedy kind of
hybrid mashup and it really was a chance
for me to
all these different genres of magic that
I love in one place I love performing on
stage for a live audience so you get
some of that I love going out in the
field and messing with people so here
you see me in Doug Benson we actually
went to a pot dispensary and did magic
for high people which was easy
surprisingly and it's a little bit of
everything but it's also the theme
really is kind of magic vs technology
technology these days is so amazing my
job as a magician is to amaze people
technology makes it hard for me to do my
job so I kind of haven't if you can't
beat them join them type of mentality
and uh and in the end I think magic kind
of prevails hopefully what really
specifically makes magic has magic kind
of lost its you know the Wonder and
amazement that people have because of
the internet what have you seen because
this is something you've been doing for
you know a long time well you know like
I feel like people are people are a
little bit harder to impress with magic
because you know like on vine people we
use you know when the shooting videos
they'll use stopping and starting and
final cut like Zach king is so amazing
yeah and does these things that are so
amazing using visual effects and they're
so magical that people love them but
also like I think the the bar for what's
possible what's not and what is amazing
like what's real like when I do
something I don't use those special
effects and it's obviously sometimes the
highest compliment I get is when people
think bitters editing or fake or Stooges
and stuff like that but I think it's
kind of made people just a little
desensitized to to wonder you know like
technology is is amazing like I don't
know how my phone does what it does
Bluetooth Wi-Fi like I don't know how it
works it just does hahahaha Emma me
earth like that's like that's amazing
stuff like that's magic 100 years ago it
would think this is some like voodoo
witchcraft device now everyone has them
so it's no big deal my job as a magician
is to share wonder but this is so
wonderous I feel like we've kind of lost
touch with how it feels to be amazed
like we should be walking around just
like in awe of all these things like in
awe that I can you know do a facetime
with my mom and see my mom in awe that
I'm talking to you right now on skype
like this is crazy this is crazy but
it's just it's just
my life now and so in order to I think
have magic compete with this wondrous
world I feel like you mix in an equal
part of comedy you know tongue-in-cheek
acknowledge the cynicism and then also
embrace technology and do magic with
technology i think is the way to take it
to kind of a new level you do that
iphone disappearing trick all the time
yeah yeah every time there's no there's
no one like you know with the string
right now right I want this ring no
where's your producer with the string
down there right he's got a fishing line
is above me business thing like here
you've got a defined plane like I could
do I could do anything and amazed you
know yeah punch take a piece of paper I
just ball it up and it disappears yeah
it's and you didn't drop it on the floor
threw it over the back of the laptop
hahaha yeah this is very easy to impress
somebody and be a skype but I could try
to do a trick worry if you want no I you
know what you I'm already impressed i
mean we I've seen the actual pilot of
the show and I just want to encourage
people that it's I love what you're
doing because it's very unique in this
way of you describe it you're mixing all
of these things together I really I
don't think there's anything like it out
there that we've seen lately so that's
what makes it pretty hot to me and
that's why we wanted to bring you on
here if you want to show me some of that
magic what you got you know what their
magic fingers let's go let's go let's
see this out here because i'm i'm at the
i'm in the green room for @midnight
right now and they have all these snacks
over here i may have some Oreos okay i
love do i love doing magic with food so
i'll do a little Oreo trick try to get
close here i'm gonna just kind of weird
not real trick by what that's just me
just hungry you're just hungry hey but
watch the cookie part here just give a
little shake oh right I'm just gonna put
that back in the pile and nobody will
ever know whoo I don't I don't know what
I just I don't even know where that came
from you have like a squeeze bottle in
your thumb is I don't even know I do I
have the power to mentally just control
cream
that doesn't sound right I should be
yeah no you know what that's sounded
perfect so you know what we we also have
questions I when we talked about the
mystery and the Wonder in the magician
culture I don't even honestly if I'm
speaking ignorantly please let me know
but right people that reveal the tricks
or people that have in the past I
remember watching on on a channel when I
was younger they did this magician who
is trying to spoil all those great
tricks that you saw to let people know
this is how it's really done wear a mask
yeah yeah exactly right he don't wanna
he didn't want to break the code of the
Brotherhood or whatnot um because of
that do you are there actually between
magicians is there any is there any like
be four you guys friends within that
community I go the competition what's it
like it's super competitive I think like
the magic community is very similar I
think to the comedy community in that
you know where's they're supportive but
there's a lot of kind of like frenemy
action happening cuz everyone you know
even more so magic because comedy music
like people acknowledge that you can
have many favorite comedians and many
favorite bands in different genres and
that it's a wide art form with so much
to love with magic I think equally wide
art form to love so many genres but
people don't really think of it that way
they think of kind of like there's like
room for one or two magicians and
because of that magicians tend to be
very competitive they all want to be
that one or two guy so hopefully I think
since magics kind of making a resurgence
I think people are realizing that there
is you know there's there's a wide scope
there's close to magic there's comedy
there's illusions what we know mentalism
there's so much to take in in terms of
you know the exposure like yeah people
magicians were pretty pissed off about
the mast The Masked Magician after today
obviously like I think most people who
watch that show probably couldn't tell
you what trick how it worked you know
they don't really remember it but what
it does is I think it puts the mindset
to people that magic is just a puzzle
you know like figure this out can't
figure it out here's how it works you
know and magic is so much more magic is
like it's an art form that can be used
as a metaphor you know to express so
many things and I think if you're just
thinking about magic as to the the how
you're missing so much of the the
potential for you know
why you know I think magic can can be
really beautiful and poetic and you know
political and make you know statements
about society like I try to do inside a
mouth magic you can actually I think be
even more controversial and edgy and you
know push the envelope more when you're
because magic takes the edge off of
thing so my comedy I could push the
envelope more than if I was just a
straight comedian cuz something about
when you're a magician kind of makes it
just a little more warm and fuzzy and
your message can kind of go down a
little easier just in a really quickly
favorite magician growing up or anyone
who inspired you oh yeah man I mean like
when I was a kid it was Lance Burton and
David Copperfield that I first saw and
I'm and now I'm so lucky I can actually
calkins like they've become you know I
mean I've idolized them and now you know
we tweet back and forth with each other
super cool Penn &amp;amp; Teller will always I
think as soon as I realized how
subversive magic can be and that you can
you know really reinvent the art form
and have magic that means something and
makes a statement they were really
inspiring to me and they still are I
mean they're always doing new stuff
they've been together for 40 years is a
performing team and they're you know
they're making such strong statements
and always pretty new things in the show
and then there's great comedy magicians
David Williamson Mac King uh so many so
many great guys out there that have
inspired me over the years you know I
saw your shoe pop up in the corner I
thought you're gonna do some like shoe
trick or something I was like what is he
gonna do what what what is he gonna do
now you made the iphone disappear you
put the cream of the cook I thought
something was gonna have like the shoes
imagica Lee make the room smell bad
that's great trick that I do if I remove
this yours your sweaty foot stinky foot
typing no motive appears yeah I want
smoke we all we all have we all have our
Bugaboos so Justin you know thank you so
much for hanging out with us again
sleight of mouth it airs tonight 12
midnight that's East Coast and West
Coast 1130pm central you got a deck of
cards yeah well let's do that baby cuz
uh so you know we viewers don't know
this but we you know I kind of switch
the skype to get a better connection and
before I before I dialed you up just now
I took a deck of cards and I went
through the deck and I turned well I
won't even show you I turned one card
the other way so there's one card facing
the wrong way in the deck
this might be a good luck omen for me

deck of cards it's aged two three four
five six seven eight nine ten Jack Queen
King club hearts diamonds spades name
