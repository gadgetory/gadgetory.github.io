iPhone 4s is here and it's not as bad as
we thought
plus more new phones and tablets from
CTIA how to make your Android phone act
more like Siri and a special goodbye to
Steve Jobs it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood welcome to
the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line regular viewers of the show may
have noticed there was no tech review
last week the death of Steve Jobs was of
course the big story of the week and we
were doing our best to give his memory
the energy it deserved we'll take a
moment to remember him in our bottom
line later in the show but we have a lot
of other items to cover this week too so
let's get started with the good though
it isn't the iPhone 5 that everyone was
hoping for the shiny new iPhone 4s has
made its way into our building and Kent
German is here with his official first
look hi I'm Kent German section editor
for cnet.com today we take a first look
at Apple's newest iPhone the iPhone 4s
this is the first iPhone that will be
available to three carriers Sprint is
joining the Apple family here in the US
and we finally get a 64 gig model and
all versions will be available in either
black or white from the start so we
don't have to wait around for that white
phone like we did last year today I'm
gonna look at the Sprint phone now for
the most part all of the versions are
exactly the same now there are a few
differences Verizon and Sprint have they
do have a dual band CDMA and GSM support
it is a good thing though to see that
world roaming because the original
Verizon iPhone did not have that with
the design the iPhone 4s looks exactly
the same as the iPhone 4 the only
difference is you'd see is that the CDMA
versions don't have a line where the gsm
does in the antenna but that's really it
one thing I would like to see in the
design at some point is a bigger screen
it's 3.5 inches that hasn't grown since
the iPhone came out in 2007 we see a lot
of phones now that are 44.5 I think 4.5
might be a little too big but you do
notice a difference if you have a larger
phone and then you switch back to this
one the antenna is exactly the same but
Apple did say that there are now two
antennas for the cellular calls and the
phone will switch back and forth on the
screen you'll see most of the same icons
there's some new icons from iOS viable
course but the iPhone 4s does bring a
few changes the first is Siri Siri is a
voice assistant program now the iPhone
has always had voice commands and
dialing but see where he goes a whole
step further
by also delivering all sorts of
information so you can ask it to do
things and you can ask the deliver
information what is the date today is
brian tong the coolest person ever it's
pretty cool it's still in beta prone
format and there you go that's Siri on
the camera side we finally get a bump up
to 8 megapixels which is nice of course
the iPhone 4 was 5 megapixels the iPhone
4s also adds a sensor which has more
allows more light the camera is supposed
to be 32 times faster when you take
photos
it also can record 1080p video clips at
30 frames per second things you need to
know specifically have the sprint model
a sprint is the only carrier right now
that's gonna be offering unlimited data
for its iPhone that's a big deal
sprint says it's gonna keep this for a
while we really hope it does because
that really is a nice leg up for Sprint
now as far as connectivity goes we don't
have 4G I think apples gonna wait
they're gonna come out maybe on the next
iPhone but they really want those 4G
networks to be everywhere and they want
the technology to be really good before
they add it on their phone so not quite
surprising that we have to wait on that
one
of course the iPhone 4s does have all
the benefits of iOS 5 just mention a
couple new notifications the PC free
activation and update system reminders
better Twitter enhancements iMessage and
some great camera editing features
another big addition to the iPhone 4s is
that a5 processor it is a dual-core 1
gigahertz processor along with a dual
core GPU so it's twice as fast will
offer graphics and performance that is
seven times faster than the iPhone 4s so
I've used it just briefly and I can't
say I really see a difference of course
if you're sprint customer being wanting
the iPhone for years
certainly now is the time to buy I like
what I see here I like the enhancements
and over a million people about this
phone already so they certainly like it
too I'm concerned and this has been a
first look at the Sprint version of the
iPhone 4s
okay so sure it's not the new hardware
and maybe not the phone that everyone
was hoping for but there's no denying
the iPhone 4s is a great phone although
if you're an owner of the iPhone 4
already it might not be the most
necessary upgrade speaking of phones the
cell phone industry group CTIA held its
fall convention this week and they
focused it on the growing use of
smartphones and tablets in the business
world but don't worry that can still
mean hot gadgets and there was no
shortage of new business ready hardware
on display in San Diego this week our
mobile team was on hand to bring you the
highlights everyone I'm testing it's all
part for cnet.com here at CTIA in San
Diego and I've got in my hands is the
Samsung stratosphere this is a new phone
for Verizon and a big deal with this
phone is that it's much more enterprise
friendly so it's got VPN got on phone
encryption and it's got support for
Microsoft ActiveSync so that will be
your corporate email all your calendars
things like that specs wise it's got a
four inch Super AMOLED screen and that's
bright and clear and really pretty to
use it's also running Android 2.3
Gingerbread one of its other claims to
fame is that it is the first 4G LTE for
Verizon that comes with a slide-out
QWERTY keyboard so it's got a five
megapixel camera and camcorder on the
back a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front
it runs off of a 1 gigahertz single core
processor it costs one $49.99 with a new
two-year service agreement and that will
be available on October 13th
so I'm Jessica's all for it this is
Samsung stratosphere for Verizon and
you're watching cnet.com I'm Nichola
senior associate editor for cnet.com and
this is a person at the Motorola Atrix
to the Atrix to is is successor to the
original Atrix that was debuted earlier
this year at CES the Atrix just a little
longer a little leaner a little slimmer
it also has a new 4.3 inch qHD display
on the side you do get the micro USB
charging port as well as the HDMI out on
top is a 3.5 millimeter headset jack in
the usual power button right here on the
back is a new and improved 8 megapixel
camera with LED flash the 8 megapixel
camera has 1080p HD video capture the
Motorola Atrix 2 has plenty of features
and plenty of power he has a dual-core 1
gigahertz ti processor
it also has plenty of features like GPS
Wi-Fi and in terms of Android 2.3
Gingerbread
it also has web top functionality that
changes this phone into a portable PC
when plugged into an HD station or a
laptop dock the motorola atrix steel
also supports the fashioned version of
HSPA+ that's it SP a class with 21
megabits per second the Motorola Atrix 2
will be available October 16th for $99
after a two-year service agreement with
AT&amp;amp;T
I'm the colonist has been a personal at
the Motorola Atrix 2
everyone is up kids all cars for
cnet.com here in ctia and I'm looking
here at the t-mobile springboard now
this is a seven inch Android 3.2
honeycomb tablet manufactured by Huawei
but it's co-branded with t-mobile so
t-mobile has really customized it the
way that it wants to one of those
customizations that you can see is there
that there are these five separate home
screens that are organized by
entertainment social networking
productivity and then there's one for
you to basically customize on your own
so it's a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor that runs the show it's also
HD it's 1280 by 800 pixels so that's a
pretty high pixel density it looks
pretty good and you know it's kind of a
small screen but it does look really
clear and really bright so that's
something that's really nice about it
it's also got an aluminum unibody it's
got a 5 megapixel rear facing camera a
1.3 megapixel front facing camera there
is Wi-Fi of course and 4G supports plus
there is HDMI out there's a surround
sound and there is six up to six hours
of battery life pricing and availability
have not been announced yet but we are
told that we will be very impressed with
the low cost of this so this again is
t-mobile springboard and it is a 4G
dual-core 7-inch tablet be sure to check
out even more new phones right now at
CNET TV although it's still in beta
Apple's new voice command system called
Siri is one of the most compelling
reasons to buy an iPhone 4s but for all
you Android phone users out there you
don't have to wait to start using voice
commands at all here's Sharon Vaknin to
show you how to get started hey everyone
I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com and today
I'll show you how to use voice commands
on your Android phone when Apple
announced Siri the voice recognition
system for the iPhone 4s every Android
user was like Hello we can do the same
thing some Android phones come stocked
with a proprietary voice command service
like nuance but I've got a couple of
other options that I think work much
better let's start with Google Voice
Search which uses Voice Actions to
complete your tasks if you don't have it
yet download it for free from the market
to get started press and hold the search
button on your Android phone to call it
voice search or if your phone doesn't
have that button long press a home
screen select widgets and add the Google
search widget now press the microphone
and speak a command like get directions
to target and you'll get driving
directions to a store near you or email
Christopher Parker subject hello message
are we still meeting today and the phone
will compose a message using that format
there are 10 total voice actions that
you can use to get things done which you
can view by tapping the microphone
pressing help and sliding through the
options you'll see one called
note to self so if you're driving and a
brilliant idea comes to mind launch
voice actions and say note to self
I should start using voice control more
often you'll get an email with the
transcription and the voice recording
voice actions is good for basic tasks
but if you want to do more fun things
like update your Facebook status or find
movie tickets you should
try out fling go grab it from the
Android Market and launch it using the
search button or add the widget to a
home screen now tap the microphone or
long-press the search button select of
lingo and say a command like buy movie
tickets for The Lion King in San
Francisco Vlingo will complete the
command and show you all the movie times
if you tap the Vlingo
icon you'll see a full list of voice
commands and at the bottom there's an
option to hear incoming messages tap it
turn it on and Vlingo will read incoming
text messages out loud to you to reply
by voice open the text tap the
microphone button and speak your reply
sure let's meet at 6 you can also get
emails played back to you by going to
settings safe reader settings checking
this box here and adding an email
account if you like Vlingo more than
voice actions set it as your default app
by long pressing the search button
checking this box and selecting Vlingo
next time you tap and hold the button
you'll immediately be prompted to say a
command
lingo also has an in-car component for
hands-free commands which Antoine
covered in an episode of tap that app to
do play with both of these apps to
figure out which one is right for you
and realize that they might not always
get what you're saying
but they're smart so the more you use
voice commands the better the apps get
at understanding you if you have any
questions or have suggestions for
another voice command app leave me a
comment on my Facebook page and visit
how to cnet.com for more videos like
this first CNET I'm Sharon Vaknin and
I'll see you on the interwebs
now me personally I use speech-to-text
on my Android phone all day every day
and I'm actually fine if my phone lets
me do all the talking and with that it's
time to take a break so director go to
commercial
we'll be back with more tech review
right after this
welcome back to the scene high tech
review our weekly video digest of all
things good and bad we've seen here at
CNET TV continuing on in the good it may
look the same on the outside but Apple's
littlest touchscreen ipod also got a
makeover and a price drop last week
here's Donald Bell with a new iPod nano
hey I'm Zalman Bell and this is Apple
updated iPod Nano for 2011 this is
essentially the same design that Apple
introduced in 2010 offered in the same
seven colors but with an updated
software if you already have a 2010
model the software update comes free as
an automatic iTunes download now one of
the big changes that Apple's made for
2011 is the price which is down to $129
for 8 gigabytes or $149 for 16 gigs the
touchscreen interface now shows just one
icon at a time instead of grouping them
together in a grid of four which makes
it easier to operate also the watch
feature now has 18 different watch faces
to choose from including a few for the
kiddies but the coolest feature Apple is
thrown in here is the full Nike Plus
fitness system before you'd have to use
a sensor in your shoe and have a Nike
connector plugged into the bottom of the
iPod but now all you need is this the
built-in pedometer can track walking and
running as two separate features and
when you plug it back into your computer
iTunes will upload all that information
to a free Nike Plus account where you
can track your progress and set goals
it's a great feature for this kind of
gym friendly mp3 player everything else
on the Nano is just what you'd expect
you get apples outstanding support from
music podcasts audiobooks and playlists
the FM radio has this unique live pause
feature that lets you temporarily pause
and resume live radio and extras like
photos timers stop watches are all nice
to have and of course let's not forget
the clip the metal clip here on the back
makes it easy to take with you and no
matter which way you clip it you can use
two fingers to rotate the screen around
it's also useful to know that a
double-click on the sleep button will
skip to the next track so that's the
updated 2011 iPod Nano a useful and
stylish choice for the gym there's still
a little pricey compared to something
like the sand of sand the line of mp3
players which can be had for under $50
seems calm I'm Donald oh okay the iPod
Nano is fine but you will never convince
me that it should be a watch never ever
let's just not talk about it and turn
our attention to the bat sure the iPhone
4s is getting rave reviews mainly
because let's be honest iOS 5 has this
phone ready for primetime but that does
not mean the 4s delivers everything you
wanted to have here's Brian Cooley with
the top 5 let downs in the iPhone 4s
well I'm not sure if apples slowing down
or if we've just come to expect a
jetpack from the one month and a flying
car the next but it's pretty clear the
iPhone 4s rollout was treated as a
fizzle by the blue karate who turned on
Apple like it had just eaten their red
ball so to examine the origins of this
site guys i'm brian coolie here with the
top five ways the iphone 4s or at least
its unveiling disappointed number five
the screen is the same size that's code
for small sorry but Apple has definitely
slipped here iPhone is now categorized
in the bottom third of the smartphone
market if you sort them by screen size
somewhere between its dainty
three-and-a-half inch screen and the
pizza box that is let's say a droid x is
the roomier yet pocketable piece of real
estate this phone's retina technology
deserves come on Apple you're serving us
a great meal but you're making a star
while we eat it number four it's the
same number apparently Apple ain't
Porsche it can't just slap an S on a
hotter model and have the crowd go wild
this whole four versus five letdown
thing was fed by the fact that almost
every rumor about a pending iPhone 5
also had the statement somewhere in it
maybe we'll just get an iPhone 4s so the
idea of the 4s being some kind of
consolation prize was baked in the rumor
cycle from the beginning but remember of
all the parties that suggested to you an
iPhone 5 was even possible Apple wasn't
one of them number three it's a 4s not
for G a somewhat unfair disappointment
I'll explain that in a moment but it is
a stark one the Android phones for
example have many handsets that are
already working on the fast new 4G
networks and those are all the buzz
compare that to Apple who just isn't
playing the 4G game yet but given the
beta ish state of 4G networks and phones
right now this is a little bit like
whining that you can't enjoy the same
spotty availability and crap battery
life your friends are getting number two
it looks the same the buzz around a
dramatic new hardware design was huge
there were reports that China's
stick foundries are pumping out new
cases it looked like lima beans or
something and then there were those
rendered images based on credible
sources who we now know probably just
spotted a chrome rice paddle in some
kitchen store and started blogging about
it drunk
whatever happened you're gonna need to
put a Hello Kitty sticker on your 4s to
tell it from your friends four and that
pisses off the shiny object crowd and
the number one reason the iPhone 4s
unveiling disappointed a lot of folks is
that there was no one last thing this is
where we're used to getting the jetpack
steve-o would toss out something utterly
new with a sanguinetti that made you
feel like everything you've done in your
life to now is lame compared to what
Apple did just this week the team did
wrap up though with a demo of a pretty
amazing voice technology called Siri but
it's still in beta came off like a
response to something Android already
does and Siri means ass in Japanese come
on what's the upside of all these
shortcomings nothing Apple will probably
sell more for asses than any other
smartphone in the world and any other
iPhone ever made previously but Apple is
getting one message clear enough to hear
over a 3GS running on AT&amp;amp;T that it's a
tough room now for more top fives like
this go to top-5 cnet.com i'm brian cool
obviously a lot of you decided you don't
care about those disappointments given
the number of people who pre-ordered the
phone already but still I was totally
ready to buy an iPhone 5 with a bigger
screen and now I don't know what to do
so frustrating while I ponder this
dilemma let's move along to this week's
bottom line as you know Steve Jobs
passed away last week and all around the
world people were visiting Apple stores
to pay their respects and mourn his loss
here are some of those reflections from
the Apple Store in San Francisco
genius only comes around once I know
couple centuries
so like this sing thanks and you know
rusted piece I think through Apple and
iPhone and everything he's gonna leave
all
I don't really think that words can
really describe like anything about
Steve other than just greatness it's
just right to do you know to respect a
guy who had given the world so much like
in terms of technology and you know
rejuvenated a company that was on the
edge of disaster mister Jobs was a
visionary he changed the world he
changed the face of technology and his
perfectionism shows itself and
everything he did and this is where we
go to recognize what his achievements
I was founder and CEO of an app
development company he made that entire
company possible I wouldn't have been
doing what I was doing for last few
years if it wasn't for the iPhone and
his inventions just feel incredibly sad
I think the world over has lost a really
incredible man and a visionary and he
will be he'll be deeply missed
pita showed the world that technology is
obtainable there's the things that they
prophesied it in back to the future and
there's different movies you know this
man here came out and he created it and
he gave it to us you know and it was it
was so obtainable to where every kid you
seen had an iPod
he's just one of the best minds of our
generation I mean that's there's no
other way to say I mean he's so affected
our generation so and the those younger
than me much you know so deeply because
it's just changed the way they've all
communicated with each other so I can't
there's really there isn't really words
to express how much he's changed Society
it's incredible I was on the train here
and I was like I just had to make a
poster that to show everybody how I feel
like my thoughts the quotes from the
think different campaign in the 90s it's
the last line said because the people
who are crazy enough to think they can
change the world are the ones who do and
the end he did he changed the world
the bottom line this week
thanks for everything Steve no matter
what you thought about Steve Jobs
personally or even about Apple products
there is no question that his vision and
creativity changed the technology world
forever twice over in fact with the
personal computer revolution and then
the mobile computing revolution and that
vision and creativity will be missed
Happy Trails buddy that's gonna do it
for this time but come back next week
for an all-new CNET tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at scene at tv.com
see you next time and thank you for
