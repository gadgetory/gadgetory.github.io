pro and depth-of-field adapter is a
shooting rig for your phone that
supports not only 37 millimeter screwin
lenses but Canon EF mount lenses as well
it's cleverly designed and well
thought-out and it promises to be a very
useful tool for phone ographers if and
when it ships in August I'm Laurie
groanin and this is the Beast Pro and
DOF adapter this is what the B script
Pro looks like and it's fully assembled
for it's got a big grip adjustable
spring-loaded clamp section for phones
of most sizes and multiple standard
screw mounting holes and will cost $90
as the name implies the $150 DOF adapter
allows you to add better lenses for more
control over background defocus than is
possible with these smaller closer
lenses now you've seen it assembled
here's how it gets that way first you
can start with just the grip side if you
want you can just clamp your phone in it
and use it as a better grip for taking
photos or videos this is the mount side
it slides in via the rails to insert the
phone you just push up and slide in you
have to align it through the lens
opening and then you tighten it in place
next you screw in the lenses this is the
10x close-up lens that it comes with the
B script Pro and you'll most likely need
it at the bottom of your depth of field
adapter stack if you just get the B
script Pro you it comes with several 37
millimeter lenses that you can attach
and stack whatever next you put a 10x
macro converter that converts the 37
millimeter route to the 52 millimeter
male next comes the focusing screen
mechanism this to me is the most
difficult part because the focusing
screen
floats between two different screw
mounds and I find it very tricky to make
sure that it's level when you're
screwing in all these pieces that may
turn a little bit next comes the EF
mount
that just screws in also and finally the
EF lens of your choice I just happened
to have this one sitting around it's
probably a little big if you're going to
be shooting handheld but it's fine if
you're on a tripod so notice what
happens if the focusing screen is not
level but also notice that the image is
flipped you will probably need an
application that can flip it back the
other way such as filmic Pro for video
which is what I tested with you can also
mount anything that has a typical cold
shoe mount like an LED light panel or a
microphone other caveats are that you
really have to use a lens faster than f
2.8 for optimal effect and because
you're shooting through multiple lenses
and other obstructions the quality does
take a bit of a hit overall though it's
a really clever and though not pretty
it's quite elegantly designed here's
hoping they make their goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
