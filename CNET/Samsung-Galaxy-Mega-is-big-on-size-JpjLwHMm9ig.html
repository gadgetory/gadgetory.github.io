CNN and this is the Samsung Galaxy
Gigantor no it's not it's the Samsung
Galaxy mega but it is an enormous phone
has a six point three inch screen now
with a phone like this and with its
price $150 on contract with AT&amp;amp;T you're
looking at some trade-offs unfortunately
some of that does mean the screen it has
only a 720p resolution on this big
screen which means that it's going to
look
noticeably fuzzier grainy err and a
little bit noisier than smaller phones
with higher resolution the mega also has
a slightly slower processor than premium
phones like the galaxy s4
it has a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
processor in here gameplay is still
totally fine but it didn't seem quite as
it be and it seems a little bit jerky or
just navigating around and doing normal
things let's talk about the size for a
minute it is enormous it's huge it looks
a little bit ridiculous on the air
you're going to have a harder time
fitting in into pockets if your pockets
are larger than it might be easier
definitely fits into bags and purses
though this is the kind of phone that
you're going to get if you want to have
a sort of tablet like experience on
something that is a mid-range smartphone
so the price is really the appeal here
$150 for something that you can sort of
use like a very small tablet it does
resemble the galaxy s4 quite a lot it's
got a physical home button on the bottom
has an IR blaster on the top so you can
control your TV and it has an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash on the
back joined by a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing camera there is support for
a 1080p HD video capture so the mega is
definitely a mid-level performer there's
nothing wrong with it but if you want
more of a premium experience you'll
definitely want to hold out for the
samsung galaxy note 3 that's coming up
that's going to be a much more high
powered device and it should have a
stylus as well however if you're looking
for value this phone does offer it but
keep in mind that there will be a little
bit of a trade-off with the screen
resolution
I'm Jessica ball for mercy net you can
