Beecham producer for the C net Apple buy
the extra crushing podcast with your
host mr. Bryant oh um what's up
everybody welcome to the show
it is episode Believe It or Not one to
one Apple white extra crunchy you know
how we keep it machi it is our kind of
extra piece add-on piece to the actual
weekly video show that uh I think
actually should have just gone up just a
just a moment ago oh cool but let me get
to what we're gonna talk about here
today we're talking about iPhones extra
large we're gonna talk about the Galaxy
S 9 and where it plays with all this but
before we get to the actual show
remember you guys gals were either
watching live or we have call ins all
the time you make the show what it is so
call us at 1-866-376-8255 nation runs
deep alright so let's just jump into the
show right now the big story that was
that start off this week really comes
down to kind of a confirmation of what
we had heard earlier from kji securities
the fact that there's going to be three
new iPhones in 2018 well our friends
mark German and company he's been a
guest on the show have confirmed at
least that aspect that yes there will be
three iPhones really a big iPhone X plus
6.5 inch OLED based I phone there will
still be a new updated 5.8 inch iPhone
10 or whatever they call it the 11 or
whatever the X I will see and then there
will still be a new iPhone that is six
point one inches it'll still hold the
same design of the iPhone 10 look and
feel but it will be an LCD based display
it'll still have face ID and the true
depth sensor but that's all going to be
in that package what they're really
trying to do is come up with a phone
that looks like the iPhone 10
but is cheaper and more affordable
because Apple actually missed their
expectations and target goals for the
iPhone 10 of this year the firt on the
launch and at least did not exceed the
expectations or even meet them from what
they had projected now there are kind of
a few key things about this iPhone 10
plus that is going to be a little
different first of all some of the
rumblings at least according to
Bloomberg this has not been confirmed
yet but they do believe that the iPhone
10 plus will have dual sims in it and
what does that mean that makes it easier
to travel internationally depending on
which carries you're bouncing around
that are even flirting with the idea of
incorporating isom in addition to you
know the sim cards we have ECM right now
the only if I were right the only Apple
product that has an ISA minute right now
is the Apple watch series 3 right now
but it's not as compatible
internationally and that's probably the
biggest issue with it they are looking
at it but according to report that's not
set in stone
other things that we've heard about this
new iPhone 10 plus according to
Bloomberg it will come in a gold color
option and it'll also bring a resolution
of 1242 by 2688 that would still fall
somewhere in that over 450 500 pixels
per inch that we were expecting but that
is still not anywhere near I mean look
when you get to a certain point things
are gonna look sharp really sharp but I
think the samsung galaxy s 9s PPI is
somewhere around 560 or so so they're
still bringing a sharper screen even
though like to our naked eyes it's it's
a little tricky a little difficult to
tell the difference so that was kind of
the big story that happened earlier this
week on Monday in addition to that there
were leaks of what's claimed to be the
iPhone 10 plus display it was a leaked
out in a Vietnamese Factory a pretty
much LG Display which is based in
Vietnam there's a photo that is showing
this person holding it now Beach when I
look at this photo
it's either actually a larger display
piece you can see there's a spot for the
knotch or it's someone with very tiny
hands so I was gonna say that guy could
have really tiny hands like don't
the countlessly has a little baby
sausage fingers honestly yeah he does
have this thumb is dramatically short
actually well yeah that notch though
look at that a notch there and then
there's like a black like a you know
like a bezel like the black that's like
the little border that that's on its
it's on our current iPhone so it's just
a display piece that's out there but
look we are expecting two iPhones three
will be coming this is kind of the
second legitimate source to really
confirm this so we'll move forward and
hey that's what it's gonna be also we
know that if we're gonna stick kind of
on this theme of phones we can't ignore
that Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
Spain happened this week I believe today
is the last day it's just wrapping up
there were a boatload of phones but how
can we talk about our Mobile World
Congress without timeout
I guess we'll talk about the s9 in a
second should we do that yeah let's talk
it's popular but I do want to talk about
this phone before we get the s9a seuss
unveiled the ultimate iPhone clone it's
their zenfone 5 series it has a notch it
has a smaller notch it's a large screen
phone even on the rear it's a vertical
dual lens camera in that same sweet spot
if you didn't know any better and
without a doubt from a distance this
looks like an iPhone 10 I don't know how
they're gonna get away with not getting
sued by Apple with this design
specifically after everything that
happened but this is a straight-up
ripoff man dude even the advertisement
looks like an Apple advertisement with
all the colors and the swirling and the
it's crazy but phone it does the big
thing about this n phone five series
from a soos is that price retail price
it's gonna start at is around five
hundred ninety US dollars that's awesome
a little less than nine hundred ninety
nine if you know what I mean all right
so let's talk about kind of the meat and
potatoes from Mobile World Congress
we got the galaxy s 9 now or I'm not
gonna get into all the specifics specs
about the galaxy s 9 you can pretty much
look at that everywhere
on our site on other youtubers but what
an interesting thing that came out of
this was early benchmarks of the Galaxy
S nine now what happened is an antic
went to the unveiling in Spain and they
ran tests that you can run on any phone
right speed test we have a geek bench
there's other tests like speedometer web
XP RT there's a lot of different tests
you can run these phones just to get a
general idea of their speed now when
they ran put this to the test
according to geek bench for single core
score Anandtech found that the X eNOS 98
10 in the samsung galaxy s 9 is slower
performing than the a 11 and the a 10
apple chips so we're talking about
iPhone 10 iPhone 8 it's not up to snuff
with the the 810 was the Aten was an
iPhone 7 so so we're talking about phone
or you know this is so we're talking
about the phones that aren't up to speed
now again then Samsung came back and
said look this is demo floor units it's
not the final firmware and so I'm gonna
give them a pass on that because we
won't know until it's the final retail
product in hand but at least according
to these tests it does appear that from
a raw power standpoint and again this
doesn't factor in the actual operating
system and how its optimized or not
optimized for these chips but at least
initially if you want to start some you
know phone Wars you want to start some
beef with your friends good or you want
to brag you want to say like dude I told
you apples on top baby apples on top
your phone your phone speed is 4 years
old
you can go rip on your Galaxy buddies
some people that listen the show
probably won't even talk to someone who
has a galaxy phone like nah I ain't
havin it but at least that's the latest
from the early benchmark to keep a beak
bench geek bench for benchmarks as well
as pedometer 2.0 those the early
indications I won't make too much about
it I wouldn't really like try to blow
this up but it's just a little nugget
that's out there so fine
let's say initially the galaxy s nine
can't top the iPhone current iPhone even
when it comes to speed we haven't even
seen what Apple's gonna drop on us with
the rumored and most expected a12 let's
talk about DxO mark now Beach do you
remember this company they're the one
that's kind of like does the analysis of
the cameras and kind of gives a score
yeah yeah yeah benchmark totally so I
know you're okay guys and gals listening
or watching he's actually literally
juggling like a camera roll audio levels
like the dude is doing a lot of stuff
check no one's chatting with the
chatroom that chat room right yeah okay
well I'm gonna let you listen out I
guess okay so DxO mark has always kind
of put out these scores as the reference
for image quality when it comes to
smartphone cameras they they've kind of
made themselves an authority but it is
also you know some people don't really I
don't even say understand them some
people don't put a lot into them as well
because it just seems like every time a
new camera comes out they raise the
score level now first things first
marques Brownlee mkbhd did a breakdown
of what a DXL mark score really means
and what they do is they have
professionals score these phones it's an
aggregate score and there is no 100 is
not the best score okay so if you're
like oh this is this hit the 100 mark
that's that's not how DXL mark scores it
bones can get higher than the 100 mark
right now all phones overall score is
below that but this is what we got they
tested up the samsung galaxy s 9 and
based on their tests where they factored
a lot of things everything from you know
exposure focus color balance they found
that the samsung galaxy s 9 plus
specifically the plus with the dual lens
camera is the best smartphone camera
they have ever tested oh wow
last year the pixel 2 was their best
smartphone that they'd ever test they
gave the pixel to an actual 98 overall
score and the scores are gonna compose
again like I said of different things
but let me just pull this up really
quick in the DxO mark samsung galaxy s 9
scored
gave it an overall score for photo
specifically of 104 they called that
their highest score they've ever given
to any still photo camera when it came
to video it was scored at a 91 surprise
surprise the pixel 2 is actually at
least up to this point the
highest-scoring mobile camera when it
comes to video at a 96 but overall if
you talk about like exposure contrast
color autofocus texture noise they
factor all this in and they come have
come to the conclusion like the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plus is the best camera on
the market right now that you can get
that's cool so you know guess what
people are gonna have inferiority
complex users gonna be like I don't
believe you DxO mark until the iPhone 11
is the top the highest rated smartphone
camera we have ever tested yeah I mean
at the Samsung event that we did on
Sunday like they really were playing up
the phone camera and a lot of people
were just like oh it's boring another
great camera or whatever but it's a big
deal like everyone wants a good picture
wants to be able to just take out their
phone and take a quick picture without
having to worry about it a lot so that's
a big deal to have the best camera so
far but you know and some other camera
will come next year knock it out but the
biggest thing that makes it special is
this very variable aperture this is a
lens that can switch on the fly it's
actually uh I'm a kid a mechanism right
where the blades of the lens you know
closed or open like this depending on
which aperture you want you want more
light in you go with an f15 you you know
you don't need as much light and f2 for
is fine it switches between those two
apertures that's honestly that's an
awesome innovation in the camera space
so you've got to give them props for
that they really over-promoted their
whole super slow-mo feature look there's
cameras that do super slow-mo and even a
higher than a 720p resolution the sony
XZ 2 is doing that so for them to make a
big big deal about that I didn't really
care but yeah the photo phone the
photography and it makes a difference I
just think that look every year
it's almost like the newest phone is the
next great photo phone but at the end of
the day all these phones are ridiculous
when it comes to photos they are like no
matter what whether you're an iPhone
user you know whether you're a pixel
user or asinine user LGB 30 those those
are the cream of the crop when it comes
to cameras yeah and the pixel everyone
loves the pixel to I mean looking at
these like side-by-side comparisons
here's the Samsung Galaxy S 9i phone X
like they all look pretty similar you
know it's kind of hard to tell him apart
now and a lot of times even just like
color temperature and saturation can be
a personal preference and guess what if
you are a real photographer you're gonna
run this stuff and process this through
apps you're not gonna just take it
directly from your camera lens yeah
you're gonna do things to it so it's
interesting either way the camera our
phones have now become I think the
number one feature that our phones are
starting to get defined by is a
ecosystem but people don't really talk
about that but the actual hardware
feature people care about the most is
probably either camera or speed and
speed is kind of more invisible and not
as you can't really really tell us much
if you unless you run some benchmark at
least with photos the proof is kind of
in the pudding and based on what you
like and what you see that will give you
the results so you know you got people
that will fight about what camera is the
best on the phone yeah but right now DxO
mark says the galaxy s 9 plus dual lens
camera is the best um
but here's the story of the week that
made me laugh Consumer Reports also
released their best smartphone camera
rankings I don't know if you heard about
this story this one was just ridiculous
so consumer reports we know a mainstream
brand does their own tech reviews they
put out their top 10 list of best
smartphone cameras right their top 10
list and you can scroll down on their
beach but I'm gonna read them and I'm
gonna see what you guys think about this
at number 10 the galaxy s 8 active and
number 9 the iPhone 7 plus that number 8
the Galaxy Note 8 and number 6 the
galaxy s 8 and number 5 the iPhone 6s
plus number 4
oh sorry sorry I skipped a number number
six the iPhone 6s plus number five the
iPhone 7 then we have the S eight plus
and then we have the iPhone eight plus
and then the iPhone eight and the iPhone
ten now they're in Mercer I know well
the iPhone the iPhone ten is number one
bottom line an iPhone eight is I should
probably should've just done the top
three but no there's no words like the
pluses is is less than the eight no well
there's the iPhone eight plus and a
galaxy s eight plus is that where I was
just thinking like the edge is in the
eighth plus camera oh yeah yeah iPhone
80 you would think so
but again this is this is Consumer
Reports ranking now they don't have the
S sign on this but the biggest omission
like I can't believe this happened
there's not a single pixel to phone on
this list in the top ten
oh that's right yeah the pixel two was
considered like they realized one last
year they rated the iPhone 6s number six
overall the pixel two isn't even on
their freaking list hmm that's a huge
not only is it a huge omission that that
that destroys credibility right there it
shows that the list is flawed for sure
cuz the pixel two is on the top honestly
the original pixel was better than the
6s arguably better than the sevens and
that's not even on that list - either
way I've Apple users got to love that
list cuz iPhones came in the top three
so I just wanted to make that point that
Consumer Reports you better update that
list and say we made a mistake and never
or didn't even know that pixel phones
existed it's brutal but iPhone 10 top
ranked camera for Consumer Reports
iPhone 10 number two in the DxO mark or
sorry number three in TXO mark okay
don't look at that crowd I just closed
my link iPhone 10 number sorry iPhone 10
is number three in DxO marks rankings we
have s 9 plus pixel two and then iPhone
10 for the top three cameras
got it all right double scammin one of
those someone's scam and that's for sure
all right let's take a little breather

I need these on that I mean I I work

all right um let's just jump back in the
stories there's gonna be kind of like a
mixed bag of things coming up but we
were gonna cover them all because
there's a lot of great stuff that came
out of the Apple news cycle KJ's
Securities analyst Ming Chi quo put out
a new report that Apple although we know
about the new air pods we talked about
them last week Apple is developing a
high-end over ear headphone launch in
late 2018 at the earliest it would be
their own brand high-end over ear
headphones with an all-new design the
goal here is to make them as convenient
as the air pods but obviously with over
ear better sound quality but this would
also compete directly with their beats
line what is interesting here is the
beats has always been kind of appealed
to like a younger crowd
you know bass hip-hop like current pop
stuff but you know the Apple could just
cuz Apple slaps up their logo on it
makes it a little kind of maybe appeal
to like a higher-end listener not as
much heavy bass like someone who wants
more classical music and rock basically
maybe a little older mature audience you
throw that Apple logo on it and that
audience typically with Apple spends a
lot of money because they old and they
have money yeah like that's not that bad
of an idea it's not it's not I see I see
a lot of people cruising around with
those big-ass headphones on like I'm the
bus whatever
yeah Jim I can't do it I don't I don't
want something huge on my head the Jim I
never get that yeah the Jim with a big
over the ears like what are you doing
man
it's gross because you're sweating on
your headphones man that's disgusting
but uh you know oh don't do that don't
do it but you know what's encouraging I
will say about Apple doing over the ear
headphones after what they did with the
home pod sound wise I think you know I
would not underestimate their over the
ear headphones
I don't like right they the help on
sounds awesome especially when you got
Jimmy Iovine and dr. Dre like approving
all the sound quality of stuff yeah you
know you can't lose with that
right now they they have they have a
couple um the two that they kind of
really have to compete with really is
obviously the bose qc25 two twos and
then the Sony MDX twos which are amazing
don't even have I think I'm not even
trying to yeah sorry not not the MDX my
brain is all over it's just basically
the 1000x
em twos from Sony those are amazing
headphones with like noise cancellation
and them like you have like touch sensor
controls oh nice
well what's crazy about him is if you
let's say you and I are at the office if
you cup your hand over the ear it turns
off the audio inside and let you listen
to someone outside oh wow that's pretty
cool it has bikes in front of it mics
inside of them
that's name I could use that 1000 MX
news man I'm telling you they're pretty
sick okay so anyways Apple getting to
the over the ear headphone business
pretty cool just a little follow up also
on the home pod according to data shared
by the NPD group the home pod had the
most pre-orders out of any other smart
speaker in the u.s. except the Amazon
echo dot that had already established in
a market and was sold for $49 so the
whole pod beat out all smart speakers in
their very first day of pre-orders
meaning if you compare that to any other
pre-orders for any other smart speakers
yeah like what other smart speakers are
under pre-order right now that's what
I'm not not right now though I'm just
saying in like at Google home when it
was pre-ordered Google home dot when it
was pre-ordered Amazon echo + echo show
echo dot the home pod beat out all other
smart speaker first-day pre-orders
except the Amazon echo dot again that's
that's the strength of the brand of the
Apple brand and also just good marketing
like hey we got this thing coming out
its new it sounds great that that's
that's huge you know cuz I guess when
the echo came out and the other smart
speakers like we didn't really know what
to expect so we're kind of like what
what it was what is this thing maybe
I'll get it maybe I won't I think I
bought my first one like after it had
been out for maybe a year or something -
I was exactly the same as you yeah
so that's interesting so everyone knows
that's done that's smart by Apple you
know they're like let everyone else get
in this game that's what they do put our
thing out and then it's gonna like you
know people are gonna want it and
they're gonna pre-order it more than
others so that's interesting well I you
know I'm sorry to people that listen to
the show in believe that we should buy
every single piece of Apple technology
that they make ever but I did return I
actually returned my home pod last
weekend oh you did I returned it because
I wasn't using up look I actually I get
who it's perfect for if you're an Apple
music guy and you're an Apple ecosystem
guy or gal or girl and you just want to
listen Apple music it's actually super
convenient and it's nice but beyond that
I didn't do it do anything else with it
and yeah I just people say why not your
smart home well it doesn't work with my
nest thermostat it doesn't work with my
Logitech Harmony
TVs home theater setup which are two
major components of my apartment and
it's and it honestly isn't smart enough
to do a lot of the skills and things
that I'm used to so I returned it and
I'm like you know I'll come back and
visit it if it gets better the sound I
do like a lot even though you know
people different sound whether you like
bass bait heavier attracts or not people
sound different on different speakers
breweries briefs but I returned it and
so if it gets better then I'll revisit
it but right now the home pod is not in
my possession that must've been nice to
get that for hunting for honey that's
hard to part with man it sucks so you
know some people were like
mad at me I'm like I'm telling you to
return it like there's plain people that
are happy with this and love it I think
you should love it it just wasn't for me
like that's all comes down to yeah like
hater someone's like hater I'm like okay
sorry that my purchases affect your your
emotions like go outside ah that's funny
man
all right cool new stories coming up
around the Apple watch I'm a Big Apple
watch series 3 lover I've said this from
day one once series 3 came out and watch
OS 4 came out this was the Smart Watch
to get people have criticized me like oh
over sone you're jumping onboard with
the series 3 oh my dude it wasn't good
enough you were bored with the one man
drawer because I wanted to see if
anything would change and it didn't
really change that much I would wear it
without charging it cuz I just liked how
it looked
yeah I saw you many times wearing it and
it wasn't turned on but yeah you're you
were way there from the 1 and then the 3
came out and then they made some
significant changes so now the 3 is hot
3 is the 3 in my mind is the hotness
anyways this data backs it up according
to a report from IDC they estimate that
Apple watch shipments totaled 8 million
units worldwide the last quarter so that
would be from if I if I'm reading this
yeah correctly the fourth quarter so
that would be from October to December
now if you compare that to other
competitors the research firm says it's
1 in every 5 wearables shipped last
quarter was an Apple watch thanks to the
strength of the series 3 in comparison
Fitbit came in at number 2 with the
reported sales of 5.4 million wearables
so that's respectable that's a nice big
chunk Xiaomi shipped 4.9 millions then
you go down Garmin Huawei and others but
Apple came in at number one in the Smart
Watch category for the fourth quarter of
last year and again they had a killer
product a killer Prada in the series 3
watch came out September I think it was
around the 22nd of last year so right
out of the gates
people were getting that bad boy so I
went to Kohl's to get like a new Casio
watch I was just trying to buy a cheap
watch that tells me a date I walked by
that they had Apple watches and Kohl's
that was tempted man I went looked I was
like let me look at this price little
too expensive but you know they're right
what price would you get an Apple watch
it have to be like I don't know maybe
like 150 to 150 to honey yeah yeah right
so you don't need this series three per
se because I actually think watch OS
four works pretty well know what series
two but I think Apple recently put out
some refurbished Apple watches on their
site I don't know what the two is but I
know that the series 3 which is normally
like 349 I think is down to 300 so that
would help me the series 2 refurbished
is probably like 200 220 yeah if I had
to guess I mean you can you can surf
right now and I'll just do the show and
then you can not listen to me but it's
all good I got it I got a Casio for 50
bucks rock that boom someone the chat
st. 200 someone else is saying don't buy
one okay I'll take Dante hey literally
like 20 ease after it just said don't
buy one all right um here's a cool thing
the biggest thing that I enjoy about the
Apple watch Series 3 is after they
released it there were tons of new
improvements meaning like I can listen
to streaming radio stations on this
there's finally like a legitimate
podcast app that doesn't require you to
sync it with your phone which I love
it's called is it outcast
now my brain is farting I should check
that out
I did a whole video on it it's not
overcast
I think it's outcasts anyways um just
great improvements across the board now
Apple watch Series three contract skiing
and snowboarding activity this has been
updated in partnership with developers
it'll be able to use the accelerometer
the built-in GPS and the altimeter that
is in the Apple watch series three
there's also these custom workout api's
but there's apps that have now brought
out support specifically snow with two W
Sano we call likes Noah Noah
snow snow what snow squad Alpine app so
all you ski bunnies get out there your
Apple watch now supports skiing and
snowboarding that's pretty sick I do
like to track your vertical feet I think
that is fun you know to see how much
vertical feet you've snowboarded speed
is awesome dude you could tell how fast
you're going yeah number of runs average
maximum speed time spent calories burn I
mean this is fun dirty stuff I'm not
saying this is a reasonably get the app
watch I'm just saying
the Apple watch keeps on getting better
throughout this entire year ever since
they released it I'm just like
thoroughly impressed that is fun I would
love to play with that stuff man because
they do track that at some Ski Areas
they track your vertical feet and then
you win prizes based on how much
vertical feet you snowboard in a season
or something you know which is really
cool so if you could you do that with
your Apple watch that would be even
cooler very nice very nice also on
report that recently came out this has
to do with a new patent charging case
for the Apple watch and electronically
enhanced bands we know there's like this
kind of additional data connection port
on the Apple watch body that everyone is
believed to either potentially be use in
the future for either rechargeable
watchbands or even some health medical
type devices this patent basically backs
us up a newly published Apple patent
application it hasn't been granted yet
but it has been applied for instant the
possibility of a charging case for the
watch that could also hold spare bands
it kind of looks like a place where you
put a couple bands and then
put the body of the watch separately
from each other almost more like a
travel case nice but the idea and the
thinking is out there yeah having a good
little watch case is fun man other quick
things I'm just gonna kind of ramble
through these really quickly
um iPhone wait times for battery
replacements this is a big issue because
we know how many of you have six 6s and
seven wait times for battery
replacements on the iPhone have now
jumped up from 2.7 weeks to 4.5 weeks
and so the process of this is right you
go to a store or you make an appointment
you say I need to get a replacement and
then they order this part from Apple it
then gets delivered and then they'll do
a swap they'll do a replacement for you
but right now we're timeout a wait time
of about four and a half weeks basically
a month that's a long time it's probably
pretty frustrating yeah I guess if
you're not like you know too worried
about it it won't be a big deal but that
is a long time to wait for a new battery
oh yeah oh yeah I I am gonna do this
everyone I know I threaten it a couple
weeks ago but I am gonna do this what
are you gonna do I'm gonna get my
battery replaced on my iPhone 6s cuz it
is definitely struggling man it is slow
I've got a 6s that I've just been
bouncing around town like a different
city so much I need to replace it so I
can resell it on eBay yeah yeah yeah so
maybe we should both go through this
process and then compare notes on how it
went I think so I mean we do it we do a
show about Apple I think a my probably
my I'll make that a priority other two
Nuggets the air power mat according to
reports and rumblings may be coming out
in March we've also heard rumblings
about we talked about last week about
iPads possibly coming in March I don't
think those two things unless it's a new
iPad pro with a new pencil and a new OS
that gives it true new functionality
that's the only reason why I think we
would see a March event if we get a
legit new iPad pro and an air power mat
across the board and really just all new
iPad models across the board if not I
think these will be the rumbling is that
it'll be a nine point seven inch iPad up
refresh and even if this Power Mac comes
out they're not gonna do an event for us
so that would just be kind of a general
lease but we'll see March is a whole
month
and they've historically done events I
think the past two or three years so
we'll see if we get one or not but that
could be coming and then just really to
finally wrap up this before we get to
our phone calls you gotta say nothing
but love Steve Jobs would have
celebrated his birthday on February the
24th his 63rd birthday if he was here
63 man he was so young so sad dude it's
sad for him his family and for us for
the world
I got a so anyways are you allowed to
play this or was that we're not allowed
to sing it you know what I mean like I
think open domain I mean it's just happy
birthday right did they stop us stop you
from singing it in a restaurant for a
certain time cuz you would have to like
pay or not there's like for a limited
time they're like oh you can't sing this
in a restaurant to customers yeah cuz I
noticed every restaurant does like a
different thing to go I mean had to do
with like performance rights more than
anything else okay well I will stop that
no no I'm not going to stop I mean if
that's the end of our show
like if it's because the Happy Birthday
song I'll be like yellow jobs happy
birthday come on all right yeah this is
heartless heartless alright should we
get to the phone calls yeah let's do the
phone calls my number everybody that is
watching or listening to show you can be
a part of this show we love it we just
love how active you guys and gals are
call us at
what is going on beach in town this is
Stephen out in Austin I called a while
back to let you guys know you'd asked if
the iPad Mini was dead
and I kind of made some comments about
it in education I will go ahead and tell
you guys right now that to us for the
price the iPad Mini 4 is not going to be
nearly as cost-effective now is the new
iPad that came out last year's the
regular 32gig 9 point what a French not
even a pro so we are buying those in
mass quantities a thousand of time and
that's kind of the direction we're going
and we're seeing a lot of other school
districts in Texas do the same thing
just giving you my input you guys have a
great day
thanks and you do a good job on nice
yeah man I love that perspective like
someone who's on the ground and how
their biz how education is doing that
that makes total sense to me makes total
sense a thousand a day to a thousand
orders at a time that's a lot okay let's
go to the next call here we go
hi Brian hi Steven this is Stuart from
the UK I'm calling with a bad apple I
use the camera connection kit with my
iPad an iPhone and actually the old one
the the 30-pin version and if you use it
with a lightning adapter it works just
fine or it did until about a week ago
the recent iOS 11 update changed it so
you can now long no longer use that
interface to you to upload photos to
your device from your SD card
I contacted Apple and their support told
me to go to their store and surprise
surprise when I got to the store they
told me that they could sell me two
replacement adapters for nearly 70
pounds oh it's I thought you guys would
like to know because I told them there
was no way I was going to do that and
check the software log and it wasn't
listed as I changed the software so
there's no way of avoiding this Luke
that they put put in if you upgrade
you'll no longer be able to use this old
device so I stuck to my guns and
eventually they give me two new adapters
for free so I'd let everybody know this
could be a new kind of dongle Gate bad
Apple for you love the show keep up the
good work
bye for now
thank you for that that calls really
helpful I feel like he he might even
tweeted me because I remember seeing
something similar like this and that's
awesome to let the community know but I
do have a few words for all of us moving
forward of how we should think about
this
Beechum let's get ready to dog
I'll stop I could hold it longer but I'm
gonna stop I'm gonna be nice to your ear
so I'm good gates back do you want me to
try let's get ready to duck
no one's watching or listening right now
anyways
no one cares don't care something on
periscope right now 79 people just
decided to sign out completely oh yeah
we lost 14 on YouTube also all right
here we go next call
hey guys david from dirty jersey maybe
you guys can help me figure something
out I'm trying to watch some shows on
itunes purchase the whole season and
unlike Netflix when you get to the end
of an episode you've got to basically
stop it
go back into the menu select the next
episode start the next episode as
opposed to Netflix you can have that
nice feature that autoplay feature where
it skips all the the upcoming schemes
and everything like that something basic
like that for iTunes you think would be
a given but I don't see anything in the
system that allows you to do that any
idea how to turn that on is it even an
option let me know thanks a lot bye I
don't even honestly I don't even know if
that's an option um I just want to say
that aundrea tree on e says that he's
still here list in the show okay but no
you know the thing is that's super
frustrating didn't you say Beach said
they also do it in Amazon Prime yeah
there's an option in the Amazon Prime
you could just it'll just open flame
season so you don't have to like get up
or you use a remote or do anything it
just will play which is phantom on it I
don't know if it's in the options where
you know you can pull on the Apple TV
remote you can swipe down and where the
subtitles and captions option is so but
I don't think it's there so that's a big
miss and I know especially when I'm
watching a show like this is us and I'm
all it up in my feelings and I want to
see the next episode like I want it to
display easy in the wipe my tears away
have you seen this is us - no but you
hurt some deep-rooted issues that
everyone has it's crazy yeah I mean
wonder my kids are watching like paw
Patrol or something I don't have to get
up and start every episode I'll just hit
play and let it watch okay so I'm
timeout this is us and your timeout paw
patrol paw patrols on a roll man just
cute like their song that's their theme
yeah paw Patrol is on a roll and then
they go and do whatever they're gonna do
so I okay so let's continue we got a
couple more calls to get through and
they're good ones
here we go
hey this is Brian from New Orleans I
went to throw a bad apple at apples
marketing team there's an AT&amp;amp;T
commercial that shows these beautiful
photos taken with the iPhone 8 or iPhone
10 the portrait mode mano stage lighting
I don't know about y'all but my pictures
look absolutely nothing like that
not even close so I'm not sure if they
took that was on iPhone 10 they also did
obviously there's lots of photoshop work
on it afterwards
not sure if I'm using it wrong just
wanted to know y'all experience I'm not
sure if you've seen the commercials in a
teensy commercial talking about the
portrait mode but I know it's in beta my
pictures look absolutely nothing like it
though Thanks okay so this guy it's so
funny because I never tried this out
and I was just like okay I'm just gonna
try the selfie camera stuff out just to
see what happens and like I totally
agree like it doesn't even look nearly
as refined look here here here's one
good like I mean I was trying to be all
tough this is from like I don't know I
can't remember I think it was before
we're doing but even the black-and-white
one I'm like dude it's like way grainy
or it just doesn't look as dope I was
like I don't know about that man I don't
know I'm trying to find that picture
that video on YouTube but I can't find
the AT&amp;amp;T commercial you know what in a
way actually this one does look pretty
good
you have the Millennial pose were the
Millennial because it's me not because
it's me but I was like all right that
one's kind of interest you do weighted
Millennial pose and Millennials don't
smile they just this is how they take
pictures they just know there's that
girl did this the girl the girls don't
smile no more on pictures I'm like dude
why are you smiling
my face look fat I'm like are you
serious I've legitimately heard I'm like
what Wow cool like you're no fun if you
don't smile get out of here
so you ugly okay we got a couple more
calls there we go and it's helped yeah
I'm actually ugly so that's different
right
hi I'm Brenda from Chicago and love the
show another two I'll talk about Apple
being the most innovative company and to
me personally
Apple has never been innovative you know
they've always been like second or third
to a ballgame and they just make
whatever they're using better so French
was like there were kind of smartphones
before the iPhone but then they came out
with a better and best iPhone there were
chapters before the iPad but they came
out with a better and best camera so
it's always like their dress you know
always evolutionary they're always
taking like the next step of other
people's working surface I don't know if
they're what you all think
thanks a lot yeah my friend that has
been their mo I think what is different
is when they've come late to the party
they've actually brought something
really innovative and compelling to at
least show that they've learned from
their competitors and they want to take
it up that next step but we have not
seen that specifically in a while I will
give the air pods credit they're not the
next time you be just like dude I'm so
I'm like staring at him I'm looking at
them like lovingly I'm looking at the
his frickin team air pot dude freaking
team air pods so I think the convenience
of how they connect made them really
special do you a beach do you still
don't get once a while you get like a
hit or a blip while you're listening
yeah there's there's playscape we're
loving like dead spots like in the city
like there's one corner when I wash the
street every day like goes out so it's
like some dead spots here and there but
it's weird so you work the corner every
day yeah I've crossed the corner to go
the bus and then I know that they're
gonna go out and they do like it's like
oh here's the spot where must be like a
bunch of Bluetooth Bluetooth waves
traveling through that corner or
something so you work the corner
everyday I work the corner I I show off
my goods come on oh yeah first Street or
no Fremont Street Folsom hit me up I'm
there every day about five o'clock 5:15
but yeah I think the home pot is a
really poor example of Apple actually
changing the game like a speaker that
sounds great
is great but that wasn't enough to me
that changed the game in any way shape
or form no no no but I remember I went
the first time I touched an iPhone he
was magical it was dude game changer
even the iPad man even the iPad yeah
every woman I remember I was there when
they announced it remember this is one
Apple I used to invite me to keynotes
and when I saw it on stage I'm like oh
this is awesome but you even could tell
people like it's just a big you know big
iPad iPhone and then when you touch it
you're like dude this is awesome this is
freaking awesome yeah definitely
something magical about him yeah but
sure now we got one more call right kind
of annoying happened with anybody else
dude the detail that we need to
emphasize he says I keep walking into
them not I walked into it once I keep
walking into them I'm sorry I have I
have walked into a glass panel thing
before and it hurts so uh I apologize
also just just to you know because you
and your car and I have the special
relationship hey Siri set a reminder to
listen to the Apple byte extra crunchy
every Thursday night you're welcome I
wouldn't that'll work that would be cool
if you kill us back and let us know it
works out my phone just now oh really
nice he's gonna be like different why'd
you do that to me I'm gonna play this
one last one that's for Brian real quick
okay
hey Brent oh you look like my friend
Matthew you'd like all its exactly the
same I don't know if you're a lady it's
pretty cool also I like your Apple shows
I have iPhone se but its batteries dying
everyday but I'm gonna get a iPhone 8
plus 2 what else I can get an eternal
fight sweet his iPhone se battery is
already dying
but because that's the old phone I think
the question that he nice answer for
himself is maybe I am Matthew I'll stop
but trying to find my evil laughs out of
fact maybe maybe I am at you bro maybe
your maybe your best friend moonlights
and does Internet videos whenever you
don't see him it could be possible it
could be possible all right everybody
