CNET with your first look at the samsung
galaxy s4 mini name aside the mini is
actually not that small
is about the same dimensions as an
iPhone the screen is also pretty large
at 4.3 inches so it is a lot smaller by
comparison to 5 inch screens and above
but you're gonna get some pretty good
screen real estate on this one a benefit
is that the phone is very slim and it's
very light so comparatively to other
phones it's very easy to stick in a
pocket or a person to carry around and
you can hold it for a long time without
your hands getting tired as you may have
noticed the design is very similar to
the galaxy s4 down to these steep shiny
sides and the sort of shiny stylized
backing the phone is very reflective on
the front in the back which can throw a
lot of light back in your eyes that's
one little downside to this line screen
resolution is a little bit lower here
but colors are still bright and
saturated and text still renders crisply
what is many about this phone are the
features they're definitely more
mid-range compared to the larger more
premium samsung galaxy s4 flagship for
instance there's Android 4.2.2 on here
you've got a dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor 1.7 gigahertz clock
speed processor was a little bit slower
I played a game Riptide gp2 on here and
it just seemed a lot choppier than it
does on much faster phones Temple Run 2
however was very beautiful and immersive
on this phone as for camera you've got
an 8 megapixel shooter on here just like
you did for the Samsung Galaxy s3 with
1080p HD video recording photos were
pretty good with this camera I have to
say I was very satisfied with a lot of
the shots knife shots aren't quite so
good but there is a night mode you're
gonna get a lot of the modes that you
see on the galaxy s4 but not all of them
you will however get plenty of filters
front-facing camera is 2 megapixels but
I found that images much grainy and much
less pleasing there are only 8 gigabytes
of on-board storage but there is a micro
SD card slot that can take up to 64
gigabytes so you're good there
there's 1.5 gigabytes of RAM on here as
well you'll be able to pick up the
samsung galaxy s4 mini
AT&amp;amp;T Sprint Verizon and US Cellular
right now we only have Sprint's pricing
that's going to be $0 with the new
two-year service agreement phone is
really great value at least at that
pricing so we're just gonna have to wait
and see what the other carriers are
gonna offer I'm Jessica's all court for
