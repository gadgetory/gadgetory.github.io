welcome to road warrior here in
beautiful san francisco this is where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a phone that's
more camera than thumb some tips for
your motorola q and a hard drive car we
begin however with the Fujitsu life book
II 82 10 it's a lightweight business
laptop with some great security features
for businesses that want to keep their
data secure this machine has pretty much
every option you could want on the hard
drive there's a trusted platform module
to keep your data secure there's also a
fingerprint reader for logon and a smart
card reader for dual authentication and
for those who are nostalgic it comes
with a serial and a parallel port glass
from the past need to take pictures with
your phone
Kent Germans got another camera phone
that looks and works just like a camera
this is a cyber-shot phone so it really
is designed for photography just slide
down the lens cover here you can see a
camera lens along the self-portrait
mirror and a flash up here which is
pretty bright also when you hold the
phone like this and use the display as a
viewfinder you can see it almost like a
camera from behind with a shutter button
here and a zoom lever here the K 800 eye
also comes with a memory card slot for
your tunes this thing does it all and
Kent really likes it now if you've been
upset that Google Maps for Mobile does
not work with your Motorola Q weep no
more go to map for PD a.com and download
the software bonnie jaw shows you what
to do next after you've downloaded the
app press the home button then start and
scroll down until you find map for PDA
on the menu open the program and you'll
be asked to enter your zip code and
accept the service terms from there you
can get driving directions search for
local businesses use satellite maps and
even get traffic information if you live
in a serviceable city I think it's
pretty awesome what's less awesome is
you also have to download the dotnet
compact framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 and
then this trick will work let's finish
up with a hard drive car Seagate has
gone and tricked out a Scion with some
super storage this vehicles been
equipped with first of all a win
computer from mp3 car comm and that's
very underneath the car it's not
sticking up like some show car at a show
it's just integrated you hardly see it
the part you do see is right up here on
this touchscreen monitor using the
street deck interface software and this
ties into storage we have a 40 gig
Seagate hard drive in this vehicle as
well as another one in the back brian
says the car manufacturers are waiting
for the hard drives to get just a little
sturdier before they make them a regular
option in your car that's it for this
edition of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt

keep you armed and dangerous ly
