the amazing apps that let you do great
things with your movies your music and
your photos and we've got brand new
versions of iPhoto iMovie and GarageBand
all redesigned to take advantage of iOS
7 and we've got brand-new versions for
the Mac designed to harness the power of
Mavericks they're all 64-bit to get fast
performance and of course they're
integrated with iCloud now we don't have
time to go through all of the new
features but I want to highlight just a
few let's take a look at iPhoto browsing
your photos has never been faster or
smoother than now thanks to 64 bits and
if you've got iOS iPhoto has got a brand
new look it's clean it's beautiful it's
a great way to enjoy your favorite
photos and albums now photo books have
been hugely popular but they've only
been available on the Mac well now we're
bringing it to iPad and with iPhoto it
lays out your book and with multi-touch
you can easily move your photos around
or change the pages to make them look
exactly like you want it then uploads it
to Apple we print it and we send you a
beautiful coffee table book right to
your home and all of this right on your
iPad so a great update to iPhoto for
both Mac and iOS
and we've got an amazing new version of
iMovie with a ton of cool new features
we've completely redesigned it make it
cleaner simpler for iOS 7 making it easy
to browse and share your videos with
your family and friends you don't need
to create a project you don't need to
edit you can just select and tap share
but of course iMovie lets you take your
videos and create incredible movies and
we are bringing desktop-class effects
that let you speed up or change the
speed of the video to picture-in-picture
all on an iPhone or an iPad on the Mac
we have a new design makes it even
better to browse your library and share
your favorite moments and of course it's
really easy to speed up or slow the
video which is great for the high frame
rate video that you capture on your
iPhone 5s
we've got a new cool feature called
iMovie theater and this is like having a
private screening room right in iMovie
it takes all of your movies your
trailers and your shared clips and puts
them in a single place for you to see
and because it's integrated with iCloud
when you create a movie on your iPhone
it's automatically available across all
of your devices and of course even on
Apple TV next GarageBand this is the
most popular music creation app in the
world and like iPhoto and iMovie it's
getting an all new look for iOS 7 we're
going from 8 tracks the 16 tracks and if
you have a 64-bit device you can now do
up to 32 tracks of music so 32 tracks on
an iPhone or iPad it's incredible
your favorite album was probably created
in 24 tracks on the Mac we've got a new
look new design and a new sound library
that gives something for everyone
whether you play the keyboard or need a
killer guitar amp so amazing new
versions for iOS new versions for the
Mac and best of all we're making them
all free with the purchase of any new
Mac or iOS device
and these updates are all available
