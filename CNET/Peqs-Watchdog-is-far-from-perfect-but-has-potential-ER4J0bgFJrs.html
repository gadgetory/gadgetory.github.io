right now we're taking a first look at
the peek watchdog kit this kit
essentially has the starter kit as well
as a camera and it's all packed together
to take care of basic home surveillance
duties and the whole price of the Pequot
dog kit is $200 so there are definitely
things I like about the peek watchdog
kit and peek as a whole it's very easy
to install you get tons of help in the
form of video tutorials step-by-step
wizards and it pretty much just leaves
you through the process and you can have
all your devices set up in minutes the
peek watchdog kit is part of the wider
broader peek smart home system so that
means you can install all sorts of
devices such as a motion sensor and
there's even a smart thermostat which
can detect the temperature but also link
to other temperature sensors around the
house to hopefully eliminate any hot or
cold zones and if you are say sleeping
or you're a way you can get text
messages sent directly to your phone so
that you can know if something's
happening that's not supposed to be like
if the windows opening or the doors
opening or if there's movement in your
living room there are some problems with
the pink system first of all the camera
does not have a motion sensor in itself
so you can't just install the camera and
have it triggered to motion or sounds or
anything like that also not very nice is
that the camera is VGA only that's low
res it's not high res HD that other
cameras you know have I also don't like
that as of now peak does not support in
app notifications so if a camera takes a
photo or if it detects motion or
something like that you want to get an
alert that is not possible right now for
the peak app so that's something that
hopefully they'll change soon also be
advised there is a $10 per month
subscription fee so if you don't want to
spend any more than you do
actually just buying the device and the
kit outright you have to be aware that
you will be on the hook for a monthly
payment
you really shouldn't judge the p-block
dog kit in a vacuum and against
standalone cameras from Belkin or
Dropcam you know they may offer more
features at a lower price but this kit
basically will connect to a broader
wider peak smart home platform which in
the long run may actually offer more
functionality thanks for watching be

device and other smart home products at
