Alexis avedis joined by sheraton kim
senior writer for cnet.com now sure
we're talking apples third-quarter
earnings traditionally the weakest
quarter has this been the case this time
around yeah it was another weak quarter
for Apple which was actually kind of
surprising people had really expected
the iphone momentum to keep going but we
actually found that they didn't sell
quite as many iphone since analysts
expected i mean this isn't saying it was
a horrible quarter it was actually you
know pretty strong quarter they sold you
know 47 million iphones but analysts
were expecting 49 and what did Tim Cook
say on the coal did we get any inside
into other parts of the performance from
Apple this quarter Tim Cook is always
very optimistic always saying
everything's great everything's
wonderful so when it came to the iphone
he said you know everything is great
people are still buying them but the
issue for Apple is we're coming up
against some really hard comparisons the
iphone 6 is the biggest device that
they've ever sold you know both by the
screen size and fordham and millions and
millions of people have been buying this
so the problem is what can they do with
the iphone 6s that really gets people to
buy the iphone again and not just you
know hold on to their older device and
going from screen sizes to the smaller
screen size on the wrist which was the
watch which is obviously a big part of
the earnings this quarter what sort of
insight do we get into how Apple watch
performs we didn't get much insight at
all Apple said that they weren't going
to break out Apple watch sales and they
didn't it falls into the other products
category which now also is ipod beats
accessories that increased about nine
hundred million dollars 9 52 million
actually sequentially in from the second
quarter which didn't have the Apple
watch you can't just assume that that
means they made 952 million dollars from
the Apple watch but they said all of
their growth in that category came from
the watch so things like iPods
accessories those are still dropping a
lot beats probably also had a weak
quarter but we don't know
because they don't break it out Apple
did say that the watch is doing better
than the iphone and ipad when they first
started selling them but both of those
devices were just available in the u.s.
at first whereas the Apple watch was
available in nine countries so not
really sure if it's quite a fair
comparison but Apple is still very
optimistic great well thank you sharra
and of course if you want to catch up on
the rest of apples earnings you can
