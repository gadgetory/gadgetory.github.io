seemed to have come back and everybody
was in love with the 70s again let's see
if that decade lives as well as it reads
as we drive the 2013 challenger srt8 392
Hemi the big boy and check the tech
now to my eye the Challenger is perhaps
the nicest looking of the retro Pony
cars from almost every angle until you
swing around the rear then it gets about
as big and tall and thick as a building
in the middle of the plains I don't know
what happened back there now an SRT 8
means several specific things most
importantly a 6.4 Hemi not a 5.7 as if
that's not enough adaptive suspension on
all four corners limited-slip in the
rear launch control 20s underneath those
big wide tires a unique interior and of
course a little different body treatment
now inside I find the Challenger to be
one of the less attractive of the cars
in its class this is a lot of cheap
plastic and acres of it with not a lot
of distinguishing detail srt8 s have
this special kind of velour interior
with this kind of leather bolstering the
red is not necessary you can change up
the color scheme and the gauges to me
are pretty damn ugly with that silver
and red and blue and all these busy
little patterns it's a race car let's
get to the tech though we have the
upgraded head unit this is called the
7:30 a.m. it's the largest and most
well-equipped of your options six and a
half inch touchscreen and I want to
point out the touch response is
outstanding it is one of the quickest
this side of a Hyundai Kia which is my
normal favorite for fast touch response
now for sources as you can see you've
got a hard drive here I'm not normally
big on that for what it's worth you have
20 gigabytes available to you the other
twenty are for the nav system optical
disk lives up here peekaboo style behind
the screen we have satellite radio of
course which powers our satellite
traffic on the navigation system here's
the main menu for an average you can see
this is the older system this is not the
big you connect that they're putting in
the more recently revised chrysler
products that's been getting awards for
the most easy to use navigation it's
Garmin stuff the menuing is very clear
it's not a sexy interface by any stretch
but you know what it works now you can
also use voice command if you can figure
it out here's a voice button and here's
a voice button after a day with the car
I can't recall which one owns which
functions between them though you can
use voice to run the Bluetooth
hands-free system obviously the
navigation system and call out certain
functions of the entertainment system
just keep pushing them both to get the
right one now along with the 7:30 M top
head unit you also have to go with a
Harman Kardon audio upgrade to subs and
the doors to subs in the back 18
speakers 900 watts that is not all that
unusual what is is that the audio
amplification the output side is 32 volt
remember cars are 12-volt they have been
since cavemen were driving them so
what's happening here is they're moving
toward a higher voltage that can allow
you to achieve higher current levels
which is really important for low-end in
particular and do so with the same
wiring or even
thinner wiring that weighs less and
takes up less space this is the only
piece of technology in a car I've yet
encountered with 32 volt it's
interesting another key part of the
interface on this car are the hidden
buttons is a big Chrysler thing back
here you've got a button and then a
rocker above and below it
mostly for operating your media controls
like over here is my volume as well as
three inches away my volume not
necessarily the most useful thing no
paddles here of course we have a manual
this is the 6-speed manual that is based
on these cars you can option up to an
automatic when you would have paddles on
the wheel
you
okay the heart of big dummy is this
engine the 6.4 liter Hemi not the 5.7
this one makes that one look smallish no
blower no turbo no direct injection it's
just a big ol high displacement v8 with
atmospherical combustion chambers and
Hemi by the way is a Chrysler trademark
though other cars have hemispherical
combustion chambers the numbers 470
horsepower 470 foot-pounds of torque
zere the 64 this 42 hundred pound car
4.8 or so while getting you 14 23 mpg
that's bad enough to earn you $1000 gas
guzzler tax the power always goes out on
our srt8 through that 16 manual the
pistol grip out to a limited slip rear
end you can't get an automatic in a Hemi
v8 challenger but you've got to drop
this guy out of srt class to the 5.7
Hemi and then you can get your automatic
and it's only a 5-speed the thing that
impresses me first and not in a good way
is the ride qualities for rendus it's
bouncy its kind of unrefined it's not a
pleasant car to drive and I don't feel
like it's a very good performance
suspension because of all those
unmanaged to sort of dynamics that I'm
getting the exhaust note is nice the
clutch and transmission interaction are
pretty good you do not have any option
for rear view camera and I don't know if
you can see but there's some big ol
buttresses back there
one of those c-pillars and they're
pretty massive I can't see a hell of a
lot out of this vehicle so I could use a
backup camera this performance features
menu here is one that again if I was on
a track I could do something with but it
lets me set up trap times for quarter
mile eighth mile zero to sixty so lots
of track tools in this car that again if
you have access to a track and you do
that kind of thing you've got a real
tool kit here to work with
okay let's price this top of the stack
challenger srt8 with the manual it's the
only way you can get the six four is
gonna run you about forty four seven or
so with destination add into that 794
that head unit which given the price I
would do the $2000 option is the Harman
Kardon audio if you like thump it's got
a ton of it and the only other charge
not an option it's standard is the gas
guzzler tax at a thousand bucks all in
we're somewhere around forty eight and a
half thousand dollars now the Challenger
has a role in the world it's a somewhat
unique pony car in this revival area of
elephant motors take it as a dragster
you can take to work and it may fit the
bill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
