desk more ergonomic you're doing it home
many of us spend eight or more hours a
day tied to our desks and eventually you
might notice that your neck hurts your
back aches and that sitting at a desk is
really taking a toll on your body well
the good news is that you don't have to
switch to a standing desk to feel better
what you might need is to just make your
setup more ergonomically friendly here
are the basics
step 1 your keyboard and mouse should be
one to two inches above your thighs the
easiest way to achieve this is with an
adjustable keyboard tray also stick with
a keyboard that doesn't have a number
pad this way your hands will be centered
and you won't lean too much one way or
the other step 2
find the right distance between your
eyes and the monitor so sit back and
extend your arm and the tips of your
fingers is where the screen should be
step 3 when you sit down there should be
a space about the size of your fist
between the back of your knees and the
chair and when you sit your feet should
be on the floor in front of you and your
thighs should be slightly below your
hips if you're short use a footrest and
if you're tall well you might have to
adjust the height of your desk finally
the most important ingredient is
movement so get up and walk around at
least once an hour to keep your blood
circulating and your body happy and now
you're doing it right for a more
in-depth walkthrough check out the video
