make phone calls from your Gmail inbox a
gaming console prize fight rematch we
count down the top 5 movies on blu-ray
and TiVo's new remote slides its way
into our hearts it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some
life-changing tech wisdom in the form of
the bottom line let's start with the
good first up this week is a brand
spanking new TV from Vizio that I want
here's David Katz Meyer with a few
reasons why you may also want to make it
the centerpiece of your home
entertainment system I'm David Katz my
senior editor at CNN and this is the
Vizio xvt 3sv series it's the 55 inch
version right here there's also a forty
seven and a forty two in the series this
review will apply to all the screen
sizes this Vizio is flagship 2d TV for
2010 it has doodles of features we'll
get to those a little bit but I first
want to point out Vizio has redesigned
this TV got rid of that silver speaker
bar found on previous models this one is
all black including the bottom where the
speakers are subtly blended in along
with the rest of the black it's also a
lot thinner if you look at it from the
side it's about three inches deep which
isn't quite as thin as some of those
other LED based LCD TVs out there but
it's still pretty slim this TV does use
LED technology with local dimming again
we'll talk about that a performance
section but feature wise the real thing
to talk about here is the via Vizio
internet apps system system includes the
usual suspects such as Netflix Amazon
video on-demand Vudu all those things
could be streamed live to the TV there's
also a Rhapsody music subscription
service which is exclusive to vizio it
also includes Pandora and host of other
non streaming apps including a Wikipedia
search there's Facebook eBay and a bunch
of other things you can do this TV
including play games etc etc new apps
are downloaded into the bar I get a
little notification icon which is pretty
cool there's also the bar that appears
along the bottom of the screen here it
does also appear over other apps so for
example you can check out Facebook or
write a tweet while you're watching a
Netflix stream which is pretty much
occlusive to vizio as well that's sort
of multitasking the TV has built-in
Wi-Fi so if you don't have a Ethernet
right at your TV you can
use your Wi-Fi connection it does work
pretty darn well though you know we do
prefer Ethernet for the most robust
connection the other exclusive to this
TV is the remote control it opens up
here to have a full QWERTY keyboard so
you can actually type and do search
terms and passwords and that sort of
stuff a lot easier than you would with a
typical TV that requires you to use a
virtual keypad and the TV's remote
control so this remotes a real step up
for this thing TV also has bluetooth so
you don't have to aim the remote
directly at the TV and it also should
interface with some Bluetooth devices
such as headphones and some other stuff
in the future of izya we'll be adding
that functionality it'll also be adding
the functionality to stream from the USB
and your home network although it
doesn't do that yet most other TVs in
this league do inputs are extensive on
the vizio you got five total HDMI four
on the back and one on the side as well
as one component video input and a PC
input in terms of other features that
picture settings on this TV are
relatively sparse for a very high-end TV
it has simple to point grayscale
adjustment although we found it as a
plenty of adjustments for most people
and oodles of picture settings there's
actually nine different picture presets
you can play around with one other cool
thing about the picture settings is that
it is integrated directly into the apps
interface you get that nice slick one
menu system where everything is pretty
much accessible from one button and it
all makes it really easy to find in our
lab test the video performed very well
it does have nice deep black levels
again thanks to that led with local
dimming technology it does produce a
nice deep shade of black that's
especially visible in dark rooms and
dark scenes it does have a little bit of
blooming where the light leaks into
black areas in some scenes but that's
really not that distracting and
relatively rare another strengths of
this TV is the color accuracy it's
accurate of both up and down the
grayscale in dark and light areas it
also has very good color points and
solid saturation so all told some of the
best color we've seen this year we've
seen from off-angle the vizio does tend
to wash out a little bit of that
blooming does intensify the vizio screen
is also excellent for bright rooms so if
you're in a room with a lot of lights
that hit the screen the mat does a very
good job of cutting that down and
reducing glare it also preserves black
levels relatively well so for bright
rooms the vizio is a solid choice anyway
that's a quick look at the vizio XV 2
3sv series and I'm David Katz Meyer once
you've got your new TV I'll set up one
of the best ways to enjoy it is to pop
in a blu-ray movie but which one
Bryan Cooley's here with this week's top
5 to help you decide
let's face it when a blu-ray disc is a
poor transfer or just a crappy movie to
begin with it really isn't worth the
money
I'm Brian Cooley and in this episode of
top 5 we're going to run down the
blu-ray titles that'll make you glad you
decided to buy yet another set of silver
discs these guys are worth it according
to the savvy eyes of CNET's David carnal
and the home video editors in New York
and they're ranked by sales figures from
amazon.com as of this early August 2010
number 5 is close encounters it's been
30 years wow that long that means this
is now a bona fide classic and I need to
start getting my prostate checked
anyway this 30th edition on blu-ray
includes all three spielberg cuts has
been remastered within an inch of its
life and is going cheap like 12 bucks
just please please don't make the sound
your ringtone is it please midnight
number four Escape from New York
this one was semi low-budget back in 81
so now it doesn't exactly max out the
abilities of high definition but we like
that it rescues the tale of New York as
a giant supermax prison from the realm
of mediocre DVD editions that came
before this and it may be coincidence
that the CNET editors who nominated it
are based in our New York office or
they're trying to Telegraph something to
our HR department number three is life
from the BBC an incredible HD look at
the lengths that living creatures go to
to evade death procreate and obtain
nourishment sounds like a pretty good
weekend to me take our tip on this one
get the original version narrated by Sir
David Attenborough not the US version
voiced by Oprah no offense though number
2 here's an old one 2001 a Space Odyssey
shot back in 1968 now I still don't
really understand it but that doesn't
matter you can score this blu-ray disc
for under $10 and get a really nice
transfer with the only downsides being
that it will absolutely kick your TVs
ass especially
black levels and you'll probably run
around at work the next day talking like
how until someone says stop it by the
way if you're watching this episode and
feeling like some kind of loser for not
having a blu-ray deck don't instant
research tells us even out to the year
2013
blu-ray player sales are still gonna lag
some 10 million units a year behind
standard DVD players and about 18
percent of folks in the u.s. say they
would like a blu-ray deck but that cost
still remains a big hurdle both the cost
of the player and buying all those new
discs like our number one choice our
number one blu-ray pick is avatar this
one needs no introduction we are
actually cool with the 2d version so
good is its visual quality perfectly
formatted to fill an HD TV screen
without bars or any weird ratio mashing
this disc is probably the one you're
gonna put on to impress your friends
with your home theater if you're that
kind of a dork just enjoy the movie by
the way check out our CNN editors entire
list of top 40 blu-ray discs that this
list was pulled from you can find the
link to that at the top 5 blog I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching see you next
time
of course you can only watch those
movies so many times so you'll need to
find something else to do with your big
sweet TV like play video games now that
the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 have
both dropped down a weight class can the
ps3 hold on to its title in a prizefight
rematch let's check in with Brian Tong
and find out
what's up price five fans I'm Brian Tong
and we're bringing you an epic battle
that has stood the test of time
it's a Throwdown showdown for game
console supremacy between Microsoft's
Xbox 360 slim and Sony's ps3 slim our
judges for this fight are seen at senior
associate editor Scott the bottom line
Stein associate editor Jeff never backs
down Bakalar and you know who really a
big Tom will take all three judges blind
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth the final prize fight
score could be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system we're
going six rounds deep for this face-off
round one is designed both consoles are
bringing their slim and spelt
streamlined designs to the prize fight
ring the Xbox 360 is sleeker slimmer and
improved in every way over the original
we like the glossy piano black finish
and its new edgy style but you still
have that sizable AC adapter the ps3
slim is the sleeker of the two and more
travel friendly but it's matte finish
takes away some of the sexy and it still
kind of resembles a George Foreman grill
and it feels a lot more generic compared
to the new xbox slim sometimes makeovers
really make a difference and the 360
slim takes this design round for the
first time with a four and the ps3 slim
gets a three next round is steeper the
standard Xbox 360 slim rocks a larger
250 gig hard drive finally brings
built-in Wi-Fi you'll get HDMI and
wireless controls but its proprietary
hard drive is still a head-scratcher now
the biggest difference between these two
consoles is blu-ray the ps3 slim has
been rated one have seen its top blu-ray
players and it's now a real advantage
plus you also have a user replaceable
hard drive it's 160 gigs gives you a
little less storage it has built-in
Wi-Fi HDMI and it's Bluetooth capability
allows you to connect many third-party
accessories including almost any
Bluetooth headset plus the system is
already 3d ready for movies and games
through software updates the ps3 throws
its first
with a perfect 5 and the xbox360 gets a
3.7 Tucker averaging two rounds Sony
leads by one tenth of a point but there
is plenty of fight left round three is
online service for Microsoft Xbox Live
service is the gold standard for online
gaming on a console it's going to cost
you $50 per year but its ease of use the
size of the community and access to
integrated services like Netflix last.fm
Facebook and Twitter and more make it
the total package Sony's PlayStation
Network is absolutely free and you
really have to give them credit for that
but it's not nearly as developed and
after all this time I'm still waiting
for cross game chatti PlayStation Plus
is a new $50 annual service but you're
really paying for exclusive content
instead of new online features using
Netflix still requires a disk it's built
in web browser does allow you to watch
YouTube content and PlayStation Home
still isn't a place where I spend my
time Microsoft strikes back with a
perfect five of its own and Sony gets a
three point three round four is up next
and it's the only reason we're all here
for the game both consoles are packed
with franchise titles that each side
wishes they could have the 360 can brag
about the bloody battlefields of Gears
of War the unlimited adventure that is
fable and the world of Halo and Master
Chief but it's lost some of its momentum
the ps3 arguably boasts a stronger and
more diverse exclusive franchise library
with their modern-day Indiana Jones in
the Uncharted series god of wars epic
story and scale little big planets
creative community
heavy rains unique control system and so
many more now when it comes down to
downloadable games the Xbox Live Arcade
has a much deeper and diverse library of
games from the past and it continues to
release awesome new exclusives like
limbo the PlayStation Network isn't on
the same level with its downloadable
game library but it can still hold its
own with offerings like flower but there
just aren't enough of them you can still
play most of your original Xbox titles
on the 360 slim but backwards
compatibility on the ps3 slim is
non-existent both consoles have games
that make each one just as drool-worthy
as the other and the judges call this
round a tie at
or points a piece so after four rounds
the Xbox has taken control leading by
four tenths of a point but we've still
got two more to go round 5 is graphics
performance the 360 elite and PS 3 both
have titles that showcase their
graphical prowess even if it's subtle
the 360 Slim has shown to have a slight
advantage when comparing the same
third-party titles but then when it
comes to console exclusive titles the
ps3 really flexes its technical muscle
now Jeff and Scott called this round
even but if we're talking about the best
graphics available why don't you sit
down and play God of War 3 or uncharted
2 and show me an Xbox game that can best
them the ps3 gets a slight edge with the
4.3 and the xbox gets a 4 now this is
still anyone's prize fight the sixth and
final round that decides at all
is value both of these consoles are
$2.99 at their entry level and you guys
can argue all you want about who has the
better games and who has the better
graphics but when you're talking about
value it really comes down to one thing
and it's the ps3's blu-ray player that
will support 3d content into the future
and makes the ps3 slim more than just a
gaming console and if you want to play
online with your xbox you'll still have
to pay 50 more dollars per year and look
final round the ps3 slim gets a perfect
5 and the Xbox 360 gets a 3 point 7 so
let's averaged out the scores for all
six rounds and after a back-and-forth
battle where both sides held the lead
we are tied tied at 4.1 points a piece
now you know we can't walk away like
this and this prize fight has to have a
winner so we're gonna break this down by
hundreds of a point so do the math for
yourselves people
but after a six-round thrown out the
sony ps3 slim holds on with a four-point
102 4.0 6 in the closest prize fight in
CNET history and is your prize fight
winner
can't go wrong with either of these
consoles and if you're lucky enough get
both of them but Sony's blu-ray player
that used to seem like a gimmick in the
past is now the difference maker
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time for
another Priceline
dude that was a nail-biter but I have to
agree that blu-ray player is always
gonna give ps3 the edge what are you
waiting for Microsoft HD DVD is dead
it's time to let go okay folks it's time
for us to take a quick break but stick
around we'll be back with a batch of
handy how-to tips right after this
welcome back to the CNET tech review our
weekly digest of all things good and bad
we've seen here at CNET TV this week
let's continue on with the good on
Wednesday Google announced a new service
that lets Gmail users make phone calls
directly from their inbox
no phone necessary here's Jessica Dolkar
to show you how it all works
hello everyone I'm Jessica's all-court
wispy net here to show you how to get
started making phone calls from right
within Gmail comm if you're a gmail user
in the US the first thing you do is look
to see that the service has been added
into your account check the left side
bar where your google chat app sits and
make sure you see the call phone link
right under your name and status field
after you click it Google may ask you to
install a chat and video plugin first
just follow the prompts if the plugin is
installed click that call phone link and
you'll see a dial pad pop up in the
bottom right corner of your screen next
start typing the phone number you'd like
to call since the calling feature is
also integrated with your Google address
book you can also type a person's name
to search for your caller we recommend
having a headset with a microphone
attached to make your calls if you don't
have a mic on your computer or your
headset your callers won't be able to
hear you to check through your call
history just click the tab to the right
of the dial pad and scroll through your
history of calls calls are currently
free to the US and Canada but to make an
international call you'll need to buy
credits to add more credit click the
blue monetary amount that's on the top
right of the dial pad and select add
credit note that you will need a free
Google Voice account to buy credit for
international calls there's more good
news you can also receive calls on your
computer that you will need that Google
Voice account to do so here's how you
set up Google Voice to receive phone
calls in Gmail login to Google Voice or
sign up for a free account by typing
voice google.com into your browser then
click settings in the upper right of
your screen and select voice settings in
the phone tab cast your eyes to the
bottom of the list of forwarding phones
where you should see Google Chat as an
option click the
check box next to the google chat
listing and then look for the
confirmation message at the top of your
screen Google Voice treats the phone
call feature in Google Talk just like
another number where you'd forward your
incoming calls after that you should be
able to accept incoming calls in Gmail
now keep in mind that this is currently
only for us Gmail users and be sure to
also check out our how-to videos on
using Google Voice that's it for this
how-to I'm Jessica's Dahle court showing
you how to place and receive calls from
your Gmail inbox catch you next time
free calls to landlines in the US where
do I sign up oh wait she just told me
never mind let's go ahead and move on to
the bad this week in the bad we've got a
couple of good how-to videos to help you
fix some bad problems in a minute I'll
show you how to make Facebook Places a
little less stalker friendly but first
if you've been leaving voicemail
messages for Brian Tong and you're
wondering why he hasn't been calling you
back he has a pretty good reason
what's up guys Brian song here with
cnet.com and if you're just like me
which you aren't you're having problems
receiving voicemails on your iPhone
lately now the last one I received was
about a month ago in July and I can
assure you my mom leaves plenty of
voicemails for me on my phone now if you
suspect her visual voicemail isn't
working
dial into your voicemail directly by
holding the number one on your dial pad
and you'll hear a status update now
that's a lot of booty calls you don't
want to miss so let's show you how to
achieve your missing voicemails go into
your settings then general scroll to the
bottom to find a reset and you'll want
to select reset network settings if you
have a passcode lock which you should
enter it in press the magic button and
your phone will restart this method can
potentially help if your phone is having
trouble accessing network data for
things like surfing the web and
downloading email or retrieving your
voicemails it will also reset all the
Wi-Fi networks your phone automatically
connects to so you'll have to re-enter
those passwords as well if this doesn't
work select the reset all settings which
is also work for me but you'll have to
reenter things like your iTunes password
but it will not erase any content on
your phone now let's give it a few
moments and voila there are my
voicemails ready for me to listen to one
month later i'm brian song with your
how-to for retrieving your missing
iphone voicemails use it wisely
hi I'm Hollywood from cnet.com here to
show you how to disable Facebook Places
by now I'm sure you've heard about
places which lets you share your
location with your Facebook friends by
checking in when you go somewhere not
surprisingly not everyone is a fan for
one thing you've been opted in by
default which is what Facebook always
does and for another thing it's possible
that your friends could be checking you
in places even if you don't so let's
check in to your new places privacy
settings and figure out how to find out
what you're broadcasting and how to turn
it off under account click privacy
settings and now click customize
settings down here you'll see new
options for places I check in which
should be defaulted to friends only hey
I mean at least it's not everyone also
there's a checkbox here labeled include
me in people here now after I check in
now in small type it tells you that your
check-in will be visible to both your
friends and strangers who happen to be
checked in nearby this box is checked by
default so if you don't want strangers
saying that you're in the restaurant
with them uncheck it if you don't want
to broadcast your location to anyone
next two places I check in click the
drop down menu and choose customize
under custom privacy you can click the
drop down again and choose only me and
yes that is way more steps than it
should take next make sure your friends
aren't broadcasting your location under
things others share there's an option
that says friends can check me into
places now on my account the default was
select one but some people said that it
was enabled by default for them either
way you can enable that option or since
we're not actually sure what select one
defaults to just specifically choose
disable and there you go
now don't get me wrong I think Facebook
Places is a potentially useful and fun
feature but as with all things Facebook
does I just really want them to ask me
first first thing on how to I'm
Hollywood and you're welcome
hey Facebook ever heard of opt-in why is
it that every time you implement a new
feature that shares our info with the
world it's up to us to go through the
settings with a fine-tooth comb to
figure out how to turn it off not cool
and now it's time for this week's
bottom-line besides my son and maybe
Angry Birds there are a few things I
love in life more than my Tivo so let me
say that I was nearly beside myself when
I heard about this latest announcement
from TiVo the slide remote hi I'm John
Falcon for CNET and this is the TiVo
slide remote control this remote is
specifically designed for use with TiVo
series 3 and series 4 DVRs
at first glance it just appears to be a
shortened version of the classic TiVo
p-nut remote but as the name indicates
you can slide open the top to reveal a
full QWERTY keyboard the keyboard comes
in handy on a TiVo for doing text
searches of upcoming TV shows movies and
online media it's far more convenient
and faster than using the cumbersome
on-screen keyboard for text input and
anyone who's used a smartphone keyboard
will find it easy to use all of the keys
on the remote are hard plastic not the
mushy rubber buttons you sometimes find
on similar remotes keys have a
satisfying click when you depress them
and they're spaced far enough apart that
even someone with larger fingers won't
have trouble typing the keyboard even
has a dedicated 10 digit number pad and
a five-way directional pad for
navigating menus on the top of the
remote we were impressed that TiVo was
able to include all of the buttons found
on the larger standard remote all the
keys on the top and on the keyboard are
backlit as well when using open or close
the TiVo slide feels great in your hand
and all the topside buttons are within
range even for those with smaller
fingers even better than the keyboard
and the overall our ganache light is the
fact that it's a Bluetooth remote a USB
dongle to supply that fits into your
TiVo DVR and there was for us anyway no
setup required
it was truly plug-and-play since
bluetooth is an RF or radiofrequency
technology that means all of the remotes
TiVo control functions work without the
need for line-of-sight which you
otherwise need for infrared remotes in
other words as long as you're within 30
feet of your TiVo you can control it
regardless of where or whether you're
pointing the remote directly at it so go
ahead and hide your TiVo away in a
cabinet you'll still be able to control
it unfortunately that Bluetooth
functionality doesn't extend to other
devices that the TiVo slide can control
a TV and an audio receiver the remote
can be programmed using a help screen on
the TiVo to control nearly any brand of
TV or audio receiver unfortunately
there's only one power button and one
input toggle the system works fine if
you only need to control the TV but if
you want to control the TV and an AV
receiver you've got to split the
difference in other words you're
probably still going to need another
remote on hand the TiVo slide remote is
powered by two double-a batteries which
are included and is compatible with TiVo
series three and series four models the
price is $90 that's not cheap to be sure
and we really wish it was included with
the current premiere models or at least
the premiere XL that said if you're
already a devoted TiVo owner who's
sticking with the DVR for the
foreseeable future the TiVo slide remote
is a must-have accessory I'm John
Falcone for CNET and this is the TiVo
slide remote
the bottom line this week must-have
accessory that should have been included
in the box
come on TiVo Vizio is doing it alright
that's our show for this week everyone
join us next week on the C net tech
review and we'll have all the news from
Apple's September first music event
until then there are tons of great
videos available every day at scene at
tv.com see you next time and thanks for
