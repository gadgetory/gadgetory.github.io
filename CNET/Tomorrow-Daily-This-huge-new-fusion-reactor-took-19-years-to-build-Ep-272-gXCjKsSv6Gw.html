the best geek talk-show the known
universe I'm Ashley Scott you're
watching one of our short episodes we're
gonna be at you on Thursday with a long
episode it's a deep dive if you will
into the stories of this week so with
that being said let's hit the headlines
so we're not quite at the point where
you're going to be able to lock a mr.
Fusion to the back of your DeLorean but
there is a new fusion reactor set to
light up before the end of this month
it's a stellarator reactor called the
w7x and it's over at the Max Planck
Institute in Germany it took more than a
million hours to build this thing over
19 years to make it fully complete 50
individuals 6 ton magnetic coils make up
the cage that holds super hot gases and
they're cooled to minus 200 degrees
Celsius the machine itself is 19 meters
wide and in the shape of a ring and the
position of the cage was specifically
optimized by a supercomputer to pinpoint
the best possible design for the machine
itself traditionally we've used nuclear
fusion reactors called tokamaks but the
one issue with them is that they can
only be used in short bursts and any
magnetic disruption can destabilize the
reactor stellarators like the w7x are
supposed to be designed to be impervious
to those disruptions so this could get
interesting for the future of nuclear
energy engineers are waiting for
approval from germany's nuclear
regulators but if all goes well they
want to flip this baby on by the end of
November let's make some energy a
meanwhile in Japan a movie is being
released with a robot co-star the film
is sayonara written and directed by
Japanese filmmaker koji Fukuda it's the
story of a Japan that has been decimated
by radiation and the main character
Tanja gets a very low priority number
for evacuation meaning she has to stay
behind and suffer radiation poisoning
but she's not alone her childhood
companion Leona is there with her but
that's not CG or makeup you're seeing
Leona is actually Geminoid F a real-life
robot created by Hiroshi Ishiguro who's
robotics work you might be familiar
with he's the guy who made that robot
that looks exactly like himself it's
kind of weird but kind of cool so back
to Geminoid F since Geminoid F can't
walk the story gives her a knee injury
and then sits her in a wheelchair for
the length of the movie where she can
move around freely it's interesting that
she's treated like any other cast member
on the film's website and in the movie
it looks like she helps Tanja deal with
her increasing radiation sickness
hey Bethesda I think I just found the
plot of Fallout 5 too soon
alright so very last story I always like
to ask where's my Rosie the robot and
honestly Patton about a year ago said
that they had won for us but now there's
actually a working prototype the Patton
showed off its skills at Tokyo design
week last week and to refresh your
memory it's a wheeled robot that's kind
of like a Roomba but it's built around
adaptive AI that lets its owner choose
what type of AI it should use and then
place objects or attachments on top of
it the patent can work with for example
if you were to place a lamp on the path
and it would pinpoint where you are in
the room find the best location for the
light source relative to your position
and then wheel the lamp over to that
location there are depth sensors contact
sensors and other features onboard
powering the little robot and it looks
really really fun so here's the new
stuff its designers announced they're
going to make the patent as an
open-source platform so devs and
hobbyists alike can create their own
features apps and attachments for it
there's still no word on pricing or
availability but flower robotics says
they want to have this thing out and
available for you in 2016 and I still
want it to make me pancakes hey guess
what it's Monday let's talk about
crowdfunding
this sounds like a joke but I assure you
it's not there is a robot band that has
gone to Kickstarter to fund a lead
singer so I should probably start with
the humans involved in this project
there are three guys named Frank Marcus
and stock and they're artists who built
three robots named fingers stick boy and
bones those three robots comprised
compressor head a robot jam band of a
sort but the robots need a fourth a lead
vocalist to sing and interact with fans
and they want to make a record that no
human can perform the robots can do
specific musical actions humans just
can't do live like playing multiple
riffs at the same time they don't want a
record label to interfere with their
artistic goals because they're real
musicians man so Kickstarter seemed like
the way to go part of the project
includes a mind link web app that would
notify users when the band comes alive
and translate some of the robots
communications in a human speech super
weird but so metal metal do you see what
I did there there are all kinds of
pledge levels you can get in at and they
want over $300,000 so they've got a long
way to go and about 25 days left to get
there so if you're interested in hearing
a band that is comprised entirely of
robots this would be your chance all
right guys let's look at your beautiful
beautiful photos
our phones are over today is Terris who
wrote in and sent this picture that they
took with their iPhone 6s and they said
hey guys took this photo earlier last
month on my iPhone 6s I use clarity from
camera plus and borders other than that
photo is untouched this is a partial
panorama photo as well if you think the
photo is show worthy you have my
permission to use it well Tara's
obviously it's show worthy because there
it is right here on tomorrow daily thank
you so much for sending in that amazing
panorama I just oh it's so beautiful
if you guys want to send in your phone
tog Rafi a please feel free to do so
email us tomorrow at C Netcom send in
your photo give us a little story about
it give us permission use it on the show
and of course tell us what device you
took it on because I find that pretty
interesting and also you can find us
online we are tomorrow daily calm if
you'd like to share the show with a
friend
we're tomorrow daily on all your
favorite social media sites like
Facebook and Twitter and I'm at Ashley
ask Evan on Twitter and producer Logan
is at Logan Moy can also find Jeff
ca√±ada our co-host who'll be here
tomorrow at Jeff kanata with two N's and
one T on Twitter that is it for the show
today we'll be back tomorrow with a
brand new docket of wonderful science
back mating science fiction blowing up
in your face getting all great and stuff
but until then be good humans we'll see
you guys next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
