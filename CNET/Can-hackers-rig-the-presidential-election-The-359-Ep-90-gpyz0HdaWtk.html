we're here at Roger and Ben Fox Rubin
whoo yeah welcome to the 359 welcome
guys welcome we did we just start the
podcast while I wasn't paying attention
yes well done as always always prepared
then so we're we've got a couple of duty
topics to discuss today we're gonna be
looking at whether or not hackers can
tamper with the election I think hackers
have already kind of messed us with the
election process or are they right the
DNC had that's true so you know and they
and they hacked into apparently
Hillary's campaign as well so hey you
know why stop there Donald Trump is
already calling for hackers to go after
Hillary so is that too right and he's
saying the election may be rigged so
it's gonna happen yeah so I'm actually
we're actually looking specifically at
whether or not the election process can
be hacked right I'm gonna vote in
November and so will all my bots I hey
you all vote for action of course and
then after that we'll be talking about
we talked about the galaxy note 7 we
talked about it on Tuesday but we're
gonna talk a little bit more about it I
wrote a feature on the iris scanner and
how what you'd actually use it yeah yeah
why it's more secure and we'll take a
look at that and bright as a
continuation of like crap your pants
episode right that's all did all the
different ways you could get hacked and
your stuff stolen exactly yeah and then
lastly well some days come out yeah well
I'm not a slightly lighter note has the
fast care Ben's gonna Benjamin talk
about that yes seeing how yeah I'm the
expert I'm the expert on uh on wireless
carriers even though roger has been
covering them for oh I don't know since
you were a bit before wireless carriers
even existed that's pretty much true
yeah well all we had were cups of
strings that's right and you knew who
the best one what it's Dixie yeah juicy
by a mile holy that's a quality cup
right there you can tell the cardboard
is just so much more durable let's Rob
alright so as always leave your
questions in the comments section I will
find the best ones and we will do our
best to try to answer them and yes if
you have more samsung questions can
suppose to write we don't know Jessica
here today I don't have Jessica but I
can do my best to pretend to be like
Jessica Roger ism yes you're you're
pretty solid on samsung stuff so you
yeah I'm just gonna sit here and be
quiet because I have never owned a
samsung phone terrible alright I'm
kidding I own both so I'm neutral damn
it sure I'm sure our commenters will
find a way the mock you mercilessly yes
i am using my apple computer that gets
mentioned always mentioned i guess
mentioned and like every other I'm sorry
her social that's not come on we're
giving them so much for advertiser I
know that's let's get started okay could
you pull yep the timer as ready as we're
gonna bake that means no welcome to the
359 where we talk about the top tech
news of the day and all the other crap
you want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Ben Fox ribbon so today is all about
security well there's a bit about
carriers but that's later Homeland
Security Secretary jeh Johnson said
yesterday that we should treat our
election system like a critical
infrastructure like take our power grid
or dams right which brings which raises
a question like could our presidential
election get hat I mean as i was reading
this story it's a good one by the way so
people should read it as i was reading
this I kind of came to the conclusion
off well what if an election had already
been hacked you know like how would we
have known you know so it kind of point
creates this very interesting conspiracy
theory concept of okay that sounds
really problematic and what are we
supposed to do about it yeah in fact you
know a couple of experts that are
reported aura I spoke to said that you
know just saying or giving it the titles
like critical infrastructure really
isn't doing enough mm-hmm and the real
vulnerable point isn't what like the
voting system often times but you've oh
it's on electronic right a lot of it's
just still
right on the handle it's really the
computers that send that election data
off to soar the central database to be
counted that's where things can get
that's where things are vulnerable right
and as it mentions in the story all you
have to do is potentially focus on
critical precincts and then you could I
don't know maybe really turn turn an
election quite easily yeah look I mean
hacks have already affected our election
right the election process right the the
DNC was hacked Hillary Clinton's emails
have been hacked and that there has been
significant change from that right the
DNC's head had to resign because of
those channels yeah the hackers are
already making a difference in this
election and I don't know hopefully
these having an impact super hopefully
the super low tech of our government
will hopefully ensure some level of not
being hacked but you're right those pcs
do you sound weak a little bit problem
and we can only count on the load like
how low tech our government is to save
us all under hug all right so next up
you know I drill down a bit more I know
you hate that term but ok i did a sort
of deep dive on the galaxy note 7 iris
scanner Laura and I work together in the
story just to take a look at you know
what why an iris scanner is safer or
your secure I mean I found some
interesting things that you know iris it
doesn't change after like a certain age
unlike a fingerprint which does kind of
Ryan changes over 80 yeah but that's
assuming that you're keeping your phone
for a long time but still I mean still
no but is it if it's if it's a profile
let's consist it from phone to phone
right ladies no it's there's that there
are more points of references than a
fingerprint so I mean theoretically it's
more it's more secure look after reading
the Ken are elections be rigged story
and moving on to this one I was like yes
I definitely want an iris scanner and a
face scanner and whatever other scanner
you can give me I think I think the
point was made in the story reasonably
well that look it's not for everybody
but people that do want that extra layer
of security it's there and it's
available for them so yeah sure that
sounds like it makes sense for some
people would you have a set up so you
will
you're filled with your eyes I don't
think so yeah it's a weird right I would
do it for like maybe the first week I
would do it just to like look badass oh
and then would get really sick of it
sadly that's what you need to look
badass oh come on all right anyway so
last with the time we have left in a
test of network quality open signal
which is wireless coverage mapping firm
found that I was a little surprised by
this t-mobile came out as the top
wireless carrier by a series of
different metrics yeah so actually they
they they have been fastest for a while
but they actually surpassed 18 TSM Burt
ooh for availability which is a big
change for them so look it's t-mobile's
improving the network so I don't know
RootMetrics still has verizon on top
yeah those are my guys it's big the big
conclusion here is you know what none of
these guys are perfect if you know if
you look at that if you look closely at
the data three carriers one in different
categories you're never gonna get the
perfect network oh that's so sad sorry
alright why no more of these stories
check us out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Ben Fox Rubin thanks for listening oh we
won't be long a little I realized one
yeah that's okay though yeah well cut
