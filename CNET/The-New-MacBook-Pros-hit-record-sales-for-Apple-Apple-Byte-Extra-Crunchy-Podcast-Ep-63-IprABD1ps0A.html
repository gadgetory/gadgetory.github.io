with letting you all know how to be a
part of the show we continue to get your
calls all the time 1 800 61 62 63 8 to

be a part of something please you want
to be part of something I want to be
part of something I do too let's do it
okay so leave your name where you're
from we've got some great calls and
comments and that's what this is all
about you make the show just as much as
a we're just here to serve you all so
let's jump into it right away still
continuous flow the macbooks I think
that's really just the hottest product
that everyone is still talking about so
we're going to lead with macbook news
this comes out from our friends at slice
intelligence based on irri seat data of
nearly 3,000 customers and purchases the
new macbook pro has surpassed in its
first five days of sales it has
surpassed other competitors really has
dwarfed other competitors if you look at
this pretty graph if you can't see it
yeah Microsoft Surface book the asuste
Chromebook flipped the dell inspiron two
and one the Lenovo yoga 900 here's also
just to give you a take of how crazy
this new MacBook Pro has performed in
the first five days it outsold the
current 12-inch MacBook by seven times
wow wow seven times that's pretty
amazing we know there's a lot of a pen
why you sound like you're from a keynote
beach i'm really happy about this how
they say this is that this is the best
macbook we've ever made yes that that's
a day's best macbook we have ever made
bar none this is bar none
so we know there's a ton of pent-up
demand for this that's a given but it is
a metric to show that you know what
they're selling a lot phil schiller even
said it's the most pre-orders they had
ever received as well and just in case
you're trying to figure out when are
these coming out some leaks or rough
estimates from third-party Apple
resellers not Apple themselves have
shown that the new macbook pros are set
for a november seventeenth release we
also have people that have received
information from the big a on their
online a kind of update status that the
new MacBook Pros with the touch bar
again the 13-inch without a touch bar
has been out but that the 15 inch book
and 13 inch width touch bars will soon
be making it in the hands customers some
people are showing their details as
preparing for shipment oh nice deliver
some time between the 17th and the 25th
that's directly from apple it's like
four days y'all ready for this four day
I know I know so macbook pro people be
happy and just in another story related
to the mac pro I just enjoyed this
because I was kind of like what's
actually going on with this Apple has
reduced the price of the displays that
we're going that were released initially
to complement them I ripped on them
because look we know out of the market
you can get like a fork a sec you know
display non-apple LG ish for really a
quality one roughly around 350 for me
around 350 400 bucks for 4k and then
there's also 5k displays Apple has
reduced its called the LG ultra fine to
display their 5k version was originally
priced at 12 99 whoa whoa well they
reduced it by like four hundred dollars
yeah basically you almost did the math
correctly go 325 I know I'm you're not
looking at this I actually it's not
because I'm Asian it's actually because
I'm looking at the numbers here I did
the math really quickly thanks I do have
an abacus handy over here on the side if
you'd like me to do that cool 310 cool
at 325 reduction for that 5k display now
down to 974 thats the last two I mean
like they just announced it a couple
weeks ago so yeah that's very unlike
Apple to do something like that well get
this they
just recently reduced the price of the
USB cable dongle adapter by like six
dollars across the board that's cuz
dongle gate yeah exactly and then like a
week later they reduced the price of
these displays the for the what is it
the 4k display was dropped by 175 to now
a 524 price point but it's like
everyone's like hey maybe you should
lower the price of that a new macbook
pro while you're at it yeah joe says
it's kind of pricey that's great they're
like doing a real-time market research
with their pricing as they release
products this is amazing it's a whole
new Apple ladies engine it's a whole new
apple cooling it just like that it is
pretty cool let's take a little break
for our little sponsor we call this for
those of you that don't know about this

by a before we continue on with the show
you want to tell people why that might
have been waiting for the show well at
least our live viewers and listeners
that are on periscope and on YouTube why
it took us so long to start the show
yeah we were a little late today because
Nintendo is launching the classic NES
edition today at they released it just
right now two o'clock supposedly sapone
amazon yes on amazon so we were
frantically trying to order these but
amazon is not running anymore i think
the nintendo crashed amazon because it's
just said hi oops sorry so we're going
through this whole process and i know
this is a process that people deal with
whether its buying apple products or
buying non apple products I saw Steven
Beecham expressed the exact emotions
that I feel when I'm trying to get a
pair of Jordans on like a saturday
morning at 7am he was like ah Rican out
the lights the link crash and then it's
like oh I gotta add them to my cart but
it doesn't show in my car
I know exactly what that feels and I
tried with my phone check out with one
click that didn't work doesn't work I
know exactly what that feels like so you
you you were pretty much screwed let's
talk some new rumors new product rumors
according to barclays apple and this is
piggybacking on a lot of the rumors that
we've had but a few more details Apple
will launch a trio of new iPad pro
models in March including a refresh 9.7
inch and 12 point nine inch versions of
the iPads but we've always talked about
this third model that could be a ten
point nine inch or somewhere in between
they claim that the ten point nine inch
model will be an all-new bezel free
design so you won't have any of that
black border on the edges this according
to barclays we've heard plenty of other
rumors how the ten point nine inch model
well basically because of how the bezel
the bezel less nature of it they do
report that this borderless design will
allow to be around the same physical
size as the current 9.7 and maybe that
might mean we don't have a home button
on this new 10.9 inches yeah it seems
like we'll see we'll see what happens
also kind of the standard stuff that has
been coming across the line the true
tone display is going to is expected to
arrive on the next generation these
models but marches all with march/april
ish has always kind of been the ipad
time but i will say that because we
didn't get an entire refresh of max that
i'm hoping that something like that will
happen as well yeah it's better than
that how do you feel about bezel lists
stuff is it dude are you into it or well
here's the things you know it's funny
about that we don't have too many
devices that have no bezel at all yeah
and so the trick is always will they
somehow when you touch those exercise
you know maybe when you have an
accidental finger swipe or you know your
palms are resting against it will they
be able to almost create an invisible
border for us so that even if I have my
fingers on the edge it doesn't move the
screen yeah yeah you know that that
thing some sort of distinguishing line
between that but I think it'll look
gorgeous yeah I mean I my first thing
that comes to mind is fingerprints
there's going to be more fingerprints on
your screen but I
that's something that we deal with all
the time and also breaking it might be a
little easier for sure for sure though I
at least how about this breaking the
actual the it depends on how far they
wrap for example if it still has like a
metal edge but a screen it won't break
as much right but if you have it where
it wraps pretty much over the edges
you're you're more likely gonna break is
often breaking it on the edge that's how
I broke my ipad3 one time just it fell
on the edge right on barely you know and
yeah like and that's enough to cost you
two hundred dollars or more over more or
i would say more than that more than two
hundred dollars i remember it was like
190 or something yeah it's it's never
fun it's it's actually the one of the
most it's one of the worst feelings uh
and in first world problems you can ever
have when you drop your phone and like
you you kind of hear that crack noise
like it just kind of yeah then you like
pick your ball we're on dude but how
many people still use them one that
cracked it's just you're not gonna like
buy a whole new thing i know i see a lot
of people right act phones like all the
time they could completely cut their
face up with it if they want to but they
somehow manage they somehow manage i'm
also from this Barclays report they
claim again kind of piggybacking on some
of the things we've heard but add a few
new pieces of information they believe
the iphone 8 design will be again bezel
asst but coming in two different sizes a
5-inch and 5.8 inch curved screens
according to this article because of the
removal of the bezel that will allow the
actual physical screen size to be larger
I see so that 4.7 inch or na bad boy is
that one what does that one this is my
iphone 6 what size is that though i
forget its i believe it's 47 and the the
six or sorry the 7s is like a 5.5 if i
recall correctly and then the iphone SE
is a 4-inch screen which is actually
kind of the single one an old-school so
we'll find out about this also people
have been asking yo what's what's going
on with the iPods or the air pods i
wanted to address this specifically to
our friend Bob from was it long island
island he called in but i was like a
we're going to answer this
according to reports we have not heard a
single peep from Apple but a couple
reports are saying that apple will begin
production of the air pods in December
what that moves we may not see them in
time for the holidays if they do it in
the beginning of december we might see
them like but that's a big might because
i still have to manufacture them make
sure the supply is right and then ship
them over seas here yes yeah it's I
don't think that's gonna I don't think
they start production they're gonna get
it in like a week and a half or two it's
gonna be more like three weeks to four
weeks so we'll see how that shakes out
but that's all the stories um I'll told
indication and again I think it's
extremely disappointed he also was
wondering like what was the problem you
know can we speculate on that do we know
remember I kind of had this long
diatribe about like what was to me that
they didn't have enough controls but um
I I think that it's part of it we have
never heard a single bad thing about
functionality at least from the
reviewers who got the early prototypes
that were able to use them so and even
if they had specific problems a apples
not going to tell us and be apples not
gonna tell us if I if if you really
think about I can only speculate which
are you gonna try them out are you gonna
buy a pyre I would love them but I just
not gonna I can't afford one hundred and
sixty dollars or whatever so for earbuds
that you don't even really like in the
first I'm afraid I'm gonna lose that I
don't know what the sound quality is
that I'm gonna have to charge like it
they bring down the price a hundred
dollars maybe no wait wait wait 60 lbs
65 for em Stephen Beecham the ultimate
consumer hey Apple if you just drop a
hundred dollars off that price I'll
totally they're dropping their they're
dropping prices on everything apparently
so I wouldn't put it past them that's
true I'll give you that much for sure um
just some updates and software mac OS or
I guess people ackles people last for
Michael see ya 10-point 12.2 the beta is
out actually the public beta but what
makes this special or what makes this
different is a you
receive an update for unicode 9 emojis
you know what that means ah you're gonna
get emojis like a what what is oh they
added like the bacon emoji they added
like a clown fit they added a bunch of
them but you're going to be able to get
those emojis in mac OS Sierra sometime
soon I'm just letting you know we're
losing some emojis to write release yes
a peach buttons there right there yeah
they're replacing the peach but did we
talk about this it was I've seen it all
over the news like CNN updated it is
frustrating I use that a lot in my text
messages yeah why do you gotta change
stuff man just like a lot I don't even
have a replacement right now like I mean
the eggplant is quite an iconic emoji
that I use frequently as well be getting
rid of that no okay they can't get rid
of it can that's like one of the most
highly used millennial I think yeah I
don't know oh geez I can't remember off
the top my head is the banana emoji is
it a single banana or is it a bunch of
bananas I think it's a single but it's
peeled right that's right that's right
that's thanks for thanks for the Intel
is really important stuff oh my gosh and
then also the public beta for iOS 10.2
is out and they give people if you have
it you can sign up for all the public
betas for free directly through apple's
website i do want to remind you that
it's really dumb to run that as your
primary running a beta as on your
primary phone I can't tell you how many
be like oh just doesn't work as well I'm
like you know why yeah it's you're not
supposed to do that yeah like you can
and you can get away the most things but
I've had things were some of my apps
that I use all the day like my sling
player app that's where I can watch TV
anywhere I go on my phone like a because
it's connected to my cable box at home a
lot it all the to almost every year when
i try run a bait on it it doesn't work
so when i'm on the road watching NBA
games like warrior games dude I need
that apt to work yeah that's a bummer so
10.2 beta is including kind of a steep
peak of the TV app this is if you recall
at the last keynote Apple showcase their
TV app which is a way to really just use
apps that networks and channels have
already created to make it easier to
watch program is this the TV app that I
have on the screen yes it looks just
like
itunes like a music app i itunes stylish
this is a exactly just kind of a few
sneak peeks of the screens it's not
fully functioning at all it is just kind
of like oh this is what it looks like so
you can't use it per se but it's not
fully featured at all right now but it
is very i2z ish I mean or Apple music
Ischl yeah yeah totally looks exactly
the same which is not confusing at all
to call it TV like when you have an
Apple TV but it plays movies and TV not
TV I just have a feeling like you're
gonna get lost in your apps kind of
gonna be like am I in the music app or
the TV app because that happens to me
now with like Twitter versus Facebook
versus you know Instagram it's like
which one of my in now because they all
look the same now you're you're lost in
a glass cage of emoji exactly you can't
gravity a glass of other weeps other
politics as you scroll down becomes like
a window with a picture and a caption uh
how often do you it because you're
trying to like do a billion things at
once often you actually message people
the wrong message do you do that a lot I
don't yeah sometimes I i've done that to
my dad and like embarrassing my
death card me hahahaha I've done that a
few times three times all right dad Saur
Saur daddy-o also just to kind of get
you updated with some also some iphone 7
News oh sorry wait before we go I how
can I forget this I almost skipped our
most important story of the show the
more emojis more emojis okay saw these
so unicode 9 is the recent was was
approved like last year but the those
emojis were put in a place or i think it
was like in April or May I can't
remember just don't accuse me of not
remembering all this crap so the Unicode
10 has proposed 51 new emojis for
acceptance which we would most likely
see in 2017 including the bearded
hipster a giraffe a like a sippy cup
soft drink breastfeeding like I thought
that was one that i did not know one's
interesting that could be used for a
whole lot of things in my and based on
my texting abilities we got a little Shh
we have like a pie a pie I like the
Dracula one that's that one's pretty
cool culturally relevant the Haji yeah
there and X is a zebra and the pretzel I
mean it's always pretzel time baby
pretzel time pencil time there's like fo
UFOs there's gonna be like broccoli if
you scroll down on that page Beach out
if you can there's like broccoli
coconuts like make me a sandwich there's
this one there's a point where there's
just too many Modi's like I think look
the art of the emoji is taking other
things and kind of making up messages
from them yes and when it starts getting
so specific it kind of kills like you
know like breastfeeding come on uh yeah
that's like there's an actual emoji for
breastfeeding coming does that make
sense to you sure funny the more the
merrier I don't I don't care about I
mean it is hard to like scroll through
like fine like that's not cool you know
but even though it has your most
recently used it's still not enough
sometimes I'll be going through emoji so
I'm like what the hell am I doing with
my life except looking for an emoji I've
said I've said that a lot of just in
general like waste of time yeah also
just to jump over the iphone 7 rumors
according to Macotakara they claim that
Apple may add what they call in
quotations a jet white color option for
the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus now i
think this would be really cool when
they call it jet white it's more of the
treatment right remember how they showed
this intense video of how it was like
polished and then we added i I don't
know he's all this is like a 13 step
layer process of anodization and
polishing we make painting your eyes
like so close so if so in tongues so the
rumor jet white color could be coming
again it's not for sure but I actually
like the idea this again I kind of wish
they released that crazy night midnight
blue color that was really yeah like how
the dope was that people were buzzing
about which everyone was all about that
they were like come on bring out the
blue but you know before we even started
the show today people got in the chat
room before we even live and they're
like I can't wait for that jet white
phones like everyone was talking about
it like it's weird how just something
that simple gets people excited yeah
like some just you mean like when any
time Apple just says we're gonna make an
announcement
people just get really excited hey super
excited like an Nintendo classic edition
not coming up on my amazon hey it's I'm
sorry I'll apologize if it's my fault
that because we're doing the show
exactly the time that it launched that
you don't get one man i know you're
checking right now i can tell hell yeah
this section okay and then finally last
quick story about iphone according to
reports iphone SE unlikely to receive a
refresh until early 2017 and that's
really because they're waiting for the
component parts to lower so that for the
current stuff or you know based on the
deals that they strike with
manufacturers so that if they do make
any upgrades they'll still be able to
make their like ridiculous like thirty
thirty-five percent margins on those
phones but the iphone SE a very popular
phone yeah i mean surprisingly like we
hear a lot of news about it and a lot of
people dig it yep super popular phone so
um there you go i hope that last week
you guys if you end gals if you haven't
had a chance to listen to i know that
the phone call he wasn't the best but it
was more than good enough that you're
able to hear our interview last week
with steve blank because i think it shed
a lot of light and just more than
anything it was not to poop on apple but
just to give you perspective
historically of maybe where they're
going but again any company can turn
things around so I don't I don't I don't
think it was incriminating some people
were so mad at me they're like why would
you do just a one-sided thing I'm like I
thought was actually very fair how it
was discussed yeah definitely you know
all you do is poop on Apple I'm like did
I not brag about Apple's solid-state
drive speeds last episode no response
that's what I thought well we talked
about this they're just they're having a
little slump right now you know a little
we called it last year nostra Tongass
beach and dong it this is a down year
for Apple yes you could see it like you
could see it but I mean this macbook pro
news you did at the beginning of the
show is very surprising i mean like we
were all like oh macbook pro is so
expensive and you know just not enough
but it seems like it's taking off never
underestimate the power of rich people
so yeah all the guys not either right
now my god i've worked oh they don't
need the touch bar but i'll give them
the 10
alright and then also just does a little
teaser next week we will have our laptop
editor dan ackerman a week we will have
an interview with him so if you guys
want to listen in and just hear pluses
minuses and everything about the new
macbook pros a you'll be able to listen
to that yeah he's been living with it
for what about two weeks yeah so so
we'll find out how how good that thing
really is and who it's for okay should
we get to some more phone calls let's do
some voicemail let's do it baby alright
let me make sure my thing is ready here
we go hey Brian beach Jason in
Tallahassee got an iphone 6 and ever
since I downloaded iOS 10 battery life
is terrible my phone will go from forty
percent watching a movie and drop in to
nothing and shut off on me in five
minutes any ideas thanks love your show
yet so first of all I will say to I will
I don't know how early you updated it
but I do know for a fact when I updated
to iOS 10 because of the way it really
re indexes your phone to help optimize
it I feel like the first week or two my
battery life was getting murdered like
absolutely murdered and a lot of people
experienced the same thing it has
stabilized since then but then the other
issue that really come that it comes
down to is a lot of times these new
operating systems Apple will never
officially say it but when you go to a
phone that might be two years older or
three years older it's just not really
made for those phones and it typically
can be more resource hungry so that also
could be one of the reasons why you're
experiencing that just purely because of
how they choose to or not choose to
support older phones I don't know if you
can maybe you could email us at the
apple byte at cnet com with a follow up
I'm just curious it I kind of need more
information that but my first hunch is
if you update it very recently it's most
likely that but the second hunch is also
how they support devices and again this
is
an ongoing thing for years and they're
you know they're here I'm also thinking
like when you do the update it refreshes
all your apps sometimes and maybe
possibly similar apps that track you got
reset to track you again let maybe you
turned it off because that happened to
me like I did an update and a couple of
apps that i just had turned off where
you know where they're tracking my
location they were that was back on yeah
oh how did that I guess I guess the app
reset itself or something so that could
be if you have apps tracking you then
that's going to eat all your battery
life there are a few ways though I will
tell you again maybe it's something that
you might want to look online there are
a few ways to iOS 10 in general uses
more battery life there's like a feature
where when you pick up your phone it's
called raise to wake your screen
automatically turns on yes that's gonna
that's going to use more battery life
quite honestly and then also there's
things like they added all these new
widgets and guess what those widgets
have to constantly be fed data to be
updated so you can actually turn that
off there there's a few things you can
tweak with but I would just say try
turning off raise to wake at least and
then try you know there's also um like a
background app refresh option than that
again requires your phone to work to
update that if you want to maybe only
select a few apps for to support that's
fine but just try some of those tweaks I
think raised awake will help though
actually oh for sure you know sure cuz
yeah and then turning off the animations
to like live just little things like
yeah yep yep the motion effects oh yeah
okay so next call yep it looks like the
nintendo is currently unavailable again
don't cry dry your comment don't cry dry
your hey guys this is francis from los
angeles california love the show just
had a question about what you guys think
about the apple car project project
titan and its recent news about it being
sort of disbanded i think a good
strategy actually and i heard about this
is the possibility of for example buying
tesla and making you know i musta CEO at
apple i think actually that would be a
great strategy because it sounds like
apple doesn't know what to
do with their car project and what
threatened to take it and they're
actually years behind Tesla and other
autonomous driving companies so um I
just was wondering what you guys think
of that strategy papal would be open to
that it Moscow would be able to that
with Tesla I think that was a 10 years
you know up ahead again if they did
something like that like they did with
beats and music streaming service so uh
yeah I'd love to hear your opinion on
that and uh yeah thanks for i think it's
i think it's a fascinating idea I also
you know when you talk about who are
kind of those next generation innovative
minds Elon Musk obviously has to be on
that short list clearly I don't know if
you guys and gals saw what he's doing
with roof tiles it's amazing the solar
roof tiles he's on his way to being the
next day job mr. like figure yeah for
sure with the with the types of things
that he is pushing forward with so check
out those solar tiles uh they're crazy
look I believe in what Tesla Elon Musk
is doing because I put down a whatever
it was it's refundable but a one
thousand dollar deposit for the Tesla
three like kind of jealous i knew do
that because it was refundable right and
at the same time like i don't know when
this thing is gonna be available might
be two more years three more years but
i'll be in the market for a car then so
why not at least have the option to like
don't see what their see what they're
cooking I think realistically though
Elon Musk already has his own plans and
ideas you know you might choose to buy
you could you could buy a company Apple
has more than enough cash to but if the
actual if just cuz you buy his company
doesn't mean he wants to be the CEO of
the company true like yeah so that these
guys he's got his foot in so many
different things I mean they're he's
going to space he's billing assault
obviously there's a lot of things he's
doing so I it'd be hard to get him to
focus on one thing I'm sure and nothing
he's doing you know again that's a great
suggestion but nothing he's doing is
what Apple's doing and that's actually
part of the problem like his brain is
thinking like ahead of what Apple's
doing yeah exact you know he he's not
think he's always thinking how can I
like interrupt Apple well you know what
I mean or what what is what did they
call just disrupt it disrupted the
silicon valley's buzzword
exactly so um I think he'd be a great
man but he doesn't really play in
consumer electronics quite honestly now
he's going for the big boys big stuff
big big stuff so great called oh thank
you okay next call hey guys heard from
Salt Lake x is still chapped about no I
max I'm need an imac it's frustrating as
hell waiting forever and not getting on
uh what's your thoughts thanks yeah do
you need a hug bro look hike if the new
imacs do come out what would be the
price point like how I don't even know
how much the current ones are I feel
like that around fort I feel like
they're around 12 99 1499 so of the talk
about in a surface studio oh for sure no
more affordable it better be it'd be
embarrassing if it was more expensive
studio quite honestly yeah um it was
weird though because like they were
really high when the first imac came out
the new design i bought it immediately
because i loved it and it had more than
a power and it still does for what i do
it had this cool fusion drive technology
but then they kind of like went away
from that it was is basically like a
hard drive that was merged with like a
side bit of like flash storage to
optimize and speed up things I don't
talk about it as much anymore I might be
wrong but I think the new ones still
have it but they just don't talk about
it nice or it's an order to build to
order option but um well you're not the
only one waiting for new imacs plenty
people wanted just knew max period not
just new macbook pros my hunches will
see something in march or april of next
year just because they have to do
something and i'm sure they're working
on it so we'll see cool alright next
call hey Brian how you guys doing my
name is Anthony I'm cold from New York
and I'm a software developer and I've
heard all the complaints about the new
macbook pros and I just want to play
devil's advocate and say uh you know
when I first looked at it having no
ports I got freaked out um but then what
I I look deeper and I saw how much those
ports can do it really is amazing arm
but the fact that you can't plug your
new iPhone into your new macbook is
completely retarded so I think the hell
Mary passes if apple announces the
iphone XR
iphone future whatever you guys want to
call it and they release it with a USB 3
arm and then you have one port to rule
them all do you think that they will
have the guts to actually do that all
right guys I love the show thanks right
yes great call it's not called guts it's
called courage courage see spelled CEO
you are a GE yes hashtag they could look
they could they could do something like
that it depends on how married they are
or how much they really love their
lightning look you make a great point
because if they really loved lightning
that much you would have seen a
lightning port on the new macbook pros
true like you really would if they felt
like we've got to have this and so um
will find out but again at the same time
Apple has never on their iPhones if I
let me think about this out loud and
carefully they've never used a
standardized cable connection they had
that 30 pin connection adapter then they
go to lightning they've never used like
an actual USB USB micro or even a
firewire you know that was back in the
day with the ipod so historically
they've never used a mainstream
connection on their phones the only sort
of thing you can call mainstream is just
the wireless why over Wi-Fi yeah that's
the only thing that they've really does
Wi-Fi balita so so we'll see what
happened I students yeah well we'll see
we'll see what they do I think it's an
interesting point and look if if it's
all about being super thin I think if
they use us bc and it actually can be
thinner than whatever they have you know
from their component parts and lightning
they'll do it so I phone acts iphone
future will wait and find out I like how
people pick up on that name because it
is dope it is done is dope I think
that's the show man we have yeah we have
one more piece of business we got to
take care of oh thank you for reminding
me of that piece of business I guess
I'll just read it is that okay please
