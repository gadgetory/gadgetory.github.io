IndieGoGo project about this watch
projector and it's this piece of jewelry
that you would wear as a regular
wristwatch and what it would do is it
would shoot the time on your wrist and
if you're watching the video version
you'll see the guy is hold like this
just pondering and this image and
there's a the actual watch face or the
time appears there and the idea is that
you would get smart notifications as
well on your I guess your palm top so
you can see like Twitter notifications
you'd be able to see Facebook things but
the time would be one of the items I
don't know man smartwatches right we
this has been a big crazy push this got
a projector and if you look is that this
leatherette look to it would you wear
this I would wear it if I'm going
somewhere that nobody knows me because
there's no way I'm doing this in front
of my friends cuz I would never hear the
end of it but what drives me nuts is in
this video
they keep showing people with the image
projected but they cannot freaking see
the time just projecting it to the world
like that's over here I'm gonna touching
my ear I'm holding hands with somebody
else and you can't actually see the time
that's what I don't understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
