browsing the web and playing games on
the go but nothing will replace a
desktop computer for the ultimate gaming
experience you can walk into your local
Best Buy and purchase a computer from
companies like Dell HP and Lenovo for
around 300 bucks but if you want truly
high-powered machine and on afraid of
getting your hands dirty
nothing beats building your own I'm dan
Graziano and today I'm going to teach
you how to build your own computer here
you have all your components the
motherboard CPU graphics card RAM hard
drive DVD drive and power supply the
motherboard is the heart and soul of
your system it pumps commands to every
component while the central processing
unit acts to the brains the graphics
processing unit controls 2d and 3d
graphics Ram is your computer's memory
the hard drive stores all your files and
the power supply powers the entire thing
for a complete rundown these components
visit my three-part guide on building
your own computer now that you have the
basic understanding of each component
let's get started there are numerous
ways to build a computer but we're going
to opt for an external process take your
motherboard and place it on a non
conductive surface such as a wooden
table lift the LGA socket remove the
protective cover and gently place the
processor inside without applying any
pressure a large fan comes with the CPU
this is called a heatsink to attach it
simply find the power connector rotate
it accordingly and push down on the pins
next pull back the clips on the RAM slot
and place your cards inside push down -
you hear click but make sure the RAM
cards aren't located next to each other
but rather in slots with the same color
set the motherboard aside for a little
as we move on to the case take the power
supply and line it up with the
corresponding screws sockets at the back
of the case and secure it in place there
are two types of power supplies modular
which has removable cords and non
modular with attached cords like so
which is why you want a modular model
next up is the motherboard line it up
and screw it into place
then pull back the PCI clips and click
the graphics card into place both the
hard drive and DVD drive slide into
place and can be secured with screws
once everything is installed it's time
to bring the system to life your power
supply will come with either 24 pin or
20+4 pin adapter this plugs into the
motherboard
along with a four pin connector which
can be found near the CPU plug two of
the 6 pin PCI connectors into the back
of the graphics card each drive must
also be connected to a SATA power cord
with the smaller cord being plugged into
the motherboard and each fan must be
connected to a 4-pin molex adapter the
power button and LED light will either
be a 1 or 2 pin connector and they will
plug into the first 8 pin header on the
motherboard
while the 8 pin front-facing ports plug
into their corresponding sockets close
the system up plug it in and if
everything is installed properly it
should power on once you hit the button

your own computer including detailed
steps for installing an operating system
