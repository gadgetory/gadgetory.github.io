honeycomb tablets keep our labs buzzing
how to root your android phone and why
you would want to in the first place
take the drive-in theater wherever you
go and how to put the kibosh on annoying
facebook updates it's all coming up
right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good the
motorola xoom was the first device on
the market to run honeycomb the tablet
only version of the android OS now it's
got company though from a flood of new
honeycomb based tablets here are Eric
Franklin with the LG G slate and Donald
bell with the acer iconia tab as only
the second tablet to use the honeycomb
OS the team of OG slate with google by
LG will garner a lot of attention most
want to know how it compares to the zoom
so let's get that out of the way right
now first off the G slate is smaller
sporting an 8.9 inch screen compared to
the zooms 10.1 inch screen it also
supports t mobile's 4g network includes
a 3d camera and features the pre
installed app t mobile TV which offers
streaming TV and on-demand movies the
tablet also includes full flash support
out of the box those are the major
changes with so many tablets being
released this year we don't recommend
signing up for a new data plan but you
should know that the no contract price
for the G slate is 750 dollars by
signing up for a two-year plan with
tmobile you can get the tablet for 630
dollars plus a 100-dollar mail-in rebate
bringing the price down to five hundred
and thirty dollars at those prices is
cheaper than a zoom with a verizon data
plan but not quite as cheap as the ipad
2 again we don't recommend signing up
with any carrier until the dust on the
tablet landscape has settled also no
word yet on a Wi-Fi only version of the
g slate weight-wise the g slate is only
slightly heavier than the ipad 2 but
like the zoom those heftier due to its
odd weight distribution it's also nearly
a third thicker than the ipad 2 in
landscape mode its screen measures as
wide as the ipad tues but it's about an
inch shorter in height the g slight
feels comfortable in our hands while
typing whether in landscape or portrait
mode and unlike the ipad 2 with its
smooth as silk metal casing the g slate
isn't as likely to slip
our grip on its bottom side the tablet
includes ports for mini USB and mini
HDMI on the top is a volume rocker and
microphone pinhole to speakers can be
found on the right side with another on
the left also on the left is the
power/lock button a headphone jack and a
power adapter slot input accessing the G
site SIM card is a little more involved
and we like there's a hidden panel on
the back requiring you to push down and
slide it up revealing the SIM card as
well as the reset button underneath
these days you can't have a tablet
without a built-in camera usually to
legislate attempts to one-up the
competition by not only including a
front-facing 2-megapixel camera but also
a 5 megapixel 3d camera on the back the
silver panel here isn't a kickstand
sorry sometimes a silver panel is just a
silver panel unlike the zoom the G slate
includes an IPS screen with a noticeably
wider viewing angle surfing speeds under
4G we're faster than the zoom and iPad
using 3g especially on busy sites but
using 4g did drain the battery something
quick if you're expecting good looking
3d on the G slate prepare to be
disappointed first off it uses
anaglyphic red and blue glasses which
while more practical and cheaper than
active shutter lenses results in a lower
quality image in the end the g site
screen all classes a zoom while motorola
spins its thumbs on 4g support t-mobile
delivers it out of the box while the 3d
is shot early implemented some will find
some use for it also the content on
tmobile TV won't suit everyone's taste
but it's still a convenient way to get
live TV and on-demand movies on your
tablet aalto thanks to a slightly lower
price higher quality screen and extra
features the tmobile g slate with google
is a better value than the zoom with a
verizon data plan however the ipad 2 is
still the tablet to beat check out the
full review for more details on the
tmobile g slate
hey I'm Donnell bell today we're taking
a first look at the iconia tab from Acer
this is a Wi-Fi only contract free
tablet running Google's Android
Honeycomb OS and priced attractively at
four hundred and forty nine dollars
honeycomb made its debut on the motorola
xoom early in 2011 and we criticized the
tablet for being a little too pricey and
too bulky to compete with the ipad with
the iconia tab acer is at least
answering one of our requests pricing
their tablet at four hundred and fifty
dollars less than the Wi-Fi only zoom
while maintaining nearly all of its
features like the zoom you get a 10.1
inch screen that's great for videos and
web browsing there's a built in hdmi
output for mirroring HD content onto
your TV you get a 5 megapixel camera on
the back a 2 megapixel camera on the
front both of which can be used to chat
over the included google talk app the
Android Honeycomb experience here is
pretty much what you'd expect acer puts
a few of their own bundled apps on the
home screen but if you don't like them
they're easy to clear off and replace
with something else the bad news is that
acer hasn't cut any of the bulk we saw
in the zoom in fact it's a tad heavier
and when you hold it up next to the slim
down ipad to the difference is dramatic
still we're happy to see honeycomb reach
a price below the iPad and hopefully
this will be a trend that will keep
seeing throughout the year for cnet.com
i'm donna bell and this is the acer
iconia tab a500
and believe it or not those are not the
only honeycomb tablets to pass through
the lab this week head on over to seen
at tv.com to see Eric's review of the ax
Seuss epad transformer and it's snazzy
keyboard / docking station next up is a
pair of products that can help turn your
home office into a DIY photo studio
without breaking the bank hey there I'm
Josh Goldman senior editor with cnet and
this is a look at the nikon coolpix
s9100 now like all point-and-shoot
makers nikon continues to push just how
much lens can be jammed into a compact
camera this one is packing a 25
millimeter wide angle lens with an 18x
zoom that's longer and wider than most
in this category it's also using a 12
megapixel backside illuminated CMOS
sensor that improves low-light photo
quality and shooting performance and
this camera is fast there's almost no
shutter lag and it shot to shot time is
barely more than a second the only time
it really slows down is when you pop up
the flash actually using the camera is
nice to nikon's s-series cameras are
geared for point-and-shoot use so you
won't find any manual controls beyond
changing exposure compensation is o or
white balance what you will find are a
lot of automatic modes to help you get
the best results without worrying too
much about settings and that includes
some special effects that can help spice
up otherwise boring photos the S 9100
also captures movies in Full HD at 30
frames per second or high speed videos
for a slow-motion effect zoom lens works
while shooting regular movies but the
movement gets picked up by the stereo
mic on top so in quiet scenes you will
hear it a bit otherwise the clips are
pretty good and photo quality is good
too but average for this type of camera
there's some lens distortion in the
corners at the wide end and if you're a
stickler for sharpness or fine details
when photos are viewed at full
resolution well then this camera
probably isn't for you but for its price
and shooting
flexibility most people after a decent
snapshot should be pretty happy with the
results I'm Josh Goldman and that's the
nikon coolpix s9100 thanks for watching
hi I'm Justin you with cnet com with the
first look at the canon pixma mg 60 120
multifunction printer we had a few
issues with the touch sensitivity on the
control panel but its missteps are
definitely offset by its competent Home
Office capabilities and those include HD
movie print simple installation and dual
paper trays on the top and bottom that
can hold up to 300 sheets of paper at a
time the mg 60 120 takes on a new design
that incorporates folding trays all
around to keep the footprint relatively
small and easy to transport despite the
rear mounted auto document feeder and
its six individual ink tanks inside but
the most interesting design change comes
in the form of this interactive touch
sensitive control panel as you can see
the only tactile button you get is for
power all the other buttons light up on
an as-needed basis depending on the
function you're accessing the controls
also work in conjunction with this
3-inch LCD screen that lifts forward
from the middle and tilts back into the
unit the new button style is easy to use
but we're hoping that cannon will let us
adjust the sensitivity in future models
as the current setting is so sensitive
that we found ourselves accessing the
wrong buttons accidentally along with
the standard multifunction duties like
copy print and scan the mg 60 120 also
includes canons HD movie print feature
that will let you pull still snapshots
out of videos shot with compatible HD
Canon cameras in terms of performance
the mg 60 120 registers impressive
output speed in two out of the four
tests but did fall behind the
competition printing text prints and
photos that said this printer may not be
the quickest performer for graphic
design offices but we would not hesitate
to recommend its output quality in a
boardroom presentation and you can read
more about all those features and
performance scores for this printer in
its full review on cnet com but that's
going to do it for me I'm Justin you you
just took a first look at the canon
pixma ng 60 120
one printer thanks for watching yes you
could spend a lot more money for a DSLR
camera and a high-end photo printer but
if you just like to take a lot of
snapshots and want to print out a few of
your favorites those two goodies should
do just fine meanwhile back in the world
of Android last week Sharon Vaknin
showed us how to back up our Android
phones during that video she also talked
a little bit about rooting your phone if
you don't know what she was talking
about Seth Rosenblatt is here to explain
what rooting your phone means and how to
do it rooting your Android phone used to
be a complicated process involving about
a dozen steps and arcane rituals best
left to folks like Anton LaVey nowadays
it's much simpler there's an app for
that hi i'm seth rosenblatt foreseen it
and today i'm going to show you how to
gain root access on your android phone
actually there's more than just one
rooting app but the one I'll be using
today is super one click if you have an
HTC phone you want to use the unrevoked
non-market app to root and remove the
nand lock for unrevoked simply download
run the installer on your desktop and
follow the instructions before we begin
i'm going to caution you be careful when
you root your phone it will void your
warranty and it's possible to break your
phone even with a one click rooting app
generally that only happens when the
one-click process gets interrupted but
one more time please be careful for
example if your main computer is a
laptop make sure it's plugged in so
you're not draining the battery while
rooting alright all that said let's get
this started note that these are general
instructions and that there might be
device specific idiosyncrasies you ought
to know about before you begin so do
your research first download super one
click and save it to your desktop but do
not run it not yet next connect your
phone to your computer but do not mount
the SD card that means that you should
not turn on
USB storage double check by going to
settings SD card and phone storage and
unmount the SD card what you do want
though is to enable USB debugging if you
don't have a notification that will take
you to it go to settings application
settings development and enable USB
debugging go back to your computer and
double-click on super one click x e
choose the samsung captivate tab if
that's your phone for all others except
those made by HTC choose the universal
tab last click the root button and go
get yourself a tasty beverage this is
going to take a while if you want to sit
and watch it you ought to see a bunch of
activity scrolling by with ok appearing
after each one you might see some
warnings too but they're nothing to
worry about as long as superoneclick
doesn't freeze after routing is complete
it's a good idea to check for an app
called super user with a skull and
crossbones icon and to allow non-market
apps to install if you haven't set that
up yet either go to settings
applications and check unknown sources
finally reboot your phone and you ought
to be ready to breathe in the rarefied
air that all rooted android owners share
it smells like victory so that's how you
root your android using superoneclick
keep an eye out for the companion video
to this one how to install a custom
android rom remember always be safe when
routing from cnet I'm Seth Rosenblatt
great my phone is totally routed now
what will come back after the break for
the second half of the process
installing a customized Android ROM and
we'll be right back for more tech review
right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good when we last
left Seth he had just finished helping
you avoid your Android phones warranty
by rooting it well if you made it this
far you might as well go all the way and
set it up with a brand new rom take it
away set you've rooted your phone
congratulations now comes the hard part
installing a customized version of
Android hi i'm seth rosenblatt prasina
and today i'll show you how to install a
custom android problem there's a lot of
reasons you might want to run a custom
rom android features at the phone
company or hardware manufacture has
decided won't get pushed to your device
or just to get a more robust set of
features you can also run customized
themes on a rom you're likely to see
significantly better performance
basically you get more control over your
phone it's all about you baby oh and i
hope you know this by now but rooting
your phone voids your warranty
installing a custom rom pretty much
obliterates it there are a few methods
for downgrading your phone back to stock
and though they're not simple seen at TV
has how to do that to the mod we're
going to be working with today is
cyanogenmod which is in use on more than
100,000 android devices and is one of
the most popular roms i'm going to
install it on cnet editor antoine
Goodwin's old droid 1 mostly because
that's the first spare phone that showed
up roms can be tricky things so be
careful that you use what i tell you
here is more of an introduction or loose
guideline for how to install a custom
rom definitely go look up how to install
the rom of your choosing on your
specific device so here's how it's done
first we're going to create a backup of
your system download and run a backup
app like titanium backup then download
the raw manager app from the market
either free or paid will do tap the app
and then choose flash clockworkmod
recovery tap motorola droid and they
give the app root permission if prompted
if the app crashes just allow it to
force clothes and run it again if the
flash was successful you'll see a box
that reads successfully flashed
clockworkmod recovery clockworkmod
recovery is a customized version of the
android default recovery screen and it
allows for more choices such as nandroid
backups all right let's get to the ROM
next if you've bought the premium
version of wrong manager there's a
slightly automated way to do this jump
into the app and select download rom tap
cyanogenmod after you install you can
backup existing ROM and wipe data and
cache when the install finishes it will
reboot directly into Santa gen mod if
you didn't buy the raw manager premium
you can still install a rom relatively
easily relatively go to cyanogenmod com
and download the latest version if you
use google apps like Gmail also download
the Google Apps package cyanogen decided
to spin off the Google sourced apps to
avoid potential conflicts with Google
connect your phone to your computer
enable USB mode and place both the
cyanogen and google apps zips in the
root directory of your SD card next boot
into clockworkmod recovery by turning
off the phone and restarting it holding
down the X key along with the power
button use the d-pad to navigate choose
wipe data/factory reset then wipe cache
partition then install zip from sdcard
select Choose zip from the SD card then
go for the Santa gen mod update zip then
install the Google Apps update.zip once
the installation is finished go back to
return to the main menu and choose
reboot now your phone auto boot into
cyanogenmod if it fails the first time
but you can still navigate give it
another shot of course if it doesn't do
anything at all you've got yourself a
pretty little brick and that's how you
install a custom rom on
android first cnet i'm seth rosenblatt
so now you're all set right no problem
actually rooting and installing roms can
be tricky so if you decide you'd rather
put it all back the way you found it
look for Seth's video how to restore
your rooted phone to the factory
settings on cnet TV most new cars these
days have these big pretty touchscreen
display is right there in the center
console and they're cool but they take
up a lot of space luckily Pioneer has
come up with a solution that is both
elegant and kind of rad if you want a
big screen car audio system for your
vehicle but you don't have the ton of
space in your dashboard you'll probably
be interested in taking a look at one of
these motorized AV units I'm antuan
goodwin cnet com today we're taking a
first look at the Pioneer AVH p 6300 BTW
and this unit features a 7-inch color
touchscreen that moves on a motorized
arm the unit can be tilted back and
forth and retracts into a single din
chassis when not in use you're saving a
lot of space here on installation but
you want to make sure there's about an
arc of six to eight inches of clearance
in front of the unit so the motorized
display actually has room to move
physical controls include a volume knob
a source button physical skip buttons
and a disc eject button for the CD DVD
player there's also a button to retract
that touchscreen an analog auxiliary
input and USB port can also be found on
the front panel the latter of which
supports mass storage devices and iPod
connectivity there's also an SD card
slot but you'd be hard-pressed to find
it because it's hidden behind this
removable panel both that USB port and
SD card slot support audio playback and
photo viewing so it may not be such a
bad idea just to leave an SD card in
this unit with a bunch of your favorite
songs additionally there's also an input
for a rear-view camera and an analog
auxiliary video source Bluetooth
connectivity is standard and the
microphone is included but it doesn't
appear that audio streaming is supported
just yet now when the iphone is
connected via USB pandora's Apple Inc is
supported if you have the app download
on your phone so you can then view and
select your preset radio stations thumbs
up and thumbs down songs and bookmark
songs all from pioneers interface you're
gonna want to check out the full review
for the pioneer AVH p 6300 BTW for even
more details and photos and our final
thoughts about this mobile DVD receiver
there's been Antoine good with cnet com
giving you your first look whoo another
cliffhanger I guess you'll have to go
find Antoine's review to see what he
really thinks but here's a hint three
and a half stars alright I put it off as
long as I can it's time to check out the
bad the bad award this week goes to my
facebook newsfeed between the top news
feature and the oversharing friends that
pollute your timeline making sure you're
seeing the updates you want can be a
little tricky luckily Sharon Vaknin is
here to show you how to solve those
problems and more
hi I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com here
to give you a spring cleaning project
for your Facebook account when
Facebook's at top news as the default
view my newsfeed became completely
irrelevant according to facebook top
news displays posts that get the most
comments likes and shares along with
post by people you interact with most
but instead of letting Mark Zuckerberg
decide what content is important to you
here's how to customize your newsfeed
first switch to the most recent view
which is like a real-time view of your
friends activity now it's not really a
real-time view because Facebook only
shows you the latest posts from people
you frequently interact with to change
that click most recent and head down to
edit options here select show posts from
all of your friends and pages now this
means that every single bit of activity
will show up in your newsfeed even
updates from the annoying people who you
didn't really miss when you were in the
top news view so the next time you see
an update from that person or page hover
over the post and click X you can
actually choose to hide just that post
which is pointless or hide all updates
from that person they'll never know this
also works for hiding apps like
farmville or Twitter click the X and
choose to hide all posts by that
application
at this point your newsfeed is already
much cleaner but there are still a
couple more options to make it even
better this drop-down menu gives you
options to filter posts by status
updates photos links and more just below
those options are your friend lists if
you don't see any that's because you
haven't created them click account and
then edit friends in the upper right is
the option to create a list enter the
title of the list and select the friends
you want to include I have a work list a
list for just my close friends and a
family list now if you go to the
newsfeed and select that list only
updates from the people or pages you
included will appear you can make as
many lists as you want one creative way
to use them is to put all of the news
brands into one list to stay on top of
current events of course the most
powerful way to control your Facebook
feed is to unfriend people who bother
you or delete pages and apps that you
don't care about Facebook needs to make
some changes though I'd like to see a
built-in current events filter and
option to make most recent my default
view it would also be nice to hide
certain activities like new friendships
or relationship statuses that I don't
care about until then these workarounds
will do for cnet com I'm Sharon Vaknin
and i'll see you on the interwebs
you know I noticed we blurred out the
names of the people that Sharon had
blocked from her feet I wonder how much
it's worth to her for me to keep that
information private while I come up with
a ransom figure let's go ahead and check
out this week's bottom line now here at
Cena we see all kinds of technology but
sometimes our jobs take us in unexpected
directions like to toilet first looks
yeah no really check it out hi I'm Scott
Stein senior associate editor at cnet
com and this is the Kohler Numi toilet
now this may not be for everyone in fact
it costs almost sixty four hundred
dollars to buy but this is a high-tech
toilet that borrows a lot from the idea
of Japanese hi-tech toilets but gives it
a distinctly American design namely
there's a touchscreen on this this is a
touchscreen magnetic tablet that docs
over here and gives you complete control
over heated seat functions and
automatically adjusting the day and also
temperature and blow drying options for
your every comfort need there's a
speaker system built into here there's a
radio you can attach your iPhone yes is
a full entertainment system for your
commode but if you are touch a verse and
you don't like using a remote this thing
can be fully automatically adjusted as
well it will automatically raise and
lower the lid from a distance of up to
six to eight feet you can also set it to
automatically flush for you and it also
has to flush settings one uses less
water for the ecologically conscious
overall it is a toilet from the future
but if you've been to Japan you may have
seen something like it you probably
haven't seen one that has a remote quite
like this I'm Scott Stein and this has
been a hands-on with the Kohler Numi
ultra high-tech smart toilet
the bottom line this week stay classy
Scott's time that was a remarkable
exercise in restraint not a single bad
pun in the entire piece which is a lot
more than I can say about this show all
right folks that is our show will be
back next week with a brand spanking new
cnet tech review including highlights
from the 2011 new york auto show until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day that's seen at
tv.com I'll see you next time and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
