ask you a question why do people who
were adopted feel like they were
rejected instead of selected I don't
feel rejected you're sure very sure
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a
complex man and the new film from Danny
Boyle and Aaron Sorkin explores the
personal cost of being the technology
visionary who helped shape the world we
live in today the movie is definitely
not a straight biopic instead is divided
into three acts each set backstage just
before an important product launch as
jobs meets with key figures in his life
including co-founder Steve Wozniak and
the man who ousted jobs from Apple John
Sculley it's an interesting approach
that helps the film stand out from
previous jobs biopics and the many books
written about him but it does see writer
aaron sorkin take a lot of liberties
with actual events and people all the
conversations are totally imaginary
illustrating aspects of jobs is life and
personality in completely dramatized
form it's more like a play in which jobs
is repeatedly visited by the ghosts of
Christmas past present and future the
three acts are marked with clever use of
subtly different music and even
different film while director danny
boyle keeps things focused on the actors
and the dialogue it's pure Sorkin filled
with the trademark quickfire banta
throwaway technical information and
witty quips familiar from the west wing
the social network and the newsroom in
the lead role Fassbender doesn't deliver
a spot-on impression of jobs but does
give an intense performance while Kate
Winslet stands out as Joanna Hoffman the
Apple staffer with the unenviable
responsibility of managing jobs both
professionally and personally at the
heart of the film is job's relationship
with Lisa the daughter he at first
denied shining a light on the lesson
pathetic aspect of his character Jobs
was definitely a complicated and
paradoxical figure and a hard man to
understand if you want the facts read a
book but if you want a witty and
dramatic interpretation of this divisive
figure the movie Steve Jobs approaches
the Apple su primo from a very different
angle the movie opens in the US on the
twenty-third of October and in the UK on
the 13th of November check out cnet com
