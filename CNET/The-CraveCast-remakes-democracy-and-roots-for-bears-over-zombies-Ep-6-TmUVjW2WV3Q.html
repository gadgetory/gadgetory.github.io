gentlemen i am your host for the credit
past eric mack and i'm joined today by
kelsey adams and steven Beecham at the
scene at studio in San Francisco and
Amanda Kooser also on skype from
Albuquerque New Mexico I'm actually
coming to you today from the offices of
my local newspaper and the company I
once worked for here in Taos New Mexico
defined talents news one of the finest
news sources between Albuquerque and
Denver check it out and because
apparently in my neighborhood it's the
print media that has the best broadband
connection so yeah there we go right
there so thanks to the town's news for
hosting me today and also if you're
joining us in the chat room you can join
us and chat with us on our YouTube in
the YouTube chat room youtube.com slash
seen it and you'll see the link for the
creative cast their go ahead and join us
there if you'd like to chat and also on
our live stream page and you can also
tweet at us at krave we're keeping an
eye on that one as well so in today's
crave cast we're going to look ahead to
a few big days they're coming up soon
obviously there is Halloween next week
which is an important date and who I
know eight people in the chat room are a
little disappointed we're not in costume
so it's like that it's a late right I'm
totally in costume this is still you are
Oh pearling cross Omega flying glass you
don't see that everything it and as you
can clearly tell I'm in costume as a
international traveler here behind me
okay I'm a cowboy on the road and so we
got halloween and but meanwhile while we
wait for the zombie apocalypse here in
the US we've also got an election coming
up just a few days after all hallows eve
and so I actually want to start off with
a little bit of political news before we
get into the more critical question of
the day involving zombies and bears but
first here in America you know
satisfaction with our politicians and
particularly with Congress's and an
all-time low in fact over the summer
Americans were asked how favorably they
looked upon some of our more popular
politicians you know names like Hillary
Clinton ran
Barack Obama and they were Americans at
the same time recently were also asked
how they felt about popular star wars
characters and when you mash up the
results of those two surveys as the
Washington Post did over the summer you
find that Han Solo Yoda and even a Darth
Vader pull much higher with the American
people than Hillary Obama Paul Ryan or
any other notable politicians in fact
Hillary Clinton and Baba thet heart but
polling neck and neck so I don't know
what that says and they try to make that
sound like a negative thing but if you
think about it boba fett is a huge cult
following and has done for a really long
time and people hobbyist code incredible
lengths to reproduce his armor his
weapons I mean he's a very very popular
character and so I think this augurs
well for Hillary's at Kennedy so Hillary
may have actually found a running mate
it sounds like however there was one
character from the Star Wars universe
that actually pulled significantly worse
than most of our politicians any guesses
at who that might be Jar Jar judge
indeed indeed Jar Jar Jar oppose very
loyal so a a Biden Binks ticket is not
the ticket for 2016 it turns out um god
I'd actually love to see their campaign
yeah there it is right there so you know
with this state of things in mind I
actually put out a clarion call on cnet
yesterday calling for the formation of a
new political party something that
harnesses the wisdom and the popular
culture influence of geeks and nerds and
fans like us at tentatively i'm calling
it geeks and nerds united that's or
canoe which has a lot of other great
meanings actually like to pronounce it
just knew with the saionji but
technically that's incorrect but as
people will definitely point out in the
comments but whatever so the real
question though today is is what would
this new party of geeks and nerds stand
for I mean what is our platform you know
I've got a few serious ideas like net
neutrality free and open Internet the
right of to access of information and as
our comrade Maikel Franco pointed out he
also supports the idea of
resolving all international conflicts
via one huge LARPing tournament which
you know i'm all about that what do you
guys think if we could actually pull off
a new party of geeks and nerds United
what should stand for I think there's a
lot of political power in the geeks and
nerds and I think they're all pro
science which is good because our
Congress anti-science right now so I
think it's a win Australia would get a
space program that's for you Michelle
but winter for Michelle oh and we should
also mention we are we're short a couple
of nerds today we're missing Jeff
Sparkman and we're missing Bonnie Burton
who are both respectively at Disneyland
and under the weather one being worse
than the other depending on your
perspective and how many kids you
dragging around with you so I it's too
bad they're not able to chime in
although I do know that Bonnie's in
favor of a robot about Butler in every
home so we can definitely support that
we did get some responses on Twitter
from readers and Watchers free education
for everyone which I think I think I
given what we were saying about science
and the lack of you know being a little
bit behind the world in science
education that we could certainly
support that then all other kinds of
stuff low cost for college a lot
educational thing you're better paid
teachers year round school year which is
what you see in a lot of Asian countries
that probably wouldn't hurt in some
respects I feel into gaming time though
just raising this is an issue that's
that's a good point uh Michael ah is
pointing me to the marvels Future
Foundation nua note this is I'm loading
and unloading it against hopefully this
is going to be appropriate what do you
think Amanda what party it's the Nerds
I'd like to see an initiative for some
nationwide broadband um just kind of get
an end to these these comcast complaints
Oh Raven yeah and to having to rely on
on comcast I mean I'm begging for
you know the company worth the worst
customer service due to come to my house
and not even having that option so
something is clearly broken there here's
the Future Foundation on wikipedia the
first paragraph it has to do with
science okay I've been becoming
discouraged by how earth scientists view
science in its applications mr.
fantastic forms a new group to create a
better future for all humanity gathering
some young great minds mr. fantastic
plans to mold them into a team that will
come up with solutions to the world's
problems cool there we go well alright
well we can be the non-fictional
component of the Future Foundation
Center so if you've got any any thoughts
on that you know the post is up on cnet
right now and definitely tweet at us at
krave and/or in the in the chat room i'm
glad that one s Yami stands for geek so
that that's excellent in the chat room
there now I thought there was an
official geek political party already um
libertarians so pretty much every
computer programmer I know as a
libertarian got the people in redditor
libertarians so yeah there's so there's
the pirate party which is a real thing
in several countries and there is a
pirate party of the of the US and then
there's also the internet party in
Ukraine which is kind of awesome they
they actually tried to get Darth Vader
as a candidate this is back in April and
we didn't we did cover it and he was
yeah I love the mix of expressions in
the audience there this is like during
the fall do Ukrainian political party
it's kind of funny
ignacio li SI ellos el medio to him he
packing up his evening have a scary
actually that might not go over so well
in our political system but but you get
the idea and actually i think they did
go so far as to submit his candidacy and
it got denied although i am now go ahead
i was just good i have recently seen
since he was denied there's no posters
all over Ukraine for to bacha so
Chewbacca's they still under running I
was just gonna say that if you look at
our our article we did on it the picture
of him looking defeated after the defeat
was very eloquent I thought uh-huh I
didn't know we had live footage this
better this is him submitting his papers
of alia so I'm just saying you know it
could work for it could work for Ukraine
and the polling seems to support this
and there is a you know aside from the
silly stuff like your stand I think
there's a serious amount of power within
the geek and nerd community that we
should harness and to try to build a
world where we all can all live long and
prosper so with that see we're going to
move on to Halloween which is the least
scary of the upcoming holidays here in
the United States and Bonnie Burton had
a couple of excellent Halloween post
which one do we want to start with the
Ghostbusters is getting a reboot right
did I do let's brief segue first yeah
yeah do your psycho cuz I didn't
understand it so you should do it um
esteem Cena colleague Christine Caine
pointed out to me that somebody did a
study comparing the number of zombie
movies and vampire movies made over the
years in the US according to whether it
was democrats republicans in office and
um apparently there's some theory that
zombies are more popular during
republican administrations vampires are
more popular during Democratic
administrations because of the the fear
of zombies as like the shambling
proletariat the poor diseased people
coming out you turned get your money vs
vampires being the decadent aristocrats
I feel like the empires are the taxing
you know they're the sucking the blood
taxing the public and with the
Republican I just want everyone to be
dumb so everyone walks around like
zombies looking for brains so this
theory has been floated and they have a
chart and with the numbers per year
where's that all right it's in there I
put the link in there so that uh ok so
the link the links a few years old I
think it's from 2009 and it would seem
that since then I mean at least pop
culture wise we've moved into more of a
zombie Fey about the phase arguably
wouldn't you think with like World War Z
and walking dead or is that not how it
works well we seem to be having a big
upsurge in both really lately so I don't
know what are we gonna read party third
party time it just made it just means
we're screwed okay so what is it we're
all gonna die okay Segway complete back
to you hey it means we need about time
to call on bears which we'll get to
later uh but yes okay so in terms of
Halloween stuff though Ghostbusters is
getting a reboot and skinning a reboot
for the ladies so this is a post that
the Bonnie did for us doesn't mean it's
only for ladies oh right all right I'm
sorry starring the ladies and let's see
who I think it is a it's a Paul fig or
fig I'm not sure directed upcoming
reboot and he's that he's the same guy
who did the heat starring most McCarthy
and Sandra Bullock so that might give
you yeah some sense of the tone that
we're talking about here well that the
screenwriter Katie Dippold work gonna
hate Katie Dippold worked on heat i'm
sorry i'm scanning too quickly I thought
um his comments about the technology
were interesting says he's very into
tech and he wants to have new and scary
modern technology for the movie which is
reboot it doesn't take into account the
previous ghostbusting that happened I
always thought the proton packs were
kind of scared
nuclear weapons right on their backs
yeah that is a little bit scary so where
is he planning to go from there I don't
know well hat and how do you update the
you know the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
because I mean now the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man is actually even scary I
mean he's gonna be made all of corn
syrup and he's you know the evil
mastermind behind the obesity epidemic I
mean it's I think it's more layers he is
a stark pup a stay puft marshmallow man
on this one how about the Ronald
McDonald in his new social media
friendly costumes remember that one we
had an article about that yeah yeah
that's me remind us of the horror um
well they were trying to make him hip um
for his new social media look it is a
little frightening it's worth checking
out if you like a scare but uh then knew
Ronald McDonald that slept again for for
a reboot but I wouldn't object to seeing
him what would you like instead of the
marshmallow manner where did you say
you'd prefer to have the marshmallow
again that's an excellent question you
know I think I've got it wide open but
the only thing I want out of this movies
I want to see Kristen Wiig in it that's
my one request this yeah that seems like
a must is this the new Ronald McDonald
oh yeah that's it oh yeah updated
throwback roundel mcdonald but so i'm
curious what are other female crave
casters like are there any other
franchises that you would like to see
you know get a a more uh estrogen heavy
cast in a reboot Three Musketeers oh
that would be good that would be good I
think we have to bring up the
possibility of a female doctor who at
some point well yeah every single time
yeah follow the discussion I'm still
waiting for um okay I completely blank
on your name because I love her so much
and i'm talkings and never mind carry on
but you know she played the female
doctor in Chris of the fatal death you
know I'm talking about oh yes I do know
what you're talking about tremendously
funny wonderful actress yes Oh God okay
somebody yeah pages from water really
fabulous you know Patsy oh I love her
yeah
her but I'm totally with you I mean
we've had a female USS Enterprise there
you go you know I mean we've had some
female starship captains and I mean it
definitely seems about time for a female
doctor I mean it's I mean especially
since the turnover is so high how would
it not be possible well the argument is
that all of those incarnations are
aspects of the essential doctor and that
the essential doctor is simply not
female you know which I mean why
wouldn't that be true we don't know we
don't know Gallifrey I know I have a
feminine side that I get in touch with
and I I would argue that absolutely the
doctor has a as a feminine side as we
all do but we're gonna start to get into
eastern philosophy here really quickly
if we go down this rapid a whole bunch
further so anyway uh yeah I think I
think this is a definitely something to
get excited for it i am interested to
see who is cast in it and I would second
that motion for for Kristen Wiig for
sure and I think Melissa karthi McCarthy
would be great as well so uh but on to
beer specifically your beer out of a
pumpkin and not i'm not talking like the
Seas noble seasonal pumpkin flavored or
pumpkin pumpkin seed too funky yes yeah
no pumpkin spice here whatsoever this is
an actual pumpkin beer keg for halloween
again something that uh Barney wrote up
for us Bonnie fine I was fascinating
crafty things she uh ya know she does a
lot of him herself and then and then
finds other ones as well yet so there's
the the DIY video there um yeah well any
of you guys be trying this this year I
am allergic to beer Oh saddest thing in
the world I'm surprised you didn't die
last month when you went to that all
Brewer town I know I didn't have a
single one as tempting as unlimited line
maritas are ya oh yeah killer sangria
with this pumpkin too oh man can sangria
oh yeah this is a harvest yeah I have a
dumb question is it safe to drink raw
pumpkin
I mean sure oh yeah yeah it's like a
fruit right grows on a vine so I think
that does make it a fruit right yeah has
seeds inside yeah toast the toast the
seeds you're good to go so y'all pass on
this anyone else gonna try it for us I'd
like to I just don't have the time or
the patience to drink the whole keg
describing well we're gonna be busy with
our halloween costumes anyway which
obviously only only Kelsey got in line
today but I know amanda is also working
on her Halloween costume already tosa
one of them one of the main features is
that you're working with their well what
I've been doing is fresh to the past
week i have been wearing some staff to
the future replica shoes this is a
replica of the nike air bag minus all
the nike stuff it's from halloween
costumes calm has an exclusive on it and
doesn't have self-lacing you know the
Power laces don't work but that's okay
it looks it looks correct but the
greatest feature is that they light up
alright that I honest I've been wearing
these grocery shopping more than a band
practice having a hands-on article will
be coming out this weekend so well I'll
describe my my experience wearing these
for whole week the law kind of let you
get a lot of comments from people who
morning I get a lot of side I look in it
try not to stare but it was a surprising
how few people knew where they came from
but when I walked into an apple store
everybody in their new not surprising
but i'll give you full kitchen this
weekend you get a lot of comments from
like a younger like say under 30 folks
who think they're really cool but don't
know what it's from yeah absolutely a
lot of kids would would come up to me
and say oh cool shoes and some of them
had their own light up shoes you know
how they yeah god those uh
just got some from my son their Star
Wars shoes they light up he he i think
he broke him within like two days only
one of the shoe still lights up oh well
okay he's balancing the bouncer sorry
I'm actually wearing Star Wars earring
nice Oh 14 Republic and 14 anyway carry
on what's up with what's on them the
symbols for the Empire and the Republic
I got him up etsy I have time on my
hands so so Amanda are you gonna do a
faux back to the future costume for
Halloween or is that just for the hands
on review well I have a t-shirt a
matching back to the future two t-shirt
that's us probably as far as I'll get I
mean I kind of like to mash up some
Marty McFly costumes from different
across you know like a cowboy half of
the third movie like the puffer vest and
and then the shoes I can be Marty McFly
across time yeah yeah like cotton Oh
cotton across time for a little thing
you could they even have hoverboards now
that's right I got to be kind one
yesterday was crazy yeah well you got to
ride one yeah I got to go to Los Gatos
um ride the hoverboard it was really fun
that really happened I mean what's that
like it was I just felt like I was out
of control cuz there's no inertia or any
you know there's nothing stopping the
board from moving it just keeps going
whatever direction it wants to go so I'd
get on and I just kind of start with
spinning in a circle and then some guy
would have to stop and after a while I
got used to it I could put my foot down
and stop myself and like kind of control
it but you know it takes a lot of
practice for sure but it was fun it was
really cool this is speed yeah well
there was we were in just a very small
little area so we couldn't really go
fast but I would imagine it would go
super fast if you wanted right i mean if
there's no friction slowing it down then
gather that can be the same yeah it's
scary so this this is the one that's
basically it's like the same as a maglev
train right so you actually have to be
over a certain surface and it's you're
like a couple inches off the ground is
that right is it that one yeah they had
a copper floor I'm soon gonna find the
video
should be around here somewhere yeah
they had a copper floor and that's how
the magnet would conduct you know it
would kill damn agentic field it
conducts this energy that builds a
magnetic field under the board so you're
basically floating on a magnetic field
you know it's very weird yeah but um and
then they were a half pipe there too and
there was another guy who could do the
half pipe really well it's really good
at it Wow so uh it was pretty amazing
here of the video was really loud too oh
I see but uh I was thinking about while
amanda was talking about the shoes if I
had the shoes yesterday that would have
ruled yeah but yeah it was fun in a way
nice oh this is where you were yesterday
okay yeah so you see how just once it
starts going in a direction it doesn't
stop you know someone has to stop you or
you have to step off of it fun and it's
that it's just so delightfully misguided
and so dude you guys there's a nice
undershot of it I just thought of
something incredible so so that's all
copper you're telling me yeah and you
can also write it on a on an aluminum
floor you know there's other surfaces
you can write it on but they had a
copper floor others studios so you know
last last month when we were at there
was a tour of the motorola headquarters
in Chicago and some of the other cnet
folks were there and you know they have
in the middle of that building they have
in a big room where they test the radios
and stuff that's entirely copper lined
on all four sides oh wow that would be
like the most incredible hoverboard
arena hell yeah in existence that's what
the guy was talking about to he's
talking about having hoverboard parks
theme parks and roller coasters and
stuff so you know the future is wide
open that's incredible that's
particularly incredible after there was
you know that hoaxes including Doc Brown
took a few months ago that there was a
real overboard but it was a hoax and now
that now it's rio that's awesome Tony
Hawk
yeah they actually mentioned that and
the meeting we got yesterday it was
funny how did they--how did they hoax it
oh here i think i can find the video but
they just they did like a reveal they
did like a reveal video or like here's
the first working hoverboard it was fake
you know but they never say in the video
at all like they never addressed that it
was a fake video they just kind of put
it out there like it was real and may a
lot of people got upset with them yeah
keep the dream alive yeah all right well
so back to you know our crumbling world
on the Halloween theme Amanda you had
this other great post about zombies
since it is that time of year and
particularly just just tell me about
zombie vs bear and then let's have the
conversation alright this is pretty
simple premise the National Wildlife
Federation is doing a series of videos
where they look at various wildlife vs
zombies and the first one is zombies vs
bears and but the basic idea here is
that zombies are walking bags of meat
and bears like eat meat and therefore
grizzly bears brown bears could just
totally go to town just chow down on
these zombies and actually be really
good allies for the surviving humans in
case of Apocalypse Now but do bears eat
rotten me I think that's an issue here
oh I think they'll kind of eat anything
all right I believe that yeah i think
that dope i think they go to town yeah
they're scavengers they go through all
the garbage cans in Tahoe and everything
there's a really scary I want up close
man yeah there's a huge credibly strong
and they have these little eyes and look
at you so who would win actually do we
we get that in there bears so airs okay
yes so having good bear was right now do
they do they clarify Amanda like what
breed of zombie we're talking about here
because you know walking dead zombies
are pretty dumb and immobile but the
world war z zombies were like you know
super athletes on zombies on steroids
into the specifics on the type of
zombies my biggest concern really is if
we're talking a zombie
affection that couldn't potentially
affect bears that would be an incredibly
dangerous situation because we'd have
zomb errors it pretty much mean the end
of humanity right there so we're hoping
that this is not transmissible to to the
bear population topic but I think any
zombie they could catch and bears are
fast you know I've looked up some facts
on grizzly bears and found that their
claws can get up to six inches long and
they can bite through a cast-iron
skillet so I think I think we could kind
of rely on bears to be our buddies in
case of zombie apocalypse do you say
bears can bite through a cast-iron
skillet that's according to National
Geographic a grizzly bear can bite
through a cast-iron skillet and you know
how they found that out somebody tried
to fend off a bear with a cast iron
skillet there's no other nation that's
scary you know what did they do like a
zombie vs safari situation cuz in North
America bears are kind of like it as
scary as a gift and you tend to be able
to get rid of them with a really loud
whistle but like I mean if this were in
Africa then you're dealing with like we
forget zom bears you got zom rhinoceros
isms on potty mrs. and zom Lyons has all
her books like it would be the most
dangerous really well it says that
upcoming episodes will have cool things
like Ravens and flesh-eating beetles
that's gonna be really gross well so
we'll see we also had some other
smithers Ombey news I believe tell me
I'm forgetting which one was yours
Amanda what was some of you talk about
summarize your zombie coverage for is
rather watch with zombies and bears and
then a very interesting thing from Tiger
log cabins which is a zombie proof log
cabin kit costs 113,000 dollars that
includes all premature all the gear
doesn't include installation
flamethrowers or extra but you get a
pretty well thought-out zombie-proof
structure has reinforced slit windows
barbed wire surround 360-degree views
has a microwave and arsenal a garden
area
where you'd be pretty well set for a
walking dead sort of situation if you
had this particular blog cabin kid
actually it's pretty nice inside I
question it says it's only good for ten
years so why why is why is there a 10
year warranty on that yeah there's a
10-year zombie-proof warranty I'm
assuming they're just trying to limit
their liability a lot that happens you
know to a structure to deteriorate over
10 years so I could see what you might
not want to guarantee it past that time
period of course the difficulty of
collecting on that guarantee I'm sure
has occurred everybody they do it a
medical proof of zombie activity if you
want to collect on that guarantee right
and you know in the case of a complete
and total breakdown of society I think
it's a well-known fact that the lawyers
would go first and then the court system
so after ten years what's the point of a
warranty it can't be enforced anyway
it's just logical maybe the last running
water in the nation will be in the
Patent Office the other thing hmm so you
can actually get flame throwers that's
interesting I only learned a year or two
ago that flame throwers were actually
used in the military and our real thing
and not not just invented for games I'm
confessing that that's all right so
another real thing that we've been
talking about a little bit on on crave
is the return of twin peaks I'm jumping
right to this one because I wanted to
get into it because I've never seen twin
peaks and I'm wondering if you guys have
and if you're excited about the notion
that it could be coming back I am
excited because it's david lynch and I
is he gonna be directing than you want
to yes oh my god yeah i mean that's
that's exciting just just that alone I
never watched the original series either
but it seems very odd no I've seen
literally 30 seconds of it they were the
last 30 seconds of the entire series
hello we're gonna TV on Reitman the
thing was happening that's like well so
that's that I'm a huge Twin Peaks
pan I mean i i've watched it multiple
times the whole series i watch fire walk
with me I've got
access guide to the town I have a secret
diary of Laura Palmer I mean I'm so so
excited about this and David Lynch is
signed on to direct was supposed to be a
nine-episode run so just affect alone

just going to shout out to Maikel Franco
for his last song bees of lasers aboard
this California train article um because
of that and talking to Anthony Domenico
another crave contributor I learned that
Minneapolis in Minnesota and general is
the center of paintball expeditions to
shoot zombies they have multiple
different companies running paintball
zombie shooting trips some of them drive
you on in a jeep others you're in the
woods and it's really cheap it's like
ten bucks for an evening of
glow-in-the-dark zombie shooting and
some of them are family-friendly some of
them are not I think that's really an
interesting thing to learn about
Minnesota and I just wanted to show that
with everyone that sounds like fun we
have we have new halloween plans perhaps
road trip time I mean hey I won't meet
