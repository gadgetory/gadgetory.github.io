us thousands of dollars most of us have
something like this
the Whirlpool wrt 5:1 1s ZDF this is an
$1,100 top freezer fridge and stainless
steel it's 21 cubic feet roughly of
storage space 15 of which are in the
fridge that's above average as top
freezers go but it's not the biggest
we've seen that distinction goes to the
king-sized LG top freezer that we
reviewed last December that six cubic
foot freezer section is about as big as
it gets though so if you buy a lot of
frozen dinners and stuff in bulk from
Costco or Sam's Club you might want to
look at this fridge now as far as design
goes this is a pretty boring fridge that
doesn't do much to depart from the
traditional top freezer aesthetic it's
just an old-fashioned plain looking
fridge there's not much going on inside
the fridge either you only really have
this flexi slide bin that moves side to
side under this top shelf to make room
for the items below it works well and
glides smoothly but it's just not that
exciting of a feature and there's
nothing else to get excited about no
water dispenser no spill proof shelves
nothing much of anything in the features
Department what really sets this fridge
apart though is its performance simply
put it's as cold a fridge as we've
tested the default setting test came
down way below where we expect usually
you get a default setting of about 37
degrees
this one averaged out closer to 35 with
a couple of shelves going down below
freezing
including the bottom shelf in the main
body of the fridge it averaged out to 30
point one degrees in our default setting
test and even colder at the coldest
setting where temperatures went down to
the 20s so that's just too cold for my
taste you're gonna have frozen milk
frozen Jews you don't want that now it's
easy enough to dial up from that you
know if your milk freezes just pick it
up a setting and see if that fixes it
but it's still an annoyance you should
be aware of before buying all in all
this is a respectable fridge that airs
on the cold side so if you prefer that
as opposed to a fridge that might run a
degree or two warmer than you'd like
then maybe it's the fridge for you just
don't blame me when your milk freezes
