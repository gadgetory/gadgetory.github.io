and today we're taking a first look at
the Samsung sync master s27
a 850 d-- the Samsung is a 27-inch
monitor aimed at professional graphic
artists with a high full HD resolution
of 2560 by 1440 pixels it's also the
first Samsung monitor to employ the
company's claim line switching panel
technology which offers bright displays
at a lower power consumption cost on the
right side of the back section are two
DVI ports a single display port and the
power adapter port on the left side are
three USB 3.0 downstream ports 1 USB
upstream audio in and a headphone jack
there's also an alcohol light cubby hole
in the back of the panel where the
displays power brick can be concealed
helpful if while mounting the display
the Samsung includes height adjustment a
90 degree pivot 45 left and right swivel
and a 20 degree back tilt the OSD
includes brightness contrast sharpness
RGB color controls six different color
temperature options overdrive gamma
controls and five different presets
there's also an ambient light sensor and
a proximity sensor that allows the
monitor to turn off when no one is in
front of it the Samsung also includes
one of my favorite features the Eco mode
where the amount of power you're saving
is represented by the amount of leaves
on a little cute little tree there in
movies the cinema preset provided the
best overall experience displaying rich
colors and deep blacks games running in
the game preset had a high vibrancy with
colors that popped as well as we've seen
on any monitor before it while it
doesn't offer as many customization
options for graphics artists as a few
other program on others do the Samsung's
options should more than satisfy most
users for ergonomic support a USB 3.0
hub and an overall stylish but
thoughtful design makes it a great
choice for those looking for a pro
monitor that offers more than most at
$900 as Samsung offers more than enough
to make it a great investment
once again this is Eric Franklin and
this has been a first look at the
Samsung sync master s 27a
