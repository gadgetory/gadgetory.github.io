copy text 2015 in Taiwan and we are
looking at a nice kit from transcend
called the jet drive this has been
available for a little while but you
might not have heard about it if you've
ever been scared of the idea of
upgrading the SSD in your MacBook Air or
MacBook Pro then this kit is exactly
what you've been looking for it lets you
upgrade the internal SSD but it also
gives you a nice external kit to
actually put your old drive into a that
means it makes it very easy to bring
across all your old information into
your new system and B it lets you then
clear that storage and score a free
extra external drive out of the whole
deal so it's a really nice little kit
and it's called the jet drive it's
available on Amazon for say a couple
hundred dollars for a low end model
through right up to 960 gig storage
options another nice item that they have
here the transcend booth is the jet
drive light so this is basically a way
to have a SD card that just sits in
flush against the wall of your macbook
in the SD card slot and that comes in
128 gig or 256 gig options to just give
you a nice second drive that you can
just leave in that slot permanently and
you don't even notice it's there I think
a lot of people don't really use their
SD card slot very much for all the rest
of our coverage of Computex make sure to
check in at c-- Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
