are at Sprint's exclusive launch event
for the brand new HTC One m8 Harman
Kardon edition smartphone so what makes
the HTC One m8 hardened hardened edition
so special well basically it has
heavy-duty audio processing that's
provided by harman kardon a leader in
audio technology and what you get with
that is the clarify music enhancement
technology which brings richness and
depth to audio tracks it will also use a
live stage audio processing technology
to create a virtual sound stage that is
closer to you when you're using
headphones so it sounds like you're at a
performance also it has the really
powerful stereo speakers on either side
of the screen and unlike other versions
of the m8 this Harman Kardon edition has
a a very smooth black finish and it has
these champagne gold highlights above
the button below the screen here but one
thing I don't you like about this is
that it's a little bit a little greasy
here is it's very slippery has a
slippery feel that feels a lot like the
standard brushed metal version of the m8
but it doesn't have the sort of nice
gunmetal kind of brushed finish that
those phones have but all in all it's
very handsome device so another nice
little perk that comes with the HTC One
m8 Harman Kardon edition is six months
three of Spotify music service and the
app is already pre-loaded on the phone
so you don't the worry about downloading
it you also get a set of premium stereo
headphones their earbud style they're
very nice-looking they have metal finish
that's designed to match the goal
finish of the HTC One m8 the HTC One m8
Carmen cart edition goes on sale online
on am a second you can also find it in
sprint stores on May seventh there you
have the folks just took a first look at
the HTC One m8 Harman Kardon edition I'm
Brian Bennett for Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
