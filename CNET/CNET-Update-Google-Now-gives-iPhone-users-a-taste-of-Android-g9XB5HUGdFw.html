taste of Android I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update one of the
killer features of Android can now be
found on Apple devices it's called
google now and it's part of the Google
Search app in itunes google now is a
service that aims to be your personal
assistant using location it learns about
your daily commute and alerts you to
traffic issues on the way home or it
could tell you the best way to get to
the next appointment on your Google
Calendar it also keeps track of your
flights and other interests such as the
sports teams you follow there's lotsa
can notify you about but for Apple users
you have to keep going into the Google
Search app to get use out of it unlike
Android wear notifications pop up
there's also a voice search option
similar to asking Apple Syria question
so you can ask Google now if you need a
jacket today or where's the nearest
Italian restaurant it'll be interesting
to see how many Apple users flock to
using google now although Google will
grow its user base by offering it to
apple devices it also means that google
now is no longer an exclusive feature
for Android it also could upset long
time Android users since a majority of
Android phones still can't try it only
android phones with the latest 4.1 jelly
bean operating system can use Google now
apps have become the more popular way to
text on a phone there are more people
sending instant messages using a special
smartphone chat app rather than sending
a text message to standard way through
SMS on the phone the Financial Times
commissioned a report by research firm
informa which found that more people
we're using popular chat apps such as
what's at blackberry messenger an apples
iMessage in total these apps sent and
received about 19 billion messages a day
compared to only seventeen point six
billion SMS text messages and that study
didn't even count people who use
Facebook to send messages for some users
sending a message over an app is better
because it doesn't count against text
message juice and using a messaging app
can let you send more than just a text
take for example the app couple it's a
private chef for two people in love and
aside from typing you can send drawings
audio messages and even maps of your
location also using an
to text or video chat is a way to
connect on the cheap to your
international friends you may have seen
small businesses use the square credit
card swiper to process transactions
through phones or tablets but you could
start seeing more quick service
restaurants using square the square
register service app has been updated to
help restaurant managers with new tools
that can make notes if a customer wants
a special order and it can be printed
out on a ticket sent to the kitchen
that's your tech news update you'll find
more details on these stories at cnet
