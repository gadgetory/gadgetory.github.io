Samsung Galaxy s5 now Samsung has put
some interesting new hardware onto its
fifth Galaxy S smartphone that's a
fingerprint scanner on the front and a
heart rate monitor on the back we're
going to take a closer look at these two
new bits of tech let's start with the
fingerprint scanner now obviously
there's one of these already on the
iPhone 5s but there's some applications
here that you don't get on an Apple
phone apart from using this fingerprint
scanner to make payments you can also
use it to restrict access to certain
files on the phone using a application
called private mode when private mode is
activated you can go through and select
photos music particular media files and
you can tag them as only being
accessible in private mode and that
means they won't be viewable unless you
give that fingerprint swipe in our
testing we found the scanner didn't
always work and sometimes we had to try
two or three times before it would
recognize our print maybe it'll just
take some getting used to
next up what about that heart rate
scanner well Samsung wants you to use
this to track your exercise now the way
it works is it shines a red light
through your finger and that actually
measures your pulse so it knows how fast
your heart is beating it works in
conjunction with Samsung's s health app
if I fire this up you can see it's
telling me to place my finger on the
sensor and it gives me my heart rate in
BPM if you want you can see your
progress on a graph like this now at the
moment it seems this only really works
with s health but I'm wondering if other
apps could start to use it in the future
the fingerprint scanner and the heart
rate monitor are the two most
interesting bits of new hardware on the
galaxy s5 but are they enough to tempt
you to buy why don't you let us know I'm
