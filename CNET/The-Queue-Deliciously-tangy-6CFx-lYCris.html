speech and icon search engine and just
how does Lindsay's alcohol bracelet work
find out in the queue hey there hope
your day is going well I'm rich demuro
with Cena TV and you found your way into
the queue congratulations let's get you
started with your must click moment
could this video decide the future of
fair use and free speech the mom who
took it hope so she's suing Universal
after they asked YouTube to take it down
that's because in addition to this
dancing toddler there's a prince song
playing in the background of the
30-second home video the mom alleging
copyright abuse by the music giant
what's next no leaving voicemails with
the radio on in the background no taking
pictures at a sports bar with the game
visible on the big screen no ripping
movies from Netflix putting them on your
iPod and sending the disc back well
alright let's do something fun how about
a quick quiz mobile web browsing is
gaining popularity but what's the number
one thing Americans are looking up is it
news maps sports scores or whether take
a second if you said whether that's
right according to M metrics weather is
tops for info on the go over in Europe
it must be the soccer tops there is
sports info you can't escape the lindsay
lohan news these days but I'm still
shocked to learn there's an ankle
bracelet that can monitor how much booze
is in your body inquiring minds want to
know more it's called a secure
continuous remote alcohol monitor or
scram it contains a sensor pack that
randomly tests vapors from the skin for
alcohol results are then time-stamped
and stored in memory then transmit it to
a base station modem you keep in your
house results are sliced and diced put
in charts and sent to whoever's checking
up of course tampering with any part of
the process sends out a red flag and now
you know on to our beta when I was
looking for an RSS icon from our website
I tried looking everywhere for a good
source file but couldn't find one with
icon finder you'll never have to steal
from someone else's website again the
search engine for icons makes it easy to
find little symbols for just about
everything search for folders mail
arrows and feed icons or take a look at
the cloud for some inspiration and
popular picks the icon images are in PNG
format which means the pixels can be
see-through and your background colors
can shine right through it all finally
who can resist the story this sweet you
know viral video is the name of the game
and Wonka wants their fair share that's
why they've released this surveillance
video of their newest candy creations
being stolen in a wonka factory heist a
corresponding website and blog will help
super sleuths track down the
those responsible and nabbing some
sugary samples of sweet tarts rope and
shocker squeeze in the process some
companies will do anything to get in the
cube but the sweet tarts rope definitely
an interesting journey for your mouth
it's kind of like a gooey candy-filled
twizzler with some crunchy nerds thrown
in your dentist would approve I'm rich
Demuro would seen a TV in New York City
time for me get a sugar rush goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
