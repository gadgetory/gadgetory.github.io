I like the pod and I'm here with ayahs
and been for the 359 podcast episode 216
I like the cast great intro but ones
that I really like your intro from 420
you just like slid it in there if you
like hey everybody its podcast 420 go
waste like okay not past tense present
right of course so what we talking about
on the podcast today so today we're
gonna talk about the future of
Transportation in many different ways
all of them google related one of them
is way mo which is part of Google's
parent company alphabet they're
introducing self-driving cars to the
public in Phoenix Arizona and also we'll
talk about Kitty Hawk which is Larry
page's flying car cons one of two one of
two lion car companies he's got
apparently and then we'll round it off
with Spotify potentially coming out with
some new hardware that they're hoping is
category defining so that's pretty high
up there it could be the next likes this
table is Spotify enabled yes sorry I
would I would buy that is my name on
table yeah so then cable and fables hold
it are you ready for me then labels send
in your questions and comments Brian
we'll get to them or as many of them as
you can at the end of the show and let's
get podcasting and maples alright here
we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I
as the wolf actor self-driving cars are
here well sort of wham-o a part of
Google's parent alphabet is opening up
its pilot autonomous cars program in
Phoenix Arizona looking to get hundreds
of people to test out its self-driving
Chrysler minivans and Lexus SUVs is if
you were in Phoenix would you go for
this well yeah there's the other thing
is this is first it's free so if you
actually get accepted into the program
you can take this as much as you want
and it's not like like a ride hailing
service they actually want to be working
with people so they can see what their
patterns are like so they can figure out
what is the future for self-driving cars
and they're saying that this area's
about this about twice the size of San
Francisco so it's gonna be pretty
interesting interesting to see how that
pans out right you're not gonna be able
to take these cars cross-country or
anything right no I don't they're gonna
keep them in the Phoenix area for the
interim but at the same time it sounds
really interesting that we're actually
getting to the point where the future of
self-driving cars as I said they're
actually doing it it's possible which to
me sounds really interesting but at the
same time how likely do you think that
this is gonna be that this is gonna
expand out from Phoenix and really
arrive in a lot of other places well one
of the cool things about this test being
in Arizona I was looking at their blog
post about is that Arizona doesn't
require an actual person behind the
wheel for these self-driving tests now
way most cars will have a person behind
the wheel just in case anything goes
wrong
but that allows it to move much faster
so they can actually see and test I
would imagine in the future you will see
way no cars without an actual person in
the vehicle as to the driver right so
you're not gonna have like a but at this
point you are gonna have something right
now he's sitting over there
well I wanted to throw out there to that
uber is another company that is testing
out this idea but you know because they
always work in this like legally murky
gray area they were kicked out of what
was at San Francisco they tried to do it
in Phoenix so at this point if you're
really interested in getting behind the
wheel of a self-driving car or in a
self-driving car you're more likely to
do it through way mo I would think it's
two totally different approaches way mo
trying to license that technology to
other ride-hailing companies and uber is
just trying to do it on their own yeah
yeah
next up also in more Google related
transportation news the company
Hawke is showing off a quote flying car
it's actually more like a one person
sized drone with pontoon Landers for
water but hey that's pretty cool right
in the demo video it's like some lady
saying hey you should meet us at the
boat and I can get there really fast how
so she gets on this one looks like that
that speeder bike
Star Wars was like a net underneath her
and she gets up and she was flying it
looks really cool they're claiming you
won't need a pilot's license for it
although the videos they're showing off
they're saying look the one that comes
out when this does come out will not
look like this this is a prototype this
is never coming out look do you think
that people are actually gonna use this
kind of thing I have no idea how much
it's gonna cost we were just talking
about self-driving cars which people are
just starting to get behind and starting
to understand flying cars well this is
more like a flying jetski if anything
because I'm saying you can only use this
over water you're not supposed to use
this over land because that's how this
is supposed to be although you know sure
people are gonna mess with that a little
bit they should Morgan cities but it
really depends on the price I really
think yeah I mean I'm still skeptical
but we'll see
last Spotify is reportedly working on a
new piece of hardware for music and
podcast listening that it hopes will be
quote category defining like the Amazon
echo and snapchat spectacles you excited
about this you know getting Spotify on a
portable device not so easy so I'm
hoping it's something like that there
was that rumored and that rumored pebble
said they were coming up with a modify
enabled core where I was like excited
about that but that never came to be
yeah at the same time yeah Spotify
doesn't really develop a lot of hardware
so I'm curious to see what exactly could
be category defining from them but good
for them for making an effort
I mean earbud they can also using your
nose yeah that could definitely be an
idea anyway if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNET
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I as well factor
thanks for listening
I'm personally interested in the Spotify
aspect I know a lot of people probably
want to talk about flying car
quote-unquote throat is throw it out
there bvj I mean give me more better
platforms like I I'm addicted to the
Spotify model just because it's a decent
fidelity as a bit of an audiophile but
not the most stringent audiophile so as
far as like keeping and collecting my
music it's more convenient if it was in
fact that might that would be the one
thing to get me to wear a SmartWatch
otherwise I have almost zero interest
but if I can quick interface because I'm
always out and about on the go my
earphones you you would want something
that's like a dedicated Spotify wearable
as opposed to like because you always
have you already have your phone on you
right so they convincing in and out of
my phone and I like to change things and
okay that's fall so there is a value for
you if you were gonna have something
dedicated yeah that's interesting you
can kind of do it with Android wear it's
kind of rudimentary you can have play
pause controls you can and you can move
things around with that and it's not
exactly great my knee means because it's
just this really crappy extension of
this if it's a moment thing like an iPod
shuffle style thing that's what the
court was supposed to be this little
device you can take with you without
having to take your phone that to me is
actually a bigger deal like me do other
stuff not worrying about this device
because of phone especially what we're
seeing now they're getting more and more
fragile I don't want to be dropping this
thing if I'm working out or something
that's a good point I like having a
separate ipod mp3 player of any sort I
still have an old iPod Nano somewhere
just to hang out and be that things like
like I'm traveling I'm not gonna have
easy access to an electrical or I won't
want to like murder my phone battery
listening to stuff but I also don't want
to be bored that's alright it'll be a
category defining battery case for your
phone that is a Spotify player I'm down
there you go I guess so I mean the thing
is too is that it's probably not gonna
be the same thing as an iPod Nano
because the iPod Nano already came out
that's not category defining if they
just came out with like an iPod Nano
with like a wristband attached you could
have bought that like what seven years
ago you know we have been looking for a
killer reason to have a SmartWatch and
there hasn't been a single thing yet
maybe this is it maybe not I'm not sure
yet but when it comes to like speakers
it can't be a smart speaker because of
the echo and the Google home you can
make Spotify the default music player
for that so it's gonna be it's got to be
some
thing it can't be glasses you're
definitely a head scratcher it's
interesting they've definitely like
elevated it to a point where they want
it when they say something like category
defining it definitely gets me very
curious as far as like what type of
hardware that might look like but we
really don't know a lot yet about it
or when it will come out shall we
speculate besides the table where this
could occur yeah it could be a involved
it could be smart earbuds you know I've
seen I've seen those ridiculous ones
that you guys should stick you know
iPods in them and I've seen other ones
that have built-in storage but why not a
Spotify enabled pair of headphones
because that's all you would need and
yeah it could work with your phone so it
doesn't kill the battery all the time
but you could also offload your playlist
to that that I think actually would make
sense because that doesn't exist well in
the real broad sense yet if that fits in
my mind that fits much better than
potentially you know glasses which like
I don't know why you would have Spotify
glasses I don't know how you would be
able to listen with them so bone
conduction bone conduction sure course
yeah tell that to snapchat
anyways other benefits to this is
depending on how much store take could
cram into something I like the idea of
dedicated earphones that are just like
this is my music player right on how
much storage do you think it could
actually hold probably more than you
think yeah I mean like we've really
moved very very far as far as storage is
concerned so you you could store quite a
bit of your library in many earphones
these days and Danny Green our friend
Danny Green in the chat points out that
he still got an iPod in his car with
over 5,000 tunes on it because he does
want to pay for dad cuz that that would
be what I knew is I would just cash a
ton of stuff onto that thing just to
have it at a moment's notice instead of
actually going up and down the data
stream let's not wait for Spotify to
come out with something let's just make
this thing right now Danny are you on
board you want to be our investor where
would you like to see a dedicated music
platform calling out to the chat what
device do you think if it's a wearable
if it's of this or that or the other
thing where do you think would be
valuable what it was like a backpack and
it's like a terabyte hard drive in the
chair oh my god I would love to see that
come out audiophile
Spotify back oh god a filing cabinet the
audiophile
hold on I thought we were gonna talk
about self-driving car but people want
to listen to music like yeah you're not
gonna how many people are in Phoenix oh
maybe they're just like I'm nine the
greater Phoenix area screw that right
let's talk about spies are all weird
with that we have everyone listens to
music and Spotify I mean I pay for
google play music and the reason why is
because you can have your music on there
yeah uploaded stuff so stuff doesn't
disappear if spot if I added that
feature other than that local playback
stuff I'd be all over that I'm moving
back to that I really like to Spotify
experience it's right full disclosure I
don't really listen to Spotify that much
I actually still do a lot of digital
downloads like I'll download a song and
then listen to it like ad nauseam for
weeks and weeks and weeks and they'll
stream a song yeah so I don't really
like I don't use the streaming music
services as much I mean like I listen to
chance the rapper on soundcloud but like
partly because I have to like I would
have paid him outright if he just let me
I got a point out something important to
somebody in the chat - best of all
universe you can't just say unsubscribe
out loud and hope that it works out you
actually have to click the unsubscribe
button it's not like that episode of the
office network where Michael just
screams bankruptcy thank you
thank you for coming listening anyways
yeah you know that's that's nice we
expect you to come back tomorrow and say
unsubscribe to subscribe then
unsubscribe just do that over and over
and over right we have a viewer listener
in Phoenix DJ Rodgers we hope they like
come back and keep us posted as to the
the white mode developments as high as
they come along apply to the pilot
program rides are free so like that's
still a really big deal you're not
paying for gas you're not paying for the
driver and you can do pretty much what
you want so this was one point that I
really wanted to make in the podcast but
it's only four minutes so I didn't have
enough time but we often talk about
self-driving cars and don't really
mention much about the potential
negatives so Christopher Mims who's a
columnist tech columnist for The Wall
Street Journal I think does a really
good job of trying to remind people that
like wow this is like so gee whiz it's
really interesting this could save lives
with like reducing accidents but at the
same time we really do have to like ask
a lot of really big questions as far as
like do we want this
what's the insurance implications what's
going to happen or like truck drivers
what's going to happen attacks
drivers is the type of thing where you
can't just say you know objectively this
is gonna be good this is gonna be
perfect you know so I just wanted to
like throw that out there I don't know
what folks in the chat think about that
but I think it's good to like at least
consider some of the negatives yeah I
mean when Moe claims if they've driven
or self driven over 2.5 bill a million
miles that is and if simulations have
done about a billion in 2016 so the
thing is there's a lot of testing going
on and don't forget about the idea of a
of liability on the drivers side and
people in like real society but these
companies are going to be dealing with
the tons of lawsuits if their technology
fails right so I think that their
interests are aligned with you know the
good of society because if one a most
tech is licensed to Volvo and GM and
whoever and other ride-hailing services
and it fails like they're dead in the
water so I would think that we're seeing
a maturity level in this technology
that's gonna be not as scary I think as
people think it might be right i I also
wonder like what exactly is the business
model as far as like who owns the car is
it all gonna be ride hailing services
that you're gonna like hail for a ride
to get to work every single day or are
you gonna own the self-driving car
there's still a lot of those questions
to be answered pal early on in the chat
asked and I'm not really sure what the
context of this is they say so people
would share their cars and they would
almost never stand still is that kind of
the premise like they would kind of cars
themselves justify usage that it would
almost never be a parked vehicle it'd be
well with the way Moe trial in Phoenix
those are definitely like community cars
sure right so almost a zip cars right
exactly and I still don't know exactly
like how you hailed a car I'm guessing
you do it through like a phone app or
something like that and then it shows up
you know fairly quickly
I would hope like they're gonna have
enough cars on the road to serve like
hundreds of different people but at the
same time you could assume that like I
don't know people that are really
wealthy you might not want to share
their cars or they want might want
flashy or self-driving cars so they
might own those it's hard to say really
what exactly the models gonna be like I
say you want to customize your own car
and its self-driving could be a feature
that you don't always take advantage of
but if you wanted to you could that kind
of thing I don't see it being either/or
like you can't take over
the vehicle because there's always gonna
be a way to do that I'd imagine because
maybe sure yes I pictured this horrible
thing airplane they go be a social
network that develops from this that's
kind of like Foursquare where somebody's
like the mayor of the car they use it
enough you think that's possible in a
car you don't be in a shared car that
reeks of you know somebody else's
perfume or something or you want to have
a customization in a badge right or they
perfume or they spilled their beer in
the car or something right like that's
the issue one of reasons it's like no
other just like every other taxi or
shared car you want to make sure that
it's it's clean and neat and everything
well eventually the things gonna have to
go back to the garage or dock or
whatever it is it was gonna be some kind
of maintenance crew keeping these things
up they don't look it's a car it doesn't
last forever right I was gonna have to
do general mechanical maintenance
internal cleaning etc etc etc going back
to your point though is I was always
under the assumption that eventually
regular like human driving would
eventually be found to be so dangerous
that it would be determined to be
illegal like we would look back as old
men and be like I can't believe we drove
our own cars like now it's like
completely illegal you're never allowed
to do it when I was your age I had to
put my foot on a pedal right I'm like
that's what I always thought was miles
in the snow
like decades from now they eventually
would be creating cars that don't have
steering wheels don't have pedals don't
have gear shifts like it's just it's
just a box you know you go inside well
I'm thinking you think I'm like a train
that you just step into this thing
they're all in a line and move about 50
miles per hour I don't see that happen
there's another some kind of take over
sure but there's I mean we've been
talking about wood tech enable than
everything how fantastic some of these
developments only for the
differently-abled like you in the chat
he says he's in the UK and he's nearly
blind and this would be a huge help out
to his daily life absolutely absolutely
the idea of letting people or or
enabling people to be able to get around
much much more easily as far as that's
concerned I think that could be really
huge and very helpful for folks now we
didn't have time to mention in the
podcast but their fleet of cars is like
100 100 Chrysler Pacifica's they were
adding 500 more yeah that they announced
that really quietly like I'm one line in
their blog post about oh by the way
we're adding 500 more cars so that's
gonna be what
means that like valuable ooh I'm
assuming from reading that too that
there is substantial demand like they
probably got way more applications than
maybe they expected because there
they're not going from a hundred to two
hundred they're going from like a
hundred to roughly six hundred right so
that means that there's like pent-up
demand to like actually test out the
service and maybe people are you know at
least people in Phoenix are really you
know they believe in the idea they trust
the technology I really think the use
cases that's really what what way mo is
gonna say Google what a mole really
wants to knows like how are people
really using this it's one thing if
there's taxis and you're just going from
one spot to the next I mean whatever but
if it's somebody's regular everyday life
that's why in the video and in there and
their application page they showed like
real people and families and how they're
gonna be using it that's I think
information we don't have yet really why
like why would I have one just because
like I don't I don't want to get up
early the easy answer is lazy yeah the
easy answer is well but their
technology's so lazy besides for the
differently-abled maybe some others in
the chat have an idea how this could be
beneficial to them and a day to day life
you know and speaking of testing calling
out to DJ Rogers and anybody else we
know in the Phoenix area if you're
getting first-hand experience with this
we'd love to hear about it Oh totally
awesome join us on the join us on the
show in the chat tweet at us we'd love
to hear just email me Ben dot Ruben at
cbs.com yeah I'd love to hear from
anybody in the Phoenix area about what
this is like we don't have any regulars
Cena editors out there so if anybody's
got like a positive or negative
experience with how this is all playing
out we just love to hear what you got
wanted to throw this out there too as
far as like you have a kid I have kids
how old do the kids have to be to ride
in the car yeah by themselves so there's
just like another interesting nuance I
mean like my daughter is going to enough
to end on a smartphone I suppose I guess
my daughter's going to kindergarten next
year so she's gonna take the bus by
herself to school with the same dolt
is it right with the bus driver and
going to school but is it the same
concept so this is another one of those
like nuances that like technology is now
getting to the point where you have to
you know reconsider what's normal for
like regular Society do you think that's
weird no I just think of the news tours
like you like would you track your tile
with this robot
there's a tablet on has been hacked your
child who have never been safe again and
loved the plot find out it's like that's
what my head is screaming if they'd if
they designed a robot to look cute and
kind that's what they've been trying to
do as parents would you trust a robo bus
oh great question depends how long has
it been an operation
fair enough you want to make sure that
it's a it's been really I mean I can't
imagine them not doing a thorough test a
it's been like five years do they have
an emergency driver sit in there I would
hope so yeah so they don't want it we
don't want our kids being the first ones
I guess that they don't have my kids do
not have the right stuff okay like I'm
not I'm not like having them be like the
guinea pigs for something like that need
somebody stop them from messing with any
of the controls stay back
Lord of the Flies we're going to Mexico
all right deploys airbag I just love
this line from J Smith in the Chad cuz
ya mess around miss a car payment the
damn thing will drive itself back to the
bank
totally true love that oh my god it's
very good point
swinging back over to the Spotify a
topic real quick before we call today
because we're going way long today this
is great
imagine soggy points out you know who
really buys tech anymore for just a unit
Oscar you know just one thing now the
trend is for a piece of tech to have
multiple issues with your phone is your
camera is your video camera or iTunes
player is your GPS is your music player
is your everything would you like to
have a unit a score like that hey guys
when the headphones would they put other
stuff in there would it interface like a
wooded naturally Bluetooth with the
phone so they could take a call on it at
the same time like any normal bluetooth
headphone but still just be that
separate storage unit for the music and
I think that if and again this is all
like rumor and speculation but I think
that if Spotify were creating it and
they were smart about it they they
wouldn't make it a unit ask a piece of
hardware they would have like Spotify be
the core of it it would be like the the
main reason for it existing but adding
little additional apps or features into
it probably wouldn't be that complicated
or difficult and those are all
value-adds
if this only did Spotify then it really
would be pretty hard to justify I don't
know like how much would you pay for
that like 50 bucks if it's 50 bucks you
know only does one thing okay maybe I
think I'm Spotify is getting into the
hardware game they shouldn't overload
this thing with features because if it's
just another smartphone it's just
another smartphone yeah and we already
have smartphones already have these bad
watches and we have these lousy other
products a lot of people aren't buying
unit a Spurs but Spotify is in so many
different devices already there spot if
I was to come out with hardware it would
make a lot more sense that it was very
singular focused of yeah there are
headphones they have Spotify offline or
it comes with premium imagine that like
oh by the way you buy your headphones
you got premium for a year mmm two years
okay good idea
they give you a reason why would you do
this same thing with the the echo if you
the echo you can get Amazon Prime music
for like five dollars per month if you
just have read I think it's because it's
less than five yeah like nothing as long
as long as it's just the loft ooh that's
a cheap ring not much only on that
speaker you can't yes but whatever I
would think yeah
not other thing a lot of people will go
out and go this is gonna be the end of
it that's why still thinks it's probably
the headphones that makes the most sense
you're gonna buy them anyway everyone
needs headphones so or I modify branded
speaker in your house that would be
pretty yeah my sticker to put on any
speaker you have before it's pretty hard
to stand out as a speaker that's they're
probably defining stickers sir I'm gonna
butcher this name sir hacked kick in the
chat says I definitely need a device
it's not category defining the category
merging instead something like Apple
watch iPod Nano ah but music still don't
use don't like using the phone to listen
to music these are all very good
comments by the way yeah I like a lot of
the analysis it's getting thrown out
there so very good point and then one
more time back around the horn
Jacob craf asks how will do children
have to be to ride alone on an airplane
I went back to riding alone and a robo
car I don't know yeah I haven't children
thing I think it's like eight to ten but
that's because the maze isn't that high
I believe I could have swore there was
something like you could as long as
there's a like documented parental
permission and like they've recruited
flight staff to assists a child maybe
it's almost any age that the
you know more than a potato however
there's no flight staff in that car so
there's no there's no professional it's
okay right people in the flying cars but
there's AI spective just a long sigh by
the water you okay Marie okay I don't
know why kids names Marie it's coming
back to very popular name mmm
and then one last really good comment
from fully daily value to me with
self-driving car the time of my commute
becomes my time instead of my driving
time I can browse a web sleep more get
an early start in the office work etc
that's what I do my train ride
yeah self-driving we're spoiled because
we take the public transit where we
don't have to pay as much attention
granted try to pay some attention as you
can maybe learn the hard way in the New
York subway system but the point remains
yeah the idea of just having that amount
of time back because we don't there are
people out there they have our two-hour
long commute as they drive and that's
you know as someone who misses my car
because I live in New York now driving
around can be a very enjoyable
experience but I'd imagine is it not in
New York driving can be cathartic but
having to do what every single day would
get oh yes I'm riding a horse like yeah
you don't have to do that every freaking
day anymore but you just go do it for
fun yeah it's fine okay getting so mad I
like this car but Philippe also says
soccer moms can get a life again yes but
then what would we call them we would
have to give them a new name they're
still going to soccer practice no no you
just send the kid to soccer I'm going to
the mall just all mama mama yeah and on
the note to finish it off with a perfect
