i'm here with ayahs and ben for the 359
podcast episode 2 16 I like the cast
great intro what was that I really liked
your intro from 420 you just like slid
it in there they like hey everybody its
podcast 420 get waste like okay not past
tense represent right of course so what
are you talking about on the podcast
today so today we're going to talk about
the future of transportation in many
different ways all of them Google
related one of them is way mo which is
part of Google's parent company alphabet
they're introducing self-driving cars to
the public in Phoenix Arizona and also
we'll talk about kitty hawk which is
Larry page's flying car cuts one of two
one of two lion card companies he's got
apparently and then we'll round it off
with Spotify potentially coming out with
some new hardware that they're hoping is
category defining so that's pretty high
up there could be the next likes this
table is spotify enabled yes let's take
sorry i would i would buy that is not my
name on table yeah so then cable and
fables hold it are you ready for me then
labels let's send in your questions and
comments brian will get to them or as
many of them as you can at the end of
the show and let's get podcasting and
maples alright here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin am
I as the wolf actor self-driving cars
are here well sort of way mo a part of
Google's parent alphabet is opening up
its pilot autonomous cars program in
Phoenix Arizona looking to get hundreds
of people to test out its self-driving
chrysler mini vans and Lexus SUVs is if
you were in Phoenix would you go for
this well yeah this is the other thing
is this is first it's free so if you
actually get accepted into the program
you can take this as much as you want
and it's not like like a ride hailing
service they actually want to be working
with people so they can see what their
patterns are like so they can figure out
what is the future for self-driving cars
and they're saying that this area's
about this about twice the size of San
Francisco so it's going to be pretty
interesting interesting to see how this
pans out right you're not going to be
able to take these cars cross country or
anything right no no i don't to keep
them in the Phoenix area for the interim
but at the same time it sounds really
interesting that we're actually getting
to the point where the future of
self-driving cars as I said they're
actually doing it it's possible which to
me sounds really interesting but at the
same time how likely do you think that
this is going to be that this is going
to expand out from Phoenix and really
arrived in a lot of other places one of
the cool things about this test being in
Arizona is looking at their blog post
about is that Arizona doesn't require an
actual person behind the wheel for these
self driving tests now way most cars
will have a person behind the wheel just
in case anything goes wrong but that
allows it to move much faster so they
can actually see and test I would
imagine in the future you will see way
mo cars without an actual person in the
vehicle as the driver right so you're
not going to have like a but at this
point you are going to have something
right now he's sitting over there I
wanted to throw out there to that uber
is another company that is testing out
this idea but you know because they
always work in this like legally marquis
gray area they were kicked out of what
was at San Francisco they tried to do it
in Phoenix so at this point if you're
really interested in getting behind the
wheel of a self-driving car or in the
self-driving car you're more likely to
do it through way mo I would think it's
two totally different approaches way mo
trying to license the technology to
other ride hailing companies and uber is
just trying to do it on their own yeah
yeah next up also in more Google related
transportation news the company
Hawk is showing off a quote flying car
it's actually more like a one-person
sighs drone with pontoon landers for
water but hey that's pretty cool right
in the demo video it's like some ladies
saying hey you should meet us at the
boat and I can get there really fast how
so she gets on this one looks like that
that speeder bike Star Wars was like a
net underneath her and she gets up and
she was flying it looks really cool
they're claiming you won't need a
pilot's license for it although the
videos they're showing off their saying
look the one that comes out when this
does come out will not look like this
this is a prototype this is never coming
out look do you think that people are
actually going to use this kind of thing
I have no idea how much is going to cost
and we're just talking about
self-driving cars which people are just
starting to get behind and starting to
understand flying cars well this is more
like a flying jet ski if anything
because I'm saying you can only use this
over water you're not supposed to use
this over land that's how this is
supposed to be although you know sure
people are going to mess with that a
little bit they should northern cities
but it really depends on the price I
really think yeah I mean I'm still
skeptical but we'll see last Spotify is
reportedly working on a new piece of
hardware for music and podcasts
listening that it hopes will be quote
category defining like the Amazon echo
and snapchat spectacles you excited
about this you know getting Spotify on a
portable device not so easy so I'm
hoping it's something like that there
was that rumored that rumored pebble
said they were coming up with a lot if I
enable court where I was like excited
about that but that never came to be
yeah I at the same time yeah Spotify
doesn't really develop a lot of hardware
so I'm curious to see what exactly could
be category defining from them but good
for them for making an effort I mean ear
but they can also use your nose yeah
that could definitely be an idea anyway
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on cnet i'm ben fox
rubin I as well factor thanks for
listening
I'm personally interested in the Spotify
aspect I know a lot of people probably
want to talk about flying car quote
unquote throat is throw it out there bvg
I mean give me more better platforms
like I'm addicted to the Spotify model
just because it's a decent fidelity as a
bit of an audio file but not the most
stringent audio file so as far as like
keeping and collecting my music it's
more convenient if it was in fact that
might that would be the one thing to get
me to wear a SmartWatch otherwise I have
almost zero interest but if I can quick
interface because I'm always out and
about on the go my earphones you you
would want something that's like a
dedicated Spotify wearable as opposed to
like because you always have you already
have your phone on you so I convincing
in and out of my phone and I like to
change things okay that's fall so there
is a value for you if you were gonna
have something dedicated yeah that's
interesting you can kind of do it with
Android wear is kind of rudimentary you
can have play pause controls you can and
you can move things around with that and
it's not exactly great by any means
because it's just this really crappy
extension of this if it's a moment thing
like an iPod shuffle style thing that's
what the core was supposed to be this
little device you can take with you
without having to take your phone that
to me is actually a bigger deal like me
do other stuff not worrying about this
device because of phone especially what
we're seeing now they're getting more
more fragile I don't want to be dropping
this thing if I'm working out or
something that's a good point I like
having a separate ipod mp3 player of any
sort I still have an old ipod nano
somewhere just to hang out and be that
things like like i'm traveling i'm not
going to have easy access to an
electrical or i won't want to like
murder my phone battery listening to
stuff but i also don't want to be bored
that's all right it'll be a category
defining battery case for your phone
that is a spotify player i'm down there
you go I guess so I mean the thing is
too is that it's probably not going to
be the same thing as an ipod nano
because the ipod nano already came out
that's not category defining if they
just came out with like an ipod nano
with like a wristband attached you could
have bought that like what seven years
ago you know we have been looking for a
killer reason to have a SmartWatch and
there hasn't been a single thing yet
maybe this is it maybe not not sure yet
but when it comes to like speakers it
can't be a smart speaker because of the
echo and the Google home you can make
Spotify the default music player for
that so it's going to be it's got to be
some
thing can't be classes so you're
definitely a head-scratcher it's
interesting they've definitely like
elevated it to a point where they want
it when they say something like category
defining it definitely gets me very
curious as far as like what type of
hardware that might look like but we
really don't know a lot yet about it or
when it will come out shall we speculate
besides the table where this could occur
it could be a devil it could be smart
earbuds you know I've seen I've seen
those ridiculous ones you guys should
stick no ipods in them and i've seen
other ones that have built-in storage
but why not a spotify enabled pair of
headphones because that's all you would
need and yeah I could work with your
phones it doesn't kill the battery all
the time but you could also offload your
playlist to that that I think actually
make sense because that doesn't exist
well in the real broad sense yet if that
fits in my mind that fits much better
than potentially you know glasses which
like I don't know why you would have
spotify glasses I don't know how you
would be able to listen with them so
bone conduction bone conduction sure
horse yeah filled out the snapchat
choice other benefits to this is
depending on how much storage they could
cram into something I like the idea of
dedicated earphones that are just like
this is my music player right on um how
much storage do you think it could
actually hold probably more than you
think yeah i mean like we've really
moved very very far as far as storage is
concerned so you you could store quite a
bit of your library in mini earphones
these days and danny green our friend
danny green and the chat points out he
still got an ipod in his car with over
5,000 tunes on it because he does want
to pay for dad cuz that that would be
what i use i would just cash a ton of
stuff onto that thing just to have it at
a moment's notice instead of actually
going up and down the data stream let's
not wait for spotify to come out with
something let's just make this thing
right now Danny are you on board you
want to be our investor where would you
like to see a dedicated music platform
calling out to the chat what device do
you think if it's a wearable if it's of
this or that or the other thing where do
you think would be valuable but it was
like a backpack and it's like a terabyte
hard drive in there like oh my god I
would love to see that come out
audiophile Spotify back oh god a filing
cabinet the audio file hold on I thought
we were gonna talk about
self-driving car but people want to
listen music like yeah you're not gonna
how many people are in Phoenix oh maybe
there's like I'm nine the greater
Phoenix area screw that right let's talk
about spy by the laws are all weird with
that we have everyone listens to music
and Spotify I mean I pay for google play
music and the reason why is because you
can have your music on there yep
uploaded stuff so stuff doesn't
disappear if spot if I added that
feature other than that local playback
stuff I'd be all over that I'm moving
back to that I really like to Spotify
experience it's right full disclosure I
don't really listen to Spotify that much
I actually still do a lot of digital
downloads like I'll download a song and
then listen to it like ad nauseam for
weeks and weeks and weeks and then
stream a song at nazia meant oh yeah so
I don't really like I don't use the
streaming music services as much I mean
like I listen to chance the rapper on
soundcloud but like partly because i
have to like i would have paid him
outright if he just let me i got a point
out something important to somebody in
the chat to best of all universe you
can't just say unsubscribe out loud and
hope that it works out you actually have
to click the unsubscribe button it's not
like that episode of the office network
where michael just screams bankruptcy
thank you thank you for coming listening
anyways yeah you know that's that's nice
we expect you to come back tomorrow and
say unsubscribe to subscribe then
unsubscribe just do that over and over
north right we have a viewer listener in
phoenix DJ rogers we don't like come
back and keep us posted it as to the the
y mo developments as high as they come
along apply to the pilot program rides
are free so like that's still a really
big deal you're not paying for gas
you're not paying for the driver you can
do pretty much what you want so this was
one point that i really wanted to make
in the podcast but it's only four
minutes so i didn't have enough time but
we often talk about self-driving cars
and don't really mention much about the
potential negatives so christopher mims
who's a columnist tech columnist for The
Wall Street Journal I think does a
really good job of trying to remind
people that like wow this is like so gee
whiz is really interesting this could
save lives with like reducing accidents
but at the same time we really do have
to like ask a lot of really big
questions as far as like do we want this
what's the insurance implications what's
going to happen like truck drivers was
going to happen a taxi drivers
is the type of thing where you can't
just say you know objectively this is
going to be good this is going to be
perfect you know so I just wanted to
like throw that out there I don't know
what folks in the chat think about that
but I think it's good to like at least
consider some of the negatives yeah I
mean way mo claims if they've driven or
self driven over 2.5 bill a million
miles that is in simulations have done
about a billion in 2016 so the thing is
there's a lot of testing going on and
don't forget about the idea of liability
on the driver's side and people in like
real society but these companies are
going to be dealing with the tons of
lawsuits if their technology fails right
so I think that their interests are
aligned with you know the good of
society because if way most tech is
licensed to Volvo and GM and whoever and
other ride hailing services and it fails
like they're dead in the water so i
would think that we're seeing a maturity
level in this technology that's gonna be
not as scary i think as people think it
might be right I I also wonder like what
exactly is the business model as far as
like who owns the car is it all going to
be ride hailing services that you're
gonna like hail for a ride to get to
work every single day or are you going
to own the self-driving car there's
still a lot of those questions to be
answered bail early on in the chat asked
and I'm not really sure what the context
is they say so people would share their
cars and they would almost never stand
still is that kind of the premise like
they would kind of cars themselves
justify usage that it would almost never
be a parked vehicle it be well with the
way mo trial in Phoenix those are
definitely like community cars sure
right so it almost zipcar ish right
exactly and I still don't know exactly
like how you hail the car i'm guessing
you do it through like a phone app or
something like that and then it shows up
you know fairly quickly i would hope
like they're going to have enough cars
on the road to serve like hundreds of
different people but at the same time
you could assume that like I don't know
people that are really wealthy might not
want to share their cars or they want
might want flashy or self-driving cars
so they might own those it's hard to say
really what exactly the model is going
to be I can see you want to customize
your own car and its self-driving could
be a feature that you don't always take
advantage of but if you wanted to you
could that kind of thing I don't see it
being either or like you can't take over
the vehicle
there's always going to be a way to do
that I'd imagine because one maybe
there's a sure yes I picture this
horrible thing airplay Adobe a social
network that develops from this that's
kind of like Foursquare or somebody's
like the mayor of the car they use it
enough you think that's possible in a
car like I know you like being in a
shared car that reeks of you know
somebody else's perfume or something or
you want to have a customization edge
right or they perfume or they spilled
their beer in the car or something right
like that's the issue that one of
reasons it's like no other I'm just like
every other taxi or shared car you want
to make sure that it's clean and neat
and everything well eventually the
things gonna have to go back to the
garage or dock or whatever it is it was
gonna be some kind of maintenance crew
keeping these things up they don't it's
a car it doesn't last forever right i
was gonna have to do general mechanical
maintenance internal cleaning etc etc
etc going back to your point though I as
I was always under the assumption that
eventually regular like human driving
would eventually be found to be so
dangerous that it would be determined to
be legal like we would look back as old
men and be like I can't believe we drove
our own cars like now it's like
completely legal you're never allowed to
do it when I was your age I had to put
my foot on a pedal right I'm like that's
what I always thought we miles in the
snow like decades from now they
eventually would be creating cars that
don't have steering wheels don't have
petals don't have gear shifts like it's
just it's just a box you know you go
inside well I'm thinking you think I'm
like a train that you just step into
this thing they're all in a line and
right move about 50 miles per hour I
don't see that happen there's another
some kind of take over sure but there's
I mean we've been talking about with
tech enable than everything how
fantastic some these developments on for
the differently-abled like you in the
chat he says he's in the UK and he's
nearly blind and this would be a huge
help Oh times daily life absolutely
absolutely the idea of letting people or
or enabling people to be able to get
around much much more easily as far as
that's concerned I think that can be
really huge and very helpful for folks
we didn't have time to mention the
podcast but their fleet of cars it's
like 100 100 Christ pacificus they're
adding 500 more yeah that they announced
that really quietly like a one-liner
blog post about oh by the way we're
adding 500 more cards so that's going to
be which means that like value
I'm assuming from reading that too that
there is substantial demand like they
probably got way more applications than
maybe they expected because they're
they're not going from 100 to 200
they're going from like a hundred to
roughly 600 right so that means that
there's like pent up demand to like
actually test out the service and maybe
people are you know at least people in
Phoenix are really you know they believe
in the idea they trust the technology I
really think the use cases that's really
what what way mo sa google what way mo
really wants to know like how are people
really using this it's one thing if
there's taxis and you're just going from
181 spots on the next need whatever but
if it's somebody's regular everyday life
that's why in the video and in their and
their application page they showed like
real people and families and how they're
going to be using it that's I think
information we don't have yet really why
like why would I have one just because
like I don't I don't want to get up
early the easy answer is lazy yeah the
easy answer is lazy well but their
technology service lazy besides for the
differently-abled maybe some others in
the chat have an idea how this could be
beneficial to them and a day to day life
you know and speaking of testing calling
out to DJ Rogers and anybody else we
know in the Phoenix area if you're
getting first-hand experience with this
we'd love to hear about it oh totally
awesome join us on the join us on the
show and the chat tweeted us we'd love
the ears email me Ben Rubin at CBS com
I'd love to hear from anybody in the
Phoenix area about what this is like we
don't have any regular Cena editors out
there so if anybody's got like a
positive or negative experience with how
this is all playing out we just love to
hear what you got wanted to throw this
out there too as far as like you have a
kid I have kids how old do the kids have
to be to ride in the car yeah by
themselves so it's just like another
interesting nuance I mean like my
daughter is going to enough tenderness
smartphone eyes oh so I guess my
daughter's going to kindergarten next
year so she's gonna take the bus by
herself to school with this for the same
dolt is it right with the bus driver and
going to school but is it the same
concept so this is another one of those
like nuances that like technology is now
getting to the point where you have to
you know reconsider what's normal for
like regular society like you think
that's weird not a thing of the new
stores like you like would you track
your tile with this robot this is a
baton has been hacked
your child's would never be safe again
I'd love the plot find I was like that's
what my head is swimming if they'd if
they design the robot to look cute and
kind that's what they've been trying as
parents would you trust a robo bus oh
great question depends how long has it
been an operation fair enough you want
to make sure that say it's been really i
mean i can imagine i'm not doing a
thorough ten states have been like five
years do they have an emergency drivers
in there i would hope so yeah so they
don't want it we don't want our kids
being the first ones i guess what we
what i said they don't have my case we
not have the right stuff okay like i'm
not i'm not like having them be like the
guinea pigs for something like that you
do need somebody stop them from messing
with any of the controls is likely to
stay back to be Lord of the Flies oh
we're going to Mexico alright deploys
airbag I just love this line from jay
smith in the chat cuz ya mess around
miss a car payment the damn thing will
drive itself back to the bank that's it
this is totally true I love that oh my
god this very good point swinging back
over to the Spotify a topic real quick
before we call today because we're going
way long today this is great imagine
soggy points out you know who really
buys tech anymore for just a unit tasker
you know just one thing now the trend is
for a piece of tech have multiples with
your phone is your camera is your
capability oak amorous your itunes
player is your GPS is your music player
is your everything would you like to
have a unit Tasker like that like my
guys on the headphones would they put
other stuff in there would interfaith
like a wooded naturally bluetooth with
the phone so they could take a call on
it at the same time like any normal
bluetooth headphone but still just be
that separate storage unit for the music
i I think that if and again this is all
like rumor and speculation but I think
that if Spotify were creating it and
they were smart about it they they
wouldn't make it a unit ask a piece of
hardware they would have like Spotify be
the core of it it would be like the the
main reason for it existing but adding
little additional apps or features into
it probably wouldn't be that complicated
or difficult and those are all value
adds if
this only did Spotify then it really
would be pretty hard to justify I don't
know like how much would you pay for
that like knives fifty bucks if it's 50
button only does one thing okay maybe I
think modifies getting into the hardware
game they shouldn't overload this thing
with features because if it's just
another smartphone it's just another
smartphone yeah and we already have
smartphones already have these bad
watches and we have these lousy other
products lot of people aren't buying
unit asker's but spotify is in so many
different devices already that spot if i
was to come out with hardware it would
make a lot more sense it was very
singular focused of yeah there are
headphones they have spotify offline or
it comes with premium imagine that like
oh by the way you buy your headphones
you got premiums like a year mmm two
years okay good idea you give you a
reason why would you do this same thing
with the the echo if your vehicle you
can get amazon prime music for like five
dollars per month if you just have read
I think it's three cuz it it's raised
less than five yeah like nothing as long
as long as just lost to that so she can
not only on that speaker you can't yes
but what I would think yet not other
thing a lot of people will go out and go
this is gonna be the end of it that's
why still thinks is probably the
headphones that makes the most sense be
really good you gonna buy them anyway
everyone needs headphones so more I
modify branded speaker in your house
yeah that's that wouldn't be products by
pretty yeah right is I thought I sticker
to put on any speaker you have it it's
pretty hard to stand out as a speaker
that their prior to finding stickers sir
I'm gonna butcher this name sir hacked
kick in the chat says I definitely need
a device it is not category defining the
category merging instead something like
Apple watch ipod nano but music still
don't use don't like using the phone to
listen to music these are all very good
comments by the way yeah I like a lot of
the analysis it's getting thrown out
there so very good point and then one
more time back around the horn Jacob
craft asks how will do children have to
be to ride alone on an airplane I'm
going back to riding alone in a robo car
I don't know yeah I have intended
children thing I think it's like 8 to 10
but that's because there is it that high
I believe I could have swore there was
something like you could as long as
there's a like documented parental
permission and like they've recruited
flight staff to assist a child maybe
it's almost any age that the wild
you know more than a potato however
there's no flight staff in that car so
there's no there's no professional it's
okay right people in the flying cars but
there's I spective this alongside with
by the water you okay Murray okay I
don't know why kids name is Marie it's
coming back to very popular name uses
mmm and then one last really good
comment from fully daily value to me
with self-driving car the time of my
commute becomes my time instead of my
driving time I can browse a web sleep
more get an early start in the office
work at cetera that's what I do my train
ride yeah self-driving RV and we're
spoiled because we take the public
transit where we don't have to pay as
much attention granted try to pay some
attention as you can maybe learn the
hard way in the New York subway system
but the point remains yeah the idea of
just having that amount of time back
because we don't there there are people
out there that have our two hour long
composed able to drive and that's you
know I as someone who misses my car
because I live in New York now driving
around can be a very enjoyable
experience but I'd imagine is it not in
New York what I cut driving can be
cathartic but having to do it every
single day would get OBS riding a horse
like yeah you don't do that every
freaking day anymore but you just go do
it for fun yeah that's fine okay so they
cry for fun I was getting so mad about I
like this card but Philippe also says
soccer moms can get a life again yes but
then what would we call them we would
have to give them a new name they're
still going to soccer practice oh no no
you send the kid to soccer I'm going to
the mall just all ma ma ma yeah and on
the note to finish it off with a perfect
tone for today's episode Dre fray
