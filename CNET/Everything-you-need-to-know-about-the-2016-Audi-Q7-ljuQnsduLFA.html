family wants to transport more than the
average 2.4 children around the car of
choice would have been an egg-shaped MPV
like a renault megane or a Ford Galaxie
these days however and more and more
families are going for the SUV and Audi
it would seem spells SUV with a cue to
cue 7 tops out the cue range for Audi as
its flagship SUV model and this year
there's a brand new one out on the
market the second generation offers to
be lighter more efficient more powerful
more comfortable more everything really
we're here in the beautiful Swiss
landscape with a couple of hours behind
the wheel of the new q7 to find out
what's what and because this is a
popular car it sold over 500,000 so far
and because you might be considering one
to ferry around your 72 kids here's our
list of our favorite features weight is
an important thing when building a car
or rather the lack thereof and this car
has shifted over 325 kilos from its
previous version for then to context 325
kilos that's well I'd like to say that's
four of me it's closer to three but it
still means three full-grown men you're
not shifting about it's also the weight
of a grand piano I already tell me now I
don't think many people have been
shifting that around in the back of a
car but you have to imagine it has to
affect the handling it's brought the 0
to 60 to time down by over a second it's
pushed up the top speed by 10% it's made
fuel efficiency better it's incredible
to think that much weight could have
been shifted
but it affects so many aspects of the
car it makes a huge difference
Howdy's new in-car entertainment system
features apple carplay connectivity and
Android auto which means that no matter
what phone you have you can integrate it
right into the car that's a massive leap
forward considering that in-car
entertainment systems have classically
been pretty rubbish when everyone just
prefers to use their phone now that you
can integrate that straight in and use
all the functionality in your favorite
apps that's a huge win and one less
thing that the car manufactures have to
think of Audi has been moving away from
the rounded look that's been dominating
its lineup for so long and it's adding
in this more creased sharp aggressive
look across its entire range we see it
in the new r8 we see it in the new TT
and we're seeing it here in the new q7
Howdy's SUVs to me have always looked
more like jacked-up estate cars but for
a company that makes the rs6 that is a
compliment
this new creased sharp look is a modern
incarnation of that era we hold so
dearly from Audi that of the original
Quattro those sharp eighties lines the
Giugiaro
age of design is coming back and it
looks better than ever the price now
that's not something we usually focus on
here ex car but about 50 thousand pounds
and change on the road it's not a bad
prospect when you compare it to other
cars in the sector especially
considering its fuel economy and speed
you've actually got yourself quite a
good deal and for that money you're
still getting an Audi
driver assists now definitely they seem
to be coming into a world to take away
from us the pleasure of driving and for
that we will never forgive them our
robot overlords will stealers of every
last joy of driving at some point and we
will curse them to our dying day but
sometimes they can be a little bit
useful for example in slow traffic up to
about 37 miles an hour this car can read
the traffic signs it can read the road
markings and how fast and how far the
car in front of you is and adjust so
basically it adjusts your acceleration
braking and steering up to 37 miles an
hour and if you live in London like I do
that is the top speed you achieve most
of the time effectively meaning that it
could drive me to and from work now
self-driving cars might seem like there
are a few years away but apparently this
year you can get in an Audi q7 for
almost everything I would want to do on
a day-to-day basis in a car maybe those
robot overlords aren't so bad after all
the new q7 will launch with a 3 liter
TDI engine kicking out 268 brake
horsepower connected to an 8-speed
Tiptronic gearbox now that will fall
short of sports car credentials but add
in the weight reduction and that gives
you one hell of a power-to-weight ratio
Interiors for me the most overlooked
part of car design and we've talked
about how he's looking a little bit past
their best even in the top level or
eighths for quite some time now
this new q7 though has updated
everything and it just looks that little
bit more updated that little bit more
modern that little bit more swish
now this display here I'm usually not a
fan of displays that feel like they've
been bolted onto the dash of complained
about it on Mercedes in the past but
this one actually feels really nice and
elegant and the screen is super high
resolution it's a nice little touch
instead of old-fashioned analog
mechanical dowels you're presented with
them awesome screen which you can
configure to have exactly the
information you want up there you can
have virtual dials up and present or as
we have right now the dials are pushed
to the side and reduced in size to give
me a nice high definition map of where
we are now of them you with a sat-nav
marry that to the heads-up display
that's hovering about five yards in
front of me and you've got yourself a
very very efficient way of me not having
to take my eyes off the road which
frankly in these incredibly winding
mountain roads in Switzerland is no bad
thing it might not be a major point but
if you're driving at night or Andes
through a tunnel
the little interior strip lights come on
blue in this case animation look like
you're driving something out of Tron
which in anyone's book is pretty damn
awesome now this is obviously an SUV
which means I'm higher off the ground
than I like to be normally in a car and
it's bigger and heavier than I normally
like to have in a car even with the 300
plus kilos shedded so handling well
handling is like an SUV but within that
that shedded weight does make a
difference it is its lightest in its
class and it uses that to its full
advantage to make it feel a little bit
more nimble
the high seating position they'll
definitely remind you that you're in an
SUV now that might not be your taste
certainly isn't mine but if you like
that kind of thing you get the best of
both worlds something that feels light
but still gives you that high driving
mighty position on the road now modern
cars are modern cars and they all feel
pretty good Odie's are at the top of
that tree in any case this has the
8-speed Tiptronic gearbox which is as
smooth as you like and frankly right now
although a manual gearbox would always
be my preferred way of getting forward
at the moment I'm rocking an injured
knee so I'm not having to use my left
foot is actually a God set there's
obviously the flappy paddle gearbox for
those of you still want to shift
themselves or this big old chunky stick
down here can be used to shift gear as
well but frankly put it in Drive and
point it in the right direction and
that's the way you're going to treat
this car 99% of the time this is a
family transport car and no matter how
many extra sporty touches they want to
add in how many more aggressive styling
touches the truth of the matter is
you're going to be taking the kids to
school in this every day you're not
going to be taking it round the
Nurburgring of the weekends that's not
what this car is for those little sporty
touches are just there to make you feel
a little bit better about resigning
yourself to the fact that shifting your
family around is now your primary
concern when you get behind the wheel
SUVs are good at two very particular
things fairing a lot of stuff or a lot
of people and if people ferrying is the
reason you've bought this car at no
extra cost it's available with seven
seats where some of the boot is
sacrificed to put two extra full seats
in the back all of which can be fitted
for child seats so you could be ferrying
around six children in this car and the
driver seven if you teach your child how
to drive which I highly recommend
though you have it our top list of
things we think you need to know about
the brand-new Audi q7 these swiss out
roads have been a brilliant proving
ground for this car and I'll tell you
what volvo BMW even porsche you can have
to take note</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
