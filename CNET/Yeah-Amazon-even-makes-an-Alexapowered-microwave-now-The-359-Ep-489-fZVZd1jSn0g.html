359 podcast Sea nuts daily news podcast
broadcasting live from the scene at New
York studios on BBG and on Wednesday
November 14th episode 419 your hosts are
having a bit wow that was a lot to say
in a short amount of time thanks for
coming to watch her show all right
yesterday was a pretty hectic so we're
just gonna slow things down and talk
about microwaves today which is not a
lie actually so the amazonbasics
microwave which is Alexa enabled we we
have a review out today so we're gonna
talk about that there's also a new
review on the antenna TV DVR the fire TV
recast another Amazon product so I guess
we're just talking about Amazon all week
and we're gonna round out the show with
an effort by the BFF the ACLU and a
bunch of other groups to try to push
Facebook to be a little bit more
transparent with like what they do with
taking down your posts when they do go
against their policies either way
sending your questions and comments
about those topics and we'll get to as
many as we can at the end of the show
now let's get to the podcast the
aforementioned end the show will
commence in 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm alfred Aang Amazon is now
selling a new Alexa powered microwave
it's kind of small
it's 60 bucks and it even automatically
reorders popcorn for you there's there's
also like an Alexa powered wall clock
that I'm waiting for the review to come
out about that but do you think that
like Amazon has finally jumped the shark
with Alexa powered stuff or we're just
getting started I think they're still
midair on this shark I honestly like a
microwave at least some what makes sense
the clock was getting a little bit
closer to that honestly like how much
popcorn is a person eating that they
need a smart connected device
automatically reorder it for them I
don't like I probably only eat popcorn
maybe like three or four times a year
unless it's free in the
office which that I will eat a lot but
it's free on Wednesdays Thank You dvg
yeah so I mean it makes sense for me too
for a microwave at least in the sense
that it's in your kitchen it's something
that you could use it's already digital
I'm like your stove or something or like
your refrigerator or something like that
which also have their own smart
assistance but you know microwaves just
seem to make a little bit more sense
what my thing is like you're already
going up to an impressing buttons on it
you know what's true with I'm at least
put the food in yeah with a clock or
something you know you can look at it
and ask it something and it would like
to show you on a screen or something
like that
with a microwave you are already there
you're in front of our alright you're
like you that's the whole point of being
a smart voice assistant right you don't
want to get up and do something mm-hmm
but in a microwaves case you're already
there I don't really see the point and I
think it'll still sell because it's only
60 dollars yeah like this is this thing
I would think is like perfect for dorm
rooms yeah rich Brown who reviewed this
from our smart home team said that it's
really not good
for like a family of four it's not big
enough and it doesn't do enough but one
other aspect of this that I wanted to
mention was that it's the first product
that uses Alexa Connect kit which is a
new set of you know software and
hardware it's it's kind of like a kid of
stuff that third-party developers can
use to add Alexa in to more of their
stuff so I guess if I think they're
jumping the shark they're really you're
right they are just getting started
anything i microwave had more smarter
system features like being able to play
music as like just some sort of chime
boombox or something like that but it
doesn't it doesn't have a LexA built-in
it uses Alexa like like I wish it had
more Alexa features yeah yeah maybe
maybe the next generation also we've got
a new review up for the fire TV recast
which is a DVR for live TV using a
digital antenna it's a pretty cool
product it's well received by our
reviewer ty Pendlebury but it's 230
bucks which means I'm probably not gonna
buy it even though I do already have a
digital antenna yeah I mean I'd feel
like for that price you might as well
just you know spend that on an F
to count or something instead for like a
good like two years I do have a digital
antenna but I there's nothing on TV that
makes me think I want this recorded
especially if it's not like a cable show
or anything like that I mean I guess you
could record it like the Super Bowl or
award shows or something like that but
it's really not something why do you
have a digital antenna then I don't have
a cable subscription and I like watching
jeopardy oh okay yeah yeah so you could
use this to watch jeopardy on we're
recording yeah yeah to record it and
watch it later last about 70
organizations including the e FF and
ACLU are asking Facebook to let users
appeal if their posts are removed
this comes after in April the tech firm
started to allow users to appeal if
their posts were pulled down for
specific issues like nudity or sexual
activity or hate speech these groups are
urging Facebook to go further obviously
so what do you think about that I mean I
think it makes a lot of sense
you know platforms like Facebook and
Twitter they don't really adhere to the
First Amendment as much as people like
to think make that argument say you know
this is infringing my First Amendment
right when they delete my post
Facebook's not beholden to that but at
the same time it is probably the largest
platform you can get online to get views
on what whatever you think or whatever
you want to say that being said though
obviously the Facebook has their own
rules especially this new to the nudity
terrorism post hate speech and things
like that it would be interesting to see
if this does go through how pages that
have been banned like Infowars would you
know use it yeah yeah how they would
actually respond with the appeals
process either way if you want to read
more about these stories
check them out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben
I'm Alfred Inge
thanks for listening
and that's a wrap on the recording of
the audio podcast you can subscribe
using the links below right now we are
anxious to hear your questions and
comments and before we go any further
Alfred and Ben you need to put a kibosh
to the a word we'd yeah yeah yeah I was
gonna apologize for that if we're gonna
talk about Amazon not incessantly echo
we gotta find a new code word yeah
people watch our shows without
headphones on that's my question
well thank you for watching the show and
I will do my best to stop saying the
smart assistant in the echo speaker
why don't we just say echo I've changed
the weak word on mine when I was still
using it okay yeah we can try I have
tried to do echo before I'll try again
so in the meantime we want to give a
quick shout out around the world to all
of our fantastic and lovely audience
listeners Watchers however you choose to
consume our droving drabble shouting out
to kpop out in melbourne we don't get a
lot of Australians on the show nice but
I've had time Pendlebury on yeah yeah so
let's go ahead and kick it off taking a
question from Matthew - our old friend -
in the chat I'm am I looking at the
correct microwave it appears to be only
700 watts and I was looking at the
article when he mentioned that and
that's true this is a very lightweight
microwave yeah but at that price
it's pretty comparable yeah to a certain
extent amazon is presenting this
microwave as kind of the first step for
Alexa connect kit which as I mentioned
before is kind of this kid to provide to
third-party developers to create their
own devices using the Amazon voice
assistant so I don't it's but at the
same time amazon also has a huge
ecommerce website that they already know
what are some of the most popular
microwaves that are already selling on
Amazon so I kind of feel like they know
it's gonna sell at a certain price point
and
b700 and wot isn't really that good but
they probably know it's good enough to
work as a good pilot for Alexa Kinect
kid good answer to a good question next
up from Timothy do what is Amazon's real
end game for the and I like this quote
unquote Amazon lady powered microwave
like what there okay so this is
stepping-stone technology for that right
they're experimenting seeing where this
can be implemented it's not like anybody
was really crying for their microwave to
let them be lazier and fatter but this
is them trying to see where any
semblance of a voice assistant can be
beneficial in life and you got to start
somewhere right it's like it was there
and the fridge and then like what's next
if it's successful they're gonna keep
building it and at $60 a pop I kind of
feel like people are probably gonna be
pretty interested in it it's not really
a very big commitment the bigger
commitment is really if you want to buy
an echo speaker which can run you like
$100 plus or I don't know just buy
during Black Friday where they sell them
for like three cents so but it's it's
from some of the stuff that alfred was
talking about there's a lot of
additional stuff that they could
probably add to this to make it better
with the assistant I mean their end goal
goal is to essentially create the entire
ecosystem around your smart home you
know they don't want just the the echo
dot or the you know the echo itself or
anything like that they want you have an
echo clock and like an echo microwave so
that if you want to switch to a Google
home then it becomes this whole thing of
okay well I would switch that but that
doesn't work with my microwave or
anything they basically want to yeah
everything haven't you locked in and you
know building on that also like your
security system your entertainment
system that goes to the recast so and
and that continues to help build Amazon
and convince you to keep getting a Prime
membership because all that stuff works
better with a Prime membership number
one number two it's been shown that the
more echoes you have in your home
whether you have a Prime membership or
not all those things build-up to ensure
that you're more likely to buy stuff off
of Amazon so
really like it wouldn't surprise me that
like the folks that buy the microwave
are also better Amazon shoppers for
Amazon sake and another thing to kind of
point out here that's important is it's
not that the Amazon ladies built into
the microwave it will speak to your
Amazon lady device so you're gonna need
an echo or an echo dot for this to even
function correct I thought that was kind
of interesting rather than just build it
in natively that again it's just
expanding on the ecosystem they want you
to invest in it's entirely possible that
they're gonna build one with an echo dot
built into it in the future but for now
like I said it's it's being presented as
a way to get developers interested in
using the connect kit so I I don't think
it does nearly as much as maybe it could
because it's just kind of like a pilot
project kind of thing they just wanted
to workshop this and say like hey why
don't you guys try this too I shed out
to mark dybul who points out that if
they really wanted to make the microwave
relevant they would have had it so that
the amazon lady could reset your clock
after the power goes out I would love
that that happens like every three days
in my house I mean that's kind of what
they were doing with the Amazon clock
aren't they so yeah the wall clock
hasn't shown up yet I'm waiting for that
review the coolest feature of the clock
was that it was like you don't have to
change it on daylight savings time by
the way it's an analogue clock yeah that
was the thing like that I'm gonna push
to just talk about the wall clock when
that review comes out I'm very
interested to find out what happens with
the clock you wear it around your neck
like a Flavor Flav necklace I think that
would be it would be pretty great and
she gives you directions and restaurant
reviews nice
here's one from Ryan Williams this is
just a nice little shout out it says my
biggest disappointment of Amazon not
coming to Toronto no more visits from
Ben oh thanks yes I was in Toronto
earlier this year and I had a great time
and the food is excellent there it's
supposed to say I mean they still could
open up an office in Toronto I mean wow
this is like hq8 now that they're on so
I
they honestly could like they
straight-up changed the rules in the
middle of the of this of this whole
search and settle owed now we're gonna
do two cities instead I've announced
Ville Toronto Toronto showed there
they're great Canadian kindness by I got
a release from I think it's Toronto
global the folks that put together the
proposal for Amazon and they said they
were very very proud of their efforts
and it increases the exposure for
Toronto so I I haven't really seen a lot
of cities throwing Amazon under the bus
after the fact even though they probably
have reason to New York I mean other
than through yeah New York did and New
York got HQ to but the losers the
responses that I saw from the losers
were all like very kind and they were
like we appreciated the exposure we
appreciated the opportunity New York and
not Virginia was one of the only ones
that there was quite a considerable but
backlash from a lot of local politicians
that didn't like it yeah that didn't
like the incentives I don't think it's
gonna change like now he's already
drives interesting to me that all this
like outrage against it only came out
once the deal was set in stone not set
in stone but like announced it most
likely because you know not many people
knew what like New York City was
offering because so many of these offers
were so secretive I know you spend a lot
of time looking for it details from what
every city offered to them I put a
compilation together as well but that
was like just basically what was public
information mm-hmm
but yeah New York's deal was not public
and now that we've seen it you know this
does not seem like a good deal for many
local politicians or people that live in
Long Island City yeah I mean in Cuomo
and de Blasio or arguing the other side
yeah Cuomo said Cuomo the governor said
that this is a nine to one ratio for
every dollar we put into this project we
got nine dollars back that we're gonna
use for public housing for education for
infrastructure that's their argument
and they're obviously getting a lot of
backlash from
folks in New York that's saying like oh
I see you've got 1.5 billion dollars for
one of the most wealthy companies in the
world but you know not for heard the
subway so that's probably going to
continue as this project keeps going but
anyway thanks for the question that was
a bit of a tangent on what's going on in
New York right now speaking of the
subway I like how that was brought up in
the chat yesterday and by the time I got
up this morning it's a full-blown mean
what the onion put on an article that
said I don't know if this predates the
conversation so if we were just getting
trolled in the chat nice job but yeah
that that Amazon is building a subway
system in New York just for prime
customer just for Amazon employees yeah
I feel like whoever was in the chat
probably read that yeah I missed that
one well the person in the good on just
that smart and should be writing for the
onion next question more from Ryan
Williams are they essentially they being
Amazon trying to do what Samsung did
with Bigsby
but with a much better assistant uh yeah
probably but Samsung makes more stuff
directly so they build refrigerators and
ovens and washing machines Amazon
doesn't really do that yet I guess you
could consider the possibility like the
door is slightly more open now that they
decided to build a microwave but a
microwave is a long way away from you
know some of those much much bigger
appliances so Samsung has more of an
advantage in kind of pushing bixby
because it has so much control over this
huge pipeline of appliances but Amazon
also has a ton of partnerships so if you
are a customer for Amazon lady sorry
this is really slowing me down if you do
use the echo speaker you you have like a
ton of options as far as buying
appliances that work with it speaking of
other appliances let's say if Amazon
were to do a fridge would that be in
heavy competition with Samsung's smart
fridge I don't think it would be unless
they partner up with somebody that makes
like if Amazon makes their own fridge I
don't I don't have the numbers but I
would I don't know how many people order
for
online as opposed to going to a store
and like picking it up there and having
it delivered from the store which
Samsung obviously is in a lot of stores
that with their refrigerators as far as
unless Amazon puts their own
refrigerators in stores and also makes
it much cheaper I don't really see them
doing that like for online they do sell
fridges on Amazon along with everything
else but their own fridge no of course
not but and and it would be interesting
if they decided to build their own
fridge I'm not discounting it that it
would never happen at all but it would
obviously piss off the folks that are
already on Amazon selling their fridges
but we've seen Amazon do that a million
times as far as if you if you sell on
the site you can readily expect that if
you're popular enough and if you sell
enough Amazon very well may decide to
create a competing you may offer
competition directly against you on its
own website here's one from dad sure he
says Amazon still needs to develop a
drone to get the meal out of my freezer
and stuff it into the microwave yeah see
that's like such an important aspect of
this as you were saying Alfred that you
still have to go to the microwave
open the door put the food in and close
at that point like what are you gonna do
like you're you're you're gonna go up
and put your food in it and then close
it and say like set like the eos 4 5
yeah so like if you're in the flow of
doing stuff I can see that somebody
might get in the habit of doing that but
is it necessary like do you need it no
of course not
so the in home food drone makes a lot of
sense who is that from - fetch yeah
great idea - yeah oh so somebody should
definitely do that there should also be
drone delivery from Whole Foods to the
freezer yeah or to your house yeah just
breaks through the window and it breaks
through a different window the second
time Amazon lady I need a pizza yeah ok
we're almost out of time let's take a
couple more questions here's a really
good one from tech slacker do you think
what do you think about Amazon focusing
heavily on markets like India for growth
since perhaps the US market maybe
becoming oversaturated yeah the US
market is definitely already saturated
and especially when it comes to prime
customers so there really isn't that
much more room to grow that being said
the u.s. is obviously Amazon's biggest
market and its most important but yeah
India is definitely a really interesting
area it's not one that I've really
focused on too much but there's a it's
really interesting what's going on there
between Amazon and Walmart Walmart
recently purchased for a ton of money
Flipkart which is a major local
e-commerce player there and also Alibaba
is trying to grow there so if you're
looking for a lot of competition in
e-commerce India is definitely an area
where that's happening and that should
be good for customers as far as lower
prices more selection and we'll see if
Amazon ends up winning out let's take
one more from Timothy do Timothy's full
of good questions these days if let's
hypothetically say the Amazon and Google
were to bind together and develop a
smart assistant Empire would there be
any legal implications in that like a
monopoly essentially yeah what do you
think maybe I don't know that's it
that's a good question there are other
smart assistants but those are the two
biggest ones but it's still a very new
market so I don't know if like
anti-competitive folks would really get
involved in something like that there
there is a theory generally speaking
that all these smart assistants are
eventually going to start working
together and you're just gonna have
you're gonna ask them different things
for like they're they're gonna get good
at certain elements and you're gonna ask
them different things for different
stuff that you need I don't think that's
coming anytime soon but even Jeff Bezos
mentioned the idea of having smart
assistants work together and not have
Amazon lady do anything and everything I
like that we're actually getting into
the habit and I'm trying that's right
it's good it's good that's really
breaking by how quick it's I'm slowing
down a lot from it but it's fine okay
last one for the day we're gonna do a
quick follow-up to HQ to doctor says I'm
sure that
really cares but it appears that
Arlington is practically renaming a
section of the region just for HQ to
look up national landing you know
anything about this Ben yeah renaming it
they called it that but there is no
place in Arlington called national
landing I didn't think that they were
renaming I thought I thought it was that
the name wrong area from what I
understood okay so the area is has been
called Crystal City I was under the
impression that it's been rebranded it
had been rebranded already as national
landing but not specifically for this
deal yeah I don't know why because
Crystal City is a pretty cool name but
maybe Crystal City was kind of slummy
before so they had an interest in
changing it to something like really I
don't know bland like national landing
they probably should have just changed
it to Bezos fill because that's what
it's going to be so Hazel's burg Bezos
burg they should have like just gone for
the gold and just said you know here you
go Jeff here's here's another slice of
plain and earth yeah
hasn't Governor Cuomo changed his name
yet to Amazon Cuomo not yet but I would
love to see that happen moments like
these I really wish that I still had a
soundboard with a rimshot on it yeah
let's work that into the next year's
budget yeah I don't think anybody is
really calling a national landing like I
mentioned it in my story yesterday but
I'm gonna go right back to calling it
Crystal City because Crystal City is
what everybody's been calling it the
whole time
yeah National Landing is essentially
what they like local like developers
called it in their way to like try to
attract Amazon to Arlington but yeah
that's not like that's not a historical
name for like its Crystal City yeah
they're trying to call it national land
until I kind of rebrand and make it look
cool kind of like what's a bad name yeah
it's just so bland I mean I mean that's
essentially what like real estate
developers did for like Dumbo back in in
Brooklyn like Dumbo is a cool name
sure yeah I mean I'm sure somebody will
say that about national landing okay
probably just Bezos I don't know but
somebody thinks it's cool I guess
more than Crystal City either way it's
nice to have somebody
you out there dad she's on the scene and
keeping us posted on what's going on in
the front line he says I National
Landing will be parts of Crystal City
Pentagon row and Potomac yard so
needless to say thanks for contributing
looking forward to hearing more from you
that being said we are out of time and
forgive us we are not gonna have a show
