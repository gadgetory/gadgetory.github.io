ear now and IKEA has shown us what a
kitchen in 2025 might look like Oh at a
little military company called DARPA has
invented homing bullets so that's not
terrifying
tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily best geek talk
show I'm Ashley sceva Jeremy's always
Caitlyn honest yeah whoa you just I
thought you pointed that gun at me with
the guided bullets I wouldn't need to
actually I mean I'd have to point it at
you but then you could run away and it
would still hitch I'm totally gonna jump
ahead and be like that is exactly like
the cf1 from The Fifth Element it's this
is insane
but we'll get there that's we'll get
there in fact let's get there right now
it's all headlines someone asks by the
way really quick if we could show what
we do during these transitions so like
can you show what you guys are doing
during the transitions and I'm like you
don't want to see that yeah you don't
like it's back here I take a stick out
and I spin the plates I was bouncing
ball on my nose I mistake and I like
guys take a big bite of steak you eat
steak on the break yeah I got energy
levels up make those proteins okay this
is the news story but this is the news
story so DARPA apparently now has homing
bullets bullets second change trajectory
mid mid shot which is pretty scary this
is from DARPA TV the video that we're
watching so here's how it works
this is DARPA 's xacto which is short
for extreme accuracy test Ordinance
which is a very good name now allows
these target locking bullets to hit a
target after it starts moving so before
they had these they were working on
bullets that could change paths midair
to sort of adjust for wind or you know
other elements things like that but now
it can actually and hit a still target
but now these are hitting moving okay so
the one footage you were seeing before
was an actual pro guy train so nice just
some idiot this is just someone trained
bozo like me are you using the exact oh
no I'm on the pro side but still that's
crazy it's all not scary it's a 50
caliber bullet which is not exactly a
small bullet and it alters its path is
it sort of cuts through the air to
strike a target of motion a DARPA to be
fair DARPA has not exactly
and how this works yeah they're not i
would imagine for confidentiality
reasons
top-secret you know how it works and
everything they're not they're not
exactly being super forthcoming about
the exact technology yeah
however i was looking on reddit at all
the commenters and we all know reddit is
full of experts and so um there were a
lot of actual people saying things like
what could be optical there could be
things like optical sensors low
megapixel cameras or motors and fins on
the bullet that make corrections from a
computer that's mounted on the rifle
sounds like a very expensive bullet very
expensive bullet I would imagine very
expensive not cheap at all which you
know might help it not get into the
hands of just like me and you would be
bad I don't think I have a 50 caliber
rifle laying around no 3d print that was
a terrible idea so yeah that the trained
sniper hit his target and then an
untrained sniper hit the exact same
target so I don't know what that says
whether that is the scariest thing ever
or really really cool that they
developed it or maybe both scare
sighting as we like say no not scare
sighting scary scary it's terrifying
yeah so there which is like cool for the
like military you know buffing me I'm
just like cool leave your guns tracking
bullets and and dizzy up one fifth
element makes me laugh cuz I always
think of like people with their aimbots
mmm
I'm like this is an aimbot and relaxers
over here okay gotcha dark was saying
that the point of this is to improve
sniper effectiveness and enhance troop
safety because it increases the time
that you can be in a position here's the
exact expanding target engagement
timelines so the time in which you would
need to sort of push it entirely good
shave to like ya know but I get I get it
this is this is scary that you approach
a pro sniper is probably real mad right
now yeah I mean I think you Pro snipers
out there who have worked very hard for
that training probably really annoyed um
but that actually so resist or a hashtag
of today yeah here's the here's the
thing so what do you do like no that
would be terrible
um this is terrifying like I'm really
scared of stuff like this and especially
when you think about like sentient
robotics like coming like if that ever
happens oh yeah use these just shoot us
like it's a t-1000 got ahold of this no
bueno no good
so my query to you and you the viewer is
to use the hashtag TV bullets and please
put a happier spin on this because I
don't want to die of terror tonight in
my sleep it's a it's a guided tic-tac
and it's for people have bad breath and
you know that like guys on a date over
there I can you're like he's gonna go
for a kiss later and I saw him eating
garlic steak like you do like a break
and you shoot it and it goes man while
he's talking we gotta tighten it though
that's stealing from and that goes right
into his mouth well it takes act smart
it has optical sensors on so just kind
of covers okay so there you go there's
my delightful spin on I like it well you
did that that really great hatred parody
where you do I'm good at that I'm good
at making really screen evil things like
really delightful charming I would like
it I would like just like a wit just
like a magician where they changed like
their magic wand into a flower I would
like it to just shoot out a bouquet of
roses to people okay like it's it looks
like a bullet and then when it gets to
you it like goes back and it's like
flowers so it's like terrorists and then
all of a sudden goes okay TD bullets
Phoebe bullets okay cool so that's it
we're gonna make that a happier thing so
let's let's turn this frown upside down
guys yeah tell me about it
making of ear lock kind of yeah speaking
of air lock I know I just said that I'm
going for
I'm going for worst transition so we all
know that there's new ways to unlock
your phone now what with you know the
finger touch scan and everything it's a
new way of not having to enter in a
passcode well over at Yahoo labs they've
introduced new technology which they
hope to to make available and this is
ear lock now this is basically a scanner
that you put up to its it's recognized
through your screen and it recognizes
the shape of your ears so it's basically
taking a much larger sample okay okay
that's basically the the gist of this
it's it's
taking it from a larger sample now why
is this important Oh weird and the
biometrics can't touch ID you have that
what we need because the biometric
scanner takes up a lot more room where's
the this the ear scanner is already like
that technology is already in the phone
so location because the screen is there
because it's using the screen right it's
already it's already cheaper it's
already there so you could put it in a
lot more phones for a lot less less
money right okay so emerging markets
this is like a thing for people who are
not buying iPhone fixes and Galaxy s5
this is this is the future this is the
future for more low end phones and more
phones adapting this without having to
increase their costs right okay so
giving giving people who have lower end
phones or access to lower end phones the
ability to sort of unlock their phone
using biometrics yes so there they're
saying that they're using the body print
they were able to do 99.8 authentic
precision Wow so they're ninety-nine
point eight percent of the time it knew
it was you that is impressive
I really like that wow that's cool so so
what are they gonna do like what are
they gonna do next so they are already
working on us they've really good I mean
obviously really good testing results
but I would imagine probably not that
many people have used this yet like are
they gonna do it with more yeah they're
they're gonna improve the recognition
algorithms and they're gonna test it on
a larger scale but you know that's
awesome yeah I mean being able it's so
much safer to be able to have that data
on your device as opposed to putting a
passcode in or you know cuz that stuff
can be cracked and so obviously a screen
like that wouldn't be able to read like
the little tiny lines on your finger
yeah but if you could you know fist bump
your phone or whatever you're like hey
this bump one looked not very accurate
but the ear one kind of makes sense that
sort of shape of your fist it sort of
remembers it so maybe that's a good
thing mm-hmm but the ears one is awesome
yeah yeah the airline of the Year one is
pretty cool so over at Yahoo labs
they're they're trying to get that
accessible to two more phones so that's
awesome because I don't have that on my
phone
no and you could have it right in there
on your phone yeah so don't have to
remember a passcode every time
was it three yeah so many
do you wanna hear about the kitchen of
the future yeah of course the video is
pretty cool okay so this is a project a
student project that IKEA sort of helped
collaborate on and then also IDEO
designs which is a London design firm
they did this concept kitchen 2025 so
they asked some students from two
European universities to answer the
question what will kitchens be like in
2025 but looks pretty standard right
kind of like a little IKEA kitchen no
hardware but yeah Harvester yeah okay
and they they gave them some parameters
they said in designing this kitchen keep
things in mind keep in mind that in 10
years we're gonna make some assumptions
about the world there's gonna be an
aging population fewer children smaller
living spaces food scarcity we might see
meat be a little bit more scarce around
the world and also recycling would be
almost required so they gave them
there's some sort of rules to kind of go
by those are good there's a good rules
because I think those are pretty good
predictions for the for the next ten
years so they displayed this and
attempted to make the tech inside the
kitchen really subtle so they were like
okay we want to make this subtle we want
to make it something that is familiar to
modern eyes like us right current eyes
but something that we would also get a
lot out of in the future in ten years so
they also wanted to blend in workspace
tech so here's what they did they have
this really awesome smart table and the
table has induction in it so you're able
to heat up different pieces of the table
now again this is not real it's all it's
a design it's a concept this is just
total conjecture but there's also a
camera that is above and and pointing
down at the table and then also
projection technology so you can see
there's like little trails for the kid
pushing his car now somebody puts
tomatoes on there okay well I also have
this so okay here are some things I can
make with those items together if you
bring them push them together okay well
here is these things that I can make
here's these two recipes that are so
good for like a bachelor that doesn't
know how to cook stuff it's really
awesome and also for just like oh I have
some leftover this and some leftover
that's like what can I do with this and
so you can put it together and oh here's
what you make so they also have lots of
different things like they have these
these sort of magazines they have they
were saying that one of the things they
want to do is they want to do timers
they want to be able to do a thing where
you can recharge your phone they want to
show you how to slice things how to do
everything they say okay well I want to
start heating up one of these pots like
okay here's we're gonna make pancakes
like so here's this video they say
pancakes okay two eggs here's the milk
we're measuring it inside the projection
and then also the flour and then once
that's done you mix it together and then
it heats up a specific part of the wood
for induction that you can make your Pig
that's really cool but the hololens
could probably do this too
I was thinking the same thing I was
thinking the same that's here this year
yeah I just know I like the induction
thing though it could be really
dangerous but so so what were the
workarounds for like the meats and they
have anything so I think part of that
kitchen was like they say okay so here
you go so you'd move it to a specific
part of the range I would show you this
is where yeah this is where you need to
move it to here's and then they would
heat it up to a specific temperature or
whatever then you put your stuff in
there and cook it cool so so yeah I
thought that was really neat and they
also have this really cool that one safe
space to that because ultimately gonna
start running it like if you live in a
city like you're gonna think about New
York yeah like if you could just not
have that count like a counter and a
stove you could work it works and they
also made it a workspace so they were
saying they have like you put your
coffee down it would keep your coffee
warm just in that little tiny spot you
put your phone down you'd slide it on to
the charging station it would by
induction charge your phone they have
all these different things you could do
like there is this the this kids drawing
something and then they're gonna bring
it to life with the projection and then
be able to like flinging around the
table no so yeah I thought this is
really neat I thought it's a really good
idea I mean obviously it's very lofty
this is not something we'll probably see
in ten years but but I keya's kitchen
and dining range manager says that the
project will be used in future product
development so maybe we'll see sort of
echoes of these types of things and
going forward in the future pretty cool
really IKEA maybe really you're gonna
make some super high-tech stuff we might
see like some projection stuff that
would be kind of cool
but you know they could maybe IKEA will
do something in conjunction with
hololens maybe it'll say we are working
with Microsoft to bring you the kitchen
in the future that's something I could
definitely see happening just usually
when I think of the lowest to end of
furniture
no offense IKEA I love you that's I
think of IKEA so if they make that big
step that would be awesome like if
they're making like affordable super
high-tech type of stuff on it there
could be partnerships so I mean that's
the thing that may or may not happen in
the future but I just thought was really
neat wanted to show it's a cool contest
it was like for students or they just it
wasn't even a contest they just said we
want to do this design project for
students they picked students from two
different universities and they said
here are sort of the assumptions about
life in ten years that we you'll have to
deal with go forth and create the
kitchen of the future wow that's very
cold I mean behind that that's super
cool like all right guys that is it for
our headlines we will be right back
it is Tuesday so it's time for new
releases there's a pretty big one this
week and then that I'm sure you're all
familiar with and then of course we have
your user feedback and our photogra for
the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily oh oh and watch these
humans as cats in viral videos
welcome back to the show we're just
shaking our fists at the sky a beautiful
drum footage very frustrating very
annoying we should have a drone in this
studio do some some overhead footage for
us Logan is a drone though drone is a
that Logan is actually a flying drone he
is a sentient flying right Logan
unmanned Erik unmanned aerial vehicle
that's that's a Logan Asst we haven't
told you guys yet I'm sorry secrets out
cats out of the bag
uh you know it's Tuesday I know you love
Tuesdays because it's time to talk about
all the fun things that we're gonna be
checking out this week so it's new
releases there's nothing coming out this
week all right so now we go to user
feedback just kidding this week if you
this has been a long time coming the
adventure the adventure game from Double
Fine that's where your star token age
all right
act to just drop Oh double fine so
Double Fine fangirl listen I bought a
goggle or shirt it's coming in at the
end of May I'm very excited I'm percent
sure what that is so this is the second
act to the Double Fine adventure which
was backed on Kickstarter it they asked
for 400,000 they got like three point
three million dollars Elijah Wood voice
is one of the main characters finally
act to such amazing it's really good
apparently from what I have heard I
haven't played it yet I downloaded it
last night but didn't have time to dig
into it but I played the first half it's
a gorgeous it's a gorgeous puzzle game
its it reminds me of all the best old
kind of point-and-click adventure games
um it's great and but the other thing is
is that it's also really freaking hard
sometimes like it's it can be really
tough the puzzles are really tight as a
someone who plays a lot of people it's
like it's even hard for you yeah there
are some there are some things in this
because you see switch back and forth
between the girl and the boy like
they're their characters they have
different stories that kind of crash
together at the end of the first act I'd
only give anything away but they crash
together at the end of the first act and
then in the second act as far as I'm
aware you're gonna spend a lot of time
kind of going back and forth between
them to sort of catch little clues and
like subtle references to how to solve a
puzzle on the other side of like the
like you might be
world yeah it's like really crazy so how
many rocks are there just to this is the
second half of yeah yeah and apparently
this is twice as long as the first act
so a lot of people are feeling you know
pretty positive about it
so a broken age Act two is out on steam
so you know pick that up a um you know I
don't know if to top of my head because
I backed it so they just I've been
waiting for it forever so I'm I just got
my little coat or whatever for backing
it yeah full disclosure I back that on
Kickstarter a missile shocker I know
it's only on what it's on a steam it's
on PC oh all right so they'll also I'm
sure released broken age now that it's
like a full complete game they'll
release it on other other cool platforms
and on alright broken age is also on I
think it's on iOS as well so an Android
they have it up across a bunch of
platforms because they raised so much
money yeah so that's the only release
that's coming out this week no no to
your user feedback
dang it Carol no um Tropico 5 comes out
if you're into Sims have you're in a sim
games your play traffic oh I did this on
purpose yeah yes it's working it's
working any I hope it's working not
tráfico 5 look how beautiful is this
it's just like sitting oh my god your
tropical my weekend is spent right here
you're never gonna do anything else this
weekend you're not you're gonna be so
excited about tropical your Night Watch
you're a little island and you're gonna
build it all out it's gonna be great
yeah Tropico is really good at making
commercial I don't know you've seen the
ads where it's like stalling dancing see
those those are really good so this has
been out actually for about a year but
it's finally out on ps4 so there are
some people I saw online that we're like
alright so a new release on ps4 cool ok
and that's it you know it's the Avengers
age of Ultron I've already bought your
ticket this is an indie film very small
very small budget I'm really hoping that
maybe it gets seen by somebody I mean
seriously if you've not bought your
tickets for this you're screwed you're
not seeing it this weekend that's mine
it's selling out everywhere at least in
Los Angeles from what I've looked at
even on the reserved seating places but
yeah get your tickets now to go see this
cuz you know it's it's definitely
something you're going to see want to
see it yeah you're gonna want to see it
and I've heard Cale and I have both
heard maybe maybe don't see it in 3d
maybe see it in 2d because the transfer
not as good don't see in 3d that's
what's it like I still think if you're
gonna go see a movie like this you need
to see it like opening day or the shirts
you need to see it when everybody's
screaming and excited and shouting these
are events the the Avengers aren't just
like oh yeah such Sunday 4:00 p.m. was
born I was eating below my barians film
this is a film you have to experience
with other nerds go see it this weekend
wait in a line if you have to I got
reserved seating finest theater with
reserved seating that's my favorite I
bought my tickets like last week I don't
think that's like a universal thing no
it's not but there are a lot of years
switching over to that which is cool so
I'm like I'm literally like middle
Center dead center of the theater for a
line and I bought him two weeks ago so I
can walk in five minutes before the
movie starts sit down and I'm good yeah
if you're awesome at procrastinating
you're gonna have a terrible week or
have a terrible time seeing an age of
Ultron you're gonna be playing Tropico 5
that's what you're doing all right
I think now it is actually time for user
feedback Avengers age of Ultron coming
out this weekend you guys had some
interesting things to say about Konami
so much so that one of our users
actually sent in a pretty long email and
I didn't want to condense it so I'm
actually gonna read it on tomorrow's
show and we'll discuss but it did I say
one thing that I realized last night is
that Silent Hill fans deserved Silent
Hill said because we've been kicked
through the mud it's we've been fans of
just like the core of the game and not
an actually like solid one and I'm
stepping like I'm stepping out there
they haven't been amazing I've been
great be honest what we deserved it can
I give you a suggestion and alternate
maybe an alternate don't say fiddle
frame I was gonna say fatal frame it's
not gonna cut it for me
I like middle frame I think it's gonna
be really good this one I feel is gonna
be maybe the strongest fatal frame be up
next with the page I'm sure I'm sure
but Silent Hill is is actually in my DNA
no you actually blood shake Silent Hill
around it's just really upsetting um
okay so we got to talk about Konami
yesterday we asked you guys use hashtag
TV Konami like I said
split it up into two days we read your
bullets your bullets tweets in
tomorrow's tweets on Thursday show we'll
do it all together we find Michael wrote
in he tweeted us and he said as long as
I get Metal Gear Solid I'm happy but my
guess is they don't want to list any
fiscal info with the SEC team Konami
okay so um that makes sense
so maybe they don't want to show that
maybe they've been losing money maybe
they want to tell us market so they
they're maybe not doing so hot that
might be thing that maybe they don't
want to show revenues things like that
well again their slot machine their slot
machine divisions doing way better so so
we'll talk about that tomorrow cuz
there's they're like the guy who wrote
in wrote a very long email and it's
really good and like I said it was so
interesting I didn't want to cut it up
so we'll read it tomorrow but Neil wrote
an new new dad Neil Neil Neil Gill you
know our dad oh yeah fresh fresh dad
Neil yeah real Ronan says straight to
the point
the whole traditional Japanese game
market is in serious danger becoming
defunct some companies such as Square
Enix and even Sega are adapting by using
Western developers and business
practices others like Konami and Capcom
are slower to change and I truly believe
this is the reason companies are
suffering Konami in particulars failing
because as crazy as Kojima is considered
he's one of the few Japanese developers
that embrace the Western culture and
integrated it into his games Konami
wants the money but doesn't want to move
away from the anime boobs and pachinko
machines no this pachinko machine first
of all pachinko machines are awesome
yeah I know he's definitely right about
the whole like because like suda51 never
does that great no more like Capcom
seemed like he made a good point Capcom
and Konami are kind of in the same sort
of boat where it's like they're kind of
middling right now and nobody really
knows what's gonna happen and you know
we'll see well it's not like they've
been really knocking a park with their
Resident Evil games true HD remake
that's a pretty cool idea yeah but
that's a remake I mean I'll give me
something fresh give me something new I
don't want I'm timing my nostalgia
reserves are getting dangerously low
like I need some new stuff guys like I
love listen I love adaptations of comic
books I love I love all these comic book
shows and movies we're getting I love
all these some of the remakes
they're okay some
and like and a lot of these like book
adaptation of a great like Hunger Games
but guys where's my new stuff like I
want something new on my nostalgia is
low I'm done I don't have any left I've
no nostalgia excitement to give about
things it's fair I'm not to ration out
now I've so many games all that indie
game world that's why I love indie game
so much that's right that's why you're
double fine lady that's why I enjoy what
Double Fine does now am I happy that it
took them so long to get out a game that
we gave three night three almost three
and a half million dollars - yes no no
not super thrilled about that but it is
a really good game and I'd rather have
it late than never
I'd rather have people making those
games and being a little and being late
on the development cycle as opposed to
never being able to have those games
because they're so good so there you go
so that's it for user feedback we'll get
to the last Konami email tomorrow
because it's really good um okay so that
being said we got to talk about our
phone talker for the day sorry I was
doing stuff on the break I know he was
kale also likes to rape during the break
Hanna's glow sticks out but he threw
them right before we came back I had a
spirit hood and everything it was crazy
he plays very paranoid in tomorrow yes
Thursday maybe Thursday Thursday it
comes off the rails Thursday oh where
spirit hood carlos wrote in and said i
took this picture of my city
i'm gonna try really hard to pronounce
this carlos and don't make fun of you me
if I mess it up okay I'm gonna give you
a chance to do it to hear uh tegu Ted
Gucci Java I think that's what it is
Tegucigalpa Tegucigalpa is that what you
got you feel yeah yeah yeah okay
Tegucigalpa Honduras from my boyfriend's
apartment using the panorama mode of my
iphone six-plus greetings from here I
love your show so yeah that's that's
Honduras threadable that looks so cool I
like I like how it's you know it's
really I like how it's so kind of urban
and rural at the same time yeah like you
get kind of that feeling that you're in
a really you're in a big city but it's
also kind of like people have space
mm-hmm I like that like that a lot
