CNET's here at CES 2015 we're taking a
look at this it's Sony's brand-new
television
it's the XBR X 900 CE so this is a 4k TV
so a very high resolution the one we're
looking at here is a 65 inch TV but it
also comes in 55 inch or 75 inch
versions the demo footage they've got
running here certainly looks very good
but it's actually the side of the TV
that's a little more exciting if you
move around you can see that it's
extremely thin sony says this is its
thinnest LED TV ever at its slimmest
point it's just four point nine
millimeters deep unfortunately as you
can see it's not that thin all the way
down but Sony does say that if you're
into wall mounting this thing's gonna
hang very very flush to the wall
obviously it has all your Smart TV
modern conveniences and this TV actually
runs Google's mobile operating system
that's Android lollipop it's coming out
in the spring there's no pricing yet but
as a new very fancy TV expect it to cost
a pretty penny it's definitely a
good-looking TV but there's so much
competition out there at the moment in
televisions from the likes of Samsung or
LG that we're really looking for Sony to
be very competitive as well so stay
tuned for the full review I'm Luke
