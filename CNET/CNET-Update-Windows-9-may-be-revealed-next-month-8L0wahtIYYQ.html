reveals windows 9 I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your seen that update are you
ready for our new windows microsoft is
working on updating the often criticized
windows 8 operating system and sources
say that we'll see the new and improved
windows 9 near the end of September the
verge has a source pinning the big
reveal on September 30th now you may
have heard this next version referred to
by the codename threshold it's supposed
to include features that make windows
easier to use on non touch screen
devices it should bring a new mini Start
menu kill the charms bar and even bring
in Cortana that's the voice command
assistant that debuted on Windows Phones
but even though this preview of windows
9 will be revealed in a month the final
formal version won't likely be released
until the spring of next year the cell
phone carriers keep coming up with new
promotions and lower priced plans to win
you over verizon now has a sixty dollar
a month plan for individuals and you get
two gigs of data with that which is a
thirty dollar price drop in what it used
to be sprint also has a new sixty dollar
a month plan but it's unlimited data but
there are some catches you either have
to use your existing phone or either pay
the full price of a new phone in monthly
installments its twenty dollars less
than what t-mobile offers in its
unlimited plan but t-mobile is
countering it by offering unlimited plan
upgrades and credit when you recruit
your friends to switch to t-mobile and
speaking of cell phones if your phone
can't keep a charge maybe you'll want to
wear your charger as a bracelet the cue
bracelet is a high fashion bangle that
snaps apart to reveal charging ports for
either an apple lightning connector or a
microUSB the battery inside holds enough
juice to recharge an iphone 5s up to
sixty percent it comes in several sizes
and metallic designs the company is
taking pre-orders now for eighty dollars
and it's expected to ship out
mid-december but if you don't want to
wait that long there are other universal
charger wrist bands out there like this
$25 model you can find listed on
thinkgeek and amazon but some users
complain of their risk getting hot while
they recharge
and it doesn't quite hold a charge for
everyone but our wait to see if the cue
bracelet solves that problem if you want
a new mobile game to get hooked on this
is the app you're looking for disney
released star wars commander which
mimics the popular game clash of clans
where players build up armies and towns
to battle one another but in the Star
Wars twist it will have a storyline that
takes place in the time of the original
trilogy where you fight with the Rebel
Alliance or the Galactic Empire it's
available now on apple's app store
that's your tech news update you can
always find more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
