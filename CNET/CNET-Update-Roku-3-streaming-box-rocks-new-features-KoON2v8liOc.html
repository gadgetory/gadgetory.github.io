I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update there's a new roku streaming box
out now the roku 3 costs $99 same as the
previous roku XS model but this upgrade
has a faster processor and it comes with
headphones that you can plug into the
remote so you can listen to your shows
in private without bothering other
people in the room it also has a new
interface that makes it easier to scroll
through channels now you see 9 channels
at once compared to five on the old menu
and the older Roku models will also be
seeing this new menu in April if you're
unfamiliar with the Roku there are
hundreds of apps on the streaming box
you can access your subscription
services like Netflix and Amazon you can
watch free videos such as on the cnet
channel and there are even some games
you can play with the remote if you
don't already have a game console at
home and you want to stream video to
your TV the Roku is a great way to dive
into that world if you do have a Roku
and you happen to be a time warner cable
subscriber the Roku can replace your
cable box on your secondary TV there's a
time warner cable channel on the roku
that just came out and if you plug in
your subscriber info you can access all
your live TV channels the only thing is
that you don't get a channel guide and
you don't get to pause and rewind or get
on demand but it beats paying a monthly
fee to rinse another cable box google+
launched a layout redesign of course
it's right before facebook announces its
redesign google+ now has larger cover
photos the About tab has separate fields
you can edit and there's a new tab for
local reviews so you can list your
favorite restaurants Facebook will
launch its new look Thursday but early
reports suggest the change will be how
you can sort your newsfeed to look
through just photos or just the updates
about music so that way you can discover
more posts and hang around longer last
year Google relaunched the Android
Market under the name google play and to
celebrate the one year anniversary it's
offering a week of deals and discounts
on mac
jeans books videos music and apps so be
sure to check that out and also keep
your eye on the app called folk like
soap but with an F it pays users for
taking photos but it just stepped up its
game with a feature called missions
companies send users on a mission to
take a specific photo of something and
the best photos get cash or prizes it's
a cheap way for a brand to get lots of
creative photos of customers using their
products but that reward better be good
for people to make it worth their time
that's your tech news update you can
find more details on all these stories
