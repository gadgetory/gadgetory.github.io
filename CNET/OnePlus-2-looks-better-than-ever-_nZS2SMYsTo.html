for cnet and this my friends is the one
plus two you'll notice right off the bat
that the phone is pretty big in fact it
has a 5.5 inch 1080p HD display you'll
also notice that it has a metal rim all
around its side unlike the first
iteration of the phone the one plus one
which was made of polycarbonate around
the edging so this definitely looks more
premium on the back you've got a 13
megapixel camera with a larger sensor
than before so low light picture should
be a lot better up here above that is
dual LED flash and you've got laser
focus right underneath this button on
the left spine is called the alert
slider so you can just slide that up
down or to the middle to adjust your
notification settings and on the front
end here the home button also doubles as
a fingerprint reader one plus is custom
oxygen interface rides on top of android
5.1 here which is what it will ship with
inside you've got a 1.8 giga hertz octa
core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor
which is pretty top of the line you can
remove the back cover either to swap in
another cover or to add one of two SIM
cards to the sim card slots there is no
removable battery and there's no microSD
card storage instead the phone comes
with two options 64 gigabytes or 16
gigabytes also if you follow these
things you'll be excited to know that
this phone has USB type-c at the bottom
as its charging connector now if you
aren't into the original sandstone
colored backing which is sort of like no
blue charcoal grey looking you can buy
other covers aftermarket including
bamboo and Kevlar we got our hands on
the one plus two so for even more
information check out our impressions at
