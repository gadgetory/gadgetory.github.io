that's been used in the best looking TVs
we've seen to date but how does the tech
differ from regular TVs and what do you
need to know OLED televisions produce
their images via a different
technological process to other kinds of
TVs and we at CNET's have been very fond
of the results with the first OLED TV we
reviewed producing the best picture
quality we've ever seen but to
understand what makes OLED different you
first need to know how pictures are
created in an LCD TV which is the
technology in common use today at the
back of LCD TVs there's a backlight
which shines light through liquid
crystals which acts a bit like shutters
either allowing light through or not
depending on the current that's run
through them red green and blue color
filters put over the top make up an
individual tiny on screen pixel capable
of producing any color contributing to
an overall visible picture on the screen
our LED uses that same color combining
principle but the big difference is that
there's no backlight instead light is
generated by organic compounds that glow
when a current is applied some OLED
designs including one favored by LG use
white LEDs overlaid with red green and
blue filters but the common trait is
that OLED displays don't need a
backlight so why the better picture well
it's because each pixel can be shut off
when there's no current flowing the
pixel appears completely black this
extremely high contrast between light
and dark makes for a lovely image and we
found beats the picture quality on sets
that use backlight even though TV makers
have found clever ways to dim back
lights in LCD TVs to make darker parts
of the screen as black as possible OLED
screens can also be made very thin and
have wide viewing angles and the tech
can also be put to use in bending or
transparent displays OLED is yet to go
mainstream however and there aren't many
TV makers using this technology plus it
remains very expensive so our LEDs
commercial future is uncertain but
having been deeply impressed with TVs
that use it we certainly hope we see
cheaper sets at a range of prices in
years to come that should be all you
need to know for an introduction to OLED
for much more on TVs and all things tech
stay tuned to seen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
