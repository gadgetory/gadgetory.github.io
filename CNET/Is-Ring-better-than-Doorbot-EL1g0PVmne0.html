appliances here on this chilly December
morning on my front porch with ring this
is a 199 dollar Wi-Fi enabled video
doorbell so here's how it works
whenever someone rings rings doorbell
you will get a push notification on your
phone Android or iOS and then it will
link you to a live video stream so you
can actually see who is at your front
door and talk to them be a two-way talk
this may also unfamiliar to you because
ring is actually a rebranded door bot if
you remember door bot I tested here on
my front door and experienced a lot of
issues with its video quality and it's
2-way talk functionality given all the
issues I had with door bot and all the
problems that a lot of people seem to
have with door bot ring is a definite
improvement
I received my push alerts within 5 to 10
seconds sometimes it varied and would go
a little bit higher but the average was
a few seconds so there wasn't a huge lag
time and the video quality was much
better they did bump it up to 720p which
could be a problem if you have low
bandwidth it could cause some pixelation
and some other sort of problems when
you're trying to view a video but
overall I had a pretty good experience I
did test ring at two different locations
to see if there were differences between
Wi-Fi connections proximities two
routers and so on here at my house I
didn't notice a bit longer lag time and
the video quality wasn't quite as good
at the other location I did notice that
the video quality was a bit better and
that the push notifications seemed a
little bit faster from the time I rung
the belt when I received them on my
phone so it will vary depending on your
Wi-Fi connection if you're a door bot
user ring is a definite improvement but
I would still hold out for my sky Bell
review I am testing that next it is a
direct ring competitor and it has some
very interesting features including
motion alerts that I think might make it
a promising addition to the Wi-Fi
enabled
video doorbell realm thanks for watching
this video of ring be sure to check out
