Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded programmers who use Adobe
Flash to make professional online games
we'll have to start giving Adobe a piece
of the profits adobe released a new
version of its flash player and with it
a new plan to make this browser plugin a
source of revenue for the company now
downloading a flash player is still free
for consumers who want to watch videos
or play a game rather this new cost is
for game makers that use the advanced
flash tools to design an online game and
once that online game makes more than
fifty thousand dollars it'll have to pay
out nine percent of net revenue back to
Adobe but not every game made with flash
will have to pay there's no extra charge
for developers to turn a flash game into
a standalone smartphone app for the iOS
or Android operating system the other
day we reported a story where a consumer
group in Australia was taken apple to
court over the new iPad the complaint
was that the new iPad is being sold as a
4G advice but it doesn't work with
Australia's 4G network in fact the iPad
4g speed only works in the US and canada
well now apple says it is willing to
issue refunds to ipad buyers down under
who feel they've been misled over that
4g label apple also said it would put up
clarification online and in stores about
the iPads 4G compatibility the leader of
the Autobots optimus prime has lost the
battle against computer maker isus
hasbro the Toymaker behind the
Transformers franchise filed a lawsuit
against a sous last year when it
launched a tablet called the transformer
prime hasbro argued that a sous blended
the transformers and optimus prime names
the consumers would think the tablet is
associated with the popular toy line and
it would hurt the Transformers brand to
further the argument the transformers
cartoon series is called Transformers
Prime and in the third film one of the
transformers turned itself into a lenovo
laptop so consumers might think a
transformer can be tied to a computer
line but a judge ruled that not to be
the case and a sous can keep selling its
transformer prime tablet President
Barack Obama is pinning the president
has added yet another social network to
his campaign the popular virtual
pinboard site Pinterest his profile has
boards like
Obama inspired recipes where you can
learn his family's chili recipe the page

supporters the president on the campaign
trail and Obama 2012 merchandise the new

4,600 followers no Republican candidates

Romney's wife Ann Romney did debut her
own Pinterest page last month those are
your headlines for today I'm Bridget
