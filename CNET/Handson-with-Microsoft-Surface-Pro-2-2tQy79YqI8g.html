a look at the new microsoft surface pro
2 this is the second generation of
Microsoft's Windows 8 slate the original
version was one of our favorite of the
first gen of windows 8 slates because it
had a full core i5 processor and a
really clever keyboard cover we keep all
that with this new version in fact it's
pretty much the same size the same
weight the biggest difference to the
body is the kick stand in the back
course you pull out the kickstand now
like the surface to it has a second
angle so you can go like this that's
especially important if you're trying to
use it on your lap or you're sitting up
a little bit higher of course you can go
back to the original like this
internally the biggest change is these
guys have moved to Intel's latest
generation of processes we call that the
fourth-generation core i series you
might also hear that refer to as Haswell
and what that gives you is it's a modest
performance improvement but the most
important thing is the battery life
boost you should get a lot better
battery life with the new chips and
microsoft says they've done a lot of
tweaking inside to give you additional
battery life gains on top of that so
that plus the Haswell will hopefully
give you an all-day tablet that you can
take on a plane with you or just use in
a coffee shop all day long without
having to plug it in now one of my
favorite things about the surface
returns and it is the type and touch
covers this is the type cover it's a
removable keyboard cover that has actual
physical Island style keys you can use
and it snaps on just like this comes in
a bunch of colors a big improvement to
the original type cover is that this is
it's a little bit thinner but it's
backlit and I love backlit keyboards and
the light is actually pretty bright it
turns on automatically in low light
situations and of course when you're
ready to go since the keyboard is
magnetic you just close it like this
close the kickstand and then you have a
very portable package you can just take
with you like that and then of course
you're set up to use it just like that
the surface pro 2 is going to be
available at the end of October and
start just like the surface pro 1 did at
899 i'm dan ackerman and that is
microsoft surface pro 2
