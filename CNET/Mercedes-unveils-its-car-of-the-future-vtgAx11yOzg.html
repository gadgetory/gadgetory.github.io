I'm proud to introduce Mercedes Benz
vision of the car of the future
this is our concept car for15 luxury in
motion and it will have a tremendous
impact cars will be rethought in terms
of shape and design in terms of outside
interaction in the terms of inside
interaction the idea is about designing
the entire car around the advantages of
autonomous driving while making use of
the added room you have in an electric
car without the engine and transmission
now there's a reason of course by most
robots to have puppy-like men shaped
faces just like cambot they look
familiar and friendly to real humans and
thus create trust and social acceptance
autonomous driving cars need to achieve
this as well but I think you agree that
a happy smiley face would really look
weird on a luxury sedan that's why
autonomous cars will need to find
different ways to actively communicate
with the outside world
fo 15 has a suggestion here as wrong
let's see this
thank you but this car does not only
take design and detection to another
level it also has a lot to offer on the
inside let's have a look at that
interior now
as first glance in the interior you will
realize the for15 has fewer buttons then
your smartphone zero what we have seen
on the outside continues on the inside
see sometimes it still needs a human
here we go
thank you again it's clean and clear
digital and real-world plant without
boundaries windows can be used as
screens the car also features a steering
wheel which again represents the
Traverse freedom of choice to drive or
chill while on the go by the way as the
car will drive itself in most
circumstances we won't talk about Travis
anymore
it's more about guests travelers
passengers or let's say conductors like
the conductor of an orchestra everything
is geared by gestures eye tracking and
further interactive elements that
surround the passengers plus I don't
have to tell you that this car offers
every bit of state-of-the-art technology
in video conferencing social media in
the equation and whatever else you might
desire to spend time with on the road in
the future as you can see mercedes-benz
fo fifteen luxury motion does not only
look different from the outside it also
offers completely new opportunities to
spend and enjoy the time commuting from
home to the office and back because as I
said before quality time and private
space will be the true luxury goods in
the future and for15 luxury in motion is
the third place that offers people
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
