Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update twitter has finally released its
music discovery app but it had a glitchy
start twitter music which you can try on
the web or as an itunes app lets you
listen to songs that are being shared on
Twitter it could be from the people or
the artists you follow or just which
shared across the whole network it
offers a way to get a quick preview of a
song but you can listen to the full
track by connecting it to a Spotify or
Rdio account there were some problems
getting that to work you also could
tweet about a song directly from Twitter
music but that too has its buggy moments
not to mention typos Twitter music also
showcases the big name artists that you
follow and if you don't really care to
use twitter to follow musicians this can
prove to be kind of embarrassing take it
from me I found it fascinating to
discover that's some time in my twitter
life span i clicked follow on Billy Ray
Cyrus I have no idea why or how but
clearly I need to go and add some
artists now to save my cool cred Twitter
began teasing this service last week by
giving access to a few celebrities
Twitter music is still very new but it's
got an uphill battle to get people to
take the time to use this in addition to
the other music services they use in
other social media news facebook
continues to roll out new features to
its users many of you may be now getting
the option to add expressive faces to
show how you're feeling or icons to show
an activity like watching a show or
reading a book facebook also launched
its open graph search for mobile the
first units of Google glass are starting
to arrive for developers and chosen
high-profile users that pay fifteen
hundred dollars to be among the first
with the computer eyewear but don't plan
on buying one off ebay or even borrow it
from a friend Google's Terms of Service
ban owners from reselling loaning or
transferring the headset to another
person and if they discover you did
Google can deactivate the glass harsh
you've heard the reports and rumors that
Apple is working on a cheaper plastic
iPhone well here's another report that
could back it up this blog cactus just
put up a photo claiming this is a
plastic version
an iPhone you never know who you can
trust on these reports but it's
interesting nonetheless technology
changes fast but icons typically don't
take for example the save icon
traditionally it looks like this but in
a recent survey of elementary school
kids eighty-six percent of students had
no idea that this is a floppy disk the
survey was done to celebrate National
Library Week they were also asked which
was invented first a computer folder or
paper folder seventy-nine percent got it
right that's your tech news update you
