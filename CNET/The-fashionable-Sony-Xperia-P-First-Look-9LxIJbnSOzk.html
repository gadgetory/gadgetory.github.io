and today we're taking a first look at
the Sony Xperia P as the middle device
in Sony's next line of Android
smartphones for 2012 the Xperia P looks
a lot like its bigger brother the Sony
Xperia S at four 7999 however the
unlocked Xperia P costs about eighty
dollars less yet has a more thoughtful
and attractive design first it's
slightly smaller and about an ounce
lighter than its bigger brother second
the phone's aluminum body has a more
premium feel in my view than the Xperia
S has plastic construction I also like
how the clear bar running along the
bottom of the Xperia P uses capacitive
buttons that actually sit on top of
their associated icons the Xperia S
annoyingly places them above these
symbols in the form of heart to see dots
other features include a four-inch
screen that uses what sony calls its
white magic technology basically a way
to pump up its brightness the expiry
also links to Sony's Entertainment
Network letting you buy rent and stream
music movies and TV shows above the
screen is a VGA front-facing camera
below is Sony's signature clear bar
that's found on all the new next series
handsets the left side holds ports for
micro USB HDMI and a micro sim card slot
hidden under a flap on the top is a
standard 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
while on the right are controls for
volume power plus a dedicated camera
button what's also nice is that the
camera key will wake the camera app even
if the phone is asleep finally around
back is a 8 megapixel camera with LED
flash there are some things that will
disappoint hard core android users here
the Xperia P still runs android 2 dot 3
Gingerbread and is powered by an aging 1
gigahertz dual-core processor as a
result performance can be choppy and
sluggish I'm Brian Bennett and this has
been a first look at the Sony Xperia P
