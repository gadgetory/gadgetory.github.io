upstairs in the reading nook where we've
decided to install some smart shades
while there are quite a few options out
there we decided to go with Lutron's
sarena shades while they're a little bit
pricey they have some really cool
integration features first off they're
homekit compatible which means that you
can use Siri to control them with your
voice Siri lower the upstairs shades
okay I said all of the upstairs shades
to zero but unlike some home compatible
devices these will also work with
Android phones so if you get the app you
can actually set it up with IFFT to work
with Alexa
so with Amazon echo you can also get
good voice control the LexA trigger bed
time sending that to lift the smart
shades that I have set up now are
basically able to double as smart
lighting and smart temperature control I
can issue voice commands with Siri or
Alexa but my upstairs nest thermostat
will also track the temperature so if it
gets too hot the shades will
automatically close to keep out some of
the sunlight Plus aside from some of the
basic offerings like being able to
schedule the blinds or set up very
simple triggers you can also take
advantage of geofencing so if I decide
to run out to the store for example the
shades will automatically close to keep
out some of the sunlight and keep the
temperature normal but when I get back
they open back up and the room lights up
again I really like setting up these
shades in this reading nook up here
because it's one of the spaces that I
use the most of the smart home but I
really won't be willing to commit to one
type of shade for the whole CNET smart
home until I see some progress in a
couple of areas in particular I'd like
to see some of the prices drop for some
basic shades like these there are about
$350 a pop that's just too much I'd also
like to see some deeper in app
interoperability right now you can do
some pretty cool integration but that's
only possible via third-party apps like
IFFT for instance homekit scenes are not
the same thing as Lutron app scenes so
you can't actually activate scenes in
the Lutron app using Siri which is also
a major problem now I'm not totally
committed
the idea of having homekit enabled
shades in particular but until another
company or Lutron really decides to make
these three big changes then the
upstairs reading nook of the CNET smart
home is going to be the only area that
has smart shades</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
