sony xperia z2 it's sony's latest
flagship super phone and as a flagship
it of course comes with a full HD
display it has a 20 point seven
megapixel camera that can shoot 4k video
a supercharged quad-core processor and a
sleek waterproof body it's critically
very similar to last year's dead one
with its glass front and back and the
aluminium edging no complaints from me
there as those premium materials make
this bone both look and feel
ultra-luxurious it slightly larger
thanks to its 5.2 inch display but it
has slimmer bezels around the screen
meaning that it's still fairly
comfortable to hold it is of course
completely waterproof not only
protecting it from spilled drinks but
also allowing you to easily watch
Netflix in the shower the Zed to use
display is superb it's of course full HD
making small tech slip pin-sharp it's
also very bright has great colors and
good viewing angles not a bad combo
there Sony inside is running on the
latest Android KitKat software which
sony has tweaked of its own image
galleries and a wide range of themes
that can change the look at the
interface the quad core processor at his
heart is caught as a mighty two point
three gigahertz and there's a very
generous 3 gigabytes of RAM as well it's
incredibly powerful and will blitz
through any of the games you'll find in
a play store along with basically
anything at all you're likely to throw
it on the back is a 20.7 megapixel
camera which is capable of producing
some seriously impressive shots and
there's a whole load of creative extras
like filters and augmented reality toys
to play with it'll also shoot video in
4k resolution it's an impressive claim
but not one that should make you rush
out to buy it just yet sure the quality
of my test footage looks impressive on a
65-inch 4k TV but those 4k TVs are still
extortionate ly expensive so you
probably won't find any real advantage
in filming and such high resolution
particularly as a larger file sizes take
up a lot more space on the phone luckily
though it's video quality at 1080 is
still high and they're stabilizing which
should help smooth out some
handheld shots in general the Zed two
packs everything you'd expect from a
top-end flagship phone it's got a
brilliant screen truckloads of power the
latest software and a sexy design for
waterproofing will be a huge bonus to
the clumsy among you and it's great
camera makes it a solid choice for all
you shutter bugs I'm Andrew Hoyle for
cnet and this is the Sony Xperia z2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
