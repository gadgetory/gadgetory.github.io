refresh and we're going hands-on now
with the latest version at the ephah
tech trade show in Berlin all right this
ereader looks very similar to the
previous paper lights put there are
quite a few changes for starters there's
a new processor that's supposed to be
25% faster than the old model and that's
going to make page turning a lot quicker
the panel has changed as well this is a
new ink panel and the lighting
technology has been upgraded as well so
you can now up the brightness even more
Amazon's thrown in a few software tweaks
as well first up is Wikipedia support
which lets you hold your finger over a
word and look up its meaning or
Wikipedia also every word you look up
will now be put into this flashcard app
called vocab builder to help you
remember the words you might be
struggling with finally there's this
slider app now what this lets you do is
skip around your location in a book
without actually leaving the page that's
handy if there's one page in a book that
you always want to be skipping back to
perhaps a list of the important
characters it's up for pre-order now and
it's going to be shipping in about two
weeks it cost one hundred and nineteen
dollars or a hundred and nine pounds if
you're in the UK please check out more
tech from the ephah trade show by going
