headquarters CEO Mark Zuckerberg put an
end to some persistent rumors today
we're finally gonna talk about that
Facebook phone or more accurately we're
gonna talk about how you can turn your
Android phone into a great simple social
device with its new product that's only
available on certain Android phones the
social network makes a grab at precious
real estate on your mobile device the
home screen is really the soul of your
phone you look at it about a hundred
times a day it sets the tone for your
whole experience and we think that it
should be deeply personal Facebook home
transforms your home screen even if your
phone is locked into a slideshow of
photos and status updates showing you
your newsfeed without ever launching the
Facebook app if you're not a rabid
Facebook user then you might find that
this experience kind of hijacks your
phone and offers up a learning curve
that you have to overcome in order to
use it with another feature chat heads
messaging also infiltrates your phone
buttons with the sender's profile
picture pop up no matter which app
you're currently using just by tapping
on this chat head it pops me into the
conversation and think that's so cool
and so special about this is that this
is all happening right over the article
I'm about to read and write over the app
I'm using so no matter what you're doing
you can just quickly pop into these
conversations a phone was unveiled
but Facebook isn't jumping into Hardware
the new HTC first will be preloaded with
Facebook home this is not a fancy phone
it doesn't have whistles and bells it's
not particularly pretty to see it
doesn't have fancy accents or anything
like that I think it's gonna be a really
tough sell the only nice thing is the
price the phone will run a hundred
dollars but Facebook addicts might
consider the device priceless in San
Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet.com for CBS
