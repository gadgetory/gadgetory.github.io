the DNA we've seen before
let's check out the 2013 XV crosstrek
and check the tech so what exactly is a
Suvi cross track first of all it's a
whole new model for them although it
doesn't fall too far from the familiar
Subaru tree when they sent us as you can
see is a whole mess of orange but we're
okay with that it's a two row there's no
third row option or anything of this
wheelbase and you got a usable cargo box
in the back notice it's also got a high
ride height ample space here for
suspension travel and not terribly
low-profile tires that's a formula that
adds up to a vehicle that is credibly
good in rough pavement or off the road
not just looking like it is first off we
have the optional navigation head unit
in this car this has got a decent size
color LCD and they need the 6.1 inches
because there's an awful lot of junk in
there look how busy that is even if you
put it in the most minimal mode you've
got stuff everywhere if I go to the nav
menu you can see how things are sliding
and moving and going to different modes
the touch response is pretty good it
seems to need kind of a hard press and
you'll find that it's a little bit
cryptic in terms of how you go to
various modes of navigation it's not
always the most obvious thing to get
through and everything is very small and
busy this is not easy to digest at a
glance and that's one of the core sort
of sources of distraction when you've
got technology in the - this is not
great in that respect by any means
now navigation on this guy is powered
kind of like in a Ford by this little SD
card right here pop that out nav goes
away and you might say why would you pop
that out there's no real reason except
they oddly enough give you a photo
viewer also in here which you can use in
place of navigation not sure why you
want to do that except to look at cat
photos that's what I would do cuz I'm
not that crazy about the nav now even if
you get the base car you get all the key
audio sources I like that so
means am/fm satellite bluetooth
streaming and USB which is also
compatible with iPod here in the console
that's really all you need to Jack this
thing up and get this disappointing nav
and HD radio pass in every configuration
I believe you have six speakers around
the cabin there isn't a big difference
in terms of the sound you can get a
dealer-installed subwoofer for like 500
bucks but notice the theme here as I go
through nav and audio lots and lots of
detailed and techie toys this was
designed by geeks for geeks to be used
on their desk in the house this is just
too detailed and too techie and too many
layers for a great automotive interface
now the rear view camera is also part of
this package and you see it's got no
trajectory that is live it just shows
you some distance and curb line marks
you can get that with the nav unit or
you can also option that in with a
higher trim level two ways to get there
and one more thing that annoys me about
how you get some of the options here if
you want to get this little glass
moonroof which I do you have to also get
this Cluj of a navigation head unit
which I don't and you do have voice
command which does a fairly good job of
simplifying this interface let's see how
it works for navigation voice command
please first of all where all the
prompts that show me what I can do from
that screen I can do more than just say
help but it doesn't prompt me to get
there and then notice I've got tabs here
so I have to go through a mix of tabbing
around two different modes to get
prompts and speaking to it that's also
kind of poor interface navigation
navigation
please say a command
destination please say a command address
say the house number anyway you can see
at times it's pretty good at digesting
what I say other times there's just too
many little fussy steps for this voice
command to be as simplifying as it
should be
all right here in the engine bay pretty
standard sube stuff a 2-liter flat for
you know they do flat floors partly
because they sit low in the car in this
car that Canada doesn't matter does it
because the whole cars high and the
engine doesn't seem particularly low to
me either
no turbo charging great thing else a
very straightforward boxer engine they
earned their keep using this one 147
horsepower 145 foot-pounds of torque 0
to 60 I'm certain it will and 25 33 mpg
with the CVT if you get the six-speed
manual it becomes 23 30 mpg quite a hit
and if you get the limited car the hide
rims you only can get the CVT one more
thing where we go for a drive I'm
intrigued by Subarus very precise
tanginess with paint but in this edge
where the color code ends and the primer
is revealed they could not have been 1
micrometer closer and had this car be
ready for production what do they save a
nickel
now driving the crosstrack isn't much
different than driving a lot of other
Subarus the noises it makes the the
steering compliance even the ride or
very sube but what this car does
surprise me on is the relatively direct
application of power it's fairly
straightforward in that respect and
that's a lot of credit to this CVT
continuously variable transmissions are
often a disaster of slush eNOS this
one's actually quite positive in fact I
wasn't sure was a CVT or a standard
automatic when we first got in this car
it feels like it kind of has gears
that's a high compliment and the shifts
here from the paddles are very quickly
executed I've driven a lot of more
expensive cars than this with paddles
shifted automatics that didn't get the
job done as quickly so good work
of course this 2-liter mill doesn't have
overwhelming power but it's it's ready
it's willing power and that's what I
always look for in a car and most
Subarus are like this they're really
kind of Spartan and kind of austere
inside almost German if it weren't for
that kind of overly wrought
unsuccessfully wrought head unit this
would be one of the more handsome clean
cabins on the road today
okay let's price our XV crosstrek this
guy is the limpid trim the high of the
two trims twenty-five three roughly
delivered man there's kind of one option
to go see that style and that is the
package that brings you that nav head
unit in the glass moonroof 1/2 of which
I actually want the other half I don't
so that'll be your call for five hundred
bucks the dealer could install a powered
subwoofer that might be a nice addition
to this system and unfortunately there
is no option to add more paint in the
door jambs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
