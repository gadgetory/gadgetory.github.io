your roof is strong and stays intact
first of all the roof doesn't intrude
and injure passengers or kill them
inside the vehicle but secondly the belt
the airbags the windows and the
windshield have a strong base so they
can stay in place and do their job
keeping you from leaving the car which
is a big problem in rollers only about
2% of the nation's roughly 9 million
annual car accidents are rollovers but
they typically account for an
astonishing 33 percent of fatalities so
say hello to a tougher roof standard
now new federal standards for roof
rollover strength were passed in 2009
they started phasing in September of
2012 and full phase in across the entire
fleet of new vehicles sold in the US as
of 2017 model year cars now before these
new standards that kicked in in 2012 we
go back to 1973 for the last time roof
crushed specs were set and back then the
federal standard was only that it had to
withstand one and a half times the
weight of the vehicle
today that's a poor rating that would
not even be a passing grade
now the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety Awards those coveted rollover
standards based on a test where they
come right here with a big machine that
tries to deflect this part of the roof
five inches total deflection the
question is how much weight does it take
that's where they come up with a ratio
based on the cars weight to get a good
rating which is the best that has to be
a four to one ratio in other words the
roof can support four times the cars
weight of an impact now there are some
downsides to all this additional roof
strength performance a couple trivial
ones and that is there's an estimate
that it costs maybe fifty four dollars
more in your car's MSRP to create all
this stronger structure and sixteen to
sixty-two dollars in additional fuel
consumption due to some added weight
those are small numbers but there is a
bigger concern and that is this as these
pillars get stronger they're getting
thicker
the airbags that are in them the padding
here for federal head impact standards
and the increasing slope for
aerodynamics you've got a visible
University at Michigan that a study that
found these increasingly thick pillar
designs make invisible for a substantial
time a pedestrian who could be in your
path during a typical left turn at an
intersection let's say in the EU such
outward visibility is regulated in the
u.s. it's not the IIHS has roof crush
ratings by car model on its site and
since these new standards are being
phased in it pays to double check so
bottom line when you look at your car
next time and see the roof and the
pillars and think you're just seeing
something to keep the rain out and keep
the glass in place mm-hmm you're looking
at some pretty serious engineering that
has come a long way in a few years
towards saving your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
