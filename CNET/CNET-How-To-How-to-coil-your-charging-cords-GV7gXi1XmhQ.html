get in the way and when you put them in
the draw they come out all tangled hi
I'm Dan Graziano I've got the perfect
solution for you there's a coil cord
this cord takes up less space it's
attractive and will still charge your
phone your tablet and much much more
best of all in this Internet exclusive
offer I'm gonna show you how to make the
coil cord for free you will need a full
length pencil some tape and a hairdryer
to get the job done now let's get
started using a piece of tape so if
you're a one end of your cable to the
end of the pencil leaving about an inch
of cord from the tape spot tightly wrap
the cord around the pencil working your
way to the other end once you've got
about an inch remaining apply another
piece of tape turn on your hairdryer and
keeping it about three to four inches
away begin to heat the cord you should
do this for about two minutes and be
sure to heat the entire cord not just
one side let the cable cool completely
for at least five to 10 minutes then
remove the tape slide out the pencil and
press though one nicely coiled cable
this is an easy DIY project but Prakash
you're applying heat there is the risk
of damaging your cable or shortening its
lifespan for what it's worth the cables
we tested worked immediately following
this process but we can't be sure how
long they may hold up for more how-to
like this one be sure to check out how
to DAP Tina calm you can also reach out
to me on Twitter with any questions or
comments I'm Dan Graziano frissina
