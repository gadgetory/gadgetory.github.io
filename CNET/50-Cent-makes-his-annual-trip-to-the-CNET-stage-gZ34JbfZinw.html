wizard I don't really have to say all
these you know superlatives about you do
I know it's a great great introduction
it's always fun here seeing that so for
me this is my for CES you know I stop by
and see you guys every year I mean it's
close to the point that we get to do
each other on the first name braces
Brian yeah yes yeah 50 Brian I can I go
Curtis though is that too personal oh
you could say nobody don't know who
you're talking about right on so you
know CES you've been here like you said
for years does it ever get old to you
this Vegas ever get old it doesn't it
changes like everything from I watched
in the different areas I'm always some
reason I'm always always like the
television because we go to a fun
entertaining whether it's film
television or music will turn on
different areas and kind of be
entertained by it and I watched the
televisions it went from how big can we
make a screen to how thin could we make
the screen - let's make it curved
towards us curves are kickin
yes changing an audio space i watch
hates us be really big and then we start
to come down to you know it fits without
it being uncomfortable
now we've seen you honestly literally
grow up here at CES with your own
company from the start with an SMS right
how has that journey been for you I mean
really from start to finish
owning or running being behind your own
business in the headphone space well I
mean it's been it's been great for me my
has been interesting the first time I
came I just had a rendering of the
headset and was doing the publicity and
announcing the name of the company and
since then our quiet corner audio and
there were already a profitable company
at about 20 employees and Brian noe who
was the CEO and owner of the actual
company had worked at uh Gillette the
best a man can get about 20 years when
yeah the high executives over there and
then for him it was like a pet project
to be involved and I bought their
company in order to create my vision for
SMS audio and it was able to come
together a lot faster having that team
already put together now you know we've
seen your line evolve and growing I mean
we can talk about a lot of things but
let's just start off with your headphone
line recently announcement the new
partnership going in the second year the
next-generation Star Wars headsets
everybody loves Star Wars right come on
now yes that the Lucas brand is stronger
than people identify with it because I
mean I'm aware of it and I enjoyed the
actual film but what we had scheduled
for projected for the first quarter of
the Star Wars brand of SMS audio
headsets is sold the first two days of
us releasing it so we had to go back and
redo everything and this is the second
generation I expected to be as
successful even more in it if not more
in it and the year closing because the
actual film comes out and reignites all
of the energy around it so it's cool but
people really loved that brand since
1975 and it's pretty difficult to get
them the license anything to Star Wars
cuz they protect it they only want to be
associated with high quality you know
products and having a relationship with
Disney because we create all Disney
products or audio products that you
would purchase from Disney inside of the
stores if it got make you one and I did
it
now also Star Wars bringing some
diversity to the table I mean we saw the
first person of color in a stormtrooper
outfit John boyega I mean you know were
you competing with him for that spot I
would have sworn trooper outfit even fit
you I wasn't trying to be the
stormtrooper I had one different vision
oh you got some Jedi skills go got a
little bit I need one of them beams
right on also another piece of your
lineup here the SMS audio bio Sport
Fitness wearables a big thing here at
CES this measures some of your
biometrics through the headphones right
yes this great collaboration I I worked
with Intel to create the bio sport
version of SMS or do we like earbuds so
I can give you an example if it hasn't
changed the size of the actual airports
but the functionalities of it is a lot
different
these headsets are able to record your
heart rate your distance your pace and
how many calories you've burned like a
like a treadmill you know if you utilize
it for outdoor activity and it's as a
waterproofing technology they prevent it
from being damaged by your sweat or you
know if the weather visually rested by
50 yeah they are managed this right here
passed the test complete you know they
got 12 millimeter drivers in them they
create that good high-quality sound you
know outside of that you know want to
make the the best possible product every
time like I always take the things that
I've come across or the the
imperfections out of products that I've
had in the past and put up the new
products that we create up against that
you know something you know you know you
talk about creation your Creator we're
gonna shift gears a little bit
you know you and Jeannie g-unit released
a recent EP a little while ago beauty of
independence and you have some
statements about just uh the passion of
music and just um you know putting art
out there like it's not about
necessarily numbers and even for you can
you kind of expand upon that a little
bit like technology is changing
everything and because it's changing the
way we consume music eventually we will
be paying for music the way we pay for
cable it'll be one shot and we get
everything all genres and everyone was
pleased by finding something that they
interested in but like my album give it
to - mine is the largest debut and hip
hop album sold over 10 million records
oh it was it's a good one
we love and with the technology shift
you'll never find another artist that
comes behind me they sells more records
for a first album and it's not that
there won't be people who create content
that we all appreciate and enjoy on the
same level but we won't see those
numbers again because it's just
different and now that the technologies
allowing us to do like everything is
shifting is changing like it not just
for for music but as far as film is
concerned they got these drones down the
hallway you would have to rent a
helicopter have a harness and hang out
of it
shoot that that car crossing the bridge
shot and now the drummer's just gonna
fly their comfortably and shoot that
shot for you with no problem and it's
not probably no permit necessary
have you tried have you tried playing
with one of the drones yet how does
anyone immediately yeah yeah immediately
is it I'm so implying it outside they
hold on a second let me see if I get and
ain't that hard so you know I'm sure
it's gonna be that thing there were
places that you know what we did in the
past now another theme here big at CES
we're talking about wearables right
wrist watches finish devices but I want
to talk about a different wearable that
you recently invested in and I don't
know if any of y'all know about he's
already grinning tell us a little bit
about you know your latest venture with
frigo and expects explain it to the
people out there well free goes the
company I was you know I work with guys
actually from Switzerland from Swiss
land is is as a technology in it that it
creates a it's an adjustable pouch in it
for men that allow us to not allow our
men apples to rest beside our legs so it
doesn't create that little odor that
every men it is clearly aware of
regardless if you've been physically
active or not you don't have to tell
everyone out in the open that you have
took your finger and tested to see if
anything was was there but so you're
telling me that you've actually done the
smell test what you heard laughing was
because personally they've tried it on
their own quietly in the past see but
this is just a reality of it is no one
ever thought of creating the technology
that allows it to come under air so it's
your there's a separation between there
will we would create the more extreme
orders on our body in places that our
arms are rubbing like are you know where
you perspire the most I don't know where
you perspire the most which is probably
good thing overall we can actually
generally test what people think where
the owners gonna come from but under
your armpits in areas where your body is
rubbing up against things is usually
most owner comes from so yeah it's guys
at for those you that are looking this
is this it's underwear its underwear has
an adjustable strap underneath it make a
comfortable fit and and how much are
these uh how much of these gonna go
retail for the top-of-the-line version
of Regal is let's be honest here
sometimes we see a lot of tech here that
makes life more difficult and doesn't
solve a problem I mean this solves
problems like when I sat in it and they
showed me everything I looked at and I
said wait let me see this and they had
to give it to me and I and I took it and
I said now this is gonna work this is
really like for females look at what we
would spend for under clothing the
amount you can walk into some places and
spend $5,000 on lingerie right you know
I mean like it did well even if you
bring it down to the Victoria's Secret
level it could get expensive you know
and it ferment
everything's three in a pack over in the
corner hahahaha you know this is the
perfect way to you know to let it be
about a man for a moment this is the
perfect gift she gives him for her now
um you know we know you had your venture
with vitaminwater there was a formula 50
will there be an exclusive exclusive
like specific type of version for the
free go like what would you know
whatever business conversations you
don't nothing good past you huh what I'm
training now I'm working out now for the
photos you I got to be built up like
Marky Mark when you're trying to sell
Calvin Klein I knew is you know guys are
good and showboat now put it all the way
together can't well you know you expose
things like I've had moments where I've
had my shirt off in my career and I
won't take my shirt off until I'm
topping those moments again because my
shirts been on for a little while yeah
you know I just wanna make sure that I'm
back in that position before I go ahead
and you go what happened oh you don't
wanna be you don't want to be that right
when it would happen moment you know
like like what happened to you you was
you would like hot once upon a time you
just take a couple trips to the gym and
we put it all back in perspective all
right 50 well you know what thanks so
much for coming out to our CNET stage
always a pleasure
look out for the free go revolution
we're under we're coming to a store near
you definitely all right thanks a lot
guys
