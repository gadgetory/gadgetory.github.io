watches I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the world of Android
has now expanded into smartwatches and
also cars and televisions at the annual
Google i/o Developers Conference the
company showed off new software for
upcoming Google products the
presentation lasted nearly three hours
but I'll sum up the highlights for you
in under three minutes google gave a
demo of how smartwatches work with the
Android wear operating system the idea
is that you would have notifications
that you can quickly glance at there
will be cards that you flip through to
see text messages or other alerts now if
you get a phone call you can answer or
hang up from the watch or swipe up to
send a quick text saying that you're
busy it understands voice commands so
you can set a reminder by talking to
your wrist Dick Tracy style the Android
apps on your phone will be simplified
for the small watch screen for example
all the cooks app shows recipe steps on
your wrist but not all apps for a watch
will make your life better pinterest has
this pointless push alert that shows you
when you're near a restaurant that your
friends pinned to their wall yeah too
many notifications could be a drag on
the watch's battery life the first two
smartwatches to run Android wear will be
the LG G watch and a samsung model
called the gear live both can be
pre-ordered now and what's arguably the
best looking one it's the round Moto 360
that is an on sale until later this
summer Android will become part of your
car's dashboard some cars coming out
this year will support Android auto so
when you plug in an Android phone into
your car the cars touch screen will show
a Google interface for maps music and
other apps and all this can be
controlled with voice commands Android
also wants control over the living room
android TV is an entertainment hub for
your television that's controlled with a
phone or a tablet or your SmartWatch if
you have one you can look up shows open
apps and even play android game
like everything else you can also
control this with voice commands google
TV flopped but maybe android TV will be
different it comes out this fall but
you'll need a special TV or a set-top
box to use android TV we got a quick
peek at the new design coming to the
next version of android it's called
android l know they didn't give it a
cute sweet treat codename not lollipop
or licorice just el google had lots to
show off but we didn't hear anything
about glass so for now that your tech
news update you can get more details on
all these stories at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
