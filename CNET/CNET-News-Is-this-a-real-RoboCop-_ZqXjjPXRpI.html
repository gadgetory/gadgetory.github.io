first thing we have is the lidar and the
lidar actually will give you a 3d map of
the environment it will take a
270-degree image of the of the room
around it or the space around it and
allow it to actually create a
three-dimensional map couple with that
you have GPS you have D GPS which will
actually allow it to locate itself
we've got monitors on the wheels to tell
how what distance is traveling and then
we have ultrasonic sensors around it to
tell anything else it might be in a
closer proximity to it so now we move
down to the first sensor layer and on
the first sensor layer we have four
cameras positioned on each side of the
k5 the cameras will see 360 degrees we
have nighttime vision capability and
daytime vision capability and also
thermal imaging as well any of the
information that is immediately relevant
so we need something to send an alert
for example that data can be immediately
transferred then you have data that's
stored on it and then when we go to park
the the unit to on its charging station
we take those opportunities to load the
data either to a local server or to the
cloud on the side these are the inlets
for the microphone so we're not
recording people's voices or people's
conversations we're recording
ambient noise levels so we want to make
sure that if something's going on and
people are screaming we're able to
detect that and say hey there's
something going on in this particular
area in the future we will also have
weapons of mass destruction caping
capability so we want to be able to
detect radiation chemical biological
weapons and also airborne pathogens so
that's the sniffing portion of it so
right now those features are not in this
correct we right now we in the beta
prototype we're offering optical
character recognition we'll get to that
in a moment the 360-degree video
capability and the lidar mapping so the
k5 also has optical character
recognition optical character
recognition will allow the robot to read
license plates so if you have somebody
in the area with a stolen car wanted
fell in anything like that again we'll
be able to send out an immediate alert
to in to the appropriate authorities to
act on that the nightscope k5 is also
fully autonomous it it runs around on
its own as we said before
uses the lidar to map the area and then
it'll it's on an electric battery the
battery gets charged automatically and
it can run up to 24 hours won't do that
but it's capable of running 24 hours but
it knows at certain intervals it's going
to go and seek out a charging station
but in future we're gonna be able to go
up and down curbs off-road this
particular one we can go on just about
any surface grass concrete and the like
small bumps ramps things like that this
will run up to 18 miles per hour okay
but I imagine in a shopping mall
that's a cruising speed it's actually
gonna be much lower in normal operations
probably going to be somewhere between 1
and 3 miles per hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
