dan graziano filling in for Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
according to a report from paul thurrott
microsoft will enter the wearable market
later this year however rather than a
watch the company is reportedly working
on a fitness tracker the device is set
to be priced and design similar to the
two hundred dollars Samsung gear fit
like other fitness trackers the device
will track your steps calories burned
distance traveled and heart rate it will
likely include a color screen and will
go beyond fitness tracking to display
notifications from your smartphone but
unlike most wearables on the market the
tracker will work with Android iOS and
Windows Phone devices it will reportedly
be available in the fourth quarter of
this year it seems like everyone is
doing a SmartWatch these days first it
was Samsung then you had LG and remember
those pesky i watch rumors that just
won't go away but this isn't Microsoft's
first wearable device the company
actually teamed up with fossil and other
watchmakers and released a SmartWatch
way back in 2004 called the Microsoft
spot but let's hope things go a little
better for Microsoft this time around in
other news a goldman sachs contractor
accidentally swapped at GS com for @
gmail.com and sent an email with
confidential client data to a random
person with no luck the investment
banking firm reached out to Google and
asked the company to delete the email
Google is willing to cooperate but only
if there was a court order this led
goldman sachs to the new york supreme
court google has since blocked access to
the email in question but this is a
stark reminder that we all agree to
Google's Terms and the company can
access our emails at least this time
there was a court order most people
aren't aware however that there's a
nifty feature in gmail called undo send
this allows you to undo an email a
couple of seconds after you've sent it
the feature can be enabled by going to
settings clicking on labs and selecting
undo send and finally it's back the cult
comedy community has been renewed for a
sixth season but not on NBC the network
put the plug on the comedy earlier this
year instead yahoo has renewed the
series for 13 new episodes the new
season will air this fall exclusively on
Yahoo's video platform known as Yahoo
screen it appears the internet giant is
following in the footsteps of Netflix
speaking of Netflix the streaming
service has removed a total of seventy
nine titles from its us library this
includes classics like taxi driver and
the rocky series Netflix also added more
than 50 new movies and TV shows like hit
titles such as mean girls The Karate Kid
and boys in the hood that's your tech
