is the audio technica ath mr s7 and
excellent over the year headphone that
costs around two hundred fifty dollars
online and comes in a few different
color options aside for being a nicely
designed sturdy headphone it's
comfortable to wear with plush lis
padded ear cups and comes with three
cables including standard 1.2 meter and
three meter cables plus a 1.2 meter
cable with an inline remote and
microphone for compatible smartphones
and other devices the headphone is
equipped with audio Technica's
proprietary 45 millimeter true motion
drivers and the company calls this a
high resolution headphone and says it's
designed to reproduce high res audio now
I can tell you that until now we haven't
tested a so called high resolution
headphone in this price range that can
truly reproduce high res audio but to
its credit this audio technica can which
is why we're calling it the most
affordable high res headphone out there
there's a lot of energy in life to its
sound along with lots of clarity of
course so you feel a strong connection
to the music it also projects wide more
outside the head stereo imaging and is
particularly open sound for a closed
back headphone the only downside here is
that it's also the kind of headphone
that's not shy about revealing harshness
or distortions and recordings so
grittier sounding material can end up
having a rough edge in the end the audio
technica ath msr7 is a great headphone
it's not quite as comfortable as some
competing sony models like the mdr-1a
which is a little bit more laid-back
sounding and forgiving headphone but if
you are listening to well recorded
tracks it will certainly bring out the
best in them I'm David Carr Noy thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
