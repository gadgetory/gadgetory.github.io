I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update HTC has revealed its latest
super-sized phone the HTC One max is a
smartphone with a high def 5.9 inch
screen and just like the rumours
foretold it has a fingerprint scanner on
the back you can use that scanner to
unlock the phone or open apps this model
is also different because you can remove
the backplate to add a microSD card to
expand the storage but you won't be able
to access the battery to replace it if
you want a large phone and your between
the Galaxy Note 3 and the HTC One max
well when you just compare hardware
specs to know three wins the one max has
an older slightly slower processor and
its camera is good but it goes by a
different measurement than megapixels it
uses a branding term called ultrapixels
the note is also a little smaller
thinner and lighter and it comes with a
stylus HTC's extra large phone goes on
sale in the UK within the next couple of
weeks for the u.s. it'll be sold at
Sprint and Verizon but it may not arrive
until November larger screens are the
trend these days so much so that
Microsoft updated its Windows Phone 8
operating system to work with phones
that have screen sizes between five and
seven inches and it would show an
additional column and several more rows
on the start screen there are no windows
phone 8 devices of that size yet but we
could see one in a week the rumored
6-inch Nokia Lumia 1520 is expected to
be announced at an event in Abu Dhabi on
october twenty second if you already own
a Windows 8 Phone you also get a few
perks from the update including task
switching a driving mode and the ability
to assign a unique tone alert to a
specific contact the update will roll
out in the coming weeks and months to
every windows phone 8 device moving from
smartphones to speakers wireless
speakers are a growing category and if
you're in the market for a multi-room
speaker check out cnet's review of the
sonos play one which has been awarded an
editor's choice for its category it's a
stylish and well-made speaker for two
hundred dollars and it plays music from
your personal library as well as some
services like Amazon Cloud Sirius XM
Spotify Pandora and Rdio but it's not
Bluetooth it's a little more complicated
because it creates its own wireless
network and sonos is throwing in its $50
bridge device for free to get you
started it doesn't play every type of
streaming service so if you primarily
use google music all access iTunes radio
or Xbox music then you're better off
getting a Bluetooth speaker that's your
tech news update but you can get more
details at cnet com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
