she is really outgoing our oldest is a
seven year old named sly but his real
name Sylvio we call her Gracie Gracie
gene and Cristo James then we have beans
and then we have Francesco and our
little one his real name is Santino he
loves doing the computer stuff we have
some other electronic devices that I
don't know how to use and he'll say here
mom let me show you you hear these
parents who are you know really trying
to do the right thing all the time but
they've got busy complicated lives we
thought to ourselves how can we rethink
parental controls entirely and that led
us to create free time this is really
the first time that a parent can set up
a personalized free safe place for the
kids to play you don't don't worry about
kids accessing the internet you don't
worry about kids buying stuff when we
developed free time you listen closely
to parents and create an experience that
both kids and parents will enjoy
anything I can do to help me out it is a
huge Essen takes only a few seconds to
create a child profile start by adding
their name
give them their birthday pick an icon
that you think is interesting to them
and you're ready to go each child has
their own experience it's personalized
to them we put the actual content the
titles themselves the movies the TV
shows ran out in front of the user every
one of the kids went and the carousel
one visual and they saw the contact when
Kindle Fire switches to free time the
background color of the screen turns
blue make it easy for parents to
reassure themselves from across the room
that free time is off we set up this
feature so that a parent could set time
limits on how much of each activity
their kid did one hour video one hour
for games or unlimited for reading or a
parent can say listen do what you want
to but you've only got an hour a day to
do it too
have to worry about when the time comes
to an end that his device is in control
that that would eliminate some of the
pressure for me and I think it would
allow him to kind of feel like a little
bit more independent right up above the
carousel right we've got a books icon a
videos icon in an app cycle we also have
a characters icon so they can click on
Sesame Street for example and go to all
the Sesame Street content that you've
made available when a kid picks up the
Kindle Fire they're playing with it
they feel like it knows who they are I
love my job at Amazon
it's create products from the ground up
that hopefully millions of people use
and in this case you get to create a
product that helps parents feel like
they're better parents and let kids
learn more and explore and have fun and
take advantage you know of all the great
things that digital media has to offer
um that's a pretty great thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
