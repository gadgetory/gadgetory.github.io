changes lately Google is still the big
leader with more than sixty seven
percent market share in the US but
things are moving from the desktop to
mobile and wearable devices and the game
is getting more wide open now google
just announced that google now its voice
search would be available on apple's ios
i'm dan farber and i'm joined by seth
rosenblatt and covers this subject
matter for cnet so what is the
significance of google now coming to iOS
sure well Google now is a predictive
search and a voice recognition app it's
natively built into android 4.1 and
above and it allows Google to not only
do voice recognition very easily very
simply where you talk to the phone you
can send text messages and stuff like
that and it's very accurate with its
recognition it's also predictive search
so if you have in your calendar for
example a plane trip from San Francisco
to New York it will tell you you know
what the traffic is like on the way to
the airport before you even ask for it
in New York it will have hotels listed
if you don't have one built into your
calendar if you're into sports it will
recognize that you are in San Francisco
and we'll pull in Giants scores or the
49er scores so basically where do you
think Google now Siri mm-hmm there's
another one Sherpa that came out of
Latin America where are these all
heading because you don't see a lot of
people talking to their desktops you
don't see a lot of people necessarily
talking to their phones at this point
sure well I think one of the very
interesting developments that's going on
is with google glass the ability for
google and these other services to
recognize what you say as you're as
you're speaking with very little lag
time means that device is where you're
no longer holding it in your hand where
it's something that's just worn on your
clothing or worn on your face i think is
a real game-changer if you don't have to
pull out your phone out of your pocket
that that means you're basically living
with the computer instead of interfacing
with the computer in
more cold way no kind of talk about you
know all the predictive solutions and
answers it can give you but what are the
limitations at this point well at this
point Google would say that the
limitations i think our are fairly
significant although they have told us
that there is that in the past year
alone the first year of google now
they've made fifteen to thirty five
percent increase in improvement in voice
recognition so they clearly see the
glass as not even being anywhere near
half full and they are clearly going
full full speed ahead with this it's
also very notable that larry page last
week in their earnings call brought up
the fact that Google now is a big thing
for them he didn't talk about much else
he talked about google glass he talked
about some of the other projects that
they're working on google fiber but fact
that he called out google now not chrome
and none of the any other services that
that they're working on indicates that
the voice recognition in the predictive
search of google now is extremely
important to the company and this is all
kind of tied into what google has called
a knowledge graph which is a train um
trying to identify all these entities so
to speak so that it understands when you
say king yeah to try to figure out the
context about what kind of King do you
mean right whether you're talking about
the kings of sports team or whether
you're talking about the king of
Thailand or whomever you know King
Street there's a lot of different ways
that that can be interpreted another big
problem that they're wrestling with is
accents you know the ability for the
knowledge graph to recognize what you're
saying and what that means when you're
speaking with a different inflection
then what could be described as standard
American English so the glass is half
full I think Google would say the
glasses and even anywhere near handful
and what about Siri just to finish up
sure well what Apple is doing with Siri
is slightly different so far it's pretty
much limited to voice recognition um but
it does have different their integration
with the phone where you can jostle the
phone and get Syria to to activate you
can also just save you know hey Siri and
Cirie will activate so that kind of
technology has google hasn't yet put
directly into its Android systems but
honestly if if
they announced that in a few weeks at
Google i/o I wouldn't be surprised oh
great thanks Seth thank you Dan foreseen
it I'm Dan Farber thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
