and we saw companies taking huge strides
for making your cooking smarter too
let's take a look at some of the gadgets
that caught our eye this year by handing
out a few superlatives now the award for
most improved to goes to Amazon Alexa at
the beginning of the year this platform
didn't really do much in the kitchen but
she really stepped up with partnerships
with GE appliances and a new immersion
circulator called Jewel and what do
those partnerships mean you can use your
voice to control some of your cooking
appliances so you can preheat the oven
or check the temperature of your sous
vide water bath just with your voice now
for the most ambitious debut I got to
give this one to the June intelligent
oven this countertop cooker has a camera
built-in along with the processor that's
worthy of being in a smart phone and
Wi-Fi capability so that you could not
only watch what you cooked as it was
cooking but the oven could also
recognize your food now it did have some
faults and it's $1,500 but it was
definitely an ambitious debut for a
company that shows us what we can do
when it comes to cooking and technology
and speaking of expensive appliances I
give the splurge if you got an award to
the Samsung family hub refrigerator yes
this appliance is five thousand six
hundred dollars but it is so cool it has
a very sleek modern look a lot of
storage options once you get inside but
there's also a 21 and a half inch
touchscreen built into the door of the
refrigerator that has special apps that
help you create to-do list there's also
built in cameras in this fridge which is
great if you're stuck in the grocery
store and need a quick picture of what
you have at home and one thing 2016
showed us was that sous-vide immersion
circulators aren't going anywhere which
is why i give this category of gadgets
that here to stay award brands like na
miku innova and jewel all they viewed
new Wi-Fi connected appliances that help
you cook with sous-vide which is a kind
of weird method that involves a
vacuum-sealed bag of food and a water
bath even if you're not quite on board
with this method of cooking
it's becoming more and more popular and
because of that we're seeing more and
more devices into this category 2016 was
a big year for smart kitchen appliances
and I don't expect 2017 to be any
different be on the lookout for more
partnerships and more innovative
technology that actually proves to be
helpful and maybe teaches you a thing or
two about cooking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
