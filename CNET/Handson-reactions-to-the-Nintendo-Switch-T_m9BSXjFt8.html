with the lovely Scott Stein we just got
back from a live Nintendo switch debut
event here in New York City and we're
back to talk to you and each other about
what we thought of that event so Scott
yeah what did you think man this was a
crazy sort of first hands-on with the
Nintendo switch we know all the details
we know it's coming out March 3rd it's
$300 but this was the hands-on stuff so
how does it feel to play Nintendo switch
there's a lot of expectations this is
gonna be like a 3d Asus it's going to be
a Wii is it going to be a Wii U it's
kind of cycle all of them but it also
felt like if you ever played an Nvidia
shield tablet it's a kind of video tech
inside basically it almost felt like an
Android tablet or Windows tablet into
which they're running Nintendo I don't
know how to explain that it felt really
nice but the actual tablet has more of
the feel of almost like a PC components
yeah it's heavy it's a little heavy
little heavy it's got vents at the top
right it's it that's the machine right
there that's the whole thing and the
controllers are nice it feels like a 3ds
type of control with a with the analog
stick of a Wii gamepad right Wii U
gamepad so in terms of how it feels to
play you have that gamepad tablet thing
the two joy con controllers that flank
it on either side can come off and when
you take them off there's these little
sort of like half Crescent controllers
and I found them to be very small and
maybe not the most comfortable little
things in the world
yeah those got weird they were a little
bit like a super-powered Apple TV remote
there are a lot of buttons there are
more buttons than you would find on your
Wii Remote yeah it's kind of
disorienting we we played a game called
1 2 switch and you and I were milking
milking cow udders come every time we
were moaning every time we would milk
them they were just like vibrate and
feel weird and I thought that was a
strange example of the power of this
thing yeah those are lighters I got away
from the TV thing where we were supposed
to just be playing in a party game
looking at each other they do they claim
is very advanced haptics to me they felt
more like it kind of like better haptics
that you get on a phone yeah maybe the
Xbox controller
super
they were not super stoked on my rumble
HD I don't know what why HD I don't know
why I don't classify Rumble as HD but
this did not feel like superior no I
didn't feel I didn't feel they talk
about clinking of ice cubes in a glass
you know I didn't feel that cow utter
thankfully right but you know that was
who was a vibrating different pulsing
that was going on and the question is in
the games will that matter I knows when
you tilt some of the games like like the
arms the boxing game we did right it
would um it would give you feedback on
how much you were tilting yes I to get
the feel for what that meant I think
that can we can kind of gloss over for
now you'll have to experience it for
yourself overall I think people are
gonna want to buy that pro controller
that's seventy dollars extra to me that
kind of feels good the grip which will
house the two crescents that comes with
the box so you could kind of decide if
you like how that feels so that's how it
feels to play when you're holding the
tablet the right Joey con joystick is a
little lower than the one on the left
that's a little unusual and I found that
to be a problem when we were trying to
get you to map it out the screen looked
nice but it's six inches so it's crisp
but not cool right there's a pretty
significant bezel around it okay let's
go into the games real quick you and I
first started we played that game arms
this is what like the accordion hands
boxing would you think of that
I thought arms was a little hard to
control I thought it was it was fun once
you started getting into it but
understanding how you curve your shot
because not only can you throw your
punch with motion controls but there
were some Wii Sports type angling of
shots up depending on how much you twist
your wrist yeah there were a lot of
buttons so again it was which shoulder
button are you pressing your feel for
that when you hold it in the profile
sort of like thumbs up grip they keep
it'll drip you can hit a lot of buttons
by accident like however you decide to
hold it you were going to have the
option to hit a bunch of things that's a
great description yeah there are a lot
of buttons every surface and then they
didn't get into that one of the
controllers has an IR camera right that
can recognize them
yeah yeah so that wasn't employed in
game so the question is if it's only on
one what games will do that and how
there's a lot we'll get to questions we
still have at the end of this then we
played splatoon too which I thought was
pretty good we were playing it on the
tablet
I didn't really I don't like the lien
aiming thing that they do they let you
in the first game make it an analog
thing so hopefully that won't be a
problem this time around what did you
think is splatoon
too solid it shows you can play a TV
game on the go so I thought it did a
good job with that the screen size
seemed right
I felt like playing a Wii U game on that
gamepad but but fully on the go right
I'm a little uncertain about how much of
the game could be played hunting over
that smaller screen yeah it felt like I
wanted to see more maybe just that might
you know I was looking for details and
doing that but it definitely was it was
functional for sure yeah okay Zelda I
didn't play Zelda that much at this
event I played it III I keep looking at
that gameplay yes this is the game to
play obviously it's really the only game
to play but it looked a little choppy I
just think like there's maybe going to
be a bit of a performance hit when you
bring a mobile I don't know yet we don't
have it but I'm not concerned I just
noticed that yes a little bit of that -
I was watching people play I was kind of
like walking around and observing a lot
of the gameplay I mean I was Elda you
know plays in general but the game it's
it's weird because the the switch is
supposed to go into two different types
of processing modes you know it's when
it's in the dock it's like full power
overclock yeah and so that's going to
give it potentially a little more
graphics boost and so how does that how
does that even out when you're playing
on the go versus they're interesting
equal but it's good does that mean like
when you're playing Zelda portably
that's the two and a half hour battery
life that they were you know low-balling
it that maybe what we'll see then we
played snipper Clippers sniffle clipper
yeah that was kind of the surprise of
that event and then some mania yeah it's
not McMahon E which is a 2d that's
basically like Sonic 4 or whatever the
last right is it truly really acts like
a like retro sonic yeah coming out for
other platforms - Xbox one a play for
real quick we got to wrap it up what's
the outlook what what questions do you
still have for me I like the price I'm
very concerned about the fact that
there's only one real launch game to get
Zelda you know looks great but if I
don't like Zelda I'm not buying this
thing you've got the new Mario game
coming
holiday that's a long ways away I think
people have every right to sort of be a
little skeptical about like why am i
buying this if there's only one game
what what are you concerned about I want
to see what else it does they didn't
talk about whether it even stream stuff
I mean the other Nintendo like the wii u
does stream amazon right it sounds like
a small thing but I mean if you're
taking this on the go connect it to your
TV giving it to a kid we're about Kindle
app washer what else does is do we don't
know about the interface or the apps and
then games retro games they're the NES
class either what's the deal with that
what's the online like right we heard
about this service that's gonna cost
money this online service they're gonna
give away one game is it one game a
month or is it you can rent a game a
month it was alone clear right and their
retro game so what's the Virtual Console
stuff how many of those games can we
play because people want to play those
classic games and are we gonna have to
reboot again because clearly yes but how
many times you're gonna do that because
you have all these games you may have
already bought you have to buy these
again what's the deal right are they
just gonna sell these one by one again
so I'm concerned and curious about that
so that's gonna do it for us thank you
