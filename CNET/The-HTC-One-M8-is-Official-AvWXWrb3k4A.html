welcome to google issues for everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
each week and this week there's plenty
of google news but we can't ignore
probably one of the worst kept secrets
this year the official announcement of
the all-new acc one ma now you've
already seen its unibody metal design
that brings a quad-core snapdragon 801
processor with 16 or 32 gigs of storage
and a new micro SD card slot for up to
128 gigs of additional storage the sense
UI gets an update to six point 0 like
we've shown in past episodes with bolder
colors motion launch gestures to answer
calls or access apps and an updated
blinkfeed and the new acc sense TV
sports for real-time scores and stats
now the biggest feature improvement is
its duo camera that has a mode called
you camera that lets you take a picture
and then select what part you'd like to
be in focus after the picture is taken
just think of it like a light show
camera on your smartphone now now a fun
add-on is also there acc dot view case
that allows you to see or answer calls
without accessing your phone and it also
shows you date time and weather
reminders now the HTC One m8 is
available starting today for 199 with a
two-year contract I don't know if it can
really change the market share breakdown
or close the distance between itself and
Samsung's marketing machine but my
personal favorite android phone just got
better all right in google news a new
app called photo wall is now available
on android and iOS that lets you turn
your TV with a connected chromecast into
a live digital photo frame people using
the app can beam pictures to the TV live
and even doodle or annotate images on
the photo wall now i like to do it on
people's faces like my niece and nephews
just let's uh add a little facial hair
and then some glasses and some finishing
touches and perfect all right now
chromecast development is starting to
take off photowall is my favorite price
it's free and this is a fun and clever
way to use your chromecast at a party or
just by yourself now Google glass
development is also taking off in one
example is layers augmented reality app
for glass it overlays data about a user
surroundings and it just became
available in beta form you can sign up
for it now
but some of the ways that can be used in
this video clip show off its potential
for looking at real estate locations or
interactive content on top of existing
things like a movie poster or magazine
I'd like to see this being used on other
magazines specifically with quality
content like Maxim and google recently
posted an article of their own called
the top ten google glass miss that
sounded pretty defensive highlighting
points like glass is the perfect
surveillance device well their argument
is that there are better cameras out
there that you can use if someone really
wants to spy on you another one glass is
always on and records everything I don't
see a problem there another one glass
explorers are tech worshiping geeks
really guys that's your target market
you're bashing and glass is only for
those privileged enough to afford it so
yeah it's $1,500 right now and the
counter points were that some people
have worked hard for it some have
received them as gifts and other people
have gone to Kickstarter to raise money
so yes it is only for those privileged
enough to afford it it's like they just
decided to make themselves the biggest
glass hole after the article come on
Google don't be stupid now Google now
get some new functionality with some new
voice commands you can now say okay
google play some music and an i'm
feeling lucky radio station will start
to play via google music with a constant
stream of music based on your listening
history who will also recently added the
ability to take a picture and take a
video with voice commands last week as
well and in case you missed it google
officially released their android wear
sdk for developers after our show posted
last week that relies heavily on google
now and it will power Android wearables
coming later this year one from LG
called the G watch which was teased with
the standard rectangular design we're
used to and then the best freaking
looking jaw-dropping SmartWatch concept
that we've seen for Motorola called the
Moto 360 with a round screen design and
a thin bezel that looks like an actual
watch and is still leaving people
looking for a change of Underpants now
I'm still not sold on a SmartWatch but
if it does end up looking like that and
they make it cross platform compatible
um I watch who but obviously we'll see
what everyone ends
bring it to the table and a quick note
the Samsung Galaxy s5 is available on
all the four major carriers for
pre-order here in the US for 199 with
the two-year contract for its april
eleventh launch and their line of gear
products have been officially price with
the new gear 2 at 299 the gear 2 neo at
199 and the gear fit the most
buzzed-about gadget from mobile world
congress at 199 as well alright that's
going to do it for this week's show you
can email us at Google licious at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you next
week for some more of that Google Isha's
