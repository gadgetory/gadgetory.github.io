twenty-fourth thanks so much for tuning
in to the 404 show my name is jeff
bakalar to my left Russ flush the Cour
you sir been so long Jeffrey that's been
a week two weeks in two weeks I missed
missed a certain week we did and we'll
get to that in a second we will but
first I want everyone to say hello to
Shannon kook back on oh right the
Australian word for hello um it's good
to see you great to see you guys it's
been a long two really a while you're
nine six months at least really in
couple mom be a whole half of you went
by yeah that's the effect you have on us
down I felt something was missing there
was a hole in my life total loss and
concept of time and space let's fill
that hole Here I am by all means fill it
we shall uh we're gonna talk about the
summer music scene and Shannon's gonna
guide us through that wacky scene um
summer has started summer has sprung
what do they say spring has sprung what
is some are done no summer dragged it's
a summer is heating up no that's never
paid summer so whatever it is that he
picks it's gonna be a negative right
summers gonna like throw up in your lap
something like that um so before we get
the songs of the summer and all that's
good stuff I'm back from LA and back
from the e3 entertainment expo yeah I
saw video games I saw disappointment I
saw people getting nauseous from VR oh
yeah that happens a lot man I i was i
was here at home i was i was manning the
polygons like live video efforts here at
home and not every time i would watch
fer demo I'd be like oh yeah that would
make me puke you can't do it now like
you're ready admitted to everybody that
you're not ears anyway he can't even
handle games that aren't VR right
sometimes is this something that will be
improved or it's just it's certain games
it's about emotion and if you have a
problem with it it's too bad I think
people to like car sickness uh if you
get sick on a boat yeah if you have it
roller coasters anything get my pregnant
yeah all right so we're talking about
this like there should totally be like
off spew scale for like a hearl meter I
house is gonna make you because there
was one game our resident evil 7 oh yeah
they're doing in VR which is like a
horror game a made half the people I
talk to you sick like actually sick
there's one do from cnet uh sky nick
Healey who who couldn't even have dinner
that night cuz you're like I'm to left
up yeah I can't deal with it it's crazy
so yeah a like no one pregnant should
use VR I think it's like the same rules
for like King Dakar the roller coaster
right it's like if you have heart
problems don't put on a VR headset and
play re seven if you have the right kind
of like other issue yeah you know what
happened it wouldn't be very good for
sales to put like a puke meter on the
box though so gotta have an intense yes
or eating or something Shannon have you
used vr at all no not at all man not
even once next time you're here you come
a little early more will get you in yeah
you'll make me whole thank you really
there are certain things incentives yeah
to show up well do all of this show you
stuff do you have a history of getting
nauseous and no motion sickness no only
when I'm pregnant which isn't very often
right Adam in a car oh oh so well that's
that's a pretty big good to know they
have to be happening the Sun pregnancy
plus cos oh really so you weren't
nauseous outside of cars when you're
married just as you're in the car I
think you're gonna be fine then I'm not
worried about you one day you'll be fine
I'm not worried about it we'll get you
in on Nexus I'm not gonna fly then if I
like how many people are sick half the
people who try again I don't want to
it's have no no I talked to its certain
games though so like the game he was
talking about Resident Evil it was like
a very realistic environment where
you're walking and because it's so
accurate so like real life your body
literally gets convinced that oh you're
actually walking and that's where the
motion sickness comes from more
outrageous games where you're like in a
weird factory and it's like not grounded
you don't get as sick it's not as
convincing to your head yeah the more
the more disorienting it is obviously
we're like your because it's all about
your brain we talked about this the
other the other day like why you throw
up from being
motion sick maybe you have a bad brain
no my brain my brain season being hated
other things jury's out but for this it
seems to agree ah but it's like the
things were like when yous like there
was a duck button then you press oh yeah
and when you duck you're like your
brains like Brian no you should be done
till I you know it's like does not
compute it's really weird the future
about it is weird yeah yeah just wait
I've seen the future freakin weird all
right let's pivot into um Shannon cooks
Spotify person you want me to play some
songs that will make you hell yeah about
that is that like a promise because look
usually you know me pretty well and you
know the kind of music I like yeah and I
brought none of that kind of music right
busy all summer music yes and summer
music tends to be popping up upbeats
poppy positive for the most part um yeah
well we've at spotify we like to come up
with a list of predictions for song of
the summer because as you I'm sure where
we have sort of been crowning a song the
song of the sirna and you've got the
data I've got the data to support oh yes
I'm really really what I've brought is
the space between my navel and my crotch
which is my gut wow that was a long time
ago I feel like your guy do anyway yeah
there's really good eyes sure what do
you think you're getting I think the gun
thing eludes the navel as well I think
the navels part of the gut a little bit
above the name but above the navel is
the stomach yeah I which I don't include
it just so you know she's not showing us
this everybody was talking about we're
all touch we're just about body looks
people lived at our shirts and we're
examining we base predictions on a lot
of things we use data we use my gut you
know I chat a lot without in-house
experts that Spotify they know what's
coming down the pipeline and we're all
getting pretty good at guessing what's
going to pop based in large part these
days on how songs performing playlist
right right is playlister the gateway to
discovery these days and song starts off
in an influential playlist and it just
bounces to more influential playlists
and become
hit song let me ask so could you
nominate a song for the summer if it
came out in January and always hopped in
summer absolutely okay that's why he
came out he died years ago it that would
be fine too okay it's really disposable
it's really just a song that becomes
really huge in fact I think happy uh we
don't I think that I'm sorry well we
have a comparable we have a happy update
thanks to justin timberlake oh dude okay
we could talk about that soon what
should we start there maybe that's where
we start things off why what what's your
beef with this song I just feel like
heat this is he phoned it in I just I
like JT mirror is a great song right
yeah this one yeah it does this is
phoned in I'm sorry I love Jay doesn't
sound like that in spike out there it
sounds like he'd listen to a lot of sure
and just like I mean he's worked with
dr. obviously so I'm sure there's a lot
of crossover but like yeah it doesn't
come on remember it's a film soundtrack
right it's for the trolls not only look
wait what what is the trolls boxtrolls
Oh box from know that came out like you
were here Zi shirts I know it's for a
movie what is the truly DFG ya know is a
movie called patrols I'm gonna look it
up I don't know anything about the movie
I'm sorry here's the chorus right come
on yeah build up and it's fun my hands
are going in the air can't help yourself
yeah they're not moving but they're in
the air
now the movie lets you what you did
Oh trolls oh so got it sorry but we got
to hear the full said oh come on let it
let him do his little fall said it here
we go
it's all too bad so the trolls movie and
get your curious is based on the troll
dolls with the hair oh so that's coming
out I guess in November that's a
relevant timely reference well look at
Lego exploited Legos always been popular
um let me ask about so this seems like
the sort of song I'm definitely not
playing the song at my wedding but it
seems like the sort of song people would
play at their weddings do you think they
are playing it at their weddings and do
you think that is a big qualifier for
Sonia this summer we're like everyone
has to go to a bunch of weddings and
they're always hearing that I think
that's the fallout okay that's the end
result yeah like the end result is
you're gonna have to do that uh what's
the other song the shoot that shoot the
moon what is it with the better than
walking in what's their silly song no
yeah popular shut up and shut up and
down yeah yeah which is I think a good
sign in a very good wedding song yeah I
think the main criteria to become a song
of the summer it just has to be a song
that's inescapable so yeah you're
hearing at weddings you're hearing it on
the radio you hearing it every time did
you call the inescapable and is
inescapable buddy by the end of the song
by the end of the song by the end of the
summer you're like this song was
everywhere I was following you around
and I think everybody felt that way
about Callie Rae Jepsen song oh yeah
call me made call me maybe yes which
really I feel like is this song and the
summer that's really kicked the song of
the summer phenomen and if we're gonna
call it that in thai i get i got a
question before that we didn't really
hop on the song of the summit right i
have a question for you it's more
philosophical odia guy does becoming the
song of the summer is that a death
sentence for some like may arrest you
mean just for like stuff well like the
artist maybe the song for sure there are
many one-hit wonders that emerged as
songs of the summer just kind of shame
after you know maybe you just cash out
well let's remember they don't do super
well on the first song that they hit it
big with that's the problem yeah I don't
know let's um can we all remember this
song for a second oh yeah I don't know I
really hate this this was a song
I don't know when he 13 this is robin
thicke blurred lines it's just and this
was inescapable like it was every this
was also accused of being raping but we
weren't lucky you didn't know that i
also i thought it was accused of like
plagiarism too well there's that this
song had everything fun for the whole
family yeah but you could I mean some
might argue that Robin Thicke kind of
went away a little bit after that sure
yeah but I feel like he made money he
made I also think it's kind of still
doing okay I think it's sorry I'm gonna
cut you out of the conversation first
quick second there's the mad by Tom and
on I'll be outside you know I dunno
about the man in phenomenon with cover
athletes being on the cover of the new
madden game nice oh man is done I
supposed to know that's it's a kind of
its it's the NFL football game right
right everyone who's on the cover that
game has some sort of like tragic thing
happen right whether on or off the field
and and people say it's a curse or
whatever I the honest truth sophistical
e is that people have these outrageous
outperforming years and then the
following year they just go back to
normal and people consider that to be a
massive curse so I feel like that's sort
of the same idea where like the odds are
an artist hitting it big twice is very
unlikely so they hit it once during the
summer oh they're not hitting a big
again because they were summer hit well
it's funny you were talking about that
because this morning i was reading an
article about this tour that's happening
um it's called i love the 90s okay heard
about this it's a sad for that actually
basically a collection of I was gonna
say stars but I'm not sure it really
stars anymore some of them are um
artists who had a big song in the 90s
and then kind of disappeared oh you have
like vanilla ice like salt and pepper
some vanilla ice is there color me badd
can remember them yeah of course I went
to third eye blind now third eye blind
was not a one-hit wonder been they were
no one here whatever they were bigger
the nineties and not after that well
these are these are really doctors these
are really oddest who had a big defining
song in the 90s that touched a lot of
people and a lot of people are going to
these concerts sure to hear a string of
one well I think they sing more than
what they're like oh
it will headline with our one here no
its mother also did you remember Tone
Loc funky cold Medina I mean it was in
ace ventura it could be it could be a
really fun show and they're actually
thinking it's going so well they're
thinking of doing you know and that's
another one with with a whole different
slew of right 90s one hit one day
because you don't want to go to a full
tone loc show no I want to go to a
medley time we want to go to a greatest
n log n Australian thing yeah I think I
remember seeing someone's trying to get
me to go to it was like the 90s grunge
reunion right was like uh it was the
third eye blind wait third eye blind's
night they're not crunchy me was the
grunge it was like 90 s raw sure I was
like oh yeah rather what are they that
they're yucky rock yeah yeah whatever
they are what is it I knees I've been
enjoying nineties music lately when I
Drive around I listen to too serious
stations i bounce between 90s on nine
and 80s I love eighties music well and
I'm a favorite 80 song I it would
probably be something whammy okay sure
wake me up before you go yeah that's
good one there um but I've been enjoying
the 90s station more I sit on that alone
I mean there's some terrible stuff in
there like there's some terrible sort of
trip house yeah kinda stuff down I
thought 90s dance music was really good
well that's what I know what I'm making
fun of look like black box like Santa
it's sandstorm no I'm thinking like
Robin right I am and you know like who
sang that one hundred percent pure love
from the back Oh indeed light right that
was 90s yeah are you visited here's this
is what I keep hearing on my 90's on all
one of here I I jumped to the 80 station
when this comes on yeah this is I think
this oh yeah this is cool this was in
like Encino man right
yeah well he's driving around town right
now cuz this is accurate I love what
it's a distinct sound though and yeah
here it me just say it where they're
like hey I think we can use computers
and music but I mean you know what they
say on the same they also said you know
what they say about like the music that
you heard growing up is like you gets
locked into your brain for all time yeah
is that way and and like you will never
like have that same reaction to anything
more recent so you know it's not really
surprising that I can free gravitate
process this is good chance it is I
couldn't listen to it for a long period
I this is all I'm good for and then you
go to a tee that's a fun song yeah I
prefer groups well if we want to go talk
about the eighties why don't we let me
point out a couple of songs that were
big in the summers in a okay because
some people think that the song of the
summer started in 1985 really yes was
this song take my breath away 1985
that's why I guess take my Brenda way I
want to guess to his top gun was it is
around there 84 a violent this cave in
ah crazy is this some tears get repairs
care
yeah I love juice fierce yeah record
they're so great it isn't like I'm
having such a solid vision of like
people driving and like Trans Am sneeze
listen to this it's like great lot of
neon so there I mean the song of the
summer thing I mean you were saying like
you it just started but obviously it's
been going on for I think well there's
always a song that does well over the
summer yeah he's going to the zone
alright I've just jumped to 1980 oh yeah
I never Deborah teenage boys stink as my
dad would say they sting why does he say
that lease is one of my favorite bands
oh they're amazing and then he know this
is a summer still sexy he's a handsome
gentleman it's kind of sad this song it
is it super downer it's another creepy
song are we watching you yeah all right
then let's jump to 2005 2005 sorry I've
let's the 80s enough eighties time
travel
do you know this is no 11 years ago diva
there's your clue Mariah Carey yeah from
the glitter soundtrack last hit let me
that'll mean it is but I think if I been
here all right I'm jumping around I'm
gonna go back to nineteen ninety-seven
oh I love this game this is this is not
daddy won't daddy featuring faith
evans lost and this is right after we
just died Oh Vicki yes hey this is not
about for society it's not I know but
this the song was big or it was
everywhere around the time Princess
Diana died and this song because i'ma
goddamn candle in Australia it was being
yeah exactly and that what handle the
wind I did not mean to like laugh at
there's no it's funny that that's where
you want to go oh it's all right make
fun of me about a black you can make it
winna sweet how much money do you think
they paid sting for this right yeah I
think Han well yeah sure yeah this is
definitely after the period of time
where they're like yeah we'll just take
it yeah go to the sample this year no
ice kind of proved that that wasn't
possible all right we're gonna get a
little 20 of this was hmm was it 2012 oh
this is call me baby yeah Angus 2012 I
just sang this and carry out the a few
days ago did you how did that go really
well right carrier it is a good karaoke
well received
you brought the house down brought the
house down your stare was holdin ripped
see how long I can last I'm gonna jump
out of in a second here Eddie yeah
that's just wait come on sing it rough
hey I just met you whoa this is crazy
but here's my number so call me maybe
it's hard to look right oh wow your baby
but here's my num no one knows that part
so call me maybe and the lyrics are not
in front of him this is impressive sad
like that in the song I'm gonna see you
gonna sing that at your wedding oh you
know maybe am I got it up in a chair man
EJ and also you have total control total
control I like it ok I've skipped ahead
to the future here is the song of the
summer for 2016 maybe cuz its SIA well
it's not right no see is more talented I
love SIA by the way she's amazing
brilliant you should see your live
credible yeah stands there and sings I'm
amazing boys need to guess this well I
know this is only the Gomez no oh guys
it's Ariana Grande you know what a guy
it's sort of in the category of trying
to go this it is but like this is a
great song where's the catchy part here
it is yeah this'll do well do you think
Spotify has the power to create a song
and summer out of nowhere um well that's
that's a really good question and made
up things like their own strings like
but like I was saying a lot of it comes
down to placement in playlists nowadays
sure but couldn't you like in the
discover playlist like emphasize one
song and get it to be placed and more
fight it was talking about some dork
 no this is dark we could play God
if we wanted to this is what is known in
warned about you yeah but what we do is
we like to support a song if we see that
it's being listened errs are responding
to it in a certain way we will move it
around a little bit and see if we can
create more buzz with it because we
ultimately Spotify wants to deliver
songs that listeners that they enjoying
it they're gonna like right and there's
one song on my list of predictions it's
a great song you never would have you
won't have heard of these guys they're
called friendship okay they're a duo out
of LA and this song is called capsize
we've seen the most um rapid growth on
this song that with them that we've ever
seen on really none known song oh no no
the song was discovered in a blog by
someone who works at spotify and curates
some of the key playlist that spotify
and he put it in a new music friday
playlist which is pretty popular and it
people loved it they didn't skip it yeah
the song isn't skipped sure it's on at
all its people are loving and they're
actually listening to it all the way
like I've got a b-side then we kind of
vibe to it goes a little bit like his
new album
you
Oh
that's not a guy oh that's a woman okay
I those two guys
yeah like an earworm kai some
instruments let's go write it I can see
why it's I mean it's one of those like
ear were me and you can leave it in
background it's not too distracting it's
electro pop and that genre you know /
EDM does very well with our listeners
but it's I think this is a lot like that
doesn't that sound a lot like that
Bieber album like a lot it's very it's
like said blow it's not a bad word it's
it's been streamed 38 million times Wow
and in a very short time and it's now
climbing a US chart so and it started
climbing a US chart after we predicted
it could be a big song what I'm saying
they our stock market yeah look I've
been this isn't the worst it's not the
worst that's fine let me play you
something else okay I don't think you're
gonna like it oh yeah cool this is jason
derulo oh he was very recently snacks
shirtless on a performing on a yacht in
can i'm just pointing that out because
it wasn't the pictures were fun to look
at sure this is how he sings yep like he
always sounds like gee i wish i could
interview I wish I could go back to when
I interviewed on us and I love that to
be my first question this is anything it
just sounds like he's doing something
unnatural to himself well it's it's
processed obviously yeah
I'd love to do something we're cool to
him is there anyone he's an amazing
dents in this guy by the way but he had
a big song he's becoming really good at
releasing playful sexy songs mean
playful sexy playful comma sexy song
yeah I get it is that like it's okay for
a thirteen-year-old is that what that
means like no just it was uh I'm just
changing the song now probably your
subject what is it this is his song from
last year this was my favorite song of
2015 this was the song that was big loss
oh yeah right yeah you'll love this it's
so ladies listen to it yeah I don't mind
this give it a chance good i doesn't
wait i know how focus everyone shut up
now it's gonna be the curse on the
nervous I didn't realize the same guy
lately wait for them
I know it everyone shush now for reals
and I had a good wedding song as well
Shannon's really dancing shimmer Li
dancing Cooper defoe to get a photo for
the life of me dancing and Russ singing
yeah Oh make a gif out of this is good
stuff that song it's a good song I will
I will take it back I don't like your
new song sir but you're also you know
just sounds like fine young kiss is a
better song whatever Oh God same voice
when we listened to all right we know is
that 55 miles is that them know that's
the proclaimers but same year pretty
much know that way this is one of the
greatest songs ever recorded oh hell
yeah oh hell yeah oh hell yeah hey
what's up guys i'm jordan lee 26 million
streams what's wrong with kids what was
the song we just heard who's the guy in
singing it a Cinderella hey Jason
where'd you get that voice bro that was
it may be from this guy
I can see the music video in my head so
it's like it's just like a singing head
yeah there's the head right yeah I bet
there's Dylan's but there's less
processing on this guy yeah that's the
all natural sitting here through a tube
we have to get to the chorus behind yeah
of course you disappoint the list money
what year the question once an 89 88
so good yeah 80s we're good tribute oh
it is really good 89 this whole album is
filthy but is it good I have a list of
the whole outdoor the raw and the
uncooked right is that Johnny so Johnny
i'm home is a great song good thing good
thing i love the singing in this
particular really good stuff
I'm so good man so they only have three
albums I believe that do you think that
this music would fly today I think that
word is I think you see like the foxy
shazam audience like being open to
another era of music that's with it i'm
not saying this is the same as Fox of
gym but that's like 70s and 80s what
means you've been listening to them
foxygen ever you like her I have yeah
it's too bad there no no longer it oh
they broke up
okay can i play another good thing yeah
seeing as we're on a bit of an 80's
train yes is a song that just came out
but it to me it's a little bit playful
this is my favorite song at the moment
Tegan and Sara oh oh yeah good what are
you talking to this song's called
boyfriend and i absolutely love it there
is a very pop it's probably the most pop
has ever been yeah I know you always my
five year old loves the Sun but she's
very confused by it okay okay Wow Cuba's
razy yes oh my god
but we're gonna really just to get Sarah
and that's what a producer does for you
man time out I need to know
like
secret anymore it's very 80s it is very
easy I'm crazy stuff is back that's why
I think the stuff that we were just
playing like the fyc fine young panels
those songs fyc yeah those songs could
fly today yeah there's a lot of like
montage 80s movie songs that that would
fly today well I think what was it drive
sorry kicked off that part that was like
the the vaporwave comest yeah yeah but
that's I think similar kind of to this
stuff that like better female convince
keys of the world near like the you know
what I really like this street cleaner
he does I think you might have played
that I show yeah yeah I go to the 80
stuff yeah I love that I can't believe
this Tegan and Sara's blowing my mind
everybody their new album is very cool
it's it's it's definitely very poppy and
do you think that's the producer that's
like pushing this or do you think it's
them um i guess it kind of matter no I
mean they're I've interviewed them their
fur they're pretty headstrong ladies
they don't be pushed around by a pretty
know you're doing this for a long time
admit I would I think there and I think
they're having fun yeah I think this is
dead we're gonna try something new kind
of thing yeah they're not think they're
a group in a position to be heavily
influenced by any kind of outside party
I think like this is something they
wanted to Jerry Lewis's that's what I'm
the reason i ask is because you have
like I was watching and this is from
maybe a year ago I was watching an
interview from the New York Times with
diplo and Skrillex and talking about
Bieber and they basically like in tonk
he met him kind of like rip on him
pretty hard core and they're like well
he had this like kind of crappy song and
we like mess with it and change it
around and we made it like awesome so
that's in that case like he you know the
reason that album is success she was all
the producer yeah he and but that's the
thing like that album had to be good
hear me like it was make or break too
much I was like well I think his do you
see him fall off the runway yes that was
what entertaining you haven't seen that
video it's pretty great he felt like he
was modeling he was new it was a show
wasn't walking down the runway wearing
some weird stuff and then he just I
think he was exiting the runway concert
I thought he was like through this it
was like a whole is even though like
people fall that's not but that he
hasn't done like a drunken like
Lamborghini crash in a while so that's
so it's coming soon orgy I think he's
through the worst of it you think yeah I
think he's gonna have like a Britney
Spears know now but he never ever had
anything remotely close to a normal
childhood and that does not go away like
I can't just learn humanity his Canadian
citizenship will level him out you think
yeah a lot of normal Canadians I know
bad eggs out of that no I I don't know I
think he started so early and I think I
don't know I think it's a tough road I
think I mean you look at michael who
Jackson oh my golf the Michael we're
best friends uh you know Maddie
different different issues different
issues but how are we doing for time do
we haven't we got about three minutes I
Vijay yeah it's funny one of my favorite
bands uh they had broken up for a while
and they're back with like a new album
are you waiting for me to keep no you
don't have to do cuz you're not gonna
like it I'd like to try it's been called
thrice and these guys were like very
very heavy duty sure like linkin park
feel like we've played this before black
honey oh you mean to play that you could
play there's a song called hurricane
alright I'm so like they were gone for a
while I think they were broken up for
like six years and they come back and
they make a record that's like very
mature and I've really awesome like
evolution that's a great title to to be
everywhere is to be nowhere is that the
album was a native album Oh cute and
like they grew up like these guys stop
screaming and they're like yeah we're
we're talented rock band
and like it's good
I kind of like so pearl jam e no no no I
think so this sounds program mixed with
explosions in the sky dance with me I'm
nodding
well now it's not now it sounds like I
like this this great sounds like
Coldplay the vocals not like Coldplay I
just when I first heard the song I'm
like cuz if you heard their old stuff
you're like what looks the same band
almost like a TV in town yeah
or like you too am I wrong I'm like
totally off-base you follow them on
Twitter should I follow them on twitter
if you want they're on tour now
supporting this new record
and now it's Foo Fighters it sounds like
Green Day and mighty mighty bosstones
and in all those bands
I just like you know I it's still got
its heaviness like bathing at all
there's a maturity there that I didn't
think these guys had in them yeah I mean
this is like their eighth record like
they've been around the block yeah you
gotta keep reinventing yeah and that's
like tegan and sara I think they just
released their seventh or eighth oh yeah
and like they're it's funny because they
have I guarantee they have a lot of
overlapping fans like antara very big in
like punk scene 2 yeah and uh it's just
weird when like fans are still doing
their thing people get all pissy like
some of the thrice loyalists were like
what the full three shows like shoot no
no no guess what people grow up and they
have kids and their families where they
do things in their lives and that
changes them and that comes out in the
music and you have to like appreciate
that I wish someone told that to you
know 14 year old Jeff when like Green
Day made uh you know an album that he
didn't like as much as the old ones like
no dude people grow up for life people
change that's a sure day but now I have
this new thrice record go check it out i
love it i like it this is a great sound
yeah um do we want to talk about I want
to tell you about um Spotify just
partnered with bumble yes dating app is
so what's the position of dating app I
don't use desigirls primary right and
happily so but you know just as you know
it's pretty good fun I'm kind of curious
I am I've girlfriend of mine uses bumble
quite quite addictively and bumble is
basically it's it's the dating app where
women are in control right i believe so
men can message unless the whim woman
like accept invites him to or something
like that sexist right you know what I
just realized the imagery of the
branding makes perfect sense cuz it's
like sorry this get any worse but it's
like a flower and Abby so the flowers
inviting the man ah the be to land since
bumble huh I think that's a stretch I i
I'm willing to bet that's why I think
you're right my sake right thanks good
Brendan here's the Pullman here
come on shaking your stinger yeah all
right well we've done we've partnered
with them because um I guess I I don't
know you you can be attracted to
somebody because based on their music
interests maybe like I was all thing
like yeah I want to meet someone at a
show really yeah like when you're
younger you are you talking about
aligned music interests yeah of course
well this is kind of taking it to the
online dating space i guess meeting
someone at a show not a thing it and
it's obviously always been like in
online dating i used to do it many years
ago and they would always add it to the
profile right you would say like I'm
into this band of that band so this is
presumably take well it's the same thing
we basically group together your most
listened-to artists and it's presented
on your profile so people can see who
you're into right and you can't hide you
can mess with it you can't mess with it
now but I think down the line you'll be
able to silence a lie you'll be able to
edit it a little so if there's something
oddest who you've been embarrassed about
her you can maybe take them maybe a
little too much cranberries never too
much cranberry totally on that tour so
many song yeah I know you had like okay
I don't they had like 10 or 11 right now
it's a good Rick that's that vulnerable
The Salvation askin ode to my family
zombie and what else okay now they're a
mission impossible soundtrack I'm pretty
good oh not so can i play my favorite
cranberry song and causes the total
cheeky one is it playing yet yeah oh
here we go 00 linger yeah yeah right i
forgot linker I just like the accidents
the accident Dolores
that's her now I've interviewed her
she's some she's trying sweet yeah funny
cute little petite yeah tiny what other
words can I throw out there how old do
you think she is now 50 thing be there
probably but how about this song come on
what's going on got bad internet oh all
right kids i think is in the song the
place at the end of mission possible one
yeah it's a really discordant from the
restaurant Vicki but it's a great tune I
love this tune
we keep going back to the 90s guys it's
obviously the best probably all the 80s
are but we stop man I'm gonna listen so
much cranberries down
so they can see you're walking out to
whatever and and that makes the matches
on bubble yeah well I mean it's just
another rubric character trait that you
can see and and you can actually if you
see an artist on there that you've never
heard of and you want to check them out
you can click on them and it'll take you
to that artist profile and Spotify so
you can start listening instantly and
it's pretty swipe left or right based on
that experience oh I really like I mean
I think it's great I mean surprising it
hasn't been more of a thing but it made
me wonder like if you like what would
turn you off what would be a deal
breaker do you like somebody all true
but it feels like a you guys but if it's
like oh like Johnny Cash that's bad come
on but that's kinda great when I say
country that may not be Thursday you
know the cup yeah that is a deal but
don't you think a lot of guys are now
just gonna like use this as like and
then your listen to the full albums and
I look at my Katy Perry suicide is just
like dynamite yeah or maybe those my
favorite or maybe even edit their
favorite artist based on what they think
they came i'll i speaking of Adele
somebody my buddy or rot you know around
from Sony oh yeah he made the best joke
oh yeah it was really good a lot of
setup can we okay oh he's like oh
great news for Adele we know she always
nails it after a bad breakup pretty good
that's good but I was just I'm still too
sad about the whole yeah we're too too
soon for that joke you see I'm going to
be like four minutes after I'm gonna see
Adele live it medicines quick are you
gonna interview her no I'm just gonna go
and sit and listen I happen to like
Adele agree Jerry oh she's wonderful um
I got a question for you shoot that's
the bumble thing so that's live now or
it's happening right now we'll check
that collaboration out why I got a
question about um should you need to be
online dating yeah I mean don't do it
but it's interesting i hope sorry to go
back sorry to cut cut you off on your
own show but the whole online-dating
thing is fascinating to me a parent
according to bumble the average amount
of time that people spend on bumble it's
like a hundred minutes a day
that's a later time that seems like like
that one time that's more time than your
spending on facebook and what about spot
instagram spotify is always in the
background excuse me that's good well
why should I be sitting behind you but
is that something i mean i'm sure you
guys track that how many we do i don't
know i mean it's different for everyone
at the average I don't know that's a
good question it sounds crazy to push
what if you think about you're sitting
on the subway you're swiping mad you
swiping left like I'll play destiny 400
minutes but 100 minutes it's really an
hour and a half right it's a lot of mech
tonight or hi you're lying in bed yeah
yeah it does seem like a lot uh yeah I
don't know I don't know I think it's
read it are you probably a lot of people
muskan you but it's just very focused
yeah can be commuting does it have the
swype thing where you swipe i believe so
i believe so i haven't used it yeah I
don't need to but I should just to check
it out here yeah see you think they know
okay with the husband maybe no no no
friend of mine discovered that her
husband was on tinder he was like it was
just reason I'd I was just checking it
up but why did you put such a handsome
photo on it and why you say you're four
years younger why do you seem her single
uh if I were to do that and in the
conversation comes up a great deal with
Stacy and I or it's just like I just
want to just want to see I want to feel
the experience this is the Sun man I
don't want to cheat on you i love you
sure how did you mean we met in college
okay sorta college sorta we were from
the same hometown but we got close in
college right yeah you guys could do it
together like right like wide browse
yeah she'll get the hit on and she got
hit on walking the dog the other night I
was just like but she was she did yeah
she's very so that the Krans very proud
of that so God I she should be which
came home freshening guess what happened
yeah that's funny yeah what's up I got a
question about speaking of 90s and the
bands from the 2000s whatnot um growing
up in high school high school primarily
I was I was a blink 182 fan and I know
they have a new record out uh I'm
curious to know how it's doing I don't
love it i've listened to it the only
reason I bring it up I haven't cared
about this band in a decade but the lead
singer of one of my favorite bands of
all time Matt Skiba from alkaline trio
took over for Tom in blink 182 was he
thought we'd singer he's the backup guy
a base play the guitar player but yeah
saying like half the songs oh they sound
like the cranberries I sound a lot I'm
did you see them by figure out what this
single is I think it all goes it bored
to death little did you see them live at
e3 no I think so bethesda was a shitshow
out and left got it yeah but they
headlined the Bethesda press conference
oh yeah and sorry who's there I don't
love it it's not it's blink but it's not
you know 30 million streams I guess
that's not bad oh you just mean point
quantitate in general notes on it this
is not a song this is not a new song
this is really this is positive I didn't
see them I know all their sounds
the same that's why yeah the song's
called it's bored to death right yeah
yeah this is it it's a couple months all
winter if I ok I've heard the song a lot
maybe it's just like been MIA bonds like
everything else yeah sounds like all
there really is I mean they're like 40
now and they just can't make she's can't
do anything different yeah it's a long
way back from 17 that's a sign up yeah
it's a long way back later 47
the gun corn
all right we get it good I like it's cat
these guys have um more than 5 million
monthly listeners on Spotify which is
great how'd you get her to blink juanita
course you think I did you like these
this is a popular but I didn't know it's
surprising because like they haven't
been in the scene verb tenderizing it's
surprising if I sounded at all surprised
it's cuz this genre of music hasn't had
much of a showing come on it can't break
through all the pop in the EDM and the
hip hop abs are coming back now that
means in 10 years the punk rock scene
will come back again I agree I agree but
these guys do really well this song um
arguably their biggest song has more
than 100 million streams 95 more than 5
5.2 million monthly listeners that's
that's big I think what happened with
blank eyes they I don't know it's kind
of like a green day thing I'll Green
Day's another band but um you know that
stuff fell out of vogue yeah and I don't
know well they also never I mean green
day continue to have hit like they had
huge albums even after anymore though
they haven't had a big ones right I feel
like american idiot yeah here's why i
was ten years old still I mean when was
the last time going on a two-out a
figure out well that was the thing so
like they had a falling out with the
goof Tom right he left you hear his died
in a plane crash yeah yeah okay so
Travis Barker great drummer from playing
I believe was in a plane wreck with a DJ
this DJ Adam guy yeah DJ and oh I
thought works travis barker guys know
Charles parkash alive and he's playing
drums right now Sawyer's Travis is he
okay he was traumatized by it but he
seems like okay yeah sad story but up
but yet but now blink is back i guess in
there what's he doing there thing all
right can I can I just give you a little
bit of one more song yes really popular
at the moment mmm and it's on my summer
list it's from the chainsmokers we heard
of these guys know there are new york
producer do i this song's called don't
let me down you probably hello i have
heard the song yes yeah
um these guys had a song in 2014 called
selfie do you remember that sort of
parody song yes you'll probably remember
me run away with it oh I did my in the
old studio I brought you that yeah you
brought us that delight if the hook and
this I don't remember what it is but
once it comes to because I remember
being very good she's got a lord thing
going on right need you right now it's
what she up to Rihanna she sounds a bit
real 290 million streams nailing for the
song when does a kick to the things here
enough yep
movie this song sucks ha ha ha funny
story I was at the dentist and yeah I
didn't mean something better than this
man the hygienist was cleaning my teeth
and she told me that her son-in-law
writes all the songs for these guys Wow
tell him you said that you can't be like
it's worse than a root canal that isn't
the most removed you can possibly be to
someone this is your hygienist son son
in law yes would that make you guys
nothing um man uh what was like I was
gonna bring up another band oh we were
talking my lord what ship Lord what is
Lord up to something I saw photo of her
swimming somewhere I've got to stop
reading those gossip yeah bad news

what she's up to how does she feel
totally working on hmm yeah I know did
you hear about Lindsay Lohan's tweet yes
she did it was marinated them all why is
she talking she started tweeting like
she was very much the FATA UK make the
right choice but it was after the polls
that are because it wasn't she in fact
she was in favor of staying she no
excuse in favor of exiting no I think
she was in favor of the stang in the EU
the fact that we're not sure right it
sounded really just how strange stuff at
the Twitter sounded like a total me very
strange why and why that and they're
showing all the tweets were deleted
right um yeah because they're published
Oh Lindsay you know we had that talk she
lives there now hello she leaves orange
acres all right so maybe it does but
