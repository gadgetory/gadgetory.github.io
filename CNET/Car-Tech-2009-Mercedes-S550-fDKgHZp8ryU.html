still have a few moves let's get into
the Mercedes s550 for 2010 and check the
dash the s-class is kind of a sad little
mixed bag of cabin tech it's one of the
best systems in terms of just the
quality of beat interface and the way it
looks when you dig down into it it's
missing some stuff for example this car
doesn't have HD radio yet just about
every other onine Mercedes does this is
just late to the game
the navigation system has traffic of
course they were early on in this stuff
and they do a good job of it
interestingly there's no audio option on
this car you just get the audio system
luckily it's pretty darn good it's a
Harman Kardon Logic 7 which is
synthetics around 14 speakers something
like 600 watts and 7.1 surround
compatible which is pretty impressive
that of course would come off of a DVD
audio disc
play the six disc changer right here in
the console as you can see it's pretty
straightforward right above a PCMCIA
card slot you know I feel about those
and here our audio sources am/fm
satellite radio of course the the CDs
can go in here DVD s can go in there DVD
videos can go in there and aux refers to
in this case the optional iPhone
connector iPod iPhone which is a
dealer-installed accessory about 400
bucks no USB drive in this car which is
becoming pretty common in a lot of
vehicles especially those that cost near
$100,000 you do have aux Jack's however
there's a set of RCA s for stereo audio
and video up there in the glove box now
the big crowd-pleaser in this car is of
course night view assist optional we've
got it in this vehicle only works at
night if you hit the button over here
that entire speedometer turns into a
forward-looking night-vision camera I've
always found that kind of jarring
because adjusting your focal plane from
there to out on the road makes me nuts
but some folks must love it now believe
it or not even in the car of this price
the rear view camera is optional part of
a package and it does give you some
information about your trajectory and
where you're going this button takes you
to the most complicated seats in a car
today you've got the ability to adjust
any number of the components of them
look at all the various zones that are
user
guessable in those seats then you've got
the pulse mode which is kind of a little
you know massage thing from slow and
gentle too fast and vigorous that's
obscene and you've got dynamic seats
here tells you how much the seats will
automatically bolster you against lean
or dynamics in the car you put it on to
there and it's annoying you can be
turning in a parking lot and this
thing's hanging on there for dear life
up here in the engine room we've got
what you think we have a five and a half
liter v8 hence the name s550 no tricks
no turbos no supercharger no diesel or
hybrid obviously this time good ol
Mercedes v8 puts out 382 horsepower 391
foot-pounds that's good for a 0 to 60
scoot in 5.4 seconds pretty good for a
big old fat ass of a car like this but
the mileage is where you suffer 1422
good enough to qualify you for a
thousand dollar gas guzzler tax one
transmission in this car 7-speed
automatic it's a beautiful gearbox you
do have some cheesy plastic paddles up
here the logic on this car is left for
downshift right for up shift you know
and there's no shiftable stick because
all you have is this little dainty stock
so this is your shifting interface right
there parking assist system on this car
doesn't actually steer anything or take
over the wheel it just tells you what to
do so here I'm pulling up alongside a
spot and I've got that square P right
there which is going to turn blue okay
that means it's inquired and found a
parking spot and now I just have to
match up the lines until they're green
the yellow and the red and just follow
that arc it's using all of its sensors
around the car to see if I'm making the
right trajectory and not hitting
anything and bingo it beats when I'm
going way back and that's it
now I must admit the s-class always
spells old man to me but on the road
you're reminded that if this is what the
old guys are driving they've still got
it going on a creamy powerful quiet ride
awaits with handling and steering that
belies this car's size and weight while
making those silly pretensions about
being a sports car leave that nonsense
to the AMG side of the house I can live
without a lot of the styling of this car
from the pontoon front fenders for that
swelling potbelly thing in the center of
the dash and the annoying dial pad that
hides most of the control knob I can
also pass on the taillights a look that
they came off a 94 Mustang but the cabin
is a damn nice place to spend time on
the way to some wine auction or whatever
you s-class drivers do when you're not
leasing one of these for four figures a
month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
