comeback and with them comes the new cue
acoustics m2 this is a three hundred and
forty nine dollar sound base which
offers a decent amount of features
including Bluetooth and an HDMI input
unlike their counterparts sound bars a
sound base is designed to be a literal
base for your TV and it's better for
smaller televisions which have a
centralized pedestal stand the m2 is a
compact sound base less than two feet
across but it feels sturdy and it's
rated to hold TVs up to 25 kilograms or
55 pounds in weight the sound base is
covered in a matte black finish and it
has a steel grill across the front the
unit features a power button on top
which functions as a source selector
changing color according to the input
the speaker also includes a dinky
credit-card remote but these are easy to
lose and I'd suggest using the TV
controller or getting a universal model
instead the speaker includes two balance
mode radiators on the front and these
offer a wider sweet spot than most
speakers so people on the ends of the
couch don't miss out
plus it has a built-in subwoofer on the
bottom don't expect bowels shaking bass
from it though and unfortunately there's
no subwoofer output to add more low end
m to offers clear sound something we've
heard from other q acoustics products
making dialogue perfectly intelligible
and that's what makes it worth the price
of admission alone but if you push it
for action movies or music the lean
sound balance doesn't really have any
way to go the Q acoustics m2 is likable
enough but for the money there are
better alternatives including the
fluence a 40 or the Z Vox sound bass 670</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
