I had a lot of retro game systems so
this size HDMI can play 720p not that
Atari games are high resolution but you
could connect it to your TV more easily
there are a hundred twenty games in this
there is there a pair of wireless
controllers and you can save resume and
rewind games this is a lot like the Sega
Genesis flashback made by the same
company so let's take a look at the box
it's got nicer packaging and a bunch of
the games are listed back here I don't
even remember a lot of these games but
there's link by Activision there is
pitfall which is awesome so Activision
games are on here see quest see battle
real sports games all of them it seems
star master sword quest games I remember
those tempest warlords asteroids so a
lot of the classics let's take a look at
what's inside the box this is the most
expensive of the flashback consoles
they're actually a couple of Atari
consoles that they're selling right now
this is the only one that's HD so you
got an Atari poster that games is really
into putting the the posters in the box
which is kind of cool this is the flash
pancake which has a very similar graphic
design to be Sega one with the same
white grid which I'm not so wild about
there's a fall which feels like a bit of
an afterthought none of the cool Atari
art that I remember that they've created
great art books with but anyway if you
want a kind of okay Atari poster here's
one with crease marks and instructions
on the back inside the box you've got
the little Atari console this is very
small and it doesn't okay this doesn't
really look like an Atari console that I
remember it's like kind of with sort of
wood grain that's a sticker and a bunch
of buttons so you've got difficulty
buttons select buttons start power
and to authentic game controller ports
so both of these here you could plug in
old controllers if you have them or use
the wireless ones the HDMI is on the
side which is kind of strange so I don't
know the reason for that that's the box
it does not play cartridges unlike the
Sega Genesis flashback so I'm sorry but
it does have a lot of games on it you
also get two of these old-fashioned
controllers and they're Wireless you
have to unscrew this to get to the
batteries and it feels ok this doesn't
feel as flimsy as a Sega Genesis 1:1
button this actually feels like it's
easier to move than the original 2600
joystick which was really stiff so
there's that there's the other joysticks
such a strange thing to have again and
here's the AC adapter pretty small in
fact it looks like the same exact AC
adapter as the other Sega Genesis
console and HDMI so that's how the
hardware looks these two wireless
controllers and the console which is
pretty lightweight plastic what's weird
is that these two wireless controllers
one of them has extra buttons the other
doesn't so if you want to be able to use
the extra buttons use the correct
controller the one that has the extra
buttons has four on the side these are
reset select start and replay because
this has game rewind so that I guess
that brings up game rewind functions for
all of the games love to see how that
works
other than that it's you know your
classic but more lightweight feeling I
think joystick the joystick actually
feels less stiff than the original Atari
2600 joystick but it feels really weird
to be using a joystick again anyway I
won't have as many people playing the
Atari 2600 and it's games as possible
people who've never played it before and
people have played all the games how did
they look on a giant HDTV we'll find out
stay tuned at CNET we'll tell you about
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
