cnet.com today we're gonna take a first
look at the Samsung axle this is also
called the SCH R 311 it's a new phone
for US Cellular service this one looks a
lot like the Samsung byline has really
the same design couple differences you
notice there is a camera here the byline
didn't have one of those and the phone's
just the tiniest bit heavier than the
byline but overall very similar design
flip phone really straight lines just
rounded at the ends a mirrored face here
on the front does catch fingerprints and
smudges pretty easily so you want to be
aware of that external display it's a
bit small but it is full color and it
shows everything you need to know date
time battery life signal strength also
works as a viewfinder for the camera
here on the side you see there's a
volume rocker over here there's just a
camera shutter and a proprietary headset
charger jack of course that means you
can only use one peripheral at a time
and you will need an adapter to use your
own headset phone does have a plastic
skin probably won't stand up to a lot of
blows but has a pretty comfortable
feeling in the hand and the hinge feels
pretty sturdy inside to find a
full-color display it is pretty bright
graphics and photos won't look
exceptionally sharp as the resolution
isn't that great but it's perfectly fine
for this caliber phone menus are pretty
easy to navigate and come in two styles
list or icon you can change some of the
display settings as well like
backlighting brightness when we know the
navigation controls and keypad they are
pretty well designed they are pretty
spacious they are raised just above the
surface of the phone and so the pretty
tactile felt pretty comfortable they
also have a nice almost rubbery feeling
beneath the finger and moving out of the
keypad buttons pretty bright
backlighting numbers are relatively
large and had no problems dialing or
texting quickly and no problem
navigating to the menu but really this
phone is just for making calls and
sending messages call quality was okay
the phone does get loud at the higher
levels and the auto quality was too tad
distorted especially at those high
volumes but for just a casual user who
just needs a phone occasionally should
it be too much of a problem I'm Ken
Sherman and this is the Samsung axle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
