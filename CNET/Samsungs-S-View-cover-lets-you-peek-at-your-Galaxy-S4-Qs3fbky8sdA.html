galaxy s4 launch event and one of the
cool accessories samsung has something
called the S view cover it's a plasticky
cover that fits around the entire phone
and it's got a little window in it right
here so when you close your phone it's
going to give you a new view it knows
that the cover is closed and it's going
to give you a miniaturized view that
shows you through the window in this
case the time the date and how many
emails that you have and it turns off
after a little while and you can always
just open the phone and close it again
to get back to that view and then if you
have some new updates the coming they're
going to show up here it's not the most
important thing in the world but if
you're one of those people like me who's
always taken your phone out of your
pocket opening up the cover to see what
new information is shown up this is a
quick way to get a look at that without
actually having to flip the cover open
like that we're not sure exactly when
this covers for example how much is
going to cost but it is custom-made for
the galaxy s4 I've been occurring at the
samsung galaxy s4 launch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
