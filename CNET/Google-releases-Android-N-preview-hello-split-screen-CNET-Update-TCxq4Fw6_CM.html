version of android I'm Bridget Carey
this is your seen that update
android users get ready for split screen
on your smartphone google revealed the
next flavor of Android software right
now codenamed Android n only software
developers get the chance to tinker with
it now since it's unfinished but the big
new features include split screen for
working on two apps at once on a phone
or tablet also there is picture in
picture mode so you can view a video in
a small box in the corner of a screen
and then let you do things like check
email while still watching your show
some apple devices and samsung phones
have had these features already but you
know playing catch-up is all part of the
game between these companies the
notification bar is also getting tweaked
if you get a message alert you can type
your reply right inside the alert and
Apple's iOS also has a simpler feature
perhaps battery life will get a boost
with improvements to the dos power saver
now normally Google likes to unveil the
next version of its operating systems at
the i/o Developers Conference but
Google's trying something different this
time releasing it before the conference
which isn't until May now it's not easy
for Google to get its new software on
every Android device when you have so
many makers of phones Google's Nexus
devices do get them first but only two
percent of Android users right now are
reading the latest Android 6.0
marshmallow most about thirty five
percent are still on 4.4 kitkat which is
more than two years old these systems
always get named after a sweet treat so
we'll have to wait and see what n will
stand for maybe something with nougat or
good old stuck in your teeth nut brittle
why Landry improves so does Google's
artificial intelligence computer alfa GO
created by google's deepmind team alpha
co is doing something no other computer
can do and that's beat humans at the
most complicated board game the ancient
Chinese game of Go the game may look
simple with black and white stones but
it is complicated for a computer because
there are more possible moves than there
are atoms in the universe 10 to the
power of 170 and instead of processing
each possible outcome because that would
take forever a computer just sort of
needs to play smart alphago defeated the
world champion
isa doll the top go player in the past
decade in the first of five matches the
battles are taking place now in Seoul
South Korea and they're being live
streamed on youtube it goes on through
Monday no pressure said all it's just
the future of humanity that rests in
your hands that's it for this tech news
update you can head to see that com for
more from our studios in New York I'm
