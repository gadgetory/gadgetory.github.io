hottest Android phone of the summer
after the blazing success of the galaxy
s3 all that Samsung has to do is not
ruin a good thing but maintaining the
status quo isn't the kind of thing that
typically gets Android fans frothing at
the mouth so if you're looking for an
excuse not to buy the galaxy s4 I'm here
to count down five reasons to just say
no starting off at number five the
underdogs with the s4 samsung that's
just trying to hold on to their lead so
now it's up to the underdogs to try to
steal the spotlight LG has those
beautiful screens HTC has that whole
kinder gentler hipper take on android
nokia is a what is Nokia doing anyway oh
that's right he'll come around point is
you never know when the next
breakthrough feature is going to come up
but you can bet that's gonna come from a
manufacturer with something to prove the
number four reason not to buy a galaxy
s4 it's boring it's a big fast totally
boring looking phone and stamps on the
same smooth nondescript plastic design
as the s3 and when you take it out most
people will think it's an s3 if you want
to get noticed go with an HTC One from
the money you get twice the storage and
a design that is both elegant and unique
I mean really isn't standing out from
the crowd part of what attracted you to
Android in the first place alright
coming in at number three the Samsung
Galaxy s3 is it gonna walk around with
something that looks like an s3 why not
just buy the s3 this is the phone we've
been raving about all year and guess
what it's still awesome plus the s3 is a
steal right now so just upgrade that
thing to jellybean buy a slightly bigger
case and no one's gonna know the
difference coming in at number two the
Google Nexus 5 Google has been putting
their stamp on some great hardware
recently and I'm sure they wish their
Nexus phones got a little more respect
with Google i/o right around the corner
it's worth waiting to see if they have a
killer new phone to show off a new Nexus
could also mean that they're gonna give
us the first taste of Android key lime
pie
and I always get so hungry when through
these Android stories now before we get
to the number one reason to pass on the
Samsung Galaxy s4 let's balance things
out with some reasons why the s4 rocks
on just about every carrier has some
killer camera features quad core
processor removable battery Android
4.2.2 a big old screen and you can even
use it as a TV remote it was honestly
pretty hard to come up with five reasons
not to buy this phone it won an
outstanding rating from CNS jessica's
all court and an editor's choice so
don't listen to me go out and buy this
phone that is unless you're the patient
type my number one reason to pass on the
Samsung Galaxy s4 the next Samsung phone
whatever it is you thought I was gonna
say iPhone didn't you shame on you nope
now that Samsung has the lead they're
their own worst enemy that company
cranks out more different phone models
than tumblr can crank out animated cat
gifs if the s4 isn't quite your cup of
tea just wait a minute the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 is coming around the
corner and then there's gonna be a slew
of galaxy remixes that follow until
there's the galaxy s5 rumors that start
bubbling up and will be treated to
another head-scratching launch event the
point is there's no rush and waiting is
only going to work to your advantage so
there you go five reasons to take a deep
breath and maybe just wait this one out
we're seeing this full review of the s4
and all of the competition head over to
phones cnet.com and for more videos like
this check out top-5 cnet.com I'm
