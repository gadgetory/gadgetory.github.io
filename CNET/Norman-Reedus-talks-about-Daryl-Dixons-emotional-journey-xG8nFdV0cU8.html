i have no shoes on man
I live in New York but I went to Los
Angeles for pilot season and if you're
not familiar with that that's when you
go out there and they show you all the
new television shows are about to make
cop shows
er type shows a roommate buddy shows and
then Walking Dead happened and I I read
that and I didn't even read zombies I
read this guy who lost his family and
this tragedy happened and he was just
trying to find his family you know I
found Randall right he turned it wasn't
big you know I think of Daryl all the
time and everybody calls me Daryl man if
it knows my name anyone there's a lot of
me in him and a lot of him in me do it
there were early scripts that had him
taking drugs and being racist and all
this stuff like his brother was and yeah
I fought to change those can I felt like
he wasn't really comfortable with who he
was I don't know nothing
starting this way everything gonna look
at me now he talks to you like this like
he means everything he says he's super
direct super honest and you can count on
him uh start over what - he calls shots
with Rick and they look at each other
like brothers
last season was hard on us we were all
separated and I was crying all the time
I was naked and eating dogs there's
there's no fun and this season feels
like our show again I've shot everything
from 50 caliber rifles to crossbows
I think I'm a natural
I'm kind of a tech person I have those
little robots that go on the floor and
clean your floors I have like two or
three going at a time I have cameras set
up so I can watch my cat walk back and
forth I just miss him so I see him if I
could teach him to talk back to me that
would be awesome maybe somebody should
invent that you pretty much have
everything wrong on this interview make
it up I don't even care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
