games yeah that's great there's a lot of
good games this year in 2016 there are a
whole lot of duds to some of them way
more disappointing than others that's
why I'm here today to give you twenty
six teams most disappointing video games
so let's start things off with a game
called mighty number nine it's a title
that was labeled as a spiritual
successor to the Mega Man series the
game was actually kick-started over four
hundred percent of the original goal
back in 2013 but then faced delay after
delay after delay until it finally
debuted in June where it sort of fell
flat and failed to impress even the most
optimistic of critics next up is battle
born the quote-unquote hero shooter from
Natina gave us borderlands battle born
was never able to muster any kind of
momentum before its release in May and
when it finally did come out critics
complain that the game felt uninspired
and remarkably unfunny timing didn't
help anything either because when
overwatch was released it seemed to eat
battle borns lunch even if they really
weren't as similar as people assumed
ubisoft's the division wasn't
necessarily a bad game but that's not
what this list is about what's
disappointing about the division was the
way it attempted to combine an online
co-op game with a third-person shooter
which resulted in a really weird grind
that felt monotonous and trite its story
also failed to captivate which was a big
reason I struggled to press on finally
we'll close things out with well you
guess this one no man's sky no game
should have ever received the amount of
hype that no man's sky did and that's a
big reason why its release was 2016's
most disappointing gamers felt they were
shown one thing in the time leading up
to its debut then got something that
felt significantly short of what seemed
possible in previews if anything the
community should learn something from
this fiasco perhaps temper expectations
for the next big thing to be fair no
man's sky has recently received a major
update to its core gameplay and that's
great nothing will be able to repair the
original shock of its release there are
more games in my list of this year's
most disappointing title so be sure to
check out the full collection over at
