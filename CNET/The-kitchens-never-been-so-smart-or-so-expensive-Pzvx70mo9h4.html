but manufacturers keep making them and
people largely keep on passing them up
now these Samsung models are some of the
latest attempts at winning the shopping
public over we wanted to know if any of
the smarts are more compelling than
before so what's the point in having an
oven with Wi-Fi well for Samsung it's
all about convenience with this oven you
can use an app to control certain oven
functions so let's say you're at work
and you want a nice hot oven when you
get home you can set a pre heat from
your app which is pretty convenient when
you're really really busy now as cool as
the Wi-Fi oven and the app art there are
still some limitations the app gets a
little finicky if you've been away from
it for a while and it's a little hard to
set up and as an oven
the Samsung unit is just okay which is
not what you'd expect for a three
thousand dollar appliance with the
family hub refrigerator you've got this
21 and a half inch touchscreen on the
door that has apps for things like
syncing up your family's calendars
streaming music even ordering groceries
you also have cameras with the thing but
they're inside of the fridge you use
those to check your inventory while
you're out at the grocery or here on the
fridge itself for labeling when stuffs
about to expire and there are other
smart fridges on the market too g e--'s
got one that'll make it coffee in the
morning royal pools got one that works
with nest LG has one that opens the
doors automatically when your arms are
full they all do different things
because they're all sort of big
expensive dart throws manufacturers are
still trying to figure out how to get
people to buy into the idea of smart
refrigerators to begin with and that's
not an easy task
this one here costs six thousand dollars
and that's the thing there aren't any
budget-friendly options available right
now if you want a smart large kitchen
appliance it's luxury or novice yeah and
they don't feel totally necessary for
the smart kitchen yet either I mean if
you want to have smart cooking
assistance with your stove or smart
inventory management in your fridge
there are devices that will work with
your existing dumb appliances and get
the job done that's what we think it's a
smarter idea to forego large kitchen
appliances that try to do everything
instead opted for specialized small
appliances that cost a lot less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
