under $100 you're looking to buy
somewhere a pretty nice gift or maybe
that someone is you either way for about
$100 you can get some pretty nice stuff
let's check it out
and number five is a Garmin vivofit 2
you can find this online for about $60
it's got an always-on display and it
uses a coin battery that lasts one year
this thing is even water-resistant
enough that you can swim with it if
you're buying this as a gift
make sure the recipient actually wants a
fitness tracker otherwise your great
gift might be seen as an insult number
four is the Air Hogs ultimate Millennium
Falcon quad drone this toy drone is just
awesome looking it costs around $50 and
can be charged by the controller or by a
USB port the big downside is the battery
life of the drone maxes out at around
eight minutes but it's going to be a
glorious eight minutes sitting at number
three is the NES classic this might be
very hard to find but that's for a very
good reason the NES classic comes with
30 games built in including Castlevania
Super Mario Brothers 1 2 and 3 plus The
Legend of Zelda now the NES classic
isn't perfect but imagine a world where
when you played a game it was complete
without the need for downloadable
content all the old days number 2 is the
Amazon echo dot forget about living in
the past with a Nintendo step into the
future where you can talk to Emma's on
Alexa in the form of the $50 Amazon echo
dot the tiny speaker connects it the
Internet to assist you want to order a
car to pick you up maybe you want a
pizza delivered maybe you just want some
music to be played dot can do that if
you've got smart home gadgets the dot is
a great hub to control them with just
your voice and at number one is the Roku
premier plus Roku makes some of the best
media streamers out there the premiere
plus is a hair under the hundred dollar
mark with a retail price of $99.99 this
Roku comes with a Wi-Fi remote so you
don't have to point it at the box and
the remote has a headphone jack for
private listening the Premier Plus also
outputs 4k video there are so many other
gadgets that could have been on this
list but this is top 5 not top 20
