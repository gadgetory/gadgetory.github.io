lightest and least expensive portable
bluetooth speaker with a price tag of
100 2995 hi I'm David karna white and as
you might expect from the speaker called
the color it comes in multiple colors
and bow seems to be targeting a younger
demographic with its more playful design
which is a bit of a departure for the
company I personally like this blue
model but it's also available in black
white red and mint
while it's compact measuring 5.3 inches
high five inches wide and 2.1 inches
deep it's got a little bit of heft to it
Wayne 1.25 pounds bow says it's designed
to fit easily into a hand bag knapsack
or the palm of your hand and it seems
like it would be right at home in a
kid's room or the kitchen a last note
carrying case is included as far as
features go it has a pretty basic
feature set with a pause play button on
top and volume controls but no
speakerphone capabilities the speaker
remembers the last eight devices you
paired with it
compared with two devices at once but
only plays sound from one at a time and
gets up to eight hours of battery life
which is pretty decent for a very
compact Bluetooth speaker like the more
expensive sound like MIDI the speaker
plays a lot louder than you think it
would for its small size with a decent
amount of bass sound wise it's not on
par with the mini but it does charge via
USB which is convenient and measures up
well with other compact speakers in this
price range such as the JBL flip 2 Bose
has done a good job eking out about the
best sound you can expect from a speaker
this size and place get near a wall will
help it's bass performance the speaker
is designed to avoid distorting at
higher volume so there are times when
you push the volume the music seems a
little restrained and rolled off at
certain frequencies it also has a little
trouble with more complicated music and
finally although there are two drivers
in a bass radiator there's virtually no
stereo separation which is par for the
course for this type of speaker I'd say
that if your priority is sound quality
you'd be better off with the more
of sound like mini but if you value
portability and don't want to spend the
extra $70 the Soundlink color is a good
choice I think the majority of people
will be impressed with what it can do
particularly in smaller rooms and gave
it car noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
