how to shop for storage devices and
maybe be happy with your life I'm
serious look at how happy I am now we
come to storage devices there are three
thing you want to keep in mind the
performance the capacity and the data
safety on top of data safety later we're
going to come to performance and
capacity I always get the fastest and
the latest on the market is fun to have
your hands on the best I can't afford
that oh really okay all right in that
case and talk about picking and choosing
and balancing the two the performance
and the capacity so people like my
friend Jam here can afford them now
there are three types of start devices
the first one is the internal drive if
you're buying one as a main drive to a
host operating system this is where
performance is very important in this
case you're going to chew a smaller size
so instead drive maybe had a 20 gig or
two and a 40 gig about $200 or less to
use for this purpose you can always
extend the storage of the computer by
using an external drive or in case of a
desktop computer you can also use
another regular hard drive as a
secondary to host data for example this
is one of my test machine here and as
you can see I you an SSD over here as
the main drive and then I used another
regular hard drive up top here as a
drive to hold data this setup is
actually the best in terms of the
balance between performance capacity and
of course affordability
now the second tie up storage is the
external drive in this case performance
is not the most important thing but the
capacity so how much is enough you do
not need too much either but make sure
that you have a drive that have ammo
store space than the internal drive that
you want to back it up on so something
between 500 gigabyte and one tear buy
should be good for most people there's
one exception
Thunderball these drive are actually
very expensive but they also offer very
good performance and
the only professional would need that
and professional tend to spend a lot of
money on the equipment now the last type
store device is the network attached or
NASA server such as this synergy right
here now these devices are connected to
your network and therefore the
performance is limited by the
performance of the network itself and a
gigabit network which is the fastest
option for consumer caps at about 130
megabyte per second that's that you do
have to spend money on the internal
drive just by the drive that is long
lasting and use less energy such as this
Green Drive right here to use inside the
nest server all right now let's talk
about data security this is important
because when a hard drive die you lose a
lot more than just the drive itself the
information hole actually worth more
than the cost of a new drive for that
reason for storage you do not want to
buy use or refurbish drive you also want
to buy dry for the right environment for
example this lucy record drive right
here it can handle shock and drop and
it's good for people who work in the
rough environment oops
the drives okay my toe my we broke up
the drives okay there's also another
option called redundancy for example
this dry right here comes with sick
drive bay and you can actually set them
to u1 or to the drive as redundant
meaning that if one of the hard ride
here died you can replace it without
losing the data and finally backup
instead of buying just one portable
drive right here you buy two in this
case you can put your data on two
separate location in addition to your
computer the good thing is these two are
actually very affordable with some
capacity costing a lot less than $100
there you go that's it for now to find
out more go check out the detail buying
guide c-calm if you have a question or
want to find out how happy I really am
you can reach me via Twitter or my
facebook page and it will very impressed
and that's because I'm dome know and
this has been a proof guy on how to shop
for your storage
