welcome to episode 145 of the 359
podcast with Ben Fox Rubin and I as
akhtar good morning guys what are we
talking about today well hey oh there I
am well we're talking today about
directv now a rumor about new echo like
speaker or an Amazon echo speaker that
may be coming out as early as early next
year and also cyber monday sales I cyber
monday sales figures as far as we're not
gonna tell you about the deals that you
missed but like I yes bulaga no you did
miss some deals the echo died is no
longer at forty dollars so that's too
bad but you know maybe I'll get there at
some point later I think we all live
yeah so while Roger is out and Alfred's
unavailable I have is here at the ready
like that as long as its licensors dear
guy Chris Wesley is very excited you
hear is oh very cool alright so without
further ado let's get started as always
send in your questions and comments
Brian will get to them at the end of the
podcast and let's get moving and here we
go for the start of the recording of the
podcast in three two welcome to the 359
I'm Ben Fox Rubin and with me is a
glorious guest I as the wolf akhtar
that's me oh whoa the wolf first off
AT&amp;amp;T this week is launching DirecTV now
a series of skinny bundled cable
packages with the cheapest plan offering
100 channels for just 35 bucks a month
that's a limited time offer though folks
so grab it if you're interested is what
do you think of this well I was looking
at that deal of 35 bucks hundred
channels and the thing is you'll keep
that price as long as you don't cancel
right if you cancel anytime you get
bumped up ty think it's a sixty dollars
a month yeah so I think it's a really
great idea to get people in the door
because a lot of features are missing
from the service compared to other ones
but the channel lineup looks pretty good
yeah when one thing will throw out there
CBS our corporate overlords are not
included I think one of the reasons is
potentially that CBS has its own thing
CBS all access so that might might be a
potential issue over there will
if they get added some time later also
you could get HBO for just five dollars
a month as an add-on which is a pretty
nice addition there at that end Cinemax
I think that's also five dollars a month
if you want that so the pricing seems
really aggressive and there's a lot of
services out there there's the sony
playstation view service which i think
is pretty good but i think it's sixty
dollars for the base one or around that
price forty bucks thank you and the
thing is when it comes to directv they
also have that link with 1880s it's
eighteen eighty owns them that they're
not going to charge you any data if
you're watching DirecTV now on you're
eighteen t device on out work so that's
a huge like huge great thing if you're
on AT&amp;amp;T if you're afraid of net
neutrality concerns that would be a
whole other mess yeah but that's a real
good hook that they've got that I don't
think that else has so they do you have
a couple of hooks out there another one
to throw out there a sling TV their
basic bundles 25 channels for only 20
bucks a month so there are going to be
there are now a lot of new opportunities
out there if you are interested in
something that's not traditional cable
or satellite which tends to be a little
bit more money about sixty or a hundred
dollars depending on what your channel
packages are next amazon is reportedly
planning a high-end Alexis speaker with
a touchscreen that could live in your
kitchen rumors are that this gadget
could be cropping up later oh sorry
rumors are that this gadget started
cropping up late last year but bloomberg
reports that it may be coming as soon as
early this year sorry garbled that one
yeah there's the wall street journal
reports on around for a while there's a
new bank lunenburg it's a 7-inch
touchscreen with these high-end speakers
that are supposed to be there so to be
able to talk to this device that
supposedly live in your kitchen it's at
a tilt so you can stand your counter and
talk to this thing is anything like that
even necessary consider the fire tablet
has alexa now and the alexis speaker
works pretty well so if i if I'm like
making a recipe and I need my laptop
I'll bring my laptop into the kitchen if
I need my tablet I can bring my tablet
into the kitchen granted I don't have a
mount or a dock onto it but what exactly
this thing is going to do that's
different than what's already available
and when actually amazon already
provides with a lot of its other devices
that's going to be a really big question
and on top of that according to the
report it's it's supposed to be a
higher-end device and
I I think amazon has had a little bit of
an issue with really convincing people
to buy at a higher price level that and
the fact they're trying to get a
potentially a computer in the kitchen
which never seems to work if you want a
tablet on your refrigerator you can do
that but nobody really does your hands
are really messy so you want to be able
to talk to something but a touchscreen
you don't want to touch you after you
touch chicken or something and it's
really yes it's gonna be like a
waterproof or really tough device yeah
that's why voice has been so effective
especially in the kitchen that's where
my echo lives last cyber monday became
the biggest online sales day in US
retail history yet again no surprise
there but if you miss the deals don't
worry more are coming according to
retailmenot better deals are usually
available later in the season for gaming
consoles toys and discounted gift cards
oh my God we're out of time anything
else you want to say I hope the cyber
naming things over okay I'll see how
that goes if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on cnet I'm
Ben Fox Rubin am i as acts are thanks
for listening I just want to say thank
you MKV cinemas for buttering us up he
says you're very handsome men and he
think he's doing that because he wants
you to answer question that's not
related to today so well now we have to
it works it absolutely worked when will
Android one get Android seven point oh I
don't know the answer that I don't know
the answer to that I are available
armani genius mobile guy Roger is not
here today android seven point 0
supposed to show up till I think some
Samsung devices no the Nexus devices
December 6th is the rumor but that's
Nexus devices so if they are upgrading
the same time the Android one which I
don't know offhand maybe as early
december six but i wouldn't bet money on
it for a while okay that's the best
answer we have so far and thank you for
saying we're pretty is male wants to
know is there a full list of channels
with the direct TV now i believe ya is
listed in the article that will post in
the show notes yep and you can find them
there instead of us a lot of the popular
one right now a lot of the popular ones
that you would expect um like disney's
on there i think Cartoon Network's on
their disney junior ESPN that's in the
base package USA's in there I think look
what's the the next up package that you
really really want to watch maybe ESPN
news it's pretty good their lifetime
movie network you know I know you guys
love like
my life like I do movie network and you
see sports and then there's some like
regional sports packages and other thing
yeah like yeah yeah the problem with a
lot of these is that it's still cobbled
together services where you you kind of
get a little bit of what you want in
this service you get a little bit of
what you want in the other service and
it's not quite there yet I think and one
of the problems too is that in some of
these services like DirecTV now you
don't get all the broadcaster's which
which is unfortunate i feel like that
should be at least the baseline and yes
i will provide another disclosure that
CBS is the owner of cnet so yes I want
to make sure people remember that like
you'll get the networks at least the
broadcast networks NBC Fox ABC as long
as they are the affiliates owned and
operated by the network if they're not
you'll get the on-demand version the
next day later good silly it's got all
these like because of the way television
construct for so long there are all of
these hoops and barriers yeah there's
there's also in John salzman story today
she also mentioned some issues like some
wrinkles with the NFL oh yeah because
there's an exclusive package with
verizon wireless you can't watch NFL on
mobile using DirecTV now so again this
is a continuation of just a lot of
hamstrung issues and a lot of asterisks
involved in a lot of these plans but we
do we know if CNN is on the list CNN is
on the list there in the liberal little
the original the $35 60 channel bundle
so in the baseline million CNN if you
want to watch CNN and we'll current
directv subscribers get a discount on
directv now I did not see anything about
that did you know I didn't see anything
about that it was really they were
providing the limited time offer of 35
dollars for the bumped up package of a
hundred channels so I didn't I didn't
see anything specific about if you're a
current member what you're gonna get
yeah um shout out to Michael Brown our
buddy in the chat oh he wants to revisit
topic we were talking about yesterday
yes it is it too late to mention how
privacy concerns aren't as they were
with the spectacles like it was with the
Google glass I think that's coming i
really do it's just too young right now
well look at the way that they're
selling expected
basically they're making people wait for
six hours in line to buy these things so
um yeah they're really popular and
they're really buzzy but snapchat has
done a really successful job of really
just sprinkling them in the marketplace
like I was walking around with Alfred in
the street and some guy literally
stopped him and said hey you've got
you've got spectacles so they're trying
to create that kind of cool air around
them of rarity but this definitely
distinct difference between snapchat or
snap and converse is google which is
about taking all your information
organizing it and everyone's concerned
that Google is going to help build this
huge database I don't think people
worried so much about snap doing that on
its face you know that's not a pun but
it is I think what I agree but it's
that's why they don't freak out yet but
they will actually it's still the it's
very much the same type of product so I
think that's why it's a really good
question for Michael that it's still a
camera an outward facing camera on your
face so and there were when when Google
glass had come out it was banned from
certain areas you couldn't bring it into
like a casino or sits like that just for
a little lens cap on them this little
flip flip down lens cap so people can
see that they're off like I think it
would help well no like people were
arguing that you should have had like
the red button like the like on a camera
order like just a red button that turns
on to let you know that is something
that spectacles have done where it'll
it'll have like a word actually turns on
yeah yeah there's like this these lights
that like were around so you actually
know when you're being recorded so
that's good to know yeah I mean what
about google glass remember the stories
about what's the facetime camera on Mac
computers getting hacked and that
leaking information and they people have
figured out how to get it so that it
doesn't light up you don't know you're
being watched kind of thing how long
else I'd imagine it's on it's coming
also what else is coming first person
POV snapchat born Oh totally I has it
not happened yet I mean I would expect
it to already be you guys probably know
let us know no please don't let its yes
or no it's not your legs here is direct
TV now going to allow users to sign in
like the ESPN app and
with the sign in and have a loophole
like that with NFL games that's an
interesting God I don't know that's that
I want to say yes sign on with other
networks you don't use just their apps
if you're watching VOD you'll be able to
use their their stuff I'd imagine it's a
somewhat out of my league as far as as
far as that's last cast icity I think
it's messing with it right now you'll
see if we can like you hook up an apple
TV and do it yeah well it doesn't come
out until tomorrow actually so we'll
have to wait on that answer yeah under
lock and key yeah doesn't would be here
and I'm I think that's funny amazon
questions I'm surprised nobody cares
about us in here cares about the the
kitchen thing okay I guess everybody
that once an echo already has one I know
that's not possible what i've done is i
have a look an old nook that i wouldn't
be afraid to get splattered with grease
or food or whatever that I took and I i
modified its case so it's got magnets on
the back and i mounted it to my fridge
brilliant yeah see and i can show your
five you DIY did ya like 180 or whatever
it is probably how much is that Samsung
is the Samsung fridges has five grand
it's like I've gotta lose 4-3 a blow for
it there's a fridge that's a very good
lot of money for a friend exact don't
say as cameras in the insights you can
actually see what's inside the fridge
right and right look later on from
supermarket and a nap i'm not making up
any of this is why I'm laughs I have
seen the fridge in person and I will say
this that it is really a WoW fridge like
people walk in and like that's a real
centerpiece that you can show off if
you're if you have a lot of money to
spend on a fridge but one point Alexa
was rumored to be built into that fridge
and then they backed off of that
entirely which was really weird Samsung
was gonna do that in January and then
look up we don't know what happened to
that yeah look I i think the the
smartest thing amazon has done so far
with alexa is creating the echo died
they made it only forty dollars during
black friday to cyber monday basically
sprinkling the market like so much with
alexa where they're gonna make it a
little bit harder for the google home to
actually break in granted you just told
me that you have Alexa and yeah because
I've got one echo I've got two dots and
I've got a google
when I to stop myself from buying a
second second google oh man I don't know
what did you want to ask questions like
if you want to go some work better for
something who's the guy in that movie
directed by Tarantino and at least
Google will give you something with
celexa going sorry I don't know the
answer to that which I still think is
weird it should be something built in
and Alexis really or echoes really old
the two years old now right so like it
should be able to do some of this room
comes to lighting and things Google's
not so bad and Amazon's got some decent
things like 4,000 skills but I don't
order domino's pizza you know through I
haven't done that yet I haven't done
that yet I have ordered like one or two
things using the echo it's a little
frustrating like order more garbage bags
and sometimes she gets a right sometimes
she gets it wrong okay she's still
learning from eggs and a bicycle shows
up yeah one thing to close out on let's
wrap let's wrap it up here mr. Rivera
and Dominic want to know what the impact
of directv now will have on PS view if
think it's going to leech some users off
of that how it stacks up function wise
okay so PlayStation view the cheapest
package is forty dollars a month for
more than 45 channels okay so at the
moment at least they're offering directv
is offering more channels for less money
could could that cause more people to
like jump over to directv now it's hard
for me to say because all these services
are so new that like everybody's still
just getting a feel for them so it would
be hard for me to believe that like too
many people would all of a sudden jump
ship and switch over I could see that
happening because the PlayStation view
used to have via comm channels like
comedy central and that's gone now yeah
and those are actually on dish on direct
on DirecTV now excuse me so you're gonna
get some of the Viacom channels that you
can't get on view because I don't know
what happened with that deal but
something went bad with Sony so now you
have if you want these networks you have
to pick one or the other right which is
actually you know that's a big
differentiator that you actually have
that exclusive content would you have
content that you can't get somewhere
else right so I think that could get
some turnover I would think that if
anything the network is going to make
way more money because there's enough
competitors out there going yeah there
are there's a market they're willing to
pay fifty sixty dollars a month and
they're actually handling these bundles
because we all want it all a cart like I
want like these 12 channels I'll pay you
like 50 bucks just at 12 channels but I
want these 12 don't put it in this
package in this package but that's not
gonna happen for another like I'd say
five years I don't know that that would
ever happen we are at the edges of a
cord cutting Renaissance I think is
gonna happen they want you to keep
buying those Milky Way's they want they
want to bundle all the other crappy
stuff with your snickers bar that's
that's what I think I think there's a
chance no gateways are better than
Snickers okay all right what what did
you say that tumor death thanks
everybody it's time to go okay uh 359
