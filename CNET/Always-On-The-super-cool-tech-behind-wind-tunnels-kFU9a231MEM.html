foot in diameter vertical wind tunnel
that's designed for human indoor
skydiving perfect although they don't
really call it that what do you call it
was like the official term tunnel flying
tenafly yeah come on inside alright
obviously it on the bench here and in I
wince I'm gonna save you some
embarrassment don't fly like this
now obviously wind tunnels are great at
sending humans up into the air but
they're also used to test the
aerodynamics of all sorts of things from
bicycles to semi trucks to race cars at
Aerodyne in North Carolina they're using
wind tunnels to research the performance
of NASCAR racecars they also test
lotuses even lightweight transportation
like bicycles and if you want to see the
largest wind tunnel in the world check
out NASA Ames Research they recently
studied the aerodynamics of semi trucks
to figure out how they can be more
fuel-efficient ifly took me deep inside
the belly of their time
part of the day so we're down here in
like the belly of the beast right
underneath where we were just flying a
lot of people are really surprised that
there's no fan down here our fans are
actually up top for 250 horsepower fans
and they actually push the air out to
the sides of the building the air then
hits turning vanes just like these they
turn their win 90 degrees and then they
hit these turning vanes and they shoot
back up the air is concentrated into one
narrow area and then it can reach speeds
of up to 180 miles per hour I 20 mile
per hour range but that didn't stop me
from being totally awesome
that was ridiculous that was like the
funnest thing ever ever done do people
get totally hooked on it oh yeah it's
totally addicting how did I do you did
amazing you actually did really really
well really I'm not just saying still I
didn't come even close to what the eyes
like we can do their hope is that tunnel
flying will one day be an X game you
guys get an X Games team like can I be
honest of course honorary member ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
