64 my myspace name was dr. Peter Venkman
it was gnarly Arielle my myspace
username was the camouflage chameleon I
first account was my personal one it was
Dan Ackerman and why see because someone
else got there first then got regular
Dan Ackerman and I was like friends with
all of these like older like Kooks and
stuff that I worked with and they would
all be like what's up chameleon and then
later they moved to a much more music
oriented platform so I made a second
account Dan Ackerman music right
uploaded all kinds of music from
different albums and stuff I worked on
my myspace username I don't even want to
tell you
[Laughter]
the topic moves my space was so
important and it felt like such a big
deal to be in someone's top eight you
always tell you you had to reciprocate
the feeling right like if your best
friend put you as their number one you
had to put them at least at number three
two or one
not only is like isolating eight of your
friends or your family members like kind
of messed up but then there was like
ranking within the top eight do you
remember that one of them was a girl
that I had a crush on and I would it
would I thought it was like a subtle
message to them that hey you're on my
top eight and you know I'm interested in
the kind of things it's lame if tom is
in your topic because you know like this
person is not a serious user messed up
in my head but I like evaluated all my
friendships and like put one before the
other and it was like this thing it's
like and it was obvious and I think
that's what I think that's what everyone
did hell yeah I decorated my myspace
page it was very classy that was a big
mistake they shouldn't have let people
do that I just remember everyone had
these wild pages with blinky things and
flashing things and everything was so
seizure-inducing and I took it as a
point of pride to keep my page very
mellow
Mary very sedate designing your own page
was a really big deal if you knew how
myspace is where I actually learned HTML
like like learn what it was and what you
could do with it I would go on to
different peoples myspace steal their
codes and then you could put that into
your page and then kind of modify it
alright I would go on google and look
for you know MySpace theme codes and you
can go in like copy and paste these
certain codes you had to like drill down
into the HTML and you could like code
your own page up it was the first time I
remember ever looking at the internet
and being like oh everything on the
Internet is just a big word puzzle I can
figure this out it made me realize like
oh wow this is actually so much easier
to put stuff together
and maybe I don't remember like a lot of
what the hell you did on my series it
was way more like lurking I feel like I
think I'm mostly posted some photos and
looked at some of my friends photos a
very early version of photo sharing
obviously music stuff became a big part
of it that was the main thing we weren't
really posting links back then so much
as simply making an outpost for other
people to come and see Oh a lot of my
friends followed bands but someone that
I like particularly remember was Tila
Tequila because she was ving amis
American and she was a car model then
and like a lot of my guy friends had her
on their top eight which is like kind of
cringy on their part and then I was just
like who is she I was like super
infatuated with her but now she's the
neo-nazi and a white supremacist so we
don't talk about to India so much just
like the Internet today you know you
didn't have push notifications or
anything and people could just post
whatever they wanted to so like I
remember I had some friends that were
like really accrued and would like wow
overnight they would post them like
obscene image or something on my profile
and I'd have to like check in the
morning to go like delete it because it
was like so gross where you put your own
music on this
oh that's cool I didn't know that was it
good music I mean probably not you know
all that matters I moved from Chicago
when I was a little boy and I had an
extended family that I left and many
years later they were trying to look for
me on their end and back then you know
Matt myspace was the only social
platform that you can actually go
through and find people right and my
name is John Kim so I'm sure that was a
billion John Kim's in the world
and somehow they were able to look for
me on MySpace and connect with me this
whole reunion happened after through
myspace so just remember like even in
2004 whenever it was what I was like at
the most I was ever into it I just
constantly remember being like this site
feels unfinished and I just remember
thinking like this is very ugly even for
2004 on the Internet I just remember
that so yeah that's all I know about
MySpace I'm glad it's over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
