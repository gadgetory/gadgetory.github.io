guest today is a very delightful lady
she has played wonder woman in the
rainfall films short film she is a
member of Team Unicorn she also has a
science show that she created she's
gonna tell us all about rightly a
Vanderbilt thanks for being here thank
you guys having yeah I'm so glad that
you decided to swing bar studio oh I've
been trying for ya well yes I have like
12 different jobs okay it's hard to get
out of the dough at the office I don't
really have an office I mean I go places
and do things you're the office is
always with you yeah I'm in my heart
it's been in your heart right yeah my
office it's rise so let's talk about
let's just get this right out of the
gate let's talk about comic-con HQ
because this is a really big deal and
our executive producing have created a
science show that is going to be on
compound HQ yeah it's a so comic-con
international decided to team up with
Lionsgate and create kind of a
subscription-based video on demand you
know channel and that's kind of the way
that all our entertainment is going
these days so they're kind of jumping on
that bandwagon but hopefully doing it
before a lot of people do it and better
but we're really excited all the all the
content is really curated for the
comic-con crowd and it's really exciting
for me because as a lover of science
they they were super enthusiastic about
that the idea that I had and they're
like let's make a show and so I'm making
a show you tell so the idea is so I I
love science and everybody loves science
I mean you should love science you're
watching this show you I have show so I
mean it's it because there's science
base and everything I mean this is the
way when we're kids you know we want to
discover things we want to find out
about things how things work and I've
always loved that but I noticed over the
last couple years that there has been
kind of avoid when it comes to current
scientific news like we have a news show
for sports politics
entertainment but we have nothing
actually discussing current scientific
discoveries and anything in STEM fields
and some fields is science technology
engineering and math right so so for me
I was like well this kind of seems weird
why we don't have a saying yet science
is all around us is what makes the world
work and it's very interesting it's
always like why don't we do a science
show that is based off of current
science discoveries and stuff that
people don't necessarily know is
happening and kind of put that in the
spotlight of it yeah we love cleaning
sort of the cutting edge of science
where you know what we're discovering
now and what it means like giving
context of like and making it very it
seems like you guys really want to make
this content um not not unlike what we
do here on to our daily like very edible
for people absolutely very
understandable like and have fun while
you're doing it like there's some great
science shows out there you know you
have how the universe works or like
through the wormhole which I love that
show yeah but it that show is on a level
that even sometimes I can't understand
some of the concepts that they have I'm
just like I and with stem there's some
really big concepts like science can be
an extremely overwhelming thing it can
be I mean there's a lot that's involved
in it so we we definitely want to kind
of make science cool which it already is
cool but I don't want to bring that up
and yeah and get people really
interested in science again that's kind
of what better way to do that then with
somebody who's played a wonder woman
that's a lot bad experience oh well that
experience was kind of the best my mom
will tell you since I was a little girl
wonder woman was always my favorite and
I kept saying one day I'll be wonder
woman so to actually have it happen even
though it was a couple years ago now it
was pretty it was pretty surreal I guess
I saw you mention online that someone
actually commented about it a few days
ago they were like oh I thought I
thought that one a couple years ago with
yeah I was better that was really funny
well with the new movie coming out
Batman and Superman there's a Wonder
Woman cameo with gal Godot
and yeah I was overhearing a two nerds
talking about the movie and talking
about wonder woman and how cool it was
and then they were like well that's
pretty good but there's a thing online a
couple years ago and I was like oh my
gosh is he so crazy cuz when you have to
go it was me you know I was thinking
about that story yeah but then I was
like you know this is like a secret
identity moment true yeah so I was like
so now you have the full Wonder Woman
experience yeah not just one of you also
got the the Mystics right yeah yeah
Diana Prince experience where you can
hear what people's thoughts on you girl
odd it was a little weird I that's never
happened to me before but it was with so
much fun doing that and just how
motivated I was to work out because when
I heard I got it I was just like a
winner issued in this and they're like
12 weeks it's like oh so I have like 10
11 weeks to actually get into shape cut
to the montage yeah and that's exactly
what happened I rocky montage me today
stairs yeah I did I actually did a
fitness blog during that time so it keep
me accountable but I was working out I
think it's working out like six days a
week doing cardio five of those days and
then just weight training and then just
eating like right food getting rid of
sugar and salt and drinking tons of
water and so you went through a little
bit of what the the actors in these new
superhero movies do because I really
sacrifice their bodies for these films
the new superhero diet I gotta do is
step one get cast as a superhero yep
step 2 oh yeah just do whatever I feel
like they have it at heart like
obviously they're going through the work
but they also the time a team they have
a nutritionist and they have you know
how many you know workout buddies and
also a lot of pressure and millions of
dollars writing on them would you
terrify me into eating whatever someone
told me to eat like I just feel like I
will just help just give it to me just
like I don't wanna mess this up that's
me I mean as long as you send it to me
and it's there and I just put it in the
microwave or that good I'll just eat
whatever you put I don't know man i was
reading about Hugh Jackman's routine for
Wolverine and like he has to eat every
two hours yes yeah they wake him up to
eat yeah
Chris Rock see like there was a boy on
reddit who did what about diet and he he
went through later on no it but he lost
a little weight and he did a really good
job and the rock actually acknowledged
him on social media was like great job
guy like good yeah I actually on my
phone and it's still set there even
though I haven't like actually done it
but I have six meals a day plus three
snacks so and my phone will deang when
I'm supposed to eat so like 7am first
meal 9am second meal 1105 third meal I
do that but it's all like donuts I know
it's good content of the meals is the
problem for other than the exercising
part do we have to work off all those I
don't see why that's enough celery do
anything if one of the other things that
you do that I think is really cool we
were talking about fashion earlier but
Team Unicorn you guys do a bunch of
different stuff yeah uh you guys had a
music video you had all about that bass
we had a couple music videos actually we
started Team Unicorn started as a parody
geek girl band like the Spice Girls and
we just thought we were gonna do we did
a geek and gamer girls like katy perry's
california gurls and we thought it would
just be a one-off you know whatever just
having fun and then it actually up yeah
it turned into something this was back
in the day where I mean this is six
years ago so the geek girl thing I mean
even though it should have been a thing
it was a thing still so people really
responded to it and yeah it just we were
just like well I guess we have something
special we should continue to go on with
it so we've done three music videos and
then some like straight-up parodies of
other things too so but then you guys
are also moving in a stuff like clothing
design yeah give some really uh for
those of you who have not who are not
following Riley on Instagram first of
all go do that and secondly um you guys
posted a picture of these really rad
throwback retro looking Star Trek
bathing suits that were probably my
favorite thing ever the wholly yours Oh
make sure you get one I just don't have
the red one cuz you'll like no I don't
want to read i don't wanna rap soon
I don't want to be a red suit I don't
want Aaron soon no I mean I can get that
to my sis I get it um yes so again I
think we're really good at seeing where
there's whole
Olson's in pop culture like what needs
to be filled in and we noticed that as
far as like geek girl fashion is
concerned a lot of that is getting
filled now but the one thing that we
were looking at was you know swimwear
and how no one really makes like nerdy
swimwear and if you do find it it's like
the twenty-dollar super cheap stuff you
weren't two times and then falls it
falls apart sure sure you find us very
fast yeah yeah oh just looking for the
right bikini broiler finally we're
having this conversation I know I mean
it's a really seems like a really
important conversation what were you
gonna do I think you were gonna ask why
we were talking earlier this episode
before you got here about 3d printed
fashion which is sort of becoming a
thing there's this rose petal dress that
sort of hit the internet I don't know if
you saw anything about it but what do
you think about the idea of 3d printing
to your exact specifications and making
the exact dress that you want I love
that yeah I kind of scratches both those
itches right of the geeky thing of like
fooling around to make it just right
right I mean I think there's a lot of
movies a lot of costume designers on
movies that I've been doing that I think
even since like Tron my sure our movie
where you know they digitally capture
the actors body to me to create around
that so it's basically just perfect
measurements but yeah I think that's
kind of the way things are going to go
especially when 3d printers get cheaper
and cheaper and cheaper which they have
been I think you'll see a lot more 3d
printed fashion so so in terms of aside
from 3d printing in fashion mmm because
you're doing a science show I have to
ask like what to you is the most
exciting thing about in science right
now like to you what the thing that
really grabs you as a person well
personally I've always been drawn to
anything space related since I was a
little girl if I wasn't going to go into
acting I think I probably would have
gone into astronomy or something to do
with that so there's there's a lot of
amazing concepts in like Astro physics
and one of the biggest things that has
happened lately is they have they have
figured out
how it's a calls oh they have proven um
gravitational waves yeah you know like
Oh team member come on oh did you oh
that's crazy yeah it's a great example
of what we were talking about if
something that's kind of hard to wrap
your head around and it's great to have
away a show like what you're talking
about kind of break it down and
understand why that's a big deal because
it's like who cares what's happening out
you know so far away right and then it's
also so infinitesimally when it finally
reaches us it's so hard to understand
what is that need ramifications yeah and
that was like one of the examples we
were using as we were talking about the
show and stuff and be like well if the
show was happening now this is something
that we would talk about currently as it
was happening and try to explain in a
way that the normal you and me type of
people would be able to understand so
through demonstrations or whatever yeah
yeah it's like a like a modern sort of
mr. wizard that's why i used to love
that show you guys I'm not even old
enough to remember obviously she does
she does we watch this I'm old it's my
birthday today I just went 11 year older
my hardware eyes upgrading your
downloading all hardware is upgrading
okay so let's talk about let's wrap this
up and then we'll well but where is so
people are gonna be able to go to
comic-con international to see to check
out HQ what is this launching so the
beta launches and May first man that's
really confident you say oh no no I just
have I think I was like when did they
want my show ready by May seventh I
think they're going to do a soft launch
on May seventh right now the beta is
free okay it can try it before you buy
it it's a it's gonna be free for two
months maybe three months I might some
be missed I think it's enough time to
figure out if you like it really like it
yeah and especially I mean it'll be free
during comic-con yeah and that's a big
thing because a lot of people you know
there's so many people that go to
comic-con but there's a lot of people
that can't go sure and it's really hard
to get into the panel's you want to see
even if you go it's like H even if you
Hall H seats six thousand people you
have never gonna convert it's 6,000
people it's like a small stadium and
people still don't get it
na lage anything at this point yeah I
need have to pick and choose what you
can't see everything because you have to
stand in line what panel you want to sit
in one panel edition yeah like that's
pretty much what you're gonna get into
yeah it's uh it's really really
frustrating for a lot of people and what
this channel is going to allow for is
that you are going to kind of get a
front seat to all that stuff so they're
going to be used like live streaming all
the hall h panels they'll be behind the
scene I fatally yes gonna yeah it's
gonna be like you know you can set all
home and watch gonna be a comic con yeah
and maybe not be part of the hundred and
eighty thousand people that are the
heart of san diego comic-con you just
yeah you can just a conspiracy response
Mel sometimes your senses are better
yeah so do you know the name of your
show yet um haha working on names right
now actually I've got like eight of them
out there but marketing is trying to
figure out which one's the best all
right I gonna lock down all those social
media accounts 100 your name will know
your name okay yeah yes where can
everybody follow you so that when it
gets announced they can then go follow
the name of the show all right now on
twitter you can follow me at my first
