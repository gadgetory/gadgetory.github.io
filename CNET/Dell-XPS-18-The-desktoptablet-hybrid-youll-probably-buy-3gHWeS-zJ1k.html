a look at the Dell XPS 18 at first
glance this looks like a computer on
kind of the smaller side of the
all-in-one spectrum it's got an 18 inch
screen but then you grab it here you
lift up and look at that this is
actually got a battery in it which means
it's a really large tablet or a smaller
to mid-size all-in-one depending on how
you look at it we've actually seen a
couple of these systems before sony has
the VAIO cap 20 with a 20 inch screen a
soos has a transformer all-in-one also
with an 18 inch screen of that first
kind of grouping of these this is
definitely the best to date because the
Sony Tablet even though it's only a
little bit bigger weighs like 12 pounds
this thing is under five pounds whereas
the assist version when you remove it
from its dock it switches over into
Android mode it's very confusing don't
even get me started about that now for
$1,300 that's kind of a lot to pay for
an 18 inch own one especially one with
laptop parts and integrated graphics you
do get this big weighted stand right
here that acts as a power charging dock
as well and they throw in a keyboard and
mouse you can trade down to less
expensive versions that skip the dock
you can buy it separately and that have
like a core i3 CPU as opposed to an i5
or even an intel pentium class cpu which
I would really avoid at all costs now
you aren't paying a premium to be one of
the first people on the block with a
combination tablet / all-in-one there's
a few reasons why you'd want to do that
you can just pick this up and take it
into another room of your house to show
someone the video or share some photos
that do some tabletop gaming which is
actually kind of fun
I really wouldn't take this out so the
coffee shop or anything it's too big and
the battery lasts about four hours not
really enough for carrying with you
style computing just like almost every
laptop now has a touchscreen whereas
last year it didn't I think we might be
looking at a possible future where
pretty much every on one becomes a
detachable screen with a battery built
into it now it hasn't happened yet but
once Intel's next generation of chips
comes out and if people start buying
these as opposed to traditional
all-in-ones I think you're gonna see a
continued hybridization of big screen
tablet and all-in-one and frankly
around with a big gigantic tablet is
actually kind of fun I'm Dan Akron and
that is the Dell XPS 18</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
