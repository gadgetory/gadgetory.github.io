interview of the day on something
relatively low-tech but very close to my
heart a pinball machine and none better
to represent it than Gary Stern the
founder Grand Poobah
chief president everything of stern
pinball Gary thank you for coming here
thank you for having me please now tell
me about this pinball machine this is
actually a pretty special pinball
machine this is one of the first of this
type of pinball machine that are coming
from certain pinball
we're manufacturers of commercial
pinball machines and we we'd make three
or four different models a year we make
them in different levels of complexity
and we export half of them we ship them
all over the world for people to play in
arcades for enthusiasts to have in their
home for just people to have in their
home in a rec room we found that there
are a lot of people who wanted games in
the rec room and we decided that we
should make a real pinball machine but
at a lower price point this pinball
machine this we call this the pin it's
our entry-level game it is designed from
the ground up to be a non coin op game
but with the same play in the same parts
as a coin op games it so the foot prints
a little smaller
it weighs 125 pounds instead of 250
pounds you can move it around in the
house and yet it is a full-size play
field with the full play futures of our
commercial games it has our same
flippers or same pop bumpers our same
slingshots drop targets just like a
regular commercial games and it's most
important it's fun I think for me also
most important is it's almost attainable
for me as I've been talking about and
writing about a lot of your pinball
releases over the past year you've
gotten some high-profile ones like The
Avengers a lot of Marvel tie-ins ac/dc a
big fan of the ac/dc pinball machine but
it is priced if I wanted to go out and
buy that machine it's gonna be over
$5,000 for me to bring that into my home
it's also gonna be a long explanation
for my wife this machine it's gonna
retails I believe for close to $2,500
yes it's a suggested retail of $24.99
but that was the purpose here was to get
something a little bit more
paintable to enlarge the pinball
community very important to us that we
do have more people playing pinball we
are an American manufacturer very proud
of that we make these games in
Chicagoland area I've been in at 65
years I'm 67 so it's very important that
pinball continues to flourish and grow I
I know that there has also been a lot of
interest in pinball growing because of
apps I've seen like the all the
different iPad apps for pinball that are
out there you can play a virtual pinball
on your your iPhone has that been
something that's helped maybe bring a
resurgence of interest to the to the
pinball world I think it has helped
bring the resurgence and there has been
at resurgence in fact our commercial
sales in 2012 were 30% higher than they
were in 2011 and all over the world is
the research I believe that the the
different apps have are helpful we
actually participate and licensed some
of our titles to Farsight which is a
company that does an apps and it for
smartphones and for for consoles one of
the games they built for us
rollercoaster tycoon it has been very
successful as an app but the use value
of the game has increased of the real
game has increased and all of these
games have a value they've a lot of them
almost all of them appreciate over time
as you own them so it's it's not like
buying not like buying a television
where there's a brand new one a year
later the doubt dates it they do
increase in value all right now I'm
getting some direction from our stage
director here she she says we've been
talking about this pinball machine a lot
but we have not been playing it at all
so would you would you do me the honor
of playing that your own pinball machine
I'd love to unfortunately we don't have
any beer here to play for you have the
request for this pinball machine is beer
holders on the sides of it I think it's
really gonna have a place in a man cave
it needs to have like a kegerator
version there are accessories that you
can buy pinball this girl to the side of
them I for you when you buy your game
I'll make sure that you you know you get
a case of beer and some nuts some cup
holders for it thank you red cups will
match this perfect yeah I think you're
right yeah
and no coins needed
so I'm looking at this I realize this is
definitely not a toy version of your
real games this is the real game it's a
slightly different play field than I
know that the full-size transformers
that you've you've done it's a real
would play field just like the
commercial games have a little different
composition of wood but it's a real wood
play field and it plays it plays great
you're killing a carry this is great
you're setting the bar too high though
you're gonna get a high score on your
own game which i think is only right all
right Oh Gary don't worry there's no
shame in this you've you can play all
the pinball you want right you've got
pinball Oliver you're coming back into
the business part of the job at our
company is you must play during part of
the design process everybody has to play
for 15 minutes
I hope our manager hears that so thank
you Gary for that and thank you for
joining us here we're gonna wrap things
up oh no I'm sorry I can't we can't do
two-player or after the cameras played
out yes absolutely you got it thank you
