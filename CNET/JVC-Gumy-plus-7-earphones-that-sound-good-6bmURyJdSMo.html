cnet.com and I'm going to give you a
quick tour of another dirt-cheap in your
headphone the JBC gummy plus which can
be had online for around seven dollars
this model comes in a variety of colors
and while there's nothing fancy about
it's all plastic construction it's an
attractive looking earphone it's also
lightweight and comfortable like the
top-selling Panasonic Peugeot Fit rph GE
1:20 there's sort of a hybrid earphone
part hard earbud like your basic Apple
earbud and part soft bud they come with
three different size silicone ear tips
at this price you're more apt to see a
hard buddy your phone but being able to
jam the soft tips in your ears helps
with sound isolation and maximizes it
the bass output I was able to get a
tight seal with the largest of the year
tips and they stayed in my ear as well
as you might expect from a seven dollar
headphone there's nothing in the way of
extras no inline and remote / microphone
for making cell phone calls or any sort
of carrying case overall the gummy plus
is a pleasant sounding earphone for the
money and an excellent bargain the bass
isn't huge but it's relatively tight the
treble isn't quite as smooth there's a
touch of harshness but that's a minor
quibble the sound compares favorably to
many earphones in the twenty five to
thirty five dollar range though these
guys didn't offer as details sound as
the $50 Clips s3m I put them up against
comparing this to other dirt cheap
headphones I'd say the Panasonic hje 120
sounds a touch better but the one
drawback of that model is that it's
thinner cord has a tendency to get
tangled while this one doesn't and if
you're a bass lover you might be more
satisfied with I love citylights
earphones however it's hard to go wrong
with any of these models at such a low
price point I'm David Carr noise and
that's the dirt cheap gummy plus in your
headphone thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
