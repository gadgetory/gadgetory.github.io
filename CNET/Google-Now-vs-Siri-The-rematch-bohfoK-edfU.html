and changes to android Siri and Google
now have grown up a little bit so it's
time to put them head-to-head in a live
battle we'll keep an eye out for speed
usefulness and accuracy first I'll ask
these guys questions I know they can
handle it's not if they can complete the
tasks but how they do it we'll go from
easy to difficult ready what's the
weather like in San Francisco so they
can both answer that question no problem
although Siri things it's a little bit
colder than Google nodos what time is it
in New York
they're both pretty quick where's the
nearest gas station aha so we already
have our Google Maps serious still
thinking and we have 15 results I do
like how there's a map interface here on
Google now call Chris Parker Google now
will automatically start calling and
because I have two phone numbers for
that contact in my iPhone I have to
choose it first let's turn up the
difficulty a little bit new appointment
at 12:00 p.m. tomorrow lunch with Chris
Parker
Google now is pretty fast I can select
Chris Parker's email and he'll receive
an invitation pretty me here's the
feature I really love new note
rememberthemilk
so on Google now I hit save note and I
have a couple options I can save it to
Gmail or to Google keep in this case
I'll go with Google keep and then of
course on Siri the note gets saved to
your Notes app these virtual assistants
also let you access content on your
device so play rolling in the deep' they
both start playing that song here's one
that's new to Siri open Chrome really
useful both of these virtual assistants
let you launch apps convenient for when
you're driving let's see how they handle
email email Chris Parker would you like
to go to the Warriors game tonight once
you ask that question the processes here
are a little bit different but the point
is they both got it
the email will go to Chris here's a
handy feature remind me to check the
mail in three hours so here on Android
those reminders get saved to the Google
now interface whereas with Siri the
reminders get saved to the reminders app
either way you should receive a push
notification reminding you here's what I
use all the time navigate me to
Chronicle Books in San Francisco so
we'll choose the right ones from the
list of course on Android Google Maps
launches whereas on iOS it launches
Apple maps now if you normally use
Google Maps there isn't a way to change
that default setting
so those aren't all the questions that
these virtual assistants can handle
but now we have a taste of what they can
answer and how well they answer it now
let's take a look at the things that
only Siri can do for example enable
bluetooth you can enable any top-level
settings using Siri again really
convenient for when you're in the car do
I have any emails from Chris Parker so
you can find out if your buzz has sent
you any emails Twitter integration is
also new with Siri what's CBS News
saying this is great because you get a
list of the most recent tweets of course
you'll need to be logged into Twitter in
order to use this feature but once
you're there you can get tweets from
just about anyone you're following you
can also interact with your social
networks
post a Facebook today is a beautiful day
again you'll have to be connected to
your Facebook account and you can't
control the privacy settings from Siri
but if you need to post a quick message
you can do it right here make a
reservation at zerozero pizzeria in San
Francisco so I'll choose the right
restaurant from here I can choose the
time I want and make the reservation
using open table so Siri is great
because it can really handle all of
those productivity questions but now
let's take a look at the things that
only Google Voice Actions can do for
example I'll play some music then ask
Google what's this song
and just like Shazam it'll show me which
song is playing now you know that both
virtual assistants can give you
directions but check out what only
Google now can do give me walking
directions to Chronicle Books in San
Francisco select the store and I'll get
directions on foot or how about this
YouTube cute panda sneeze I get YouTube
search results pick one and just like
that YouTube launches and finally United
four six five so I get my flight status
in the form of this card plus the next
time I launch Google now it'll show up
right here in many ways Siri still has a
leg up on productivity but if you
compare it to the entire package that
Google now offers Google now is much
more convenient so you can't get Siri on
Android but if you want to give Google
now a try you can get it through the
Google Search app on iOS
of course these virtual assistants are
always being updated so expect some of
the results to change and when they do
we'll bring them back for another
comparison for cnet.com I'm Sharon
