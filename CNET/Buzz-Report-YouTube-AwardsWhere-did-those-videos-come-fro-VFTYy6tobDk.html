Mollywood and welcome to the buzz
reports first our gadget of the week
it's Apple TV the new box that plays
stuff from itunes on your television
maybe you see first there's not much to
watch maybe 300 titles on the iTunes
Store secondly it doesn't work with the
majority of TVs in the world your
television has to be at least 480p
resolution widescreen and have component
or hdmi input that rules out two of the
three TVs in my house finally what you
watch might look pretty bad you see the
current iTunes video selections were
customized for the video iPod now how's
that going to look on a 52 incher but
apple TV is unfairly being judged as a
device that needs to be born fully
developed like an infant with a master's
degree in a full head of hair hell Steve
Jobs doesn't even have either of those
now the news youtube announced its first
ever video awards as voted on by users
there were seven categories and the
winners were all great I mean check out
the brilliance of the most creative
award winner Chicago band okay go
for the really touching animation winner
kiwi and after a few minutes you'll be
saying to yourself what does this have
to do with you two I don't know where
they dug up these gems but 99% of
youtube's content isn't like this and
never had a chance for an award because
there'd be no category for it for
example where was the category best
transcoding of ripped off Viacom content
or stupidest ass ruining his car while
ghost riding it yeah we wish YouTube
stuff was like what 11 serious piece of
car tech got smashed up online this week
actor eddie griffin was practicing for a
charity car race in his movie producers
ferrari enzo all one and a quarter
million dollars of it when he locked it
up and plowed the front end into a
concrete k rail ouch now those nutty
conspiracy theorists got going almost
immediately first they say notice the
car wasn't going all that fast and has
arguably the best brakes of any car in
the world even touching the brake pedal
10 feet from that barrier and that Enzo
would have stopped like someone drove a
nail through it also check out the guy
videotaping behind the barrier he
doesn't flinch jump or even make water
as far as we can tell almost like he was
ready for it so let's do the math at
last count around 400 news outlets are
reporting this story and the fact that
it was related to a new movie called
redline starring eddie griffin and that
the Enzo's owner is his producer
advertising value of all this buzz
including us at least 10 million dollars
cost to fix the Enzo let's be generous
and say 250,000 those numbers work and
finally we leave you with this bizarre
story from ctia the big cell phone show
that just wrapped up in orlando florida
where we saw shoes with lights that's
right I said it's a cell phone show and
no I have no idea why shoes were being
featured but with these kinds of
attributes who could say no the ball of
the foot touches on the solar plexus
point
center of emotional energy the shoes
offer an emotional bath of light
experience so the act of walking it's
healing look I laugh the idea of selling
ringtones a few years ago so I'm just
gonna shut up but healing I'm Brian
Cooley this has been the buzz report
