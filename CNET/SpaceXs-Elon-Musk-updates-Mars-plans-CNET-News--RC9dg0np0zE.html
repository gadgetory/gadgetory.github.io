exciting and interesting if we're a
spacefaring civilization and a
multi-planet species than if we're or
not you want to be inspired by things
you want to wake up in the morning you
think the future is gonna be great and
that's what what bring a space for
exhalation is all about and I can't
think of anything more exciting than
going out there and bring among the
stars
I think we've figured out how to pay for
it this is very important next key
element is propulsive landing in order
to land on on face like the moon where
there is no atmosphere or to land on
Mars you really have to get propel
propulsive landing perfect we do not
need legs for the next version we are
now beginning serious development of VFR
we expect to have a payload capability
of 150 tons to low Earth orbit main body
diameter is that is about 9 meters or 30
feet let's look at the launch cost do
the order the order reverses the size of
of this being a 90 meter diameter
vehicle it is a huge enabler for new
satellites it's also intended to be able
to service the space station that would
enable the creation of moon base alpha
hope or some sort of a lunar base
it's just 2017 I mean we should have a
lunar base by now what the hell's going
on
why why are using combustion and rockets
and you have electric cars like well it
isn't some way to make an electric
rocket I wish there was I feel fairly
confident that we can complete the ship
and be ready for a launch in about five
years
then in 2024 we want to try to fly for
ships and yeah and over time
terraforming was and making it really a
nice place to be
but this there's something else if you
build a ship that's capable of going to
Mars well what if you take that same
ship and go from one place to another on
earth the great thing about going to
space is there's no friction so once
you're out of the atmosphere it will
smooth the silk no turbulence nothing
there's no weather so there's an obscure
now you can get to most long-distance
places like seven less than half an hour</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
