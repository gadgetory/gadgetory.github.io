that's unlike anything you've seen
before I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update next year there will be
more ways to play top video games on
your television new gaming consoles
called steam machines will be hitting
the market which would let users play PC
games on a living room TV steam machines
will be made by different companies but
running them all is an operating system
from valve which already sells PC video
games through a platform called steam
valve is currently testing prototypes of
the steam machines valve is also
creating its own wireless video game
controller called the steam controller
and instead of thumb sticks it has to
touch track pads they're designed to
replace a mouse and these track pads are
clickable it'll also provide advanced
vibration feedback for different details
and events during a game and it can
function as a speaker the center has a
high resolution display that can show
secondary screen information from the
game such as a map or different menus
the screen is also clickable samsung's
new extra-large phone the Galaxy Note 3
along with the galaxy gear smartwatch
are both hitting us stores this week at
the cost of three hundred dollars apiece
t-mobile says it's launching the devices
on Wednesday an ATT sprint and
RadioShack will have the devices in
store on Friday with verizon shipping
them out next week you may start to see
different advertisements pop up on your
Facebook feed in the coming weeks the
social network says it's using new
calculations to show more relevant ads
in the news feed and when you mark an ad
is something you don't want to see
facebook says it's listening and will
adjust accordingly and speaking of as
Android users may soon see ads within
their Gmail app the blog Android police
looked into the latest gmail app for
Android and found lines of code that
refer to advertisements and lit users
save ads within the inbox maybe that's
useful if the ads or coupons there are
no ads right now showing in the android
gmail app but it's a sign of what's
possible currently the desktop is the
only place to find gmail ads and AOL
launched a brand new service called
gather
which bundles several different digital
subscriptions credits and discounts into
one monthly subscription a gather bundle
can come in different combinations but
as one example a member could pay twenty
dollars a month for several things that
add up to $55 like redbox DVD rentals a
pandora one subscription restaurant gift
certificates and an amazon gift card
there are many different combos of
products that can be lumped together at
a discount that's your tech news update
