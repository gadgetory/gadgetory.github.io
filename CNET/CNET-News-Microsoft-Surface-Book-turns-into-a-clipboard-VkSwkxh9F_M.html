ever created it weighs only one point
six pounds it's that thirteen and a half
inch screen we talked about it is seven
point seven millimeters thin don't worry
your USB ports there in the base
it's that same three by two aspect ratio
you're familiar with it is modeled in
metaphor after an a4 piece of paper to
give you that natural feel it's a
clipboard look at it what did the
surface team do how did the engineering
team pull it off I'm going to show you
the hinge this here is what's known as a
dynamic fulcrum it's what we call it
internally it's total dork talk but hold
on we did it purposefully we want it to
be able to give you all that power in
the top of the device all that battery
all the energy you need to make it a
full clipboard experience if you're the
architect you get a walk around with it
if you're on a jobsite you walk around
with it if you're my friend who's an NFL
quarterback or a friend who's a coach or
a friend who's this and you're using it
and writing you get to use it as a
clipboard but when you plug it in you
need to be able to extend this base to
be able to give the perfect balance for
lap ability in the product watch how the
basic set it stands itself check it out
see how long that got is that pretty
cool that's and that is the hinge
designed by my team out and ready they
are just phenomenal the work they're
able to do now how do we separate it how
do we get away from the clickety
clackety clack and levers and this and
that and what how do I get it off it's
so simple we use a technology called
muscle wire invented by Microsoft and
within the muscle wire basically you
throw you throw a charge into it it
expands and contracts elegantly and what
it does is it locks in the screen or
doesn't and so basically when you want
to remove the top it's a fool by the way
it's a full laptop you see this is the
whole point of it I'm supposed to use it
as a laptop and never think twice it is
the ultimate laptop but at any given
time if I want to I just pull it off
that's it
and now that quickly got elegantly I can
move with this device and I could just
plug it back in so simply and it locks
in it's just a laptop that's all it is
and it comes together just like that
I've shown you something here that is
the most powerful laptop on the planet
it has touch it has pen it has more
pixels than any screen in its class and
it does this just like that now this
this is the ultimate laptop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
