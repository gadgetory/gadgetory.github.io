final day in February of 2018 its
episode 362 of the 359 podcast on BB G
and your host today are outfitting and
Ben Fox
Ruben fun fact about the 359 our first
show ever was on February 29th on a leap
day two years ago we gonna play her two
Penzance so we can't have an adverse or
episode for four years if we can't have
it that's that's exactly right so
Matthew dacher thanks for joining us on
your day off we promise you this episode
will suck episode terrible I was gonna
say Lego fully that shout out would be
beneficial but you guys went in the
completely other direction so whatever
either way Matt thanks as always for
joining us today we're gonna be talking
about 5g there are a ton of
announcements around 5g and apparently
is the big thing that a lot of the
telcos are talking about at Mobile World
Congress where Rodger is right now in
Barcelona we're also going to be talking
about the Asus zenfone 5 + 5 Z it's
basically an apple copycat at a much
lower price point and last Amazon's
big acquisition of a ring which is a
video doorbell company and will round
out the show with that as always send in
your questions and comments BBG we'll
get to as many as he can at the end of
the show let's get to the podcast here
we go 3 2 1 welcome to the 359 I'm Ben
Fox Ruben I'm alfred hang the 5 g race
is on a Mobile World Congress sprint
said it's rolling out the next
generation of wireless tech for six US
cities this year and promised a
nationwide mobile 5g network next year
meanwhile t-mobile said it's bringing
mobile 5g to 30 US cities both carriers
won't actually let customers buy the
services until next year when the first
5g capable smartphones hit the market
are you excited no because my phone
can't even handle it and I'm gonna have
to have like the latest phone to do it
which I'm not gonna have unless it drops
to like cheap enough that like I'm
probably not like everyone else will get
5g and like with the latest phones
probably in like the next
I don't know like two years or something
that way for me I feel like it's like a
five-year gap for me unless like because
that's how long it would probably take
me to get to a phone that's like capable
of using it I it will I think entirely
depend on you know the the first adopter
is what they're actually gonna tell
their friends and family whether it is
gonna be significantly different or
significantly better so the move that I
did years ago from 3G to 4G was a
significant and notable one if 5g is
much better and the marketing actually
holds up I think that it would propel a
lot of people yeah that I knew that's
the thing like 5 G's supposed to blow
like LTE out of the water on this one
like it's it's not like a small leap
from like 3G to LT you important we've
been hearing for years I got massively
this is like supposed to be someone that
can like power like your home like
Wireless yeah like as a replacement to
broadband the idea is is that 5g is also
going to help enable drones self-driving
cars all sorts of other technology that
need like really really fast speeds but
we'll see as these deployments go out if
that is actually going to happen next if
you want to get an iPhone 10 but don't
have the money just buy an Asus zenfone
5 Z it's basically a clone of the new
iPhone complete with the notch on top
but it goes for five ninety five hundred
and ninety dollars instead of the base
model thousand dollars for the iPhone
ten you see that it's it's even got like
the camera setup on the back the same
way I mean it basically looks like an
iPhone ten I don't know yeah this is the
dopest thing I've ever seen man I love
this so much it's half the price it's
got the full screen everything it's also
cheaper than what the Galaxy s8 is and
the s9 hold on is it like you really
think it's dope or you're just cracking
jokes I've it's a little bit of both
like if if I were like trying to buy a
new phone I would definitely like
consider this it's actually a high-end
phone that's not selling it for like
$200 it's got like really good specs
yeah for expect you know if you get the
5z which is supposed to be the bigger
one like their version of like five plus
it's got like eight gigabytes of RAM
128 Oh - like 256 gigabytes of like
storage which is insane but yeah I mean
I this is this is something that like
has actually piqued my interest
I'm I'm very interested in like getting
like higher-end phones for like lower
end prices and this definitely like I'm
actually excited about something I
believe it I've literally never heard
you excited and it's terrifying last
Amazon agreed to buy smart doorbell
maker ring for reported 1 billion
dollars Amazon also purchased video
doorbell company blink in December so I
guess if you want to get a video
doorbell you have to go through Amazon
this is obviously a continuation of
Amazon trying to control the smart home
and compete with Google which has nest
so are they gonna combine them to make
bling how how they letting ling-ling and
blink yes yes yes yeah ring and blink
I think ring is gonna be a standalone
company that's at least what a lot of
folks have been saying so they're
they're gonna be able to kind of stand
on their own one interesting thing about
ring by the way is is that they were on
Shark Tank a while ago and they got
passed over now they sold for apparently
a billion dollars if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Aang
thanks for listening you know what else
I saw in the Asus phone what starts with
an H ends with an Ed phone jack oh yeah
no it's so great this is just like and
before the trolls get to us yes we are
still talking about this I have
headphones that I like they're my tooth
I'm super into the headphone jack I was
really annoyed that the pixel 2 dropped
it after the Google pixel talked it up
in like all their presentations so yeah
definitely this is this is the phone to
get not the iPhone 10 and yeah if you
don't like it obviously it doesn't have
like a camera as great as yeah it's also
not waterproofed there there are two
other things that they died by injury so
there's like a lot of things here that
I'm just like if you just want like a
big screen and a phone that has like
pretty good specs and it's cheap like
yeah if you don't want all these like
extra
things like you don't really care about
an emoji then yeah here you go
like no wireless charging no
waterproofing - so they do strip out
some of the newer things that you would
get yeah on the newest iPhone but I
would probably argue that a lot of
people wouldn't really miss wireless
charging like the wireless charging pad
stuff doesn't come with the phone so you
know my galaxy s aid I think has
wireless charging capabilities but I
don't want to spend the money to get a
wireless charging pad you just plug it
in yeah I'll save the 30 bucks yes I I'm
like I'm continuously scrolling through
this article I'm like this phone looks
pretty cool like I feel like I would
actually get it I'm like super confused
by your enthusiasm this is like I'm
enthusiastic about everything it's
literally the first time it's a high-end
phone that I don't have to pay a lot of
money for that it really is it's it's
let's say in to put it into better
context it's still $600 I mean like
that's not that's not it a little bit of
money but obviously especially with it's
like with a much less compared it is
yeah relative it is now in relative
terms I totally agree with you but $600
there's a good reason why people are
holding on to their phones longer than
two years now and in the fourth quarter
of last year for the first time ever
smartphone shipments had actually gone
down so people are definitely holding
onto their phones longer and you know
maybe 5g is gonna be the reason that
people upgrade for sure it looks like
you got a bunch of questions yeah we got
a great feedback coming in through the
chat today let's start right off with a
commentary from Matthew dacher he was
said he was thinking about buying a ring
not like a ring sorry like it and put a
ring around God I'm it makes and that
made me think about if there's anybody
out there if Amazon's acquisition of
this company would deter or further
encourage you to move forward with
getting a smart doorbell or if it you're
completely indifferent to it I just
wonder if that has an overall effect on
your concept if Amazon is the greater
evil a greater good and that's where
that's a good way of looking at it I
think with ring and blink they both
already had Alexa integrations that's
not to say that everybody flipped the
switch and started using those Alexa
integrations but if if there was already
Amazon involved
so it's possible that people would be
detracted from getting a ring because of
this but I don't really see that to be
the case for most consumers fair enough
it was just an interesting thought they
kindly are into my brain yeah it's
interesting it's an interesting eye
because of all the conversation that
people are having about are these giant
tech companies becoming way too big it's
definitely I think something that
Worth's that's worth discussing how does
affect Amazon's like smart lock doesn't
they don't make a smart lock so Amazon
key is service where they provide a
security camera and then they partner
with smart door lock makers like August
wait I think August isn't one of them
but the company that makes August is is
part of that so you can buy I think from
three different smart locks to set up
Amazon key so they don't have their own
does the ring acquisition affect that
and buy it in any way like being able to
tell when a Amazon delivery person under
Amazon keys at your goal or something
like that it's possible that so that
would be the security camera that they
have now the cloud cam goes inside your
door so it might be an interesting yeah
additional step where you would then
have the video doorbell outside your
door so it's just even more video to
have every person so you've got inside
and outside the door we're gonna get
into a really interesting relationship
with all your delivery people it's a
great Amazon home invasion how long how
long until Amazon just buddies up with
IKEA and does like their own
construction Houston by IKEA already has
like they bought TaskRabbit said - I
assume like make yourself oh yeah yeah
um the thing is is that Amazon key is
still pretty new and I don't know
anybody personally that actually uses it
and the response from the public about
the idea of having a delivery person be
able to open your door even with all the
steps that Amazon created to ensure
security I haven't really seen it taking
off and and people are like diving all
over themselves to get it so even even
with them buying blink and ring I think
the best way to look at it as is Amazon
wants to have more hardware and control
more Hardware related to the smart home
as a
to being able to like have Amazon ki be
this big thing that everybody uses got
it a shout out to our boy Josh boy de
good to have you with us today as always
he's asking does does ring have Google
assistant integration and if it does do
you think Amazon is going to face that
out that's a good question I'm gonna try
to look that up really quickly it
doesn't know it doesn't have it but
thank you Ness does well source
basically the Google equivalent of ring
right and the other thing that's
interesting to pay attention to here is
that nest used to be kind of a separate
subsidiary of alphabet and then nest
most recently this year like rich Nieva
or Google or reporter wrote about this a
couple weeks ago nest was brought in to
Google to more tightly integrate the
nest stuff with Google assistance so I
would say keep an eye out for this race
because it's continually heating up and
Google is really trying to make a run
for the smart home just like Amazon is
and that that's why Amazon bought ring
like I don't they need to keep up with
thee and I'm just like a grump because I
don't see why you would need like a
smart doorbell like I get a smart lock
and like a security camera stuff but
like first of all no one needs a
doorbell like that's that's that's silly
everyone has phones just calling all
your generation is killing doorbells now
hold on a sec Millennials kill doorbells
now hold on a second though this is
gonna actually stem into another great
question in the chat but I live in the
the underground apartment in my complex
and it is concrete it's pure conquering
the foundation I got bagel for signal
down there so I need a working buzzer
and right that's because I get a lot of
pamphlets coming through do people just
like stamp down to like like let you
know when they're at your door then or
they they send up a flare okay I like
smoke seeps in 30 yeah I remember when I
was visiting family in Israel back in
the 90s they had video doorbells that we
you know would would kind of like have
an apartment that we were set up in it
was like a crappy closed-circuit TV
though and it was something like that
but like that and it had to be wired
yeah it was it was back then it was
you know to me it seemed useful just
till I get that additional like layer of
security to see who was there who you
were buzzing into the apartment building
so I I do see a value to it
it's not gonna be for everybody though
yeah even even if you have like no
reception though I'm like sure like you
have internet connection and they can
still like send you something on like
Facebook Messenger or something yeah
because that's what the smart doorbell
would also rely on okay so how does a
pizza guy get a hold of me I'm not
friends with him on Facebook yeah just
don't order pizza so looking at it from
Amazon's perspective and you are gonna
have to shell out quite a few hundred
dollars for this but let's say you have
the echo show which is an echo that also
has a touchscreen and you have the echo
show in your kitchen you've got a bigger
house so you've got this video doorbell
on the outside somebody rings your
doorbell bingo
you go and you ask Alexa to go see like
hey you know show me show me who's at
the front door and you just you have
that immediacy I think that's what
they're trying to solve again I don't
really see that as something that
everybody needs yeah I know there's
there's good arguments on both sides of
this but there's plenty of special cases
where this would be very helpful and
it's just it I was gonna say interesting
the amazons getting into it no it's not
that was a no-brainer as an absolutely
no it's totally interesting I mean like
the reported figure is not confirmed
like they didn't even send out a press
release about this but if it was in fact
a billion dollar acquisition that's one
of the biggest acquisitions ever well
and Andrews headline said at all because
of course they did right exactly
oh no no no that was bright Chris right
right Chris sorry right sorry I'm pretty
sure he watches the podcast religious of
course he does he with Amazon's purchase
of ring do you think this will prompt
any response from alphabet going back
full circle here well they ante up in
the smart home tech race absolutely I
mean like this is this is just gonna
continue to heat up in 2018 we saw it at
CES where Google made a big splash there
they do not want to Hamazon to run away
with smart home and voice assistant yeah
they're they've been the ones amping it
up to begin with like when they yeah
they're behind yeah when they brought
back nest to be like a part of Google as
opposed to its own company yeah and then
like I think it was like last week or
two weeks till when they ad
a Google assistant like feature to the
nest cam IQ like the camera itself was
its own Google assistant like it wasn't
like oh go talk to this thing like you
could say okay Google to the camera
itself right I two things about the
Amazon Google race is that it could
benefit customers in that it will speed
innovation because both of these
companies are gonna try to compete and
win customers a little bit faster as
they're fighting each other on the smart
home the other problem is is that
they've already kind of been in a
pissing match between each other so it's
possible that Google and Amazon go and
start you know doing crappy things to
each other to try to outsmart each other
like you know Amazon had had gotten rid
of chromecast's on amazon.com for a long
time and just recently brought them back
yeah
I'm laughing in the chatter and how
because Alex Mitchell says pizza guy
uses the app to notify you the same app
you ordered from you're a monster if you
call it Donatello is in Astoria don't
use the internet I don't think they have
the Internet I still use a rotary Bob
yeah there's a there's a capito app
specifically for New York City slice
yeah yeah I used it last weekend it
sucked I never got my pizza and I want
to blame it on the store not the app
just for the record I I'm not gonna
throw them under the bus but the the
store I called it in to never delivered
so it's kind of like I just walked down
the street to the grubby old hole in the
wall got a greasy slice and I was happy
yeah um I don't like giving out my
credit card number over the phone
anymore it's gotten stolen one too many
times
so absolutely speakerphone when you call
everybody knows the best pizza joint is
that old Italian place that only takes
cash right just putting that out there
it's we don't have that in my
neighborhood but you know that's what's
useful I think I'm just severely anti
doorbell I have a doorbell now but like
growing up I like I've never had wine
I'm anti people interacting with them in
general so I don't know I there there's
uh there was an apartment that I lived
in once that didn't have a doorbell so
and wait this is before I had to sell
the best days of your life this is
before I had a cell phone too and so for
my friends to get my attention to come
open the door they either yell out
side my window or throw rocks at it and
one time this dude like he cracked my
window and I got in so much trouble oh
Jesus I just held the boombox over his
head everybody knows that's the best way
to get somebody's attention for love
let's talk 5g real quick before we wrap
it up for the day Josh boy I will 5g be
better at getting through buildings
William Jenkins wonder if the new
Samsung s9 will have 5g in it now and
dacher all the way full circle when will
I ot devices like ring and smart locks
start to build in 5g very good questions
I don't know the answer to the first one
yes I'm gonna be better through
buildings who do we thinks gonna race
back for that we can circle back to that
with Roger because Roger is very much
like our 5g expert he's gonna be coming
back from MWC and we will do a download
with him about everything that he saw at
the show I can answer the IOT thing
though so I had written a story for uh
from MWC about arm the processor stuff
with so the chip maker yeah yeah so they
they have a new there they're looking to
put like basically SIM cards into your
IOT devices so they all have their own
like network instead of like you know
siphoning off your Wi-Fi or anything
like that so they're saying that like
this is really gonna ship out around
like 20 20 ish or 20 21 or so I don't
know if it'll be 5g but they'll
definitely have their own connections if
it's gonna be 20 20 20 21
that is definitely when 5 G's expected
to get broader deployment but I don't
know I don't know these like chips like
have like 5g capabilities apparently I'm
sure with a company like arm I'm sure
they're looking into it so going back to
the other question as far as like who's
ahead they're all trying to race each
other to try to say like oh we're going
into six cities we're going into 30
cities so we mentioned on the show
Sprint and t-mobile they're both
starting two deployments this year
they're actually gonna be available to
customers next year I'm gonna circle
back to Verizon Verizon is expected to
launch its commercial service in at
least one market Sacramento California
later this year an AT&amp;amp;T promised it's
going to have these little pucks
wireless hotspots by the end of the year
- I'm really an
all the marketing campaigns that they
usually do if this where it's
essentially like we're and we're
bringing it to these cool cities blah
blah blah like New York
Dallas whatever LA yeah and I was like
oh cool so like all the cities in
between like - they just don't matter
right they don't they don't get this
really high-speed Internet
like ever well remember Google Fiber was
starting to roll out to the smaller
cities as test and then that kind of
fell through the cracks look I mean as
long as they bring it to New York I kind
of don't care such a jerk okay me first
Ben first we are almost hosts elite yeah
we were almost at a time let's help
Carlos out Carlos is a regular listener
and he's blind and he wants to hear more
about this Asus phone as the iPhone X
competitor can we bring up some of the
performance stats for them and rundown
that's running on a snapdragon 845
processor which is gonna be the same
processor that the galaxy s nine uses
but that's only for the 5z the zenfone 5
itself is running on a snapdragon 636
which is not as high-end as that one it
actually might be I'm not sure how it
compares to the galaxy s 8 I think the
SI was using 839 right the 800 level are
the best ones yes Snapdragon the 600 or
more of the mid tier yeah and so the
lower tier one is also running on four
gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage I
personally think that's enough for like
what you're planning on doing if you
really want the high-end the 5z is using
8 gigs of ram this is just off like
listing the like specs though like I
think it's always different when you
have it in your hand and like you're
actually testing it and I have not been
able to use this so also to correct one
quick thing that Alfred said earlier I
think the 5z is not the Plus version
they both have 6.2 inch displays the
difference is the processor as you
mentioned has an 800 tear and the other
as it's 600 tears how does that not make
less version it's not because like Fry's
usually I suppose that what Plus usually
indicated is literally like the size was
kind of a byproduct of it being maybe I
misunderstood
well whatever it there they are similar
in appearance but they're different
under the hood yeah so hopefully that
answered your question and thanks as
always for listening yeah and on that
note we are
are out of time I got nothing else to
say to close out today was sucked Matt
yeah Matt whoa whoa not a cyberbully the
- that you are always appreciated by Ben
Fox room hope you hated this show as as
is everybody who joins us that is that
is absolutely right
