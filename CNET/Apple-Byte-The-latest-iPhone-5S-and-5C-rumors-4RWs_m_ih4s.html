to the apple pie for everything good and
bad you name it inside the world of
Apple there's lots of iphone news and
rumors this week with September tenth
getting closer so i just wanted to
prepare you for it and we start with a
report from The Wall Street Journal that
says Apple's ask their assembler Hon Hai
Precision industry company to begin
shipping the new high-end and low-end
phones in early September we even
predicted on this show last year that
Apple should bring two phones to the
market yeah i know we predicted two
different screen sizes which we're
probably not getting but it looks pretty
certain that we'll see apple announcing
two different iphone models at the same
time for the first time and everyone
remembers their first time riding a bike
now we told you last week about the
rumors of a gold phone you know that one
well now all things D is confirming that
Apple will indeed release a gold iPhone
that's more of an elegant gold tone like
champagne now their sources say it will
be a white front face with a gold-tone
backplate and chamfered edge like this
mock up from I more and it made me
wonder what other great things have we
seen that or gold well the Olympics have
the gold medal Mario jumps around to
collect gold coins and in Japan they
have the golden turd and there's even
pills with 24 karat gold flakes in them
so you can actually poop gold clearly
the gold iPhone has some really
prestigious company now the iphone 5c is
still getting hated on by the hardcore
Apple fans but the reality is that it's
not a phone targeting them KGI analyst
ming-chi kuo is predicting that the 5c
will actually replace the iphone 5 in
the lineup and it will support tdd-lte
used by china mobile to give apple a
huge boost overseas but the expected
iphone 5s will still be the more popular
model globally and exceed the five-seat
in shipments all right this week's
leaked apple cart from nowhere else FR
is the rear shell of the next gen ipad
and ipad mini
ah it jives with everything we've heard
and seen about the design over the past
few months so we thought we'd just show
it to you anyways and looking into the
future with apple patents the big a has
been granted a patent called working
with 3d objects for 3d gesture control
on touchscreen devices now this would
allow the user to extend the multi touch
capabilities used on the screen to the
airspace above the screen allowing for
3d manipulation of objects with 3d
gesture inputs so you can spin a dice
around that would be displayed on the
screen while your fingers are
manipulating it above it and it's
something I've always wanted to do in
life now if you guys missed this one
Apple's also researching flexible
headphone connectors to prevent them
from potentially breaking by using
flexible or elastic parts on the
connector the plug would be able to
withstand moderate bending that might
break other connectors and no one wants
a connector stuck inside a port all
right to the quick bytes gene Nike
FuelBand developer and fitness expert
Jay Blahnik confirmed he has joined
Apple's team and is likely working on
something that goes maybe on your wrist
or even the next I headband I want that
now all signs point to something i watch
related obviously but the FuelBand is
honestly the weakest fitness band of the
bunch and it just has Nikes marketing
muscle so we better see more than just a
made-up calculation we can't track
called fuel on the next i watch and I'm
sorry but I'm just keeping it real all
right google has updated some of its
apps with some really cool bells and
whistles the YouTube app on iOS has just
been updated and you can now multitask
in the app by dragging your video from
the top to the bottom to have your video
playing in the bottom corner while still
searching for more videos and swiping to
get rid of it it's a sweet update we're
checking out so you guys should look at
that and if you're using google maps
like i am they've started integrating
traffic data from their acquisition with
ways so you can see if there are any
accidents road construction or hazards
in your area by going to the traffic tab
in i'm loving this update and the jobs
movie you know the one with ashton
kutcher has been out in theatres and it
made an estimated 6.7 million dollars
over the weekend according to box office
mojo the Steve Jobs biopic earn less
than one-third as much as the facebook
an apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called
Kutcher disingenuous and believes the
movie is wildly inaccurate it also has a
26-percent rating on rotten tomatoes in
yikes that's a bad apple now this isn't
looking good maybe some of you enjoyed
it but I'm not planning on seeing it and
I'll wait for Aaron Sorkin's
interpretation instead because he's
pretty good all right our show is out
early this week because I'm in the NYC
so we're going to extend the monster DNA
headphones giveaway valued at over two
hundred dollars for one more week that
means you have more time to send me your
video submissions of you dancing like a
crazy it can be a youtube vine or
Instagram and send your link to the
apple byte at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong and this has to be a video
you just shot because people sending me
links from like two years ago it ain't
going to cut it in you really need to
bring your a-game all right that's going
to do it for this week's show I'm Brian
Tom thanks for watching we'll catch you
guys next week for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
