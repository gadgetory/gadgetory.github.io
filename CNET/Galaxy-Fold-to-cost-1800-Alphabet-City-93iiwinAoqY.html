show that normally covers everything
related to alphabet Inc the company that
owns lots of other companies this
episode is going to be a little bit more
google centric than usual I'm your guide
Aya's Akhtar and you are the audience
full of mirth today we're talking about
sundar pichai and Congress on new
assistant trick and your comments but
first it's galaxy gateway let's talk
about the galaxy fold a blog called
let's go digital found a very detailed
report by an analyst group named CCS
CIMB research the report looked at the
phone market in general but had some
very interesting details about the
foldable samsung phone the group
estimates that the foldable phone will
cost six hundred and thirty six dollars
and seventy cents to build at retail the
galaxy f is expected to cost $1,800 to
give samsung a 65 percent profit margin
the firm says samsung will pack in two
batteries for a total of five thousand
to six thousand milliamp hours other
notes from the reports say that foldable
phones will make up more than 9% of
global smartphone sales by 2022 time for
some more Galaxy S 10 stuff gives moto
UK published a report with all kinds of
details about the upcoming Samsung
Galaxy S 10 first up the S 10 would
launch at a Samsung event before Mobile
World Congress the phone would be
released on March 8th the report also
says there will be three models of the S
10 the regular S 10 the S 10 plus and a
flat version for screen sizes the flat
version also known as the S 10 light
would have a 5.8 inch screen the regular
S 10 would have a 6.1 inch screen and
the plus would go with a 6.4 inch one
the S 10 would support reverse wireless
charging meaning the phone could charge
other devices like headphones wirelessly
what about storage the flat would get
128 gigs the Plus will top out with a
terabyte of storage
Gizmodo says the price of that terabyte
monster would be around seventeen
hundred US dollars as for the 5g model
Gizmodo UK sources say it will be in
late q2 at the earliest let's go to
uptown update
sundar pichai took on the US House
Judiciary Committee for several hours of
questioning
we've got a full highlight package up on
our YouTube channel long story short
which I said the company does not have
any political bias
he also said Google does not have any
current plans to launch a product in
China but I also said that the company
had looked into the concept internally
with a team of over 100 people otherwise
we also learned that technology is still
a very difficult concept for certain
lawmakers to handle it's not a trick
question you know you make a hundred
million dollars a year you ought to be
able to answer that question does Google
know through this phone that I am moving
over there and sit next to mr. Johnson
which would make him real nervous Google
announced that assistant is getting even
smarter this time assisting will
proactively tell you if your flight is
predicted to be delayed you will also
see why the flight would be delayed
Google says it uses historic flight
status data combined with machine
learning to make predictions about
flight delays let's go to comment code
this is the part of the show where we
shine a spotlight at the most amazing
audience the world
you guys Angelou asks what happened to
Project loon that's a good question we
haven't covered a major development out
of loon for a long time
last I checked loon signed a deal with
telecom Kenya to provide Internet
services by balloon the service should
go live in 2019
now loon spun out of alphabets X company
back in July X is alphabet research and
development unit Apple goo-goo says I
will really miss Google Plus it was
really versatile and handy and useful
for everyday toggling between my work
life and personal life and of course I'm
kidding I found it annoying because it
kept trying to conflate the need that
makes music videos with the me that does
everything else never signed up for it
never used it and still it managed to
negatively impact me well stated Thanks
