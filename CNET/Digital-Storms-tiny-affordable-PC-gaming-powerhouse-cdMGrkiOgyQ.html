gonna talk about the digital storm bolt
so as you can see this is a slim tower
desktop and it's actually a really fast
gaming PC so this review unit runs about
$1,600 and it's a fixed configuration
you can make a few tweaks but for the
most part what you see on the
configurator is what you get here so
this is a tiny little design it's about
the same size as what we've seen from
Falcon Northwest and alienware and there
are other slim tower pcs and it's
actually not that bad looking there's
some fins down here to keep it stable so
it doesn't rock from side to side you
can see on the front there's the DVD
drive as well as here on the side
there's some USB ports you've got USB to
USB 3 as well as standard analogue audio
on the back of the case is a pretty
straightforward array of ports you've
got USB 2 here as well some ethernet
jacks 7.1 audio as well as digital
s/pdif audio output you've got a couple
wireless antenna jacks right here
there's USB 3 down here as well as
old-school ps2 if you have an older
input device like a joystick or
something up here in the graphics card
you've got two DVI outputs as well as
HDMI and DisplayPort out behind these
little plugs so there's no exotic port
like Thunderbolt on the system but with
what you get you can connect the system
in any standard desktop or living room
setup so that makes it pretty versatile
and lets you take advantage of its small
size so I'll go inside the case but
before I do that I'll point out that
it's actually kind of a paint the cover
slides off and it gets stuck sometimes
on some of the internal components or
some wires here there's a screw down
here that gets it away when you put it
back on so it looks pretty good on the
outside if you'd like to tinker inside
your PC you might be annoyed in which
digital storm had paid a little bit more
attention to the design so in this side
of the case you can see there's a
geforce gtx 660ti graphics card so
that's a nice fast card you can see it's
a double wide card and it's got the
power connectors up here and that will
let you play pretty much any PC game in
the market right now in our test it did
really well on far cry 2 and some older
titles that have built in benchmarks
anecdotally we were playing Crysis 3 and
far cry 3 at really high resolutions at
high image quality and had no problems
with the framerate so you might hit the
limit of this system before you would on
a higher-end PC at least you can know
that any game you want to play today
will have
problem so in this side of the case you
can see here's the CPU behind this giant
fan note there's not liquid cooling well
if you've seen on some of these slim
towers and helps keep the price down
there's a core i7 3770k CPU here so
that's overclockable and digital storm
has set the cpu speed to 4.1 gigahertz
that's not quite as fast as we've seen
elsewhere but again it's fast enough for
most gamers and especially considering
the price it's not too slow it's sort of
hard to tell but there's two memory
sticks here for eight gigabytes total
you don't have a lot of expansion room
so you have to deal with that that's
kind of a known limitation of these slim
tower systems although you do actually
get a fair amount of hard drive space so
here's the hard drive stack and there's
one 500 gig drive in the back it's a
standard mechanical drive in front of
that you have a 120 gig solid-state
drive here that has the operating system
for fast booting you can also add one
more solid-state drive here in digital
storm even wire the data and power
connector is exactly read 1 if you're
gonna add a new drive so if you're a
truly demanding PC gamer and you want to
play it high resolutions are multiple
monitors this is probably not the system
for you but if you're looking for a lean
amine PC for a relatively affordable
price the digital storm bolt can
certainly get you up and running on any
piece of game you want to throw at it so
iron rich Brown this is the digital
storm bolt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
