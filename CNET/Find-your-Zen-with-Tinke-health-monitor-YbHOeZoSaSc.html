the press preview for the big CES show
and a product here caught our eye it's
an apple accessory that is called the
two it not only measures your blood
pressure by simply putting your thumb on
a sensor but it also measures your
breathing rate and the oxygen levels in
your blood it's going to be at $99 when
it comes out at the end of the month now
right now the tank is attached to an
apple lightning connector port but this
will work with several Apple devices and
once you plug it in the light sensor is
able to measure these things like heart
rate and breathing rate and oxygen
levels based on how much pressure you're
putting on and how the light reflects
through the skin it measures your blood
kind of strange how light can do that
the only thing is that it can be a
little sensitive if there's bright
lights around so you might have to go in
an area without a direct light overhead
once you take your measurements you get
a score out of 99 to see how you're
doing it kind of evaluates how you're
doing overall I passed with a
satisfactory so I guess I kind of room
for improvement but I can then show my
score on facebook if I want so i can let
everyone know how i'm doing or I can see
how my friends are doing it they also
have this there's also a mode in your
presents so I can work on my breathing
levels so I can learn how to be a little
more calm in stressful situations this
is just one of the many health related
products you'll be seen at yes this year
expect to see more accessories for Apple
Isis the Android version of this though
may be coming out in two three months
