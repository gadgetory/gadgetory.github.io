Microsoft's 10 fair in Mountain View
where we're seeing some of what
Microsoft Research is up to I'm here
with Frank Saida for Microsoft Research
agent who is going to show us the
translating telephones so I'm gonna ask
him a few questions he's gonna answer us
in German and then we're gonna see how
the translator does so Frank what are we
seeing here
we show a system here for automatic
translation of language so it did pretty
good
how long has Microsoft been working on
disesteem community the transition in
taking opinion after Marcus or fashion
the system now three different
technologies on Microsoft Research are
annoying for nine years at Microsoft
all nine years in Beijing in China and
are you more of a soccer fan or
basketball I started as a German and
then of course one of football
and what's your favorite food my thing
seems into spaghetti labeling session or
spaghetti didn't translate the word
actually I recognized what are some of
the things if the translation engine is
best at and what are some of the things
that a major problem is that strange
written text translation system but
written text is very widely spoken
language so basically the hardest part
you can say this in English solidest
part is that the text-to-speech part is
the translation and then it's hard to
translate spoken and written language so
there are a lot of heart problems right
so speech recognition by itself is
actually very hard especially if you
speak you know in a natural pace you
stutter you repeat yourself to correct
yourself and so on that is something
that we are addressing in this system by
you know having the system adapts to
your voice over time so
longer use the system the better it gets
and we have actually used the system in
the English version for about the year
now and we get very very reasonable
accuracy chance for that on the
translation side the problem is really
that because it's all based on machine
learning right we need to get parallel
texts in two languages for
conversational style and that is very
very different home it's much easier to
get the four written text documents that
are out on the web are typically written
style so the challenge that we are
facing here is that my German for
example when it's because Paisley is not
from Attica
it doesn't fit into the normal grammar
rules and that's something that confuses
the translation system quite a bit thank
you so much for taking the time I really
appreciate it
ashamed
like to happen huh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
