Lego model it is a super detailed
replica of the Caterham 7 620r
so start with us just take a look at the
model compared to the real thing and you
can see that Legos done a really good
job I think of replicating exactly how
this car looks the real deal has a top
speed of 155 miles per hour
I can hit nought to 60 in 2.79 seconds
but the specs on this little lego model
are no less impressive it's a lot more
compact though this thing measures just
28 centimeters from nose to tail the
nose cone here at the front is removable
so is this engine cover the bricks used
here on the engine itself I love the
detail there one other detail
I know LEGO fans will be very pleased
with is that there are no stickers here
all these bricks with detailing like
this they're all printed what's really
cool about this set is it actually
started as a fan submission to Legos
ideas platform the submitted concept
design then got the requisite 10,000
votes court Legos attention and
eventually became the actual product you
see before you so call your design has
been built into to a real proper Lego
model that's going on so how how does it
feel to see the fruition of all your
labors it's emotional that's all I would
say it really is a dream come true my
initial concept design was probably
about a month but I did that obviously
just as my own person but also it was
never I never had to take into
consideration strength and rigidity
issues that you would have to do for an
official design that's when I then went
back and redesigned the sets to get them
more in line using only current
production parts and looking at the way
that the things were built and
completely redesigned them from scratch
and how faithful do you think Lego has
been to your design are you happy with
the final result it stream Lee happy
yeah I mean in fact we've still got some
eye
initial concept model says people can
see just how close the final product is
to the initial concept lanes
yeah I'm extremely the biggest challenge
was to get the strength and playability
into the model that we need to ensure
that even if a kid gets a model it's
able to play with it then and like push
on it and drive with it so building that
strength into the model was the biggest
challenge the shape was more less given
and I've tried to stick as close to that
as I could
I'm really happy I think it's a really
really nice model it's been a real
pleasure working on it
what other Lego models have you worked
on in the past have you done many cars
or is it a really broad range of models
I've done a broad range of models but
I'm mostly done lick of City so there's
a lot of cars and trucks and I'm a big
truck freak myself but I've also done a
lot of a direct-to-consumer models like
the Taj Mahal and Boeing Dreamliner and
stuff like that in the past and a lot of
Star Wars movies also so four sets
caught your eye you can buy it when it
goes on sale in October it's gonna cost
69 pounds that's all for now
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
