levy welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's hottest
tech rumor and then we vote on which
ones we think sounds legit and which
ones we think seem like total bum but
the very best part is that you guys get
to vote along too so don't go anywhere
let's jump right in our first rumor is
exciting for two reasons first it's
because I believe it for once and second
that is because it's being reported by
our very own David Carr knowing who has
a credible source who says that the new
kindle fire is coming out on July
thirty-first recently rumors from digit
times as you mentioned last week said
that the new kindle fires were on their
way with higher resolution screens the
big change according to karna resource
is that the new kindle fires are going
to have physical volume up and volume
down buttons as well as a camera which
the first one lacks unfortunately the
source is silent on what the new
processors will be and there's been no
word on Bluetooth or memory which sucks
because that's what we care about is
whether the thing you can fire it can
store more and whether it'll be faster
here's why I say yay I think Google's
new tablet put a fire under amazon to
rush this update in time for the new
school season plus karn we trust this
source and I trust Carly see I say nay
on the July thirty-first release because
I think a year turnaround is more likely
maybe it'll be announced next month but
I don't think it'll come out okay do you
guys think the kindle fire too will come
out in July if you're watching on cnet
cast your votes now using the thumbs up
thumbs down right next to Emily's head
in the cnet interactive player you have
the next 30 seconds to vote in the
meantime we're going to take the
question to the streets of San Francisco
and then we're going to come back and
see if your vote matches up with the
cnet Council of experts
do you think that it's actually possible
that the Kindle Fire 2 is coming out
next month I have no idea no you know I
just read an article about it yesterday
and I think it's close yeah well it
would be that or they might hold out
till later toward Christmas but ya know
they sure they should get it together
maybe I know that they want to push to
get things to market because there's a
lot of competition out there I'm not
that familiar with it with the kindle
myself but I'd be surprised at the
update it's so soon after the launch I
don't even know what the kindle fire one
is i might have a kindle fire one and
haven't seen really a lot of updates
ladies so I'm really hoping that working
on something well the people on the
street who deavon heard of the kindle
fire seemed about evenly split let's go
upstairs and hear about some more rumors
our second rumor comes from nine to five
mac which says it took a second pass of
the supposed iPhone prototype code and
found evidence for NFC technology baked
in that basically means you can pay for
stuff by swiping your phone I have no
idea whether this code that 95 Matt keep
referencing is real but I think that it
makes sense for NFC to be in the next
iPhone especially this is a technology
that's already in android phones people
are already sort of using it at like
four places in america and i think that
they have to do it i agree because if
they don't do it that means Apple will
be behind again and that's not a
position they're usually comfortable in
for long exactly our third rumor is a
crazy one because it suggests that
connect technology may soon be coming to
microsoft's connected car platform a job
listing spotted on microsoft site
describes leveraging connect Windows 8
Windows Phone bing as your and tell me
for the car oh that's literally every
single Windows software that Microsoft
has except for office exactly and they
just don't want you working in the car I
mean that is why I actually don't think
that this is true at all I think that
this is just some really uppity HR
person listed all the new sexy software
that she could think of for this job
listing and it actually has nothing to
do with connect not so fast because
remember that Microsoft already demo'd
this technology and a Ford Mustang in
Detroit and it was basically just a
glorified backup camera I guess the only
other thing was that you could actually
sort of wave at the radio to turn it on
so you could be like this hand gesture
means NPR
and this one means jay-z I guess that's
easier our final rumor is adorable and
suggests that the new BlackBerry 10
devices will out pixel the iphone retina
display the site n4 BB claims that it
has a leaked internal spec sheet the
only thing is they don't say it all
where they got this leaked doc but
whatever it is it does say that the
resolution of the new blackberry 10 n
series is going to be ten eighty by
seven sixty pixels say that is the worst
report I've ever seen they didn't know
how to string any words together the Sun
dances didn't make sense it was like I
am a robot and here are the specs now
you know these specs I generate doll
room our room ojo right there 2000 ok
let's get back to our first much more
credible rumor let's see with the scenic
council banks about the kindle fire to
release date the cnet council is
composed of five Cena experts who cast
their votes anonymously opinions org
estimates expressed by the cnet Council
are not an endorsement by cnet or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet verdict is yay
they think that the kindle fire too will
likely come out next month awesome the
cnet council was a four-to-one in
agreement with me those smarty pants did
you guys do better than I did check out
your results in the player also our
comment of the week last week goes to mg
watson who writes about the xbox 720
coming out next year i just want it to
launch at the same time as the ps4 so
the flame wars comparing who sells more
total units won't be so confusing i
totally agree i agree to that's our show
everybody please share your rumors at
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and don't forget to tune in
next week for more tech rumors
