and I'm back in full effect to tell you
about some of my favorite south by
southwest music highlights one artist I
was really honored to be at was the
mercury invite-only showcase featuring
pop soul artists Duffy's performance was
simply amazing sounding like an Amy
Winehouse but ten times better and cuter
you got a new bumpers
whoa
sorry Amy I still love you another band
I was also honored to be at was the fate
of showcase featuring a tribute to Lou
Reed the showcase ran a little bit over
two hours featuring 11 acts including my
morning jacket Thurston Moore and others
however it was Moby the last act in Lou
Reed performing walk on the wild side
that made the entire experience
incredibly memorable hustle here and
hustle there New York City is the place
where the said he'd be take a walk on
the wild side check out more south by
highlights from the rest of our music
team by visiting our music blog located
on the upper right tab titled crossfade
hey how's it going this is Mike tell one
of my highlights from the south by
southwest festival was checking out one
of my all-time favorite rappers Ice Cube
who ran through a gang of old hits which
is all I wanted to hear as well as some
of his later songs which I could have
done without but then again I also could
have done without him acting in movies
like are we there yet in tort you know
it's quite ignite so everything is
anyway guilty simpson was another artist
I was impressed with I've been a fan of
his since I heard him on the J live
album but watching his live performance
made me an even bigger fan do got the
entire crowd open with some ill verbal
tactics and go pee on the CD to with
cases they kill me that I'm too abrasive
unseen you move evasive cubes albums due
out later this year and guilties album
is in stores now hey this is Kurt Wolff
and myself by Southwest week was jammed
full of great music as usual including
REM Black Mountain Memphis supergroup
the boat keys and two awesome Norwegian
metal bands 1349 and enslaved it's hard
to narrow my pics but I definitely need
to give a shout out to the Explorers
Club these six guys have an obvious
Beach Boys fixation but their harmonies
and vintage smile style arrangements
were absolutely amazing
why
another favorite was these are powers a
Brooklyn Korea that made a noisy racket
Saturday night at the mohawk the sound
was loud and fuzzy but it was also
totally fun and somehow it stayed
together and never crashed
