you've got the dress you've got your
date and you're so carb deprived that
you've said 30% of your water weight I'm
so hungry
but there's one thing you've forgotten
dude your acceptance speech like
seriously the only thing you have to
remember anyway I'm here to tell you
that it's not enough to just write an
acceptance speech these days you need to
go viral your face needs to be giftable
your speech needs to get hashtag and if
all goes well you'll get a bad lip
reading done but all that's really hard
when you're an actor I should know I did
a 12 month intensive mind course at
Juilliard anyway I've got you covered
here are eight tips to writing the
perfect acceptance speech and going
viral one at the entrance but not too
much I'm not talking a full trip over
just a cute sexy trip like enough to get
Hugh Jackman to want to come and rescue
you it's like unfunny and awkward and
approachable and I in hamburgers but I'm
still skinny I'm talking like funny
awkward not awkward ugly it's the
real-life version of Instagram ugly cute
not like double chins - you are so shot
like seriously shot I literally can't
believe it I mean not literally because
you want a 20% chance of winning and a
group of five and we all know that one
of them is a complete numpty who's never
gonna win anyway
but oh my god I'm so surprised so give
us their space reacts you know widen
your eyes big stupid mouth for the most
important thing remember don't be ugly
three you've been shocked for a bit so
now it's time to meet and edge of your
speech the thank-yous
you've got your academies you've got
should God's you've got your mums and
dads remember this is gonna show that
you're really humble despite the fact
that you've got a 1.2 million dollar
paycheck for that walk-on role in Modern
Family that better put me next to severe
magar in the commercials anyway no one's
gonna use this on Twitter but it shows
that you're really approachable and as
long as you don't thank Harvey Weinstein
you're pretty much set for inside jokes
from Hollywood make sure you throw in
some obscure name drops that no one's
really gonna care about like thanks to
the craft services crew or Fred Lee it
because you were the most amazing talent
agent a girl could ever ask for if that
doesn't work then just throw in some
behind the scenes stuff to make those
mouth breathers at home really feel like
they're getting an inside view of
Hollywood like the fact that you and
your co-star got matching tattoos it
means
some destiny forget the fact that you're
eating crab pups in the green room while
here's washed up on season 34 of
Celebrity Apprentice it's gonna make you
look so approachable by get political if
we do anything about the lefty pinko
Hollywood bubble it's that they're gonna
love you talking about climate change or
Trump oh I don't know the alienation of
minorities women and people of color and
how the makeup of the Academy
essentially ensures that only the most
inoffensive films win Oscars because we
need to maintain in a Germany an
remember the entire Hollywood system is
built on a fragile framework of white
male privilege what dogs about dogs love
animal rights six tears I'm not talking
when a cult road tears hysterical women
am i right no I'm talking about those
beautiful little tears that turn your
eyes into tiny diamonds because remember
tears look good every angle they're like
sequence for your eyeballs and look
while we're on the topic I know it's a
lot to ask but if you could shed one
perfect tear I'll share in moonstruck
then that's gonna be your pay dirt
number seven and this is really
important because you're gonna start
running out of time take a selfie there
is no better way to generate content
than to take it yourself remember the
other steps still apply here no ugly
angles look shocked but hot posed with
another actor named drop a celebrity
then add a hashtag so hashtag blessed to
win tonight Meryl thinking of your girl
hashtag stop feline influenza and
finally number eight make a graceful
exit the music should be starting to
play you out by now so you should go out
with a splash just lift up the statuette
and go out on a bang a line like you
like me you really like me or suck at
James Cameron and that's it no a
chugging domestic mid-range sparkling
like you're at the BAFTAs you're an
Oscar winner now and you've just gone
viral
so grab your statue get off stage open
Instagram and start harvesting dem likes
because category is Oscar eleganza and
Europe win
