I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
it not update prepare yourself for
future well you'll be visiting websites
that engine app store movie bank down
google there could be hundreds of new
words that will be typing in our
browsers the nonprofit group that
manages domain extensions known as I can
for sure sorting through almost two
thousand applications from companies
that want to oversee new domain
extensions many companies are battling
for names dot app is a popular request
it got 13 applications and also in high
demand is dot home and dot web google
applied for more than a hundred names
including dot lol and dot Wow amazon it
went for phrases like read store and
music both the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and
Google are battling for dot baby and if
there's more than one application
forward then the two companies will have
to duke it out or it will go to an
auction for the highest bidder there are
also some controversial ones like sex
porn and dot sucks you can really see
how dots Lex can be a problem for brands
like imagine Apple dot sucks but I can
set it will take measures to make sure
companies won't be exploited under that
domain it will be some time before these
extensions get built out and chances are
most Volker dot-com is king of the
domain game you can guarantee over Maine
that way this just gives company is a
chance to create a page of the dot-com
is taken and it's not like anyone wanted
domains with dot biz or dot info or how
about that dot movie yeah that was
predicted to be the hot extension for
mobile friendly websites and then the
iPhone came out a few months later and
crushed that dream imagine being able to
silence the volume on your phone just by
waving it over a sticker as you walk
into a conference room or how about
waving your phone at the entrance to a
restaurant to post your location check
in on Facebook automatically Samsung is
presenting a new twist to NFC technology
used in mobile payments and Sampson
calls them tectiles the programmable
stickers would activate different
commands for phones that have NFC chips
if this becomes popular then you can
also expect things like Google Wallet to
be more
widely used if you've ever dreamed to be
a graffiti artist but you didn't like
the whole breaking along going to jail
factor well you might like an app called
stick to it's a virtual graffiti app
that uses augmented reality just snap a
photo of anything and add text draw or
put in stickers upload it and other
users can see what other people have
created in that same space it's
available on iOS and Android that your
