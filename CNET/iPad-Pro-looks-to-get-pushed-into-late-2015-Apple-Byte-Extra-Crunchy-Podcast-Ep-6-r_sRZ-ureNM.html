of good calls lately thank you for

you want to talk about anything yeah I

over like I can't eat that thing I don't
even know what he's doing he's just
being a clown so anyways welcome to the
apple byte extra crunchy for those of
you listening people are watching at the
same time because we post this video as
if it's live we're going to jump the
stories lots of things going on apple's
event still unconfirmed by the big a sep
tember 9th is the expected anticipated
date but we have new news about the
products that are going to be involved
in the show first up ipad pro rumblings
were saying we're gonna see iphones
ipads and apple TV all together that
seemed like a lot right Steven that is a
lot it's going to be a very long morning
what I'm going to get here at six in the
morning I'm gonna be here in this room
emoni by two or three in the afternoon
two or three in the afternoon how so new
stories have popped up multiple websites
and app developers they have their
developer logs where they see what type
of devices ping their websites macrumors
com and a developer called app see have
seen logs that show
devices from Apple specifically a tablet
device running iOS 9.1 has been pinging
their websites as far back as July some
of the activities started pick up but
ladies and gentlemen iOS 9 isn't even
out yeah so what does that mean are they
going to release the new they're not
going to release new devices with iOS 9
on it well this is T this is great
because he's Steven and I we just come
in this we start talking to flowing iOS
9.1 appears to be specifically for the
ipad the new iPad pro meaning they have
to release 9 first everything is
starting to line up that the ipad pro
running 9.1 will be a separate event and
will come later in a later update as
well as still coming this year but Apple
will then help it will help them to
streamline their focus iPhones and apple
TV in one event and then iPad in its own
event the other indications that the
ipad is coming later based on the supply
chain from digit times rumors from
ming-chi kuo everyone's favorite
favorite a rumor / early news reporter
says that the iPads are expected to
start manufacturing in the late
September early October hmm with that we
always do the ipad event October right
wait they did so historically and that's
historically what they've done as a
separate event but people started
reporting that they're going to bunch
them all three together but that looks
like it's not going to be the case so
the other thing that is surfaced is that
the ipad pro looks like it will be
getting its own touch force touch
enabled stylist so the stylist will
somehow enable these force touch actions
specific to the ipad so they're going in
the way of the microsoft surface and
adding a stylus which I've never heard
nasty for never it I think you know what
we touched upon force touch and we will
later in the show how they're not going
to try and drop down all these crazy to
contextual menus on you but they will
enable you to maybe do things a little
faster a little more efficiently and
then more than anything it'll be
interesting to see how that Silas really
interacts with some of these artistic
apps that you use on the ipad tablet oh
yeah that i don't know if they're gonna
add more functionality or it'll be
you know a more sensitive tip but we
will see why are you laughing about I
don't know why I laughed it just don't
know where to me um Apple analytics also
based on developer logs show that the
ipad pro resolution that they've shown
from their logs 27 32 x 2048 that is
what has been rumored that's what kind
of confirmed that this whole device was
an iOS 9.1 tablet specifically okay that
would that would that would also so
that's just kind of some warnings about
the ipad pro just to let people know
that's getting closer to 4k it's getting
colder here again there also iphone 6s
news uh really revealed in a triple leak
this comes from carriers in UK reports
in japan reports in germany the reports
are that apple's iphone will be
available on sep tember the 18th so
remember the eighth and now it would be
the ninth let me look at my calendar
here right now sep tember the 18th would
be a friday which would make sense hmm
now the reason why we all think this is
going to happen in the US as well as
because all those countries are tier 1
launch countries what that means is when
an iphone has launched on day one it's
been on those countries at the same time
as the u.s. recently therefore September
the 18 ding ding ding back to bham mark
your calendars mark your accountant who
but you know people are already in line
right now you know more than even I hope
not I seriously hope please guys did
well nowadays now these days okay when
the first i phone lines started forming
in New York it was an actual guy it was
kind of a big guy with the mustache with
a tummy yeah and then didn't they
announced it working oh no that was the
apple watch that they weren't gonna sell
instead of like screw line everyone is
the line was like oh yeah and then
companies started showing up like
because they knew news stories are being
covered they just be like people from a
company or squatters wearing branded
gear or saying could be Guyana tents did
answered did that even help any of those
companies get any business at all no and
actually I think it made people hate
those businesses so it's actually works
in the opposite direction all right more
iphone 6s news this is the hottest news
from unbox therapy man this is a killer
story in a killer video if you haven't
had a chance to
check it out but we're gonna talk about
and show it to you the iphone 6s she'll
actually finally has been bent so this
is the case that Lou from unbox therapy
had acquired he finally put it
side-by-side with an iphone 6 rear case
but this is more than just bending it
first of all he like takes the case and
he he reveals the metal on it so that
the surface of these metals are anodized
and what that does is that you know it's
kind of that cool layer of that
treatment that they put on it but you've
got to get to the actual metal the
actual content and so they zap it with
this device that analyzes the materials
in the metal and then uh and then it's
that they analyze that oh sorry about
that the videos like okay sorry so I
should just said that to you normally
huh turn on video I thought we were like
like what are you signaling to me people
wondering what was happening I just
wanted the video to be a little lower
volume so if you're listening like wait
what the heck just happened that's all i
did i'm not gonna single him and then
all i did was go like this turn it down
so they zap these things and basically
the new iphone case has a higher zinc
racial but there's more zinc actually in
the case primarily aluminum which leads
to the fact that this is definitely
aluminum 7 7000 series aluminum that
they're using when it comes down to the
strength of this thing he put this
through a bend test the original iphone
6 rear shell bent under 30 pounds of
pressure the iphone 6s case the
purported one that they believed to have
bent under 80 pounds of pressure that's
a lot that's way more it's almost two
and a half times more yeah so that's
pretty good so that's you have it in
your butt sit down you're gonna be safe
cuz i don't i don't know are you putting
are you putting 80 pounds of pressure on
that with your way about 200 pounds i
don't i don't think it's 80 i don't
think i've had 80 on me 80 small traces
of zinc there's there's no zinc
poisoning scare how many people are
worried about that um yeah so you can
check out the video super impressed let
me find the part where he actually puts
it in okay here we go uh listen you're
gonna listen this part okay here's where
you actually puts
putting the so that's 30 pounds right
yeah both sides on the two obvious weak
points as we've known previously near
the power button as well as near the
volume rocker we have weakness and we
have a bet a representation of not just
the bend ability of the material but
also those weak points that I mentioned
in the previous video but what happens
if we increase the pressure even more
the one that made it today 13 oh no oh
no okay so you could just pull out so
that was just the original 66 case got
230 pounds bent-it the other one got 280
pounds right but for people it's kind of
hard for people that are listening just
to catch up to ya you know it it just
shows that it this is a substantially
stronger material do I think you know
people are asking do I think the upgrade
is worth it right big booty girls can
still bend it you are correct t-bone
4030 we gotta show love to our periscope
errs that are hanging out with this I
have I agree with that big big booty
dudes big booty big big booty booze and
big booty dues they could both bend it
um so yeah that's what's gonna happen to
I think it's still worthy upgrade we
don't even know exactly what it is but I
will tell you right now just as a review
or if it has enough features that make
it different meaning if it does have
forced touch if has a better camera a
better processor I'm lighter in weight
but stronger I'm gonna I'm gonna upgrade
mine told you I have to at this point
cuz my iPhone 5 is not working for me
anymore man it's like I think apples
killing it behind my back you know
secretly bacon apple is asking what
about an elephant an elephant will
definitely I will didn't depend
Hollywood had a giraffe step on an
iphone that it was gone it was dead it
was devastated yeah okay Lee well the
screen was probably screwed up or Elif
yeah definitely broken glass so I would
not get an elephant to step on your
phone what about a mammoth mammoths are
extinct so that's not gonna be possible
good to know my bad I saw him at the
Museum I thought it was like a you know
it was probably dead right was probably
prop selatan the animatronic was
actually not a working man
that's what you're saying yeah it was
not real Brian as much as you'd like
well then the people in Korea are going
to are going to clone them so they will
be that's right yeah there's a stress
out that right yeah they're gonna cook
there gonna clone them in Korea so
expect a woolly mammoth back in the next
couple years okay good to know mark your
calendars everyone a couple years even
be Jim said you hear first we'll do that
test um a device that will also expect
to see here that needs some help needs a
little refreshing the Apple TV a new
survey kind of based on who has what by
Park associates com it almost sounds
like a that sounds like a public park
organization doesn't Park associates
they're doing market intelligence
they've been doing it for more than 25
years according to their website all
right they did a survey check out these
results based on set-top box or
streaming media device boxes Roku
continues to lead streaming media with
thirty four percent of units sold in
2014 google chromecast was second with
twenty three percent amazon overtook
apple apple is it knocked by that
apple's fourth place that's crazy Apple
is in fourth place I mean I understand
amazon it makes sense an amazon would
take over because they have the
streaming media service yeah so that an
apple doesn't have anything like that
other than you have to rent and buy
media from Apple that's right so hmm
interesting interesting yeah I would
think the chromecast would be even
higher because it's so cheap and that's
all I use now like if I'm going I switch
between my television my cable and my
chromecast that's all I do well Roku is
the one that really kind of I've always
been a big fan of Roku and what they
were doing yeah and I'm glad too that
the number is kind of bear out not only
in sales but when you talk about what's
being used the most among us broadband
households that's what the survey also
measured that own a streaming device 34
seven percent of Roku devices or the
ones actually being used chromecast at
nineteen percent Apple jumps up to
seventeen percent so apple TV is third
in usage but at least fourth in sales
for 2014 and Amazon fire TV at fourteen
percent now if you had to guess which
which three of those four devices do I
own all of them I said three or four
okay so you have a rope
you have an Apple TV and you have the
Google and then you have a chromecast
yes okay yeah you have an Apple TV in a
chromecast know you have just a
chromecast I got a rope / Roku Roku and
get gas yes but the Roku is not in my
house the Roku is at my parents house in
Tahoe which is awesome that's good
that's totally good alright so there you
go i'm just some apple TV news about how
that's broken down but fourth-place 2014
come out with a new one those sales will
spike up i'm very curious about the
Apple TV I really I mean they have to
really do something to get all those
viewers back because every like half the
phone calls that we got to we're like
what's gonna happen with Apple TV what
are we gonna hear you know everyone
wants an upgrade they all want to know
what's gonna happen with that I will
tell people that are watching on
chromecast my phones around eight
percent so it's probably the Dai
midstream just to let you know I just
want to be honest with them go to my
phone he wouldn't go to hear phone but
then we'll be under Bryant only have
seventeen percent it'll be a totally
different stream so you can watch on
live stream or YouTube but you can't
watch on periscope errs I'm just letting
you know it's gonna just mmm it's gonna
die yeah all right um also some cool
things accessories the FCC outed some of
the cool new stuff Apple has been
working on new magic mouse and a new
wireless keyboard will be coming out
sometime in the near future okay we have
the magic mouse guess what the forgets
what the how about you a beach him
without looking what do you think
they're gonna call the second magic
mouse if you had to guess um the first
one was called just the magic mouse
that's what was yes the second one will
be called the hocus pocus mouse I have
no idea the abracadabra yeah every bad
um the Magic Mike mouse oh I like that
all very excellent ideas instead they
report that apple will be calling it the
magic mouse too okay that makes total
sense good job I am actually I'm
actually behind the Magic Mike mouse I
don't know what the design would look
like it might change I'm sure someone
can Photoshop us a Magic Mike mouse
and send it in yo listeners yeah we will
show you love if someone can make us a
Magic Mike mouse all right just send it
to the apple byte at cnet com that's all
you have the Magic Mike mouse will show
you love also give you a prize will pick
will pick will pick the one we like okay
okay yeah best magic mountain is Magic
Mike gals a cool prize will get a prize
from btz and Steve easy Stevie beezy I'm
gonna call you Steve easy Steven Beecham
and yeah we're gonna do that all right
get on that cool cool I even if you know
there's probably right now there's not
it's early on in our shows life that
this is the best chance you have of
winning something yes you know you're
you might be that person that has never
won a contest you could win this contest
yeah there's probably we have like ten
viewers right now guys so one in ten
chance you can win it we have way more
than that just for the record oh yeah
you're right i know i just looked oh my
god now I'm nervous okay don't get
nervous okay let's uh let's check out
voicemails we show love to you guys you
shall love to us before we do this I
just want to remind you the number that
you can call us at is 1 800 61 62 63 8
these are voicemails we're not taking
live calls yet but we want to get you
involved you're a part of the show just
as much as we are so Steven I mean you
kind of have them lined up so I'll
follow your lead here we go number one
hey guys this is a smart Atlanta that
just want to know if you guys have heard
anything about them doing peer-to-peer
payments to Apple pay originally and
just to see what it with a what the
progress was on that yeah so we did talk
about this I think in like maybe the
first or second show that they are
planning to do something where you have
to bump your phones together right yes
so Apple has filed for an actual patent
so they it's in the cards of what
they're thinking it's the right way to
think they haven't revealed if they're
going to do anything like that but the
fact that they've filed or applied for
the patent and it exists pretty much
shows that this is something that
they're thinking of it's going to go
going to eventually happen they got to
make it easier though than having a bump
with someone's phone I mean you don't
you shouldn't even have to bump it it
should just be basically like we've
talked about it venmo or a paypal you
just know someone's email yeah call it
up send them the money the Apple ID that
yeah Apple ID me some cash man mang that
sounds too long Apple ID me some cash
mang yo Apple ID me some scrill brah
well that's a lot of cultures makes
nothing there squirrel brah so uh you
know they are working on a chamar and I
just want to say for the record shamar
actually also was the first voicemail he
likes to be the first caller for all of
our live events right he's now the first
voicemail caller in the queue he's gonna
try and keep that I'm on the show so we
should we should give he should get some
streak award or something like that he's
been should be like a guest skype collar
yeah he will I'm sure he's down for that
all right next voicemail this is brian
from New Orleans I know we should find
this out in September but other than the
reported for Scotch coming out on the
iphone 6s I don't really hurt anything
else I would maybe want to upgrade from
an iphone 6 other than the normal spec
upgrades so just want to get your
opinion on there's really any reason to
upgrade if I'm not that interested in
for such thanks we think i saw i as a
casual consumer I don't think forced
touches enough for you to upgrade but I
do think that getting an extra hour
battery life a better camera those two
things most the time and during the 6s
525 s4 24 s generation it was the camera
and the speed of the phone that was most
compelling hmm yeah speed and also
basically where you were on your phone
contract so if you're someone who has a
5s still or a 5 mm I'm not way out I'm
not looking I'm not looking at anyone
specifically in this room I'm like a
year past my car I'm not looking at
anyone specifically in this room but uh
if you have a 5 or 5s I think it's a
no-brainer to do yeah I gotta do it my
wife is like bugging me to she's like we
gotta go get me phones well that that's
actually why you're gonna upgrade
because of pressure from the significant
other fasho that's that's why she gonna
okay I get it I get it but uh I think
that I
don't think I don't even think apples
gonna advertise it says get the new
phone with force touch I don't think
that's a compelling reason to convince
the casual general consumer to buy an
iphone it's gonna be out the camera and
the speed the phone and better battery
life and when you were talking about the
new stylist and having forced touch I
just pictured people like jamming your
thoughts like breaking their screen yeah
with their stylist so could be a
dangerous thing to haha don't break your
don't break it like that so yes I think
it's depending on where you're on your
contract it's worth it that is my answer
okay voicemail number three trace so
yeah um this is john from Canyon Georgia
and I was definitely thinking about
getting the iphone 6s and whatever comes
out in few weeks or such number 26 or
whatever but um I know it's going to
have that post test display but how is
that helpful like what type of
technology can we use it that boy just
display I keep saying that it's going to
be great I haven't heard any examples of
how that could be useful so what do you
guys think the first touch display could
be you score thank you so I think that
the force touch display can help I do
like the whole shortcut idea so I don't
know if you've heard in past episodes
for people that are listening or just
listening force touch is going to at
least initially be used to shortcut
things for example hold on the phone
icon and instead of having to go through
the menus it could pull up directly to
voice mails that's cool let's pull up a
map you find a location instead of this
is if you use Apple maps which I know
not all of you do especially in this
room but if you use Apple maps you could
hold on to the map icon like a
destination and instead of going through
multiple steps it would directly start
directions from there those are cool
things I think other things that it can
come into play is as it gets more
comfortable to the user will be using
them in apps maybe even in games it just
adds another function another piece of
functionality to it that I think it's
going to be cool in a weird way I see it
depending on how much pressure can
detect and how accurate it can be I feel
like it's more advantageous actually on
an iPad if you're if it could do some
cool things artistically oh yeah
definitely like artists or to use ipad
yet like
to make really incredible art being able
to have the stylus and force touch I'm
sure that they will just whole new level
of control totally new level next level
control how many times we've seen that
on a marketing Billboard next level all
right let's go the next phone call next
phone call number foe hey this is jacob
from the los angeles area and i just had
a question about the apple TV like I
know it's supposed to work with a comb
kidding stuff but like like what what do
you know like any additional features
that the new Apple TV might have that
might work you know better with all
their devices and stuff um just you know
let us know in the apple byte thanks
again Olivia show goodbye guess what we
love you so cool question of beyond home
kit what will the apple TV do I think
that you know what are the other things
can you do with it clearly it is part of
home key but not really but the fact
that this Apple watches in the equation
you know they already have revealed that
there's an apple TV remote for the Apple
watch so that you can navigate and you
know with your watch that's a nap in the
watch yeah it's an ass in the walk to
your watch the show is a physical or
like there's buns I can up down left
right and then a play/pause and a back
it's like the remote on your watch I see
they showed it off when they first
revealed the Apple watch and then they
took it off their site so it's kind of
like um wait what happened to that and
it clearly still exists exists that's a
weird thing for Apple to do yeah you
know I have never done that before I
mean I feel like they've done similar
small things where they put something up
and taking it back but and then just cuz
there oh we need to reveal that later
you know hmm it wasn't major but then
I'm like hey where did that app go like
I remember vividly seen that I don't
know I just think of Apple is such a
fine tuned you know company like how
would they make a weird mistake like
that I don't know this guy that's
harassing us and combe or n come it's NK
you
em was all up up down down left right
left right ba start does that do
anything on you know what clearly he
doesn't use Apple devices there ain't no
B or a button yeah bro come on bro
complain too much contra nintendo nes
contra step your game up if you're gonna
come to this party step your game up if
if the periscope feed drops by one
person i hope its end come that's
seriously house smells last name I'm
just I'm just pronouncing it someone has
the giggles all right um let's actually
go jump ahead Intel sky like I've told
everyone to wait before they buy any
machines get a skylake machine okay this
newest thing Intel had their conference
over here in San Francisco is called IDF
2015 they revealed that their sky like
chips will be able to and this is for
their computers will be able to drive
three 4k monitors from one single
machine at 60 Hertz now this is crazy I
need this this is crazy because it could
be a laptop driving three 4k monitors do
you guys realize like past computers
have only been able to drive like 14 k
screen and at a lower hurts at a lower
refresh rate this I need this because
you go by my desk I have eight monitors
on my desk no I'm I'm exaggerating but I
have lots of monitors to watch lots of
stuff yeah so yeah I need this and yeah
this would be awesome this is gonna be
this is super cool that's a lot of
processing power I mean I'm it's your
that laptop is probably getting really
hot it might melt if you didn't have
like lap sores from your laptop before
you might after that gonna have burn
marks yeah yeah yeah uh another kind of
fun story not sure if you heard about
this or not kind of in the Apple world
Major League Baseball initially banned
Kansas City's royal manager Ned Yost
from using an Apple watch at games now
here's the ironic part they actually
gave him that Apple watch as our gift
for being the American League Manager at
the all-star game so Major League
Baseball gave him this watch and then
said you can't wear the Apple watch at
baseball games it makes total sense to
me i only understand why because you
could send people information on the
watch from the dugout okay why not but
okay this is good point very good point
Stephen he didn't he said he didn't even
have his phone near home in fact he
reiterated that when it's away from your
phone it's it's a watch it's just a
watch yeah but it's like a monkey we
know how sneaky professional sports
teams are like the Patriots wait who I
honestly I feel like the Patriots are
one of the most honest organizations
because they have when when faced with
these accusations they have admitted
them okay therefore they are we filming
when they were filming they had guys up
in assam's filming practices and see the
only ways so you could do the same thing
with Apple watch sen send the coach a
message like a plain message on the
Apple watch hey we need to pitch this
guy inside you notice an anyway hold up
it's an unfair advantage I mean I'm just
thinking okay players can't have watches
right can the kids cannot cannot cannot
at all so okay you realize that so if
someone was sending the message that are
you saying like an observer out there
watching like a scout would be like tell
the manager like yeah you gotta do this
that's what you're saying so yeah I mean
like strategic things that there could
be yeah they like you know in any game
you really are given credit for figuring
out within the game not with someone
influence it like a head coach has to
make decisions on the fly right yeah I
mean it's going to be used for evils
what I'm saying any type type of
technology gets used for evil so I think
it's best to ban them in sports I mean I
can see it for football because they do
put like you know they put the whole
playbook on their arm yeah right yes I
could see it I wonder if football what
allow it if they would allow that to
happen you know I'm saying I mean they
shouldn't be playing dude football
should not be playing with an Apple
watch yeah I think like the one one
single tackle it's all good though Tom
Brady destroys all of his phones after
every couple months so you know but it
is a very interesting discussion so the
resolution was that the mate that was
that Major League Baseball
then rescinded and agreed to let coaches
and managers where Apple watches not
players what they did allow them to wear
them during games as long as they were
not being used for any communications of
any sorts the best part the best part
would be if like they were just sending
like hearts to each other they were
doing the pulse there's like like during
mid game there's like tapping two
fingers on their sending like a pulse or
drawing like everyone's drawing like
Wiener pics on their you know their
Apple risk because for the for the
drawings and you're like dude what do
you guys doing I'll be watching like
highlight reels of people winning the
World Series just to get inspiration
it's like on your risk yeah during a
game like right before you go up to bat
yeah yeah watch like watch like some guy
hit a home run and win the World Series
like who did that someone did that on
the Red Sox a long time ago really like
he got pumped up and then he hit it or
used to me no I'm just I'm trying to
think of a guy who did that in real life
you're totally making this like Kirk
Gibson when he would like the hit like
are they not in the ninth inning yeah
the Dodgers made 2 a's with that as I
saw that life was crazy did you really
he was limping I mean I was right yeah
he was remember he was injured his arm
like oh my gosh when you're a kid you
don't realize how legendary that whole
thing was it was age right yes legend
it's like something they're gonna play
forever and ever yeah okay final story
of the day ladies and gentlemen for
those of you hanging out with a swatch
grabs the one more thing trademark as an
apparent poke at Apple now this is this
is really crazy so Apple does not own
the trademark one more thing in fact if
you watch their keynotes over the past
few years they have stopped saying one
more thing they really have they haven't
done it very often huh if I recall right
I don't think Tim Cook has Tim Cook said
one more thing I think I think he has
and was very exciting when he did I
forget what it was that was like was the
Apple watch was the Apple watch me maybe
it was within the last two years he did
it and you're all like oh my god he just
one more thing like it was light right
it was a big deal right I'm totally
sometimes the stuff becomes a blur to me
anyways this will discover my patently
Apple the trademarks one more thing and
swatch one more thing get it like watch
one more thing were filed in November of
2014
by the switzerland-based company
published in may swatch trying to
trademark apples phrase that they never
trademarked one more thing that's funny
and they're kind of doing this because
apple is encroaching on their territory
making a SmartWatch swatch is like what
the hell even kind of looks like an
Apple watch yeah it's just like trying
to there's smart swatches SmartWatch
that how hard is that to say swatch
SmartWatch swatch much more say it five
times fast swatch SmartWatch smart I
can't do it I can't even do it twice
swatch marxuach swatch SmartWatch hold
on swatch SmartWatch I got it I got it
okay if you guys call in the number if
you're still listening to podcast you
calling 1-800 61 62 63 8 and you can say
swatch SmartWatch five times really fast
clearly I'm gonna the first person who
does I'm gonna give him something yes
and don't record yourself and like /
don't cheat call in we want to hear say
your name so that we know who you are
we'll show you love schwhat so watch
SmartWatch swatch mark much it's really
hard so are its not even easy why would
they trade mark down that seems like a
waste of money who's saying swatch smart
one no no no no no no no a watch one
more watch one more thing that is like I
think that's like a patent trolling
nurse it is it similar it is is the four
it is a total form of trolling and it
weighs good luck with that we will be
swatching how that all resolves itself
00 on that if Tim cut if Tim Cook does
ever say it you'll have to pay a license
for you right to swatch yeah I think Tim
Cook's you get back at them and say say
some stupid pun right yeah like we're
swatching your every move what have you
said in Spanish uno mas swatching uno
mas thing I don't notice a thing in
Spanish sir even I don't want to try I
don't want to offend our vendor user
base with making up words from a
different language it's just horrible
all right um I think that's gonna do it
