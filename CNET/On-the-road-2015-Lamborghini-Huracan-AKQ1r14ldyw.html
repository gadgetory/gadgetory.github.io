best-selling Lamborghini ever and it
replaces it with a major leap forward in
technology and demeanor let's drive the
2015 Lamborghini Huracan and check the
tap when Lamborghini set out to replace
the Guyardo they wielded a lot of new
and improved technology adaptive
electronic steering magnetic fluid
adaptive suspension blessedly now a dual
clutch instead of single clutch
automated gearbox an Audi Quattro
related all-wheel drive system a
dramatically new LCD instrument panel
and a body with clean subtle
aerodynamics not obnoxious cutouts or
powered rear wings as Lamborghinis go do
I actually find this vehicle understated
and elegant notice there isn't one of
those audacious wings powered or
otherwise nothing they just did it all
with body speaking of that body the old
structure of this car is a composite of
some carbon pieces some aluminum pieces
a lot of sandwiches and blending of the
two it's not a true carbon tub with
aluminum subframe instead it's a glued
and riveted sandwich of the two
materials especially at the cowl and
down the spine Lamborghini calls this a
carbon hybrid blessedly conventional
doors do you really need this and then
you've got the glass cover on the engine
which is beautiful and clean but no
that's an option normally you'd have a
busier set of louvers there that's the
best $7000 you'll ever spend now inside
the Huracan things are decidedly more
modern than the Guyardo it replaced look
at that instrument panel it's a 12 inch
side to side all LCD driven by an NVIDIA
Tegra processor you've also got another
LCD over here that's a fixed set of
engine gauges now back to the main one
interesting behavior here you can have
sort of a split screen where you have
instrumentation on the left and you've
got your infotainment interface on the
right hold a button here on the wheel
and then you go into a full screen of
your Audi inspired MMI you'll recognise
and have seen that before
hold the button again and now you go to
a full instrumentation layout hold
another button and that can go between
full attack and full speed Oh
no other interface quite like this it's
also nice when you go in Reverse you get
your reverse camera right there in front
you in fact everything's in front of you
this is an interesting vision of moving
things away from the glance away center
head stack to right in front of the
driver and of course related to all that
stuff in the dash is a pretty familiar
kind of last generation Audi MMI
interface now onto the drive controls
this vehicles not like any other in that
respect either here on the wheel
everything is going kind of motorcycle
like notice there are no stalks around
the column only a couple of properly
mounted stock based shift paddles left
is down shift right is up shift instead
things that used to be on stalks are
here here's my high beam switch here is
my left right turn signal switch wipers
are over here and then down here on the
bottom here is where my drive
personality controls are sport strata
Corsa we'll talk more about those on the
road back here on the back bone you've
got a locked-down start/stop button
that's just a great Hollywood theater
there and of course what a supercar be
without cool titles to play with and
here's a rack of those for things like
windows hazards and most importantly on
this guy
the optional nose lifter under glass is
the heart of the Beast the 5.2 liter v10
naturally aspirated no turbos no
supercharger they do it the
old-fashioned way
0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds that's what
happens when you get 602 horse notably
though only 413 pound-feet of torque
this guys are ever not a puller
now while this engine breathes
conventionally it drinks via 2
technologies both port and direct
injection something a number of
automakers are doing more of lately to
optimize fuel delivery across the entire
rpm and load range 7-speed dual-clutch
automated manual gearbox is very
different than that Guyardo we had which
had a single clutch automated manual and
was on the bulky side this promises to
be much more refined oh by the way if
you care the mpg is 14 20 on this guy
that's actually not bad the days of
single-digit mpg
supercars are just about over
almost immediately
I notice how this cars got a really nice
transmission
because it's a dual-clutch we don't have
all that jerkiness of the single clutch
automated manuals are known for instead
the shifts are super smooth plenty quick
of course it depends if you're in strata
sport or Corsa when you move those drive
mode zones wheel you affect a lot of
things you're going to change your
throttle mapping so you get more power
sooner you change your steering ratio if
you have the adaptive steering option
you're going to change the way the
adaptive suspension operates you're also
going to change the way the instability
control is going to dial in you're going
to change the shift points and how
aggressive and quick those happen it
really transforms a lot of things about
the car now this cars also got an
interesting set of sensors the
accelerometers and the gyros are
three-dimensional so you've got X Y and
C which Lamborghini says is really
helping them get some real dimension and
real world flavor into how they modify
all of those drive systems
you know my favorite compliment for any
car it feels light tenha it feels like
and what you feel like
you feel best one of the things you're
also hearing about this car is the
exhaust that changes when you go into
sport or Corsa
they open up some baffles and you get
this nice back crackle beautiful sound
now there are some Lamborghini quarks
that make this car that I feel you have
to live with I don't quite fit I'm lean
way back and my knees are all bunched up
the other thing is when you get a
windshield this rakish and cheeki you
also end up with some great big a
pillars that really get the way of
tackling corners
okay let's get you all budgeted to buy
your Huracan two hundred forty-one
thousand dollars is your entry point
with destination now we got to add a
handful of things to get it seen that
style adaptive steering is 2400 the
adaptive suspensions 3400 navigation is
an awfully steep $3,200 rear cam you're
gonna need it that includes backup
sensors nearly 4,000 the nose lifter
will save you twice its price the first
time you find a curb that's sixty nine
hundred dollars and the glass engine lid
I love it seven thousand all inward
about two sixty eight but who's counting
this is a very liveable approachable car
that is also extreme when you want it to
be but not when you don't it's a very
interesting story and I see it bubbling
up all over the supercar market and
perhaps nowhere expressed better than
right here
