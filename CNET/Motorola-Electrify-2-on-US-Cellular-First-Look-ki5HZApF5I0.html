and today we're taking a first look at
the Motorola Electrify - for US Cellular
shipping now for one $99.99 the
Electrify 2 offers a sleek thin look
Android 4.3 manwich dual-core processing
and a big bright screen the screen uses
Motorola's color boost technology which
pumps up brightness and serves up a
wider range of colors than many Motorola
phones before it motorola even says it
has more colors than the iPhone 4s above
the q HD resolution display is a VGA
camera for vanity shots and video chat
unlike many Android phones there are no
capacitive or even physical buttons
below the screen instead three virtual
keys run along the bottom of the display
at just a third of an inch thick at its
widest point in weighing four point six
ounces the Electrify 2 is compact and
easy to carry I also like its silver
highlights that give the phone an
elegant look it could be a body double
too for the Motorola Droid Razr since it
has virtually the same dimensions
physical controls are kept to a minimum
with only a volume rocker on the right
edge a power button on the top next to
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the
left side has a flap which hides slots
for micro sim and micro SD cards around
back is an 8 megapixel camera that snaps
photos quickly plus comes with lots of
settings seeing modes and special
filters also here is Motorola signature
Kevlar fibre coating which I think feels
nice resists scratches and helps fingers
keep a firm grip immediately I see some
drawbacks to the Motorola Electrify 2
first the phone is 3G capable only
second the device's 1780 milliamp
battery is not removable so you can't
swap one out for a fresh one in a pinch
also unlike many Motorola handsets
including the Droid Razr the Electrify
lacks an HDMI port to connect it to HD
TVs to be fair though I'm not sure how
many people actually use this feature
anyways I'm Brian Bennett and this has
been a first look at the Motorola
Electrify - be sure to check out our
