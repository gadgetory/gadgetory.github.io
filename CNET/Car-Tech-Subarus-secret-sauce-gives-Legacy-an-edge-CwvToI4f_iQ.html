with other mid-size sedans like the
Toyota Camry and the Ford Fusion but
then it gives you something more
let's check the tech in the 2015 Subaru
Legacy for 2015 Subaru completely
redesigned its midsize sedan legacy
model but being a Subaru it also comes
standard with all-wheel-drive and it's
got something called active torque
vectoring really quarter braking it
breaks the inside wheels during the turn
to get you around that corner a little
bit better and also optionally it's got
the eyesight system these are these
cameras looking through the front
windshield stereoscopic cameras that see
the vehicles ahead of you and work for
adaptive cruise control and collision
braking they can give you a warning
before you're gonna hit something ahead
of you now let's take a look and see
what's under the hood now here we have a
2.5 liter four-cylinder engine that does
175 horsepower 174 pounds feet of torque
but in Subaru style it's actually a flat
floor that means the cylinders are
horizontally opposed across the
crankshaft and that means the center of
gravity sits a little bit lower than a
car with an inline for sticking up for
fuel economy this engine gets to the
legacy 26 miles per gallon city 36 miles
per gallon highway those are pretty good
numbers now you can also get a 3.6 liter
6 cylinder engine same flat
configuration that does 256 horsepower
so in the cabin here we have the
optional navigation system that's it
entirely means 6.2 inch touchscreen
right here this is what I feel like a
lot of car infotainment systems are
gonna go towards is having these equally
sized icons for the different functions
we go to info and then we get
information sources they're brought in
through Sirius XM satellite radio so we
have sports scores weather stocks fuel
prices that's really useful and we also
have an eco monitor in a vehicle monitor
some useful stuff to see how the car is
performing I would go back to them so
when we go to the map here we see the
navigation system so this is a flash
memory-based navigation system it works
really fast I've been pleased seeing how
quickly I can move the map around it
refreshes pretty quickly we also get
traffic here and it'll automatically
reroute you around traffic problems and
this car has voice command too and the
voice command is really good so I can
say just a string of an address all in
one piece and it'll take it in it's been
really accurate about interpreting that
for the audio sources here I've actually
got two USB ports in this little bin
here I also have Bluetooth audio so I
can just jump in the car and have a
plane off my phone although you don't
get you can't browse the music library
through the interface when you're doing
Bluetooth audio you have to call it the
music on your phone we still have a CD
player in this car too and then of
course I got satellite radio as well so
we have the shifter on the console right
here there is also a manual setting and
now I actually have paddle shifters here
these paddle shifters are standard on
all legacy so that's actually a nice
feature takes you through six virtual
gears on the continuously variable
transmission those are just ship points
that they program in so you can kind of
control what the engine is doing
all right I'm driving the legacy with
the adaptive cruise control on this is
using the two cameras that are mounted
over the dashboard they're taking a
stereoscopic image of the cars in front
of me I'm set for 65 miles per hour
right now but because there's traffic in
front of me the car is slowing down to
their speed which right now is 60 and
I've seen the system work really well
under a wildly different conditions at
night time it was able to detect
motorcyclists and any cars in front of
me this thing will bring you to a full
stop so this eyesight systems really
impressive now it beeped a couple of
times because traffic stopped abruptly
and that's sort of your collision
warning but it handled at all I'm not
touching the pedals right now and it is
accelerating braking doing everything I
need it to do at any speed as far as the
driving character goes it's really a
very easy car to drive and that's the
characteristic of a midsize today I'm
the 2.5 liter engine is fine for this
car it it's enough power for everything
I need to do and I've driven this car
pretty far so it handled it well
now let's price out our 2015 subaru
legacy for this premium prim model it's
23 495 base but to go really CNET style
we want to go up to the limited trim
which has the Harman Kardon audio system
that's 26 495 base and then we add one
package that package includes navigation
and the eyesight adaptive cruise control
system that adds 2990 for a total width
destination of thirty thousand two
hundred eighty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
