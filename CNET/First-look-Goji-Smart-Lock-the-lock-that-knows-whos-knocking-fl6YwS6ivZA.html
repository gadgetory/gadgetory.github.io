first look at the goji smartlock now
maybe you wanted to get into your home
with a little more tech than just a
regular key maybe you don't want to give
up using that key though this is kind of
a hybrid technology because built-in
here is a screen and a camera and an
accelerometer the smart lock will take
your picture with a proximity range of
six feet to four feet and store that in
the cloud plus the accelerometer that's
built into this smart lock will notice
if you knock or tap and we'll send you
an alert with that picture so let you
know who's come by your door when you're
not around
but there's more than that it allows a
regular mechanical key right over here
via flip-down but you can control how
you access it with an app that's
available on iOS and Android
specifically iPhone 4s and later and
galaxy Samsung s3 and up in the samsung
galaxy line because of Bluetooth Low
Energy which this uses so you can
actually use your phone to unlock your
door as you approach it or use the key
and again you could also set it up so
that somebody has your key but can only
use it certain times of the day or in
certain days and can't use it other time
so it gives you an additional second
level of control the smart lock uses for
double-a batteries tucked in the back
and it is connected via Wi-Fi and if you
also know home networks it also uses
ZigBee and it will update its firmware
as needed automatically the whole kit
costs two hundred seventy eight dollars
and the claim you can install it within
15 minutes if you know how to take out a
deadbolt and do it yourself it's a
pretty compact kit and pre-orders are
being taken now and it'll be available
in stores next March it's a pretty
interesting one-two punch if you want to
have a little bit of monitoring a little
bit extra lock control and still have a
key I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick
look at the go G smart lock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
