as the next guy
slim windows slate cool detachable
keyboard cover that's great but the
thing starts at $8.99 and no matter
which version you buy this keyboard
cover is an extra $130 really adds up
fast why can't somebody have something
that's kind of like this but maybe cost
a little less makes a little more sense
that's why we have the HP Spectre x2
this is HP stake on the same concept
again fairly slim fairly upscale looking
Windows tablet keyboard cover detaches
attaches magnetically pop it on pop it
off here's a real kicker they throw the
keyboard cover in with it and it starts
at $7.99 so no matter which way you go
you're still saving some money compared
to a roughly comparable surface product
now there are some differences here this
guy runs Intel's Core m-series process
is the second generation of the small
surface neo standard Core i3 Core i5
core i7 so it's not going to be quite as
fast but the new second generation of
Core M processors much much better than
last year's generation I frankly found
using this in you know everyday
computing web surfing social media video
streaming totally fine didn't run into
any problems at all I have a side the
upgraded version here this is got the
core m7 so it's about 1150 and again
they for the keyboard cover in with it
it's actually a metal cover so it feels
different than the surface version and
of course it's got a kickstand
for when you want to set it that kind of
like a laptop the difference here is the
surface version has this flat panel that
comes out this guy has kind of a metal
u-shape right here it's a little bit
stiff
and here's the one problem we ran into
when you fold it down like this every
single person who came into the C net
labs to check this out was mystified
about how you get the kickstand out and
once they discovered the button over
here it was kind of stiff and hard to
use you like that and then you got to
reach down here and wrench the kickstand
out so that's sort of the only the only
sour design point in this otherwise you
know fairly nice system that does almost
everything you want from a surface and
cost less and they give you the keyboard
smart idea Microsoft I'm Dan Akron that
is the HP speck
