test these iPhone underwater cases we're
gonna start with the beach boy which is
20 bucks right 20 bucks this is a twenty
dollar case we have the iPhone five that
we've already tortured in here yes then
we have this kind of Voodoo Daddy from
hit case this is $90 and that's why my
iPhone 5 is basically just gonna swim
out we're gonna start with me is this
though the third one that we'll try is
the eye Jill 330 dollars yeah this is
but this is for serious business it goes
down 3d and then the one downside this
is only available for iPhone 4 4 SOT so
we're gonna try that out a minute but
first we got our gear we got our snorkel
gear
okay here's the deal ticket case
everything seems fine under there and I
can definitely operate the buttons up
here yeah okay watch right like I go
like this I'm like press the camera
thing and then I put it on camera no
biggie
and then I take it the jovian that all
works fine I can't do any of that under
the water what I had to do was basically
come up to the surface put it on video
mode and then just take a bunch of video
underwater it's for 80 bucks I want to
be able to press the button underwater
and take a picture that seems fully
functional I could do everything I
needed to do it's super convenient it's
just hanging out and I think it's try
there's plenty to see out that is
beautiful Italy fish time for round two
we have the I gills case which is that
$330 case this one is much more than
just a waterproof case it's all about
really professional diagnosis me yeah I
mean the fact that it has a whole dive
meter thing means that it's built for
much more than we're gonna use it for
today cuz we're just gonna kind of go
circling the good news is I feel like
there's zero chance that thing's ever
gonna get wet and then while you're
going for the Cadillac of cases there I
was so impressed with the little Honda
Civic the Beach Boys the Beach Boys I'm
gonna take this out because they hit
case wouldn't let me take any photos put
your own real phone and then I've linked
my own real phone
I like their hits Luke John Guidi okay
all right big bad expensive case we
dropped it I took lots of pictures with
it that seems like the best but we need
to get out there and think there's any
choice there is yeah scary looks pretty
dry see no way looks pretty dry oh my
gosh these are spectacular he goes right
to this and went to the one of me really
does we went on back to the dive van and
looked at our pictures and video I like
to call it base camp I mean I think we
had a pretty good idea on the beach
certainly in terms of underwater
performance it's the most expensive when
you get what you pay for but this is
really designed for divers and I feel
like if you're a diver
there's devices but I don't know why
you'd want to bring your iPhone in
before your iPhone into a diving well I
will say that even
Buie I got a text while those underwater
it was kind of awesome you could respond
to it I know that's true because I
couldn't make any buttons work so the
biggest bummer for me about both the
beach boy and the hit taste
maybe it's the salt water is the
conduction of the touch interface
because it works fine above but it
didn't work underwater so I was just
kind of a letdown overall yeah I think
the beach buoy is great if you're just
looking for something to protect your
phone in case you accidentally pop it in
the water you're on a boat somewhere or
whatever but as far as like taking
pictures underwater yeah it's not gonna
do the job it case video quality since
that's all I could take was pretty good
and the head case has something going
for it which is that it's an all-around
tough case so if you use it for any
adventure he's got a cool wide-angle
lens on the back and you can take it
underwater so there's a lot to recommend
this at 90 bucks
if I really had to choose between one of
these three and the one I think you're
most likely to buy reach buoy I think
for most people who are just gonna use
it wants to really want to take that
thing in the water
spend your 20 bucks wisely but if the
price is no object nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
