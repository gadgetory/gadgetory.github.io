excitement among motoring enthusiasts as
m3 I don't think so but now you've got
to say m4 let's try the 2015 and check
the check
now in modern BMW parlance a3 is a sedan
and a4 is a coupe more or less so an m4
is your lightest two-door M series car
available today and it really harkens
straight back to the original legendary
e30 the car that made em a household
word and had ruled over one now an m4 is
about a $65,000 car it's nicely equipped
but it's missing some key features to
take it's seen that style that's where
you want the executive package and
Harman Kardon audio gets you a ticket
over 70 grand let's see what it buys you
now inside the same before a lot of
things are familiar you're going to
recognize the head unit I Drive has not
changed substantially for this vehicle
you're also going to recognize the
iDrive controller note that the newer
ones have this big knob with a touch pad
on top for handwriting recognition and
directional arrows now m4 s come pretty
loaded up they have navigation standard
but notice they don't have a rear-view
camera standard you have to pay extra
for that and BMW generally excellent
voice command is a standout on this
navigation screen navigate to 235 second
Street San Francisco California
processing your input did you mean 235
second Street San Francisco that's slick
one button press one phrase and of
course you've got all the standard media
sources I can't call that anything it's
really missing radio with HD and just a
better be kind of brought in media
player source or storage device you
never want to use one thing you will
find on this car that not every I drive
unit has are these sport displays you
can get a power output and a torque
output virtual gauge up here to
compliment your largely traditional
analog gauges in front of the driver
there isn't even really much of an LCD
helper screen a small one down there but
this car takes it old-school now let's
look at the drive controls that are key
to an M car here is your shifter we have
a DCT dual clutch transmission not the
optional manual down below it are three
grades of aggression if you will for how
that transmission responds over here is
your power train button that will put
you in either efficiency mode sport or
Sport+ and down here is your steering
field that also has three grades to go
along with it now to make these more of
a macro you have an m1 and
m-2 button here to em sport modes that
are programmable to whatever combination
of these attributes you want to put
under them and an adaptive suspension is
available on the m4 it's not standard
now the big news under the hood is no
more v8 now it's a twin-turbo inline 6 3
litre and those turbos are a matched
pair it's not one of those twin-scroll
single turbos you're not going to miss
the other two cylinders 425 horsepower
here 406 pound-feet of torque gets this
rear wheel drive car up to 60 and 3.9
seconds with the dual clutch
transmission that most folks are going
to get if you do get the rare bird
manual you give up a couple tenths
you'll be around 4.10 and this is tasty
a carbon-fiber reinforced plastic
stabilizer bar across the struts just
say carbon-fiber
first thing I notice right off the bat
where's the turbo lag I think I can
actually say they've zeroed it out I'm
not detecting any especially
transitioning on and off throttle which
is usually where turbos get cloth really
flat-footed it ain't happening this is
sweet
and that gets us into great dynamics in
four directions going this way no lag
lift off the throttle great deceleration
I really like and miss that and of
course we've got great laterals on this
car for a variety of reasons but the one
that's new is that we've got a hundred
and eighty pound weight loss over the
last generation they've done it with
carbon fiber lightweight materials the
smaller engine as well as a lightweight
clutch pack all of this added up to 180
pounds reduced that's like throwing your
passenger out that makes a difference
and I defy even the most hardcore
driving enthusiasts to have a problem a
big problem with this electric steering
rack BMW knows they've got to get that
right especially on this car in some
finesse nothing
comes on like a sledgehammer that's
harder to do than just brute power and
speed in conclusion the m4 is the
essence of em nothing you don't need
everything you want m6 seriously this
car is going to come in at a pretty
steep price as you notice so if you're
not gonna track it don't waste your
money get another four which will be
very potent but not at the razor's edge
this here is what it's all about if you
know em and love it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
