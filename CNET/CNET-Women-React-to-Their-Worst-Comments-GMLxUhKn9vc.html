wrong the bad comments I get always
somehow acknowledge that I'm a woman
it's kind of weird to me because it's
like you put in energy you know like
through your fingers on the keyboard
typing to tell someone on the internet
that they're ugly
there was one particular comment that is
burned into my brain and it is so
disgusting and so graphic and what it
said was I want to spray you all over
your little vagina I felt weird I felt
really off I couldn't really work very
effectively and productively and yeah on
the one hand like I don't want to give
somebody else that power I don't want to
give a stranger the power over me to use
words as a weapon that actually affect
me because who is this person in my life
sexually lewd comments are the worst
because you just feel violated and it
sucks that it's just part of being a
woman on the internet like you can't
avoid it I was just talking about phones
unlike and then someone will kind of
bring this really disgusting kind of
image up on a lighter note I was also
called a cheese eating bimbo and some of
like the terrible ones that I've gotten
any halt needs a new career no one likes
her and she's a woman testing a car not
a shopping cart so you must expect a few
omissions but overall a good reveal oh
thanks one of my personal favorite
videos that I've ever done I was in like
sportswear and active workers I was
running around testing stuff and I got a
gift comment that said Lexy running good
lose that weight mate when I did counter
space which was all about the smart
kitchen I received comments about how
I'm doing the right thing because I
should be in the kitchen making a
sandwich one of the most memorable
comments I got was that I was a stinky
Asian so I do get like the double dick
of sexism and racism which is always
nice to have I guess one recent comment
I read are like you're so dumb I thought
gay people were supposed to be smart
I was like oh thank you you
time to realize it like it doesn't mean
anything I just kept doing more and more
videos and I kept getting more negative
comments but with almost an equal amount
of good comments essentially both the
good and the bad they just cancel each
other out
some people don't consider it like as a
form of hate or anything but I always
think about the intent and sometimes the
intent mostly honestly is to huh Millie
I've known more than one woman who has
quit being on camera because the stress
of appearing a certain way it was just
too much I think I do have to sometimes
fight to get hurt a little bit more for
my opinions I feel like I just have to
yell a little bit louder I feel like in
order to be taken seriously like I have
to go faster than the guys I have to
climb a steeper Hill than the guys I
have to get through more mud and more
rocks than guys do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
