your iPhone 4 iPhone 4s gets slower with
each passing day i'm donald bell for
cnet.com and today i'm going to show you
a few tricks to get your old iPhone
running like new the first thing we're
going to want to do here is clean house
and take out the garbage that you've
built up on this phone over the years to
get a sense of what's on here go to
settings then general and usage you'll
see a list of all the apps on your phone
listed by the amount of space they're
taking up I once had three gigabytes of
podcast stored on my phone and I had no
idea but from this page you can take
action pretty easily just tap on the
offending app and then delete it you
can't delete iOS apps like music or
photos or passbook but chances are you
can find a handful of games that you
never play and you can give them the
boot next let's clean out your web
browser go back into settings then
Safari and you'll see an option to clear
your browser history and clear cookies
and data doing both will probably knock
out some cobwebs now for the final punch
let's reset the phone this isn't going
to erase anything your apps your email
your contacts all of your content will
say exactly as it is it just takes your
system settings like screen brightness
and phone volume and puts them back in
their original state to do this head
over to settings then general reset and
select reset all settings do not tap
erase all content in settings what you
want here is the top one reset now
you'll be given two warnings just to
make sure you mean business and then
your phone will reboot with a happier
attitude towards life I should also
mention that the home button on some
older iPhones can become a little
sluggish over time our own Sharon Vaknin
has four tips for fixing that which you
can find over at CNET how to one easy
tip worth trying though is to calibrate
the home button by holding down the
sleep button waiting for the shutdown
screen to appear and then holding down
the home button until the phone resets
finally treat your old iPhone to a
little makeover take it out of its case
clean it with a soft cloth maybe whisper
some little words of encouragement don't
spray it with any chemicals even if it
looks like it just came from the bottom
of your boot just find a nice chamois
and give it a good polish now for the
finishing touch
treat yourself to a new case these
things can be had for pennies now and
they really go a long way to make your
phone feel new so there you go those are
my best tips for breathing new life into
your old iPhone for more like this check
