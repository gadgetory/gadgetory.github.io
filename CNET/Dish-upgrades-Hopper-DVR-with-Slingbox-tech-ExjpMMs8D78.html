the hip hop to the top hip hop to the
top we're gonna hip hop to the top I got
more soul than I can control today with
my friend Harper Harper you the best the
Broadcom 74 25 chipset is actually quite
a unique chipset because it has a
built-in transcoder
and this transcoder has full sling
functionality and that's why we call the
new hopper hopper with sling with
built-in sling the hopper now advances
the TV Everywhere experience available
to dish customers dish customers can
watch live TV DVR and video on-demand
content on their smartphones tablets PCs
both at home and on the go the TV
Everywhere experience from most paid TV
providers is either broken or very
confusing some require separate apps
some feature some require extra hardware
some feature in-home viewing only and
those that allow the out of home viewing
only allow a limited set of channels
with dish anywhere it's one app and very
simple it's live TV at home and on the
go it's DVR at home and on the go and
with the launch of hopper with sling
will also be refreshing the apps on iOS
and Android platforms let's take a look
at the new iPad app when you launch the
app it fills you what's on TV what's on
your DVR or even video on demand you can
launch the guide see all your channels
select any Channel and say watch an iPad
and it starts playing on your iPad once
the video starts playing you get full
trick mode functionality as well as as
well as access to your DVR content just
like you could at home so
with the new dish anywhere customers can
watch all that all the live TV and DVR
on iOS that's iPads iPhones and Android
tablets and Android phones anytime and
anywhere when they have a Wi-Fi or
cellular connection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
