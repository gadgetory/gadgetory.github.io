is a real-life paid Hollywood writer not
just some Rando in a coffee shop working
on his magnum opus uh you might know him
from such games as ratchet and clank and
he's also a creative consultant for
Hasbro we are excited to welcome TJ fix
men thanks for being here man you have
me so good um so okay a lot of people
out there first of all love video games
many many people love video games uh
love rochon clink and you you've written
retching Clint games how many of them oh
god yeah you know I have to go to IMDB
to be sure but i think it's either seven
or nine it sits up there it's up there
how great is it that ratchet clank is
back at the top of the charts again with
an amazing installment I mean oh I think
people that are playing really good what
even alive when's the first one came
down I think so I mean I think the first
one came out in 2002 so yeah this is and
this one is a sort of reimagining of
that first game so it's very cool and
it's phenomenal I mean I am loving it I
just got my job back oh nice did I may
get back on gas bar um so I have a film
and there's a film yeah great Josh and
cleaner are big and back and ready to
rock this weekend the movie comes out um
but I want to a lot of people really
wonder what it takes to be a videogame
writer because i think that sort of a
job that like has a lot of mystery sorry
yeah because at in early days of gaming
there was just sort of like well let's
just have our producers kind of come up
with something we'll have some bear
coating our programmers come up with
something let's have a sort of basic
thing and then you ended up with you
know the end of ghosts and goblins where
where is this orly you know I got to the
end of ghosting that's true nobody ever
did that um but and now we are seeing
very much so in last you know 10 or 15
years of video games we've seen really
screenwriters people who are actually
invested in story structure for manual
things like that coming into gaming you
got into video game writing kind of in a
really weird way and it's one of my
favorite stories of starting in that
industry and I like can you tell our
viewers because I think they'll join as
much as I did yeah sure I mean I came
out to I came out to Los Angeles with a
degree in computer animation and hopes
of writing and and the the dribble
animation was very much my safety fall
back because I knew the odds of becoming
a working on Plan B are you exactly is
that they're astronomical so I ended up
out here simultaneously like writing and
trying to develop like a 3d animated
show by myself one person in the room
which is which is well I said it because
it's impossible I'm not saying well with
me I'm saying it's impossible to do so
after like two years I've done almost
nothing done and I was um I was working
at insomnia games as a QA tester and
this was on back in the resistance fall
of man days back with a ps3 I'd just
come out and my contract was wrapping up
I'd sort of finished the game and I was
going to leave and I didn't have any job
lined up afterwards I had an agent I've
been taking meetings I've been trying to
get my scripts up but like nothing was
hitting so like I was looking at a bank
account ID two hundred fifty dollars
left in my bank account I had no backup
plan I think a lot of people don't
realize as a QA tester that in gaming
like you don't stay at the company
usually when you're done testing that
particular game like you're on a
contract and when that game is done
being tested you are also done yeah it's
a contract job you know that going in
and so so like it's so like I finished
the game and it was very much time to
say okay you know so long and thanks for
all the fish sure and I'm at and I was I
was packing up my desk and I did I was
unaware of the time but the writer that
was on rachel klein tools destruction at
the time for whatever reason it wasn't
working out between him and insomniac so
they're gonna part ways but he had
somehow read some of my scripts and like
we've talked to the hospital but I'd
show him anything I guess just the
script sort of get around in this town
Wow and he's like I'm sorry that I
didn't work out but actually i read that
guy stuff and it's really good you sure
like film specs procedure these are gasp
excerpts that I'd written and apparently
he'd he'd read some woman he recommended
me so as I'm packing on my stuff eh our
director came out to me and asked if I
would come back on Monday an interview
for the job as a writer Wow so I spent
that entire weekend unemployed you know
two inch of those of a bank account like
talking to my parents but how I'm going
to be able to basically have to move
home and figure out my back in New
Jersey I couldn't even afford the move
so I wasn't sure how is how to get back
yeah uh and monday i came and
interviewed for it they gave me the job
and i think i started like on wednesday
so that was that's incredible and you
know a working writer ever since yes I'm
not say no but yes yes ever since uh
yeah and I stayed in something for a
good long time I think was like seven or
eight years
is and then I moved on in 2013 now I've
been sort of contract mostly doing a
feature work but doing of course the
Hasbro stuff as well so what is the
difference between writing for
interactive entertainment as opposed to
writing for films and TV I mean it's
it's it's a totally different ball wax
it's super interesting i always tell
like writers who are coming in like if
you ever want to sort of see what you're
made of like boot camp is like video
game writing is boot camp essentially
because imagine hiring everybody at once
the director of the actors the
production team without a script ready
just saying everybody go all right all
right I'll catch up exactly so laying
down the track space is the train is
coming through wow so it teaches you to
be agile teaches you not to be too
precious which is a big like it's tough
for a lot of writers taste the idea that
they don't just submit a script and it's
just mad you know like sighs I've never
finished but I think it's more it's more
so video games where nothing like you
can write the perfect third act twist it
is the example it was usually write the
perfect third act twist in the designer
can come up to you like but I'm so sorry
we just cut that level yeah oh can you
just make it work like yeah sure love
this right now see no no we don't have
any more any more time for scenes just
make it work just find some way of sort
of tying it together my question to you
about that because as a player you you
feel that right and I wonder if you feel
like games need to get to a place where
that is more valued like the narrative
experience is more valued and and
there's a shift apprised as far as 12
video games are made right to say like
this is a great script let's make it
into a game like this is a great game
script or great you know sort of
synopsis or log line for a game like
let's make it that I think I think there
are I think nowadays there are studios
that are getting more and more story
conscious like if you look at a rational
with like ken Levine oh whatever
Bioshock if you look at what Amy honey
did with the Uncharted series there are
more and more students who are adopting
that philosophy yeah but production is
always against us like there's always
gonna be something this happens if you
pursuant to a small degree accept it
starts with this is the story that yeah
starts with a scrub but like with with
video games it's always going to start
with the tech so if a video game studio
finds that they can do 0g really well
well guess what kind of game you're
ready you're a space game dad if you
have a great zombie game sort of luck
that's so interesting to me about it's
like well we have this really great we
developed this really great technology
gee like let's craft a game around it
and it's like like I said it's a
mechanic something that we've developed
and it's like man we have to use this in
a game like let's make that work well
look so interesting look at portal like
like portal is the best example that
portal had one mechanic right which is
this week and it was an amazing Academy
no I try they built this amazing story
around it was like all set in one
location with like one you know like 110
gigantic yeah and it was amazing so I
feel so like you know it sounds when you
lay it out doesn't sound like the ideal
way to work but it's very much the way
that the entire industry operates into a
small other great features and you just
learned to deal the end and it that's
what you need to learn as a writer
regardless of about you going to video
games we have to learn not to be
precious well I like your work with
Hasbro is probably from the same vein
because you start with a an IP right you
start on send and you have to build a
world around that exactly that's the
thing that I love doing the most like I
like when people ask me if I'm a writer
I always sort of say yes I read a bit
i'm also a world builder because there's
something fun about not just building a
building I like a three-act story but
saying here's how the world works here's
how the characters interact with each
other that's really really fun so to get
to go into Hasbro who has all these
amazing IP like transformers and GI Joe
and micronauts and like and get to sort
of play around with that figure out how
it can all connect like that that's
that's really cool i feel like i feel
kinda like Tom Hanks in Big when I say
toys it's gay it's like tie it all
together yeah it's cool and you know
like they give me lots of toys which is
always a plus and you know yeah now you
um mr. zircon is I think one of my
favorite Oh evil robots know many favor
of a lot exact lattice you've got feel
like I've really do I love evil robot HK
47 I mean I just really love them in
gaming and so mr. zircon also a favorite
but it can be really difficult i
remember we're talking about this the
other day it's really difficult to
continue to come up with you one liners
oh yeah he has to constantly have these
you know quips in the game as you summon
him and it's like they have they can't
be too repetitive yeah so over the
course of however many rich 729 Ratchet
and Clank games like how many why isn't
mr. zircon would you say you've written
easily 500 easily but and probably
closer to a thousand under start
thinking like what probably what made it
into the game right
funny thing with like mr. zircon was
that like when we first started him he
was just like a little bot that would
sort of fly around you and he didn't
look he didn't look like he did now he
looked what we call a consumer by just
one of the bots that sort of fly on the
levels they did snap with your range and
I have to concur editor Brian I'll guide
for this was brian l guy my creative
director was like you know something
like we can give personality to this
thing so let's give it a name it's
called mr. zircon we're gonna overhaul
its looks at what would you do with it
and I was like what if he just thought
everything was stupid what if he let me
talk to the third person and he'd any
trash talk but it was just in the most
like obvious like sort of chuck norris
style yeah yeah t like all mr. Zhou is
bored exactly or like mr. Khan doesn't
need nanotech to survive because on the
fear of others are calm will punch you
in the face with bullets like I mean
yeah real zinger yeah he will give you a
concerto of suffering it's something
like that that way you're right it it
looks dumb and when you recording like
that sounds dumb but let someone when
you get in the game you're like that's
actually yes worth it works but it's
really funny I became like this fan
favorite ever since so so I you know I I
take it as a source of a great pride
that it's become this big you know uh uh
weapon in the game that I don't think
they would do a wretch like it but that
one else kind of the groover try now the
people yeah people just expect it this
is a CNN with the characters yeah yeah
it's personality so you you came into
the industry and such a roundabout way
what would you say is your advice to
people who want to get in starting QA
and then just hang around I just
secretly drop scripts next to the right
exactly and hope there's your bank
account yeah yeah well I gave the thing
that people do incorrectly is they go to
school for I can get like a degree in
Game writing and they apply for and they
look for game writing jobs game writing
jobs really aren't advertised online
maybe that will change and like I've
seen a couple pop up here and there but
really that like they game studiously
their hire from within or they'll
they'll reach out to people who have
representation of an agent or have done
a lot of samples but either way the
trick is to have lots of samples ready
to get a degree or some sort of
experience inside a game studio or a
computer animation agree let's say or
like a design degree because it you know
I think one of the reasons why game
studios lean in towards producers or
people who have game experience or
animation experiences because they
understand or the other departments
to really understand that process yeah
and it's a very complicated like process
with tons different departments all
working you know 60 70 hour weeks to get
this gaming so like I think when people
just sort of get a degree in writing and
just expect to go in there and pitch a
game idea all that that doesn't do
anything for against you because kids
kiddies are not it wants a lot like
they've got plenty of their ideas I can
find people who can read stuff but what
they need is somebody who understands
the different departments so if you've
got a design degree if you have even an
art degree or an animation degree you're
gonna be ahead of where just you know I
was somebody with a writing background
if I if I was had just been a writer
didn't have the background in computer
animation I don't think I would have
gotten a job because while i was doing
resistance fall of man they needed
somebody who from QA who could handle
collision or who could handle over they
call navmesh in which is a sort of
mapping out where enemies can walk i
think they've got programmers that can
do this automatically now but back in
the day yeah you have somebody yeah sit
in an office until I four in the morning
actual work yeah so like I think while I
was doing that it was sort of proving to
the people who I worked with like okay
like he's not just a writer but he also
understands she gets it yeah he
understands what the other departments
are up against so you're not just sort
of coming down from your ivory tower
saying here is my script yeah maybe so
I'm also like there's an understanding
of like when you're as you're writing
you can think of you can keep other
departments in consideration where you
say like if I'm writing something like
how are they ever going to program this
like this is not realistic you can
actually edit that down in a way that a
writer not experienced in the games
industry would not be able to do
absolutely i've since animation as well
because there's there's there's things
that like I'm dealing with like on pop
by now because I'm going to pop by for
certain animation where if you know
what's an intensive animation seeing
what's not the production team will love
you for it like I know that I can't
write all crowd scenes because Craig
exact specs really tough it's tough it's
expensive it's time intensive and
epistles animators often they come for
you with about the wood pittore that's
the one on ones in Popeye exactly that's
thing if you could write and just say
hey reaction shot well something happens
off camera it's like people will see
like okay like you understand that they
can't just flow from your head and being
considerate you're being considered the
people you work with in a narrative way
which I think a lot of people don't
really a lot of people don't grab on to
that as much as I think they
like you see things or people well why
didn't they just write a scene like this
like you know you see all these like are
you doing yeah it's like to see armchair
quarterbacks online they go well they
should have written this scene and it's
like we have to consider all of the
different departments that would have
had to have contributed to that scene
and how expensive it would have been and
you know and is that part of the budget
and is it this and it's like there's
usually a good reason for why something
didn't exist oh yeah I mean look we live
with these games for you know anyways
between one years and three years so we
with every we've had many many meetings
about every single possible iteration of
a scenic and possibly be sure but you
know like I remember seeing one common
where someone's like why aren't like you
know Ratchanok line sequence is more
like a final fantasy I'm like final
fantasy will have 500 person team yeah
we're like everything that was done that
insomniac was done in house which is
which is very rare yeah you know I like
so it yes like there are certain things
who want that we wanted to but it's
always about picking your battles and
saying okay like what is this story
really about is is there something that
we're putting in just for the sake of
flash or is there something that that we
think we're saying really matters yeah
yeah awesome i'm excited for a pop-up
movie i'll tell you i am tale that's
great I mean I haven't seen its ever
since the Robin Williams when I've been
like one of the again what am I gonna
get an animated papa I just wondered um
