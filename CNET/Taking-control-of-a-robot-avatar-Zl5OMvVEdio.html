from one place to another and then
controlling some kind of robot or
telepresence object on the other side is
the stuff of sci-fi and All Nippon
Airways wants to make that a reality
through its avatar XPrize we're checking
out a anaise avatar presentation
hundreds of visionaries voted to make
this concept an official XPrize
competition an avatar is basically an
alternative body that you possess you
put your intelligence in it your
awareness in this avatar system is a
enormous potential from mankind that's
what I believe in if I have one in the
village for instance I can have every
doctor every engineer every machinist
whatever you need when you need it could
be there this sounds a lot like the
beginnings of Skynet to me when the
Terminator war comes do you want to
fight that Terminator in your meat suit
or do you want to fight it in your
avatar body you can travel on top of
Everest
and also you can dive deeply into the
ocean fly 2,000 meters on the very same
day and if you were able to do that
through the robot went to be tempted to
do that by yourself
average mattress I'm gonna win a hot dog
eating contest of my avatar so the goal
of the avatar XPrize is a contest that
will bring all the makers together to
create a general-purpose avatar system
the whole point of our contest is to
build this general-purpose avatar and by
having celebrities or others do it it
will get across again the full concept
that this is for everyone so we finally
get to play with the robot and shaking
someone's hand through it was incredible
but then they drop the bomb on me I get
to being a robot just have no idea how
excited I am about this right now
so there's four pieces of equipment I
have to put on in order to become the
robot a giant headset a vest and two
gloves with haptic feedback inside this
is the super futuristic version of
Edward Scissorhands to calibrate my
hands to the robots hands I have to do
these strange finger exercises that will
tell the computer what I want the robot
to do we're about to start and they say
put your hands on the orbs and suddenly
I have been transported to Star Trek
okay you have nicked it whoa hello
everybody you can see me
hello the professor touches my robot
hand and I can feel it in my hands
because of the haptic feedback yes oh
wow
that's amazing then I turned my head to
the right and that's when things got
weird because there I was sitting five
feet away oh are you here I'm having an
existential crisis where am I
yeah it's strange because I can see your
hand moving when you move towards me so
I take off the headset the gloves and
the vest and I'm super bummed out
because honestly I just wanted to be a
robot all day but unfortunately the
technology to build a true
general-purpose avatar is still a little
ways off so I'll wake up tomorrow
morning and think the same thing that
I've thought my entire adult life I wish
I was a robot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
