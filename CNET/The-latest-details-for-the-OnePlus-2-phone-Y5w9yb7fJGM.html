Google issues it's everything google
that we can pack inside of a show the
one plus two is the android phone with
the biggest buzz right now especially
since they continue to announce each new
feature one by one now over the past
week we found out more information in
addition to its announced snapdragon 810
processor the 1+2 phone will bring a USB
type-c connector making it the first
flagship phone to use the reversible
connector they also announced it will
have support for a fingerprint sensor
that will add convenience and security
and recently leaked photos of what's
believed to be the new one plus two
phone from website phone arena allegedly
show off a design that features an
all-metal body with a wooden styled
backing and what looks like the
fingerprint scanner at the bottom of
that silver section on the back and in
another first from one plus the official
phone announcement is set for july
twenty seventh and it will take place as
a special virtual reality press
conference that you'll be able to watch
if you have hardware like a vr viewer
like cardboard or if you own a VR
headset set up now that's going to be
pretty sweet now one plus is also
working on their own specific cardboard
headset for their phones in the future I
know they're manufacturing a lot of hype
and attention but I have to give the
oneplus team some props because they're
doing things that no company is doing
right now and that deserves some kudos
that was also one of my favorite granola
bars growing up just in case you really
cared alright in samsung news there's
been rumors that a larger screen size
version of the galaxy s6 edge is coming
soon and now websites and mobile reports
that samsung's codenamed project 02 is
for a larger phone expecting to use a
5.4 inch or larger Super AMOLED display
with a dual sided curved design and a
hexa core snapdragon 808 processor with
physical dimensions at 151 millimeters
tall by seventy three millimeters wide
that would easily support a screen
larger than the current 5.1 inch display
and the new device will also use a 3,000
milliamp hour battery is currently being
called the galaxy s6 plus that could
change but an official announcement is
coming soon also according to a report
from business korea samsung has found a
way to almost double the capacity of its
current lithium-ion batteries making a
new silicon cathode material that allows
it to support new levels of energy
density up to twice that of current
batteries devices keep on getting
slimmer but we're not seeing any games
and battery tech and I've been begging
for breakthroughs in this area as a
priority and this could be one of them
coming down the road but unfortunately
not anytime soon + LG is also working on
their own battery tech by shipping a new
hexagonal battery shape to smart watch
makers now check this out the design
allows it to cover more surface area and
reportedly improves battery capacity as
much as 25 percent compared to
traditional rectangular batteries
according to the korea times so we
should maybe get samsung and LG working
together on the ultimate battery okay
thanks guys and in more phone use the
latest version of the google app was
updated a 4.8 last week but a new
teardown has revealed that offline
support for ok Google is on the way
which will allow you to use some voice
commands without the need for an
internet connection the android police
article reports that you'll still be
able to say things like okay google make
a call play some music or turn on Wi-Fi
without the need for any online
connection and that's pretty sweet and
finally Google and the Federal Railroad
Administration made an announcement this
week that maps will receive an update
with audio and visual alerts when users
are coming close to a railroad crossing
in their route this comes on the heels
of railroad accidents rising 9% this
past year we're not trying to make light
of this but people are getting into more
accidents because they're paying more
attention to their phones instead the
road and now it's our phones that are
going to have to tell people to pay
attention all right that's going to do
for this we show you can always email us
at Google licious at cnet com or tweet
me at brian Tong thanks for watching
we'll see you all next time for some
more of that Google issues
