here at CNET but out of those only a
handful really reset the bar every year
I'm Brian Cooley with the five highest
rated cars in CNET's
tech centric view of the showroom
through 2013 number five the Jeep Grand
Cherokee about 43 grand CNET style
editor's choice back in May of 2013
mature lines now that are more Land
Rover than Grizzly Adams it's one of the
easiest to use touchscreen interfaces in
the whole car business but with a lot of
good modern tech behind it and the GC
has real off-road ability not just
offroad in the sense of rolling over a
shrub at the mall makes this one of the
best overall packages of the year and
one you can actually afford in fact the
cheapest on our list number 4 the BMW m6
Gran Coupe pricey at about 130 grand
CNET style this guys scored editor's
choice in November it's to have it all
car of the year in many ways mPower
adaptive suspension track class handling
combined with four doors and perhaps the
most connected cabin in the world and
also I think the best lines of any car
in our list the price is kind of
unconscionable
so I'd head for a 650 i its sibling in a
heartbeat but if you have the money
this is your new hot rod number three
the 2014 Mercedes s550 all new design
110 grams t net style editor's choice
back in August in one swoop Mercedes
scooped up the s-class and rescued it
from what could have been a lardy fate
at the hands of the country club valet
space and pace still abound in this big
barn burner but so do connected LCDs
everywhere inside and LEDs everywhere
outside combined with much sleeker
styling and a full suite of apps it
suddenly feels much less like an old
man's car number two the Audi s6 and/or
s 782 $87,000 editor's choice back in
march i put these two together because
they're very similar now everyone loves
the four-door coupe the seven which is
more than i can say for a lot of
four-door coupes it's got that
inexplicably silky out ES powertrain and
drive select that transform it
two three cars Google Earth handwriting
recognition and all of it actually works
now the s6 scored equally high but in
more of a sedan package and we started
to almost get bored with Audi excellence
this year number one has to go to the
Tesla Model S about 80 grand or so CNET
style and it got to get his choice
technically in December of 2012 but I'm
putting it on the 2013 list because it
reverberated loudly throughout the year
this is the first really aspirational
electric car from a company you can be
pretty sure will be here tomorrow
I love the absurdly large 17-inch LCD
center panel loaded with technology and
throughout the vehicle clean sheet 21st
century touches abound as the only Eevee
on our list it's also the only car with
an e range anxiety and battery safety
issues perhaps need monitoring still
this was the car everybody was asking me
about in 2013 and it scored the highest
of anything we drove all year high tech
cars and modern driving you'll find that
and more at CNET on cars.com i'm brian
coulis thanks for watching
