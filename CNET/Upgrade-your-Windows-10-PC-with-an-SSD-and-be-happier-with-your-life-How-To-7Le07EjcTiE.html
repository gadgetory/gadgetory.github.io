laptop here and I just upgraded to
Windows 10 and it works fine too slow
for example it take more than two
minutes to Buddha that's crazy
also application take quite some time to
launch and browsing around the machine
can take a bit of time too basically
it's not my star of computing there's a
simple way to actually improve this
machine here's performance a huge deal
replace it hard drive with a solely
state drive or SSD now the machine here
has a 500 gigabyte hard drive but I will
need an SSD of the same capacity just
one that has more space than the amount
of space currently occupied by data on
the hard drive in this case is about 40
gigabyte so this 240 gigabyte SSD going
to be more than enough this one is also
a budget drive so it's not too expensive
either costing some 60 dollars but still
is more than fast enough of course if
you need more space you can also get a
larger SSD or even faster one so if you
can afford it now for the job here you
can also need a USB to SATA adapter this
one here costs you about $15 and it's a
$15 well spent because this kind of
adapter will come in very handy you also
need a small screwdriver here to open up
the laptop later and finally it will
need a cloning software now my favorite
is the free version of Mac reham reflec
that can get from dot-com now the entire
process can be described in one cent you
clone the existing hard drives content
onto the SSD then physically replace the
hard drive with the SSD and that's it
after that you must be exactly the same
except is much faster now on to the
detailed steps first you download and
install Mac um reflect then now connect
the SSD to computer USB port then you
run the reflec software and choose to
clone the existing hard drive onto the
USB connected drive net just follow the
rest of the wizard and then sit back and
relax or not and wait for the process to
and then finally turn up the computer
and then swap out the to drive here we
go look how good I am with a tiny
screwdriver and that's it now you can
put the O hard drive away as a backup or
you can use it with the adapter here as
an external hard drive but the most
important thing is you will notice that
your computer now is going to be a lot
faster for example this particular one
here now take less than 30 second to
boot you can also expect the laptops
battery life to be a bit longer - and by
the way you can also do the same thing
with your desktop and then after that
you can have your friends out by
forwarding them this video they will
love it you'll make that day and that's
because I'm don't walk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
