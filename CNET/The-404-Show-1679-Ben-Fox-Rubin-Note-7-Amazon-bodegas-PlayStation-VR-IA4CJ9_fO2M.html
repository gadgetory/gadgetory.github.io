it you tuned in on friday october
fourteenth 2016 this is the 404 show i'm
joined today by the lovely and slender
and 105 pounds sopping wet mr. Russ I'm
always wash just got out of a pool and
in the other corner weighing in at a
hundred and forty-three Wow keep going
up but although he just broke the fast
ladies and gentlemen Ben Fox Rubin on
the program today thank you you
thank you Fox Rubin what's up gents how
we all doing doing great ya doing buddy
lovely I have an update last week Ben we
had a gentleman uh that goes by the
sleep doctor are we on our program oh
yeah did you do the sleep talker coffee
thing got a bone to pick with the sleep
does do that though didn't work oh
no so here's the so so that he's a sleep
specialist this is a guest on the show
yeah we've been having them on for years
and years and years and last week he
told me to get the most out of my
morning coffee to wait two hours to have
it on to after i wake up two freaking
hours you know long two hours is
horrible idea it's like wow I couldn't
even do you wake up you like do baby
stuff Oh do your commute oh and then you
have coffee there yes and I guess what I
did on the train yeah but that's howdy
nice sometimes I really almost fell
asleep that's really funny it was tough
I could only do it four out of five days
today I couldn't do it yeah I couldn't
do it because I had too much stuff going
on uh you know people couldn't do it
what was supposed to happen afterwards I
was supposed to be like off to the moon
of you were supposed to join super day
that you wake up and you get this burst
of natural whatever that wakes you up
that like thing and we man is idea and
then by the time that it starts winding
down which is about two hours after you
wake up that's when you drink negative
refuel it that's what he said to end
that the improvement from drinking
coffee right after you wake up it's
pretty minimal in comparison but most of
the most of the time when I wake up I
feel like an 80 year old but I'd like
patient
like I can't even get out of bed yeah it
feels like you were hit on the head with
like a hammer right yet I feel like I
was so hungover for at least the first
half hour until maybe I've had coffee
that's what sucks about getting older
and yeah you know I don't want to make
this one of those things but getting
older sucks i was actually this way when
i was in high school I'm just terrible
awake again I was rough yeah I'm just
very very cranky in the morning and i'm
doing the sunlight thing he said you
know oh right so I open the window I get
nice southern exposure so I open the
window and there's a lot of sunlight get
nice southern accelerator that is a
sense to asset is a goddamn circus just
came out of this guy's a man if you're
looking for a place in Forest Hills I
got a nice hey whats up hows ago you
know I get really nice southern exposure
yeah Jesus sounds like a good sitcom I
guess so follow up for note northern set
in miami miami unless there's comes down
hey if you're still interested in
learning more about your chronotype yeah
i want you to go on to the website
amazon.com and you can buy the doctor
Bruce buy that book the power of when I
did not think we would be talking about
this kind of stuff on the show but thats
it now we're gonna matter what you are
cuz like you take this quiz and you find
out what animal you are yeah yeah I'm a
fox no but that's that wasn't one of the
four I feel like you'd be either a bear
or a lion usually I'm described as an
otter okay i can say that you like cute
little things bare hands and hotter or a
duck-billed platypus sure I like that I
actually have a Segway with regards to
crota types yeah and it's about the
gremlins cuz i was thinkin about this on
the walk into work today okay you guys
are familiar with the gremlins of movie
for bite right yeah I'm game for them
even though it's nothing provided
nothing but disappointment in the past
I'll buy what do you got there Russ okay
so do you remember rules the rules
regarding gremlins like what you can do
you know feeding after midnight no right
you can't like shine a flashlight at
them okay they don't like bright light
but sunlight kills them yes Oh
but the one we're going to focus on
today is the can't feed after midnight
okay so that your wife or government
that is make a big deal about the
midnight thing because if you feed them
after midnight they go from being mogwai
it's really they start as mog wise which
is what gizmo is and become gremlins
which is the nasty verbiage is most
stays am agua yeah there's no wonder the
great the rules like if someone fed
gizmo after midnight he would turn into
a gremlin is what I'm saying uh okay oh
no isn't that how the gremlins came to
be in the first place oh you're right
yeah I come out of his back yeah as like
gross weird balls yeah so if you write
so if you feed gizmo i guess so i don't
even know at that point so he's a Mogwai
he's like the mother of the Kremlin's
fine yeah after midnight but they never
specified when it's safer yeah what's he
cut off it's probably six a.m. yeah it's
my sunroom what about daylight savings
or like a concentrator nationally like
they think it's griz a gizmo from the
asian guy in the store and like he's
from I don't know somewhere in Asia and
he's got to be you know you're right
different times of night time zones ever
submit yeah so does that so the big
question is does the times only thing is
that trance I don't want to generalize I
think it's Chinese this is transfer does
it transfer over to the United States
like why is that for is it rena ch
greenwich mean time right right right
and moon related like is it like a you
know how like could be lunar base cycles
could be tied to that reminds me a lot
about kosher rules yeah it's like if you
ate chicken on a international flight is
that okay to have a cheesecake exhaust
course i don't know if you guys are
kosher my drunk Yorker sure i was
brought up very kosher so I know all
about these rules and they're like I
mean you know whatever just part of part
of my life at that so wet so at what age
did you first try bacon I may have been
in college holy to have that's like
given that's a given someone heroin it
was amazing I it was amazing no it's
it's fantastic were you were you like
this delivers I was very very mad at my
parents at that quite was like I can't
believe you if ya you've done this even
withheld this I'm actually I keep kosher
still what eight hours every day I keep
kosher okay yeah while you sleep
yeah every single day and I wake up
express 19 burger huge chicken ball I
just fast for eight hours a day it's
weird right and buried I don't even open
my eyes very pious yeah that's crazy
yeah that is that is amazing especially
since it's like Pink's are fine whatever
they're doing to hurt anyone they're
delicious isn't like the whole kosher
thing uh you know it's based off like
before soap right of course yeah like in
the food what happened with me was it
was like the zealot riva convert was the
like I just started eating bacon carlo
yeah yeah likely ninja from I get easy I
get it lean into it lean like lean bacon
yeah lean bacon yeah it's the best thing
that yeah I don't know even like I've
been eating it for 34 years and I'm
still excited about oh really oh yeah
because it's like always the wild card
to some dish you were like all week and
tonight's special is scallops way to
look at the whole table he's like wait
for it rapid bang party it's a
arrow drops what they're doing and wave
their hands eh guy comes out he's ready
falling from the ceiling he's like
that's right amber f'ers bacon-wrapped
scallop you can literally add bacon to
anything and everyone would be on board
even wear a serial go for bacon has no
business being like chocolate yeah
works it actually does I tried that
before it's quite delicious I don't like
I don't like bastardizing my chocolate
with most things yeah but how it's
amazing is there anything disgusting
that that kosher people can eat so at
least they have that win that upside
what do you mean is there like oh I mean
the urchin is gross I never actually
even see here yeah seafood i guess like
the common lobsters good good you can't
have that stuff right lobsters amazing
I'm just ki only had lobsters like a
full one so I can you have Vegemite as
if your code hello I know what is
Vegemite Australians brilliant that's
awful it's made a yeast extract so if
you hate that yeah that's what I'm
saying if you couldn't eat it it'd be
nice at least they can have like whoa we
can't have bacon but we also can't have
this thing that's gross so we're not
missing out on the most people are
pretty hilariously
unaware of anything when it comes to
being kosher so you could just lie to
them yes sir good you like sorry Kenny
it's like my color blindness I just tell
people I see in black and white it's
really fun I used to think that's what
that meant I used to think when I was a
kid there's two really dumb ass things I
used to think you think colorblind
people saw only in black and white and I
used to think a child one day woke up
and could speak like me I didn't realize
that one day before / gradual process
nope I thought one day before little
Larry was a mute and then the next verse
I Dameron evolution right and the next
day he was reciting Shakespeare is what
I thought is how it's kind of cool
25like yeah your brain doesn't really
think about it too much that's that's
fine let's I want to talk a little bit
more about your lobster things you've
never had if you've only had 11 full and
you had a full aab story I mean like
I've had lobster rolls and stuff okay
okay what's up a yellow though yeah yeah
was like it's two shelves to make it
work yes that's exactly I was about to
say i paid like $45 e to do all this
work it's I feel like I'm in the office
so here's deal uh I don't like the work
either I'll go to work on a claw give me
because that's what caused the payout of
me we're sure uh but i don't like
getting served a full lobster it also
upsets me I know it's contradictory to
me loving the hell out of lobster but
every time I like a lobster fried oh you
know baked dates you see a base there
yeah I don't like it yeah somebody's
somebody's daddy his claws yeah it's
fine it's someone's dad give me his
claws that's fine give me his tailhole
yeah give me that tail yeah but once
it's the whole body bed you're too
spidery to like Chris freaking out sharp
like as you're doing right then they
would cut into him like i'll eat crab
legs till till the end of time but the
second i see like the whole body
together yeah yeah i feel that way about
fish too is that like you know my head
some of the top grade like seafood
places they feed you like the whole fish
that yeah i'm looking at you while
you're eating him he's like hey hey stop
eating that yeah now he's okay we could
go I was swimming
you did they make it was awesome y'all
can awkward this morning this morning
but now my god display down you're just
eating that is this going to see you're
complaining about it to you think I'm
too dry just gonna throw me out huh no
fishy no fish goddammit alright a lot of
things have happened in the last couple
weeks in the wonderful fascinating world
of technology yeah phones are blown up
phones are getting canceled phones are
getting deleted from existence which I
mean I know you guys talk a lot about it
on the 359 but holy this is
unprecedented is literally unprecedented
I called this months ago you said
right for your phone one day I think
okay so when I first started happening
though I was like they need to kill this
brand right now wait to but that never
happened like phones blow up I feel like
they blow up it's not a total happen by
the time the US was stepping in and was
like we need to take this is a band like
and but they can't be brought on this
man this is a man then all of the people
that I know there's a lot of people that
like love their note 7 it's the best
phone ever reduced ba ba ba but way more
people have never used it and way more
people now just know of that brand as
the exploding phone right right and so
at that point you just need to kill it
like I don't think there can never be a
note anything again oh yes they're not
only like a note 8 yeah they're not
gonna be like featuring non exploding
technology but it's not gonna do that
but then what would they call it no
they'll just come out with Samsung
Galaxy a big phone I think they should
wait even longer to come out with the
next Galaxy like I have your set of the
essay when directly around March yeah
World Congress that's soon yeah they
they really shouldn't do anything it
just says you just like hold up well you
heard about their washing machines know
like they explode they like spit out if
you put it on a certain cycle they like
spit out nuts and bolts and stuff well
so yeah everything they make ovens
refrigerators they're like GM yeah but
this is troubling and I was reading a
story that's like yeah this is just the
first time we rely on batteries way too
much their way
to uh exploding like those lithium-ion
batteries yeah they're just taking time
bomb well that was a problem with the
with the those scooter things what the
hell are they called hoverboards
hoverboards yeah those were also like
you got on hovering hoverboard yeah bad
lithium-ion battery there's a lot of
issues with those hoverboards the with
the Samsung stuff so after got taken off
the show state they felt like they knew
oh we've nabbed this problem they still
really but initially they say much
because they started giving out new ones
that were fixed of the product so right
so they what did they think they just
thought they claim that it was like a
yeah I was about one specific yeah one
specific manufacturer I think so they
right okay okay yeah and then the new
one started blowing up just like
gremlins to the new batch yes exactly
what this is like in fact that's how
it's been explained to me the batteries
were fed after midnight so I think they
still haven't they even now they don't
really know what the problem is which is
the scariest part and like why hasn't
this happen with galaxy s sevens in how
are they gonna prove it's not gonna
happen with the SH that goes back to
your point I haven't they have a blow-up
legacy I gotta say if this is Isis you
know hats off big Bravo that's a good
move right there think Isis is you know
burning somebody else you think Isis is
infiltrating battery man you doctor
saying I've approved with anything
they've done so far but if this is their
move that's some James Bond right
there it's also like those just a new
source a deviant there in our in our
minds really how Isis just gave me a
light migraine yeah really annoying Isis
force me to back up my contact me so
that's a terrorist organization i could
get be a sensation slightly annoying
right just like a slow
a dripping faucet if you will that's
really how you get know you and I
promise you someone has written a
headline that says is this the work of
the right that sounds like Slade slate
with doing something story my guys get
on top of that slate oh man it's a very
bizarre chain of events that have
transpired but that whole thing I just
oh that's that's just bad news for
they'll survive that's yeah w it's a big
conglomerate gonna be okay they could
take a huge loss and they'll be back
with a big phone BK there is no other
phone like that on the market so yeah I
think well my phones kind of like that
then the Nexus 6p okay and how is it
doesn't have a star does have a star
just a stylist stylist stylist big
difference ya know but there's like a
special magic one oh it's got magic
powers so magical powers and look
sometimes magic powers cause things to
explode yeah that's right tell me you
guys give me your honest honest to god
opinion is the person who owns a note 7
who has not had their phone blow up who
refuses to return it because they are
convinced and look the odds are with
them that their phone will not explode
are they being an asshole absolutely
yeah okay good totally I'm glad we're
all is here putting putting them and
other people at reser I set this on the
359 that it's it's the new smoking
because you can't even bring it to
certain places right I don't think that
you could stow it in your luggage you
can't they specifically say if you have
a galaxy notes on the point every single
point I've been on since it really they
specifically say if you have a galaxy
note 7 you're not allowed to power it up
and you're being a douche but and you're
being a dude you're like who's gonna
like raise their hand be like oh sorry
everybody I mean sorry I have it it's
the TSA what do you want it's like I
just don't understand like that's like
the CP you know that the first time
someone heard about this you don't think
that maybe there's a grandma that like
whatever didn't know I don't think
grandma grandma yeah there's not a
grandma phone if a grandma owns a note 7
yeah she got the text message that said
your phones are ticking
 time Bob return it at once yeah
yeah you're probably right right away
there probably will be some diehards out
there never were think they want to ebay
it or something oh my god like you're
not allow the way are you not allowed to
recall products are not allowed on eBay
here's some other source on the darknet
till I'm not saying okay hold on I'm not
saying that you can't sell it on anybody
just not allowed to write look they
might not even get to it what can you do
like on ebay note 6 plus 1 get around
there's a 16 you could definitely like
it turned into like a black market for
note 7 trading there's got to be like a
technology museum that definitely wants
these in their stores like in their
display in like some pretty major
technology mome it is the most defective
tech product I want to say like ever I
think I was like the most infinity xbox
is probably before this yeah but it
wasn't whatever it wasn't gonna
potentially latest flight back just
turned into a brick yeah yeah people
complained about Apple maps for like a
couple of weeks right that was insane
nearly big right this is the story that
won't go away and what about the fact
that like how many they sell a million
russ 2.5 gal yeah so well that was in
the first radio throw out 2.5 million
phone Oh they've got somewhere in China
no but they're just worth it ever all
the technology to get yeah but like yeah
aren't there like rare earth minerals
Everly in phones like I'll be fine that
stuff I feel like they need to strip
them and chop them down and like I'd
turn no dates so just like harvest their
rare earth element you picturing like a
terminator like that get lowered into
molten lava and then pulled out I guess
that's what I'm picturing i don't know i
would say this that if I was the guy
that owned the technology museum I would
showcase one of the phones that have
already exploded totally because then it
wouldn't explode on me because they're
already done if I happen to be in New
York City it's already been disarmed
right if you haven't been York City you
should go to the nintendo world store
that's that's good because they have the
original game boy mmm which ran tetris
is you might know and it was actually in
the original Gulf War go for one and got
blown up or something oh wow and it
still runs
wow it's such an awesome machinery but
yeah it's like totally the outside is
like burnt to a crisp and yeah it still
runs yeah thing will entertain thing was
like a paperback novel if the sanger
than that spent a lot of time like two
hours and thickness and takes me way
back that takes me to elementary school
yeah we're gonna take a break when we
come back we gotta get to PlayStation VR
it's worth the conversation it is more
with Ben Fox Rubin on this episode stay
tuned our sponsors day is Vega coffee
once again thank you beg a call for
sponsoring the 44 show Russ Ben you sit
here in front of me we have a bag of
Vega coffee beans in front of us smell
that nice the bag he smiles and they're
good I don't drink coffee personally but
I for the people that do drink coffee
including my wife who absolutely loves
 yes that smells like the coffee
that she absolutely loves so I think
she's gonna be very happy I just tried
the dark roast I'm a big fan I like that
Jack roast and Vega coffee is the
subscription service that you can get
that is not just the service but a
movement because Vega farmers own the
entire production process they own the
whole process they grow roast and
packaged coffee at the origin in
Nicaragua I say I said that right there
by eliminating the usual middlemen so
you pay less than you would with
comparable specialty brands and get this
Russ and Ben your purchase of Vega
coffee enables farmers to earn more
income they make more money you feel
good about yourself when you do that
that the transforms their live gotta run
a complete yeah each coffee delivery is
carefully curated to bring you the most
exquisite flavors from specialty micro
lots what yeah micro lot that's a thing
that's like a tiny tiny lot every batch
is made up of one hundred percent watch
beans coffee what kind of beans oh rabba
kabine arab acha beans that are
naturally grown hand-picked and artfully
roasted by the people who know coffee
the best then they're farmers so break
up with big coffee and let your daily
ritual become part of a bigger story
that's a lot of pressure for a coffee
yeah
I'm glad they've taken that on I haven't
thought that much about coffee when I'm
drinking coffee now i will now you will
go to vega coffee calm that's ve G a
coffee calm sign up for a subscription
enter the promo code all one word the
404 show and you're gonna get that first
bag for free big thanks to vega coffee
for sponsoring the show hey welcome back
to the show Ben Fox Rubin is here what's
back I am what do you what's like the
thing you're covering lately I saw you
cover the amazon stuff what amazon did
you doing the grocery store stuff yeah
yeah yeah oh that i would like gonna
open convenience stores is that what
your time I mean you're gonna open so
later that's a rumor yeah so wall street
journal reported it so that's the head
and I know that this letter ah like
groceries like milk bread me would they
do breakfast sandwiches and somewhere
other than New York City because that is
literally the hardest thing to find what
maybe I am a serious I was in Chicago
for entire week and the only place in
get a breakfast sandwich was Duncan done
like a bacon a disgusting waiter
terrible don't they are doing a bitch
there be all seen how those work what
those yeah just so you can i drop your
other end I'm sorry they're done great
but in a pinch as a breakfast option
it's either that I would have to be in a
serious pinch but yeah I know what
you're saying and then I don't think
they're doing the real truck real I
don't think they're doing right now by
the way and I personally think that it's
kind of a ridiculous idea i agree i mean
like the bodega concept has been
overdone a million times like the whole
reason amazon exists is because they did
something that nobody else did right you
want to circumvent but i think there a
lot of you guys i think are blinded by
being in New York City so many cities do
not have bodegas or off convenience
stores like a CVS or a walgreens where
7-eleven where is it viable for a bodega
to exist where there isn't already won I
think like a small neighborhood like if
you have a residential neighborhood and
everyone just wants to pick up like oh
crap him out of milk you don't want to
like drive to the CVS bodegas work
because they make bodegas make money
because they church five dollars that's
a milk so but I'm just saying I Sun
probably
oh no like more then I'll grow to resent
them i'll just be like oh screw this
play-doh got four years video making
money off yours i don't know maybe i
don't know anything about Amazon because
the whole bodega concept to me doesn't
make any sense to me as far as what I've
been covering with the company
everything that they've been doing has
been how do we get stuff to your door
faster directly to you and stuff that's
like immediately like like milk that's
like really hard to like actually you
gotta keep it cold it's gonna be bad
quickly what is a bag thing like they do
in Canada the wad ya the milk bag in
Canada they have milk bag yeah they have
that in Israel that's dirty hi boss wait
a minute why I chocolate milk in a bag
in Israel why is the milk in a bed don't
know why it's just save on plastic I
think because it's like the bag takes up
less plastic then so cardboard cut the
cardboard well yeah harder than carton
did you for a second ok so does coming
all right it does like the wawa milk
comes in a big old place that you get a
big old jug that kind of thing huh
alright i'm i'm not sure where we've
arrived from that oh but what about the
whole like every time I go into a bodega
I'm like thank god there's an Amazon
yeah I I feel like this would be
counterproductive this would be a step
back there's a feeling they're designed
to get something in under an hour or
like fire you have five minutes you need
something something fast amazon is
designed to get something it's like a
step back for them like you don't i
would to be do only agree with you I
when I saw this thing I was like I don't
I don't get it I don't understand and
haven't they experimented with brick and
mortar stores in the past day are they
are they have like they have like so the
bookstore well they have the pop-ups in
malls but they also have just a handful
of bookstores to those bookstores are
basically showrooms to show off the
devices to show off like different books
and stuff that makes sense yeah just to
basically reinforce the Amazon brand are
also kind of supposed to be like kind of
nice looking I think that they have like
uh you know like you get coffee there
and drugs like that like when I think
bodega or 7-11 just yeah I think like
it's kind of like grimy whatever and
what if they would exams on add to that
what if they do the Apple version of
apple store version of that which is
like a clean then they would have to
charge like 10 dolla and maybe people
will do that I I think as an experiment
you do it at three or five or ten
locations and just see what happens I
don't think that's a problem yeah all
right look see how it goes the whole
point is is that everybody thinks like
Amazon's been growing it like twenty
percent revenue growth here and so like
how are they gonna keep doing this yeah
they have to get into brick and mortar
that's the big like that's a big concept
like a lot of analysts and Wall Street
folks are thinking is like well they're
going to have to start poaching into the
rock and mortar world so every single
time they open like one book store in
Chicago everybody sits up and like oh my
god Amazon's good but that's a temporary
spike I don't yeah I mean but like
nobody ever knows what they're up to
either you know like yet they let us run
our you know run wild what's the stuff
they don't confirm or deny a lot of
things they just do their own thing
they're kind of like Apple in that way
yeah yeah yeah all right there you have
it and then AmazonFresh is still a thing
too yeah that that's like put that
things are no healing they give me bags
I don't have to give the bags back it's
really i don't know you all use it i
tried it once and i was like a big bad
don't think of these bags bags are nice
they're like cooler bags so keep the
bags you can actually keep the bags but
i had to like look online i was worried
they're gonna charge me for the bags oh
yeah i didn't want to use it again is it
was more expensive than pressure right
all right i still use fresh direct i
like them a great deal yeah um okay
playstation vr yeah let's pivot right
into that let's jump right in this uh
came out this week um critically it has
seen mostly i would say positive to
average deposit yeah nothing super
glowing nothing glowing nothing to me
because the floor was set pretty low too
I unit be our world I think so I think
once vibe and oculus came out to very
tepid you know receptions I think
they've I've reviews are pretty positive
in other words we're pricing was so shy
and I think that general sort of
landscape has left a lot of people being
like oh I'll get today i 100% it's not
the world one iota right so then
PlayStation VR come comes in and is a
more accessible technology it's a more
affordable technology especially if you
have a PlayStation 4 which 45 million of
them have been sold yeah so I did the
review for Cena and I kind of like it
for the most part I think the you know
the biggest knocks I would give it is
it's got a slightly less of a viewing
angle yeah uh and the tech is not the
best known and that's not the headset
problem that's the ps4 that's just the
fact that they shoehorned VR into a
video game company i never had
intensified three years old at this
point it's three years old and that's
when it came out that means it's been in
development for God so imagine trying to
run VR on a computer that you bought for
four hundred dollars three years ago
like that is actually what I'm trying to
do you can i'll let you say that right
now let's say that though it's prime
reason for yes five then well i mean
like because we waited like 10 years
between the ps3 and the PS well and what
it gives you reason for is the ps4
programs at november so that he has for
you know about that guys are teaching me
sometimes s4 pro will play all the
playstation 4 games you've grown to love
but better at a better resolution
potentially better performance oh yeah
better they just come out with the slim
yeah oh yeah the slim is you know
different house yeah just replacing the
same thing yes they're not going to sell
the older version of ps4 anymore the ps4
pro yeah well it will run things like VR
and certain you know triple-a titles
battlefield you name it will run
theoretically better assuming the
developers put the leg work into right a
lot in you know again like the problem I
have with this whole thing we talked
about xboxes project scorpio and and
this ps4 pros they are thrown around
that 4k resolution lingo a lot and these
games the vast majority of them will not
run in 4k you talk about a resolute er
games not out now standards and yes um
plus we do 4k TV right you really enjoy
for up project Scorpio the jury's still
out on that yes a year from now maybe
it'll run a lot of games natively in 4k
we just don't know yet but ps4 pro is
only gonna have like a very yeah now
game and they'll do upscaling to 4k but
they can't run natively based on those
specs so there's no way I'll let me ask
you a dumb question there are no dumb
questions on the show runs you should
know that 4k so so I was I was looking
this up recently that 4,000 does not
convert well to the whole like 1080p so
many people think of it that's where I
get overwhelmed don't think there's too
many numbers flies are a lot of number
so even with 10 e so 1080p is 9 20 x
1080 right at nine way into 1920 x 1080
yeah uh so k is like 38 5524 so where
does the four come from 3850 or whatever
that's so there's rounding up yeah
that's like a marketing I don't like it
well that's not a big deal i'm gonna go
to the government about this go to the
cutter Business Bureau why you should
come up you know Russ you should write a
letter where's my extra case you should
call your congressperson I need at least
one more k is that what you're really
like hung up on I just say it's annoying
to me cuz 720p and 1080p were such as
precise like yeah like there but like so
they'll remember they're also remembered
for you remember it too but it's not
very consumer price of the lower number
right like so you're so the number
europe's oh ok i understand you're
saying wait it's not four thousand it's
right no number in that duo is for
castles my call me when you get a 4k
television and then there's the idiots
that think it's 4k 4000 pixels which are
like no no that's like a tiny little
square knot who thinks that because
whoever thinks that should just be
spanked yeah the bow wow ok blue wine
punch times oh so back to the
PlayStation VR you've played with it yes
what do you what's your takeaway yeah so
I think first of all I think that the
helmet the headset is the best VR
headset I've warned pretty good if it
although it does kind of feel cheap I
thinking but I think it feels more
comfortable and more like you can wear
it for longer than either the vibe or
the oculus I do agree it feels a little
bit cheaper but actually I'm sort of
fine with that because comfort is
definitely a priority for me and it also
kind of look I mean it doesn't look cool
in the traditional sense of cool but it
like doesn't look like something out of
the future with you don't look like the
predator you don't look like you've
liked vivan
oculus rift look like you made that in
your base yeah yeah and this is written
you're showing this looks like a legit
like mine or on report the hard part is
a hard way right uh in terms of games
there's nothing like life-changing in
there I think 4p I think the real who is
designed for is people that have never
used the VR before and want like a
relatively easy out-of-the-box solution
and you know it's going to run you know
it's going to run in your hardware
because the ps4 is like a set thing and
it's kind of like a you know like flip
the switch kind of VR solution now if
you've used five or if you use oculus
from a fidelity standpoint it's their
night and day definitely vr the
PlayStation VR is definitely a step down
from right because they're running on a
two-thousand-dollar computer and they're
able to do a lot more see that's why I'm
interested to see what playstation 4 pro
does yeah I was not gonna bring it up
over break what I think it'll but I
think it'll do somehow the bridge the
gap yeah I think it'll help bridge that
so the big question though is is this
the thing that's going to get people
excited about via yeah well see you some
you say no but I think it's gonna do a
way better job than the eye of the two
other guys it is not a nerdy that is for
sure I would agree with that but like
think about it like it's the it has the
best chance out of all of them is going
to sell better than both of them perhaps
combined like it's going have they
released sales on oculus or uh no I
don't know it off the top of my head
yeah they might be curious i yes or wilt
55 hurts I don't we on three I called
Palmer yeah this guy design is wearing
them all right now I feel like uh
there's just there's not a lot of people
than it that were like yep I've seen
enough I'm Bobby going to spend two
thousand dollars on no problem so I
agree it will do better it will help to
spread the word but I think it's also
going to be like it's gonna be a lot of
people to buy it and they're excited and
they'll show their friends their friends
will be well it's really close and then
it's dust it won't be like the week
phenomenon we're like people would try
it send their friends house and then
need to buy it themselves Oh totally try
it once or twice or whatever at a
friend's house and guess what it was
like on me in this office yeah when they
brought in they carded in the HTC vive
and like I played that off
zombie game yeah yeah I would actually
like to play that again but you know I
tested it out I felt kind of silly
because I knew everybody was like
watching me everything like photos that
they would be on Twitter of me looking
like an idiot last nine yeah but okay
I'm sorry go ahead but yeah it's just it
was one of those things where I didn't
like crave wanting to play it right now
which is something that you really look
for in like a really good video gaming
ryans it's exhausting yeah it's a gr is
just like it's a holy exhausting because
it's a it's a it's a bombardment of the
senses and it's not and sometimes you
have to stand to do it a lot of the
times you to stand do it which means
that it's shortens your play time it was
like I've never worn that headset for
more than 40 minutes yeah I oh
definitely not because you just you
simply you're not gonna do it all day
they should do not find a marathon we
are I think you can PlayStation VR I
think you can play predominantly while
sitting down most of the games a lot of
the network although the some I wouldn't
recommend right yeah some of them are
liked it like where you're actually
sitting down in the game world to occur
that's right but yeah I mean I don't
think there's any VR solution short of
like once they're like Mike the size of
my glasses chor babies yeah but we're
five years we're seven years from that
more removed white quite a bit right now
you think quite a bit have more than
five you think to get to the size of
your glasses that's what their hands on
like what the fidelity is but like no
you don't think they can have just a
wire coming out of the back my glasses
into like a pack that's on my back or
something I'm skeptical that that would
come in five years yeah five years yes
quick you're talking about a projected
monitor essentially on my glasses know
what what they need to do is it's not
gonna be that there when when when it
becomes the size of your glasses yeah I
think it'll be projecting it onto your
eye I really do think that oh which is
the glyph technology right oh I don't
know yeah but to me that makes the most
sense because it's like why do you like
why would you make oh yeah the headset
rat yeah do you mean yeah and it's more
power into intensive to have like
monitors or whatever it is plus if you
have upper if you have complete uh what
will the viewing I will be 360 I guess
well now you know be 360 / what would it
be and we
180 maybe some like 170 up because now
the vibe in oculus or 110 and PSV are
interesting wow that's weird when you
think about that like wooly really the
vyver I forget which one has a wider
viewing angle but when your dazing well
they both have the same ok but what 110
you really can't necessarily see the
edges super like you kind of forget
about the edges so you do but you can
see them on PS yeah you forget only 10
degrees i can degrees is nothing really
uh it's weird I've had only one game
kinda got me not sick but nauseous
 a hundred-foot robot call oh
yeah that featuring what is that yeah
this very funny yeah but that just were
we would you ask I wanted to I've been
wanting to hear about what the games are
so so that one game 104 row back off
where you are on the back of a gigantic
hundred-foot robot and make sense you
play golf but the the whole the courses
are just like the real world and you
have to like make your way by bashing
buildings to get to is the robot might
as well the robot is your golf the wrong
guy I so is he hitting the ball he's
hitting the ball you're just on his
shoulder being like you know like
tapping a million falls over there go
there guys yeah I drank again well while
the mass is a run at your feet in in
horror we obviously did not cover or
review that game for obvious reasons
yeah I understand that yeah uh people
who do the commentary work for his
company oh my killer brother's okay oh
yeah not all right it's very funny the
an egregious they are a funny Bunch um
so so there are first-person shooters to
right there so they high stays like a
heist demo ii london heist where's kind
of like it sounds fun it's fun that
would be good one it is good it is real
janky that it has one of the coolest
moments where you pick up you know the
move controller the playstation move
controller is kind of like yeah it's
like a ping-pong ball yeah yeah if you
show any way look are you loaded up
while you're and you're smoking a cigar
yeah and it has a mic and you actually
have to like exhale to like and you see
the smoke yeah that's great there's some
songs I'm trickery there
legit creepy vertigo while playing
there's a demo where you get lowered in
a cage and you see like animals swimming
around and I was like that that's I was
very skeptical but like I felt the only
other time I felt that level vertigo was
when I was snorkeling so like even
though it is the fidelity is not quite
there it is close enough to kick in my
phone like I thought a doubt and I don't
want to like under sell this thing yeah
you get jacked in like it for me and
I've played I haven't played oculus a
lot I'll admit that but I've played
hours upon hours of HTC vive yeah and
that thing doesn't do any more like
places me or doesn't give me less
immersion than that mmm I'm i buy it
every time I'm in there it might look a
little blurry or am I look a little more
pix elated but I'm buying it like I am
believing what I am saying I have a
question and there's not there's a
there's no noticeable lag or anything
like that to their kid be because your
brain would fart out if there was it
just wouldn't just wouldn't do it okay
someone comes to you les Moonves comes
to you oh you mean like every day among
every right every year like she knocks
on door he's like Geoffrey you've done
this before where he's showing up my
door but go out every the character know
he's a reoccurring here is a million
dollars in a sack it's it there's like a
dollar sign on it right but you'll wear
a HTC vive for 30 days straight you
can't take it off we're constantly going
yes yeah without yeah I don't think your
brain would melt okay so it's a
Hollywood actually but my family needs
that yeah like I knew that how long
would you be willing to go for four
million dollars of the month sounds good
30 days 31 days and I tell them to gear
to go so there is a limit right can do
after a year you would probably have
like some sort of light you happiest
yeah I captivated that's probably like
the month would traumatize me but I feel
like I'm nothing to her back from an
actress years like all just vegetable
he's gone he's all gone and you have to
wait John simulator the whole time
you're just like so so we go on with the
rules so I can't ever see the outside
world happy acres
I'm a going into the bathroom yeah want
to sleep so that means when you sleep it
can't turn off but you can play
something like the space game where
you're in space and just floating around
so at least it's darker so you shall I
say now I'm not so here's the deal is
this anyways i'm also considering like
the really effed up social ramifications
of this so your baby doesn't know your
face anymore like I won't see him for a
month yeah it's terrible well someone
could program your baby into a VR game
and then you can see yeah I God if this
was a are it would get a very fine like
a sweaty does have a are but i Doan
blocking that you're not allowed to use
a your dick um yeah I don't I can do for
a month like million hours to do for a
week a week a week or anything oh no
it's a fourth of all of you 40 bucks for
a week what how is it and then the last
three weeks are worth a million unless
min resident let's do it man yes I'd
have to do it but it would really be
upset i would try okay actually so i was
at an AI conference about a week ago and
i met a guy who was wearing the hololens
the microsoft hololens did you put the
past like five months he's just been
walking around with it put that dang it
out as a are it is a are it's also a
still kind of an interesting comment
that technology any better now because i
don't know my dog which was III it was
pretty that i think he was so he's a
professor in florida for like new media
professor and i'm trying to test it out
he wanted to see okay what are the
capabilities what are the limitation it
over five months to test it out he
probably could have been a really
interesting to me though it's a thought
it was you know because he's really
trying to be bleeding edge about it and
she's like can I live in an AR was no
software for it yet so like what is he
even seeing like he would open up like
software elements and be like oh there's
a cat in front of me or I can open up
like a menu and stuff and like he was he
would show it to other people who would
take it off and they would try it on and
a lot of rosettes hey I know but but a
lot of the lot of the hand gesture yeah
are not as intuitive as you would think
there would be like you would have to
pinch with your fingers chair to move
the screen up and down different things
like that so you don't just put it on
your face and you in
immediately know how to use it like I
would say with certain other products
smartphone so that makes it a little bit
more challenging to yeah I yeah I don't
know what whether that pro like it needs
to be that needs to be like super small
and like even then I don't know who that
it's tough but yeah we're just that
we're just scraping the surface of the
stuff Thanks yeah you know I was very
cool technology I just like i watch that
that Facebook oculus press conference
yeah I'm just like not like having a
virtual conference feels like a 1995
like technical be like yeah that's not
even a thing I'm excited about is it any
better than doing it via video like a
vision I'm sorry I don't see what the
it's more uncomfortable yeah I swear
friggin helmet to do this that sucks
yeah and there's more tech to screw up
half of the video chats that you try to
do in the office get screwed up I've to
begin what I wonder what we'll look back
at this like like what in 10 years are
we just gonna be like to what is really
thought we were like oh there's gonna be
a thing I actually yes maybe gone it
might be it might be I think people are
pretty skeptical of this idea of like
really immersing themselves a little too
much in this stuff yeah I think that
we're already seeing some pull back from
from an etiquette and from a social
perspective on smartphones that we spend
way too much time staring into our
smartphones we're not having really like
a conversation yeah but like
smartwatches are just the continuation
to me it's just another screen to lie
here yeah you're right but they are one
of the core tenants the reason why
people use them is that they allow you
to glance down and then look back up
rather than being like heads down and I
guess so there's your wrist then this is
the longest conversation I've had all so
I mean time fill it is not on pocket
four minutes long there's we you know
we've been doing fine all these years it
has happened hey we survived for like
120 episode no way more than I thought
it's a lotta that's like three hours
worth of podcast right
that's like one of our shows good few
days hey thank you very cool stuff um
all right is there anything else you
want to talk about before we say goodbye
I don't know man we covered a lot of
bases here no we did i'm excited this
was a very very productive program today
yeah we really we felt that we did a lot
of things we hit our home run down that
we plan very specifically oh you didn't
talk about the election once we know I'm
pleased by and that was not an intro to
talk about the other of course not too
so are you guys are you guys getting
into the halloween spirit of things
yours you don't rust doesn't like it too
much of a hassle oh it's totally awesome
i have twin babies at homes right trying
to figure out it'd be fun what are we
gonna what we're gonna match them as
like salt and pepper or catenin by they
can what are the sexist of the babies
there are they're identical boys to boys
yeah so I don't know you could do like a
Fred Flintstone Barney Rubble situations
yawning Garth Wayne Garth waning ours
would be that feels like a lot of work
but sure yeah don't use joining ZB
Aerosmith had a onesie yeah but the
twins language yeah i mean i would say
if you you could dress them as the
creepy twins from the shining but those
are no no no I'm anti creepy twin stuff
I'm trying to you know like that's not
cool here's Wednesday be kinda creepy i
don't want okay no you're not creepy not
that creepy looking at oh that's not
creepy that's just confusing um so so
there are rules about halloween like you
you have to be scary no that's not true
I be sexy can but I don't like that I
think in bone stuff I'm sorry yeah sorry
yeah so usually hurt oh Jesus we are the
only problem I have with the whole can
bone thing he did an ama as I up a
spigot it's time to bone down guys
clearly because our right how was the
most uh the highest voted question for
mr. ken Bohn how was this not is first
the first question which would which
should have been how are you still
undecided actually did answer that
question
needed to be number one why was that not
something on the lines of undecided is
not uh leaning towards one way or
something which I agree is also kind of
ridiculous but like I don't know I think
a lot of those people in the audience
were like oh yeah sure I would be able
to ask a question yeah that's what I
said about the the Muslim woman they
were like how can a Muslim be undecided
at this point like that's ridiculous it
seems all seemed miraculous I would have
also started throwing out like math
problems to them just like see what
happens be like what's the square root
of all trains are going at 60 miles
around oh that's right there he would
break his brain that's not bad oh yeah
how was that question not proposed to
mr. bone blows my mind that guy is
making to have a chick him is ibaka mom
like once you know like the internet
manages to like blow people up like as
far as I can make him famous all of a
sudden be but some people really embrace
it in this guy like when nuts over it he
uh I'm he claims he's giving a lot of
money to charity or is he getting money
from well he's younger he's getting no
sponsor yeah you got an uber sponsorship
and he's getting another one he said ten
percent of everything he gets is gonna
go to a chair good for him so like I'm
talk again again like you all what your
charitable I still undecided like what's
I just don't get any has a good sense of
humor which I like oh yeah good on the
internet before yeah he knows what he's
doing some time on the oh there's plenty
of people on the internet that have no
such that you were about themselves so
well done yeah he's doing it the right
way good for you sir um alright I think
with that will say goodbye and thanks to
ben fox rubin for joining us where can
people follow you on twitter facebook
twitter is my handle is ben fox rubin
you call you on facebook as well yeah
yeah I have a journalist page so it's
facebook.com / Ben Fox Rubin yeah I'm
just booked in about three weeks yeah
it's good for you 30 it's been the most
cleansing experience telling you man
analogy is the worse it's bad I like a
lot of it don't get me wrong but it's
also the worst come become a little to
consuming it's the best and worst thing
that's ever happened to humanity mm-hmm
that's well put i mean that i would say
alcohol but ok we'll go with technology
a birthday cake icing the more than a
more the internet than anything else uh
and Russ fresh dick we will see you soon
as well anything you want to promote
real quick yeah working on history oh my
god yeah working on a history of to my
brother's too which is very exciting oh
that is a very I like that but do you
know you know the story about that right
now so super mario brothers only watch a
video well I'm and you guys obviously I
into way more detail but that game was
never intended to be a mario game yes
they basically snow Mario on top of
whatever the fellow is called doki doki
yo me cojio doki doki panick in japan
right now inspired by a carnival
inspired world's fair that was held in
japan in 1987 and the mascots of that
became the mascots of doki doki panick
and eventually became super Mother's do
and that's why it's so weird it sounds
like this guy in Amazon single I hope
you turn this into a biosensor you've
played that game I'd like remind me with
the primaries have been shaken
vegetables out of the ground and you
drop like a whore so weird were you ever
like hmm this has nothing to do with
anything they're brothers either I
thought it was really creative I never
stopped to think that it was super
different than the other one is like
well it's only really the second big
campaign games you're like I may just go
to different direction this one I'm okay
with that what funny is that they made
it so different that they needed to
justify it so it's actually all Mario's
dream so they justified it that way at
the end you see at the end you realize
oh it's his dream oh that's why it's so
weird but then you think the original
game should have been a goddamn dream to
be eating mushrooms and turning giant
going down pipes yeah that's weird too
it is but it all ties into the whole
plumber ecosystem though does it he's
unclogging those punishment I plumbers
and turtles a real relation coming right
sewage problem sure you know it's all in
the boom-boom what are the way Oh
