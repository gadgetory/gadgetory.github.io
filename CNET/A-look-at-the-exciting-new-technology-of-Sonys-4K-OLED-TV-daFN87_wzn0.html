in Las Vegas I'm taking a look at sony's
4k OLED television now 4k is a very
exciting technology we're going to see
more of these extremely high resolution
panels popping up in living rooms across
the world and OLED is also very exciting
it's a display technology there's
currently most popular in smartphones
but when you apply it to a panel this
big you get something that looks really
really fantastic and I'm pleased to say
that indeed when you merge these two
exciting bits of display tech you get
something that looks really gorgeous
this is probably the best-looking
television I've ever seen in my life
the detail is fantastic the colors are
amazing
you just get something that looks
absolutely wonderful this particular
unit we're looking at is a 56 inch model
because it served 4k resolution is 3840
by 2160 pixels which is absolutely lows
and it really really comes through in
the detail that you can see on this
television the bad news is that this is
totally concept this is not something
we're going to see on sale for a while I
also need when we might see it popping
up in shops and they told me eventually
so that's the bad news though there's
really no firm release date and you can
be sure that when it does eventually
make its way into high street shops it's
going to be extremely expensive still
this is an excellent indication of the
way that TV is going so there's a lot to
be excited about
I'm the Westway scene at CES and this is
so nice for Ko their TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
