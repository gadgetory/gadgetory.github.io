aperture rear camera with optical image
stabilization we've integrated these
components with our HDR + computational
photography for every photo we take a
burst of shots with short exposure times
to avoid blowing out the highlights
within a line and combine each pixel
algorithmically for optimal color and
contrast all of this happens instantly
with zero shutter lag the results are
stunning with high dynamic range even in
challenging low-light conditions this
year we've increased the dynamic range
and improved texture and sharpness and
combined with a new autofocus mechanism
an optical image stabilization to reduce
blur from shaky hands you get amazing
shots every time like this and this
portrait mode lets you take
professional-looking shots with a
blurred background to make the
foreground pop like what you might
capture with an SLR camera other smart
phones do this by combining the images
from two cameras pixel 2 does portrait
mode with just one camera and machine
learning the way this works is that the
pixel 2 camera includes a dual pixel
sensor technology this means that each
pixel in an image contains a right and a
left view the difference in perspective
from those pixels combined with machine
learning models trained on almost a
million photos means that this works on
really hard cases like a busy colorful
background portrait mode doesn't just
work on the main camera because of the
quality of Google's computational
photography with a single camera you can
also take portrait selfies through the
front camera during video recording on a
pixel - the OIS Hardware actively
corrects shake artifacts while at the
same time the software based video
stabilization uses intelligent frame
look-ahead
to stabilize the overall video the pixel
2 camera also supports a feature called
motion photos your pixel captures up to
3 seconds of video behind the scenes
removing uninteresting motion and
applying our unique fuse video
stabilization technology - the result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
