that we've tuned Windows Phone to help
make you more efficient and give you a
customized way to connect to the apps
that maybe you haven't pinned and get
two notifications about things that are
happening as well as get quick access to
settings so I'm going to come up here
and pull down from the top and show you
our new action center in Windows Phone
8.1 yes thanks chip we know this is
something that a lot of our users have
been asking for so here it is and if you
look down from the top the first thing
you'll see is it shows you more detail
about things like your actual battery
percentage these four buttons are
customizable quick settings I can set
whatever I would like and down below are
the notifications coming from all my
apps and those app developers we're
putting you in a position to really
control what's shown in those
notifications through new AP is that
give you control and the user has great
control as well because they can decide
which apps should cause the phone to
vibrate or make a sound or just show up
in the action center and so on so as you
see I brought this down over the lock
screen it's accessible wherever you are
in the UI and you can see the app has
got complete control over the lock
screen when I move and touch it shows
the time and calendar and notification
information in a unique way and when i
unlock and unlocks and I'm actually
going to come over here and switch to a
different one to give you a sense for
how widely varied these lock screen
experiences can be i mean the sky is the
limit in terms of what all of you will
be able to do this creativity once it's
available here you can see my day of the
week is displayed completely differently
the arrangement of things on the screen
is different and up here you see this
cool sort of this one's called Tokyo
these three balls all align very nicely
when I pan right up to the top and then
it unlocks with Windows Phone 8.1 users
have the option to choose a high density
lots of tiles layout where they get
three columns of cross of tiles and I'm
going to jump in here to settings and go
to the start and themed area where you
can see down here there's an on off
switch for showing more tiles I'll leave
that turned on so that's one way we're
letting users greatly customize their
start screen but another thing we're
doing here is we're letting people
choose a background first start so I'm
going to choose background and go into
the set of backgrounds that we've
supplied because I like this one here
with this cool green texture which
matches my phone I'll say okay and then
you can see there that photo has been
selected and now when i go back to start
voila I have a really different and
beautiful visual appearance for my tiles
all of this is about making Windows
Phone more personal and better able to
fit your personality and look the way
you want and give you customization
because we think when a phone knows you
you have a better experience with it
there's no other device that's so
personal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
