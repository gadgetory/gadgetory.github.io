it is friday july 10 2015 welcome to our
show the 404 show real quick before we
before we dive into this week's episode
we've got a little little bit of
housekeeping to attend to a little bit
of maintenance to sort of catch you up
on and today i am happy to talk about
the fact that Russ fresh dick is here
what yes and that was loud sorry and he
will be joining me on a weekly basis uh
from here on out rock and roll rock and
roll thank you for being here so you
know it's a pleasure it's a delight I've
known you for many years and I'm very
proud to be on this podcast I do want to
make it clear you know we should sort of
be in a world where I don't know even
though I'm a die-hard fan and have
listened to all the episodes shut up we
should for the audience I think imply
that like I've maybe never listened to
an actual episode so that's true you
can't imply it or you say that's true
okay um so I look there there's an
elephant in the room what's up with I as
uh we I as and I decided to go our own
separate ways on this there is no bad
blood he people may not know this he's a
very busy man at seen it uh he's got his
hands juggling a lot of top-level
responsibilities within the company I
mean if you've ever been to cnet.com
yeah that's basically him like he's the
guy programming that front door he's
also involved as i'm sure you all know
in a good amount of video work in front
of and behind the camera so you know the
show wishes i as the best and help me
back i'm sure we already talked about it
and it's it's all everyone's in a great
place so you know all the crap you read
on the subreddit
always true uh and you know there's no
bad blood where we're in a good place so
so we'll leave it as that um moving
forward Russ is here he's going to be
here pretty much every week right USA
pretty much if you want to commit to I'm
comfortable with committing uh you know
unless you're like you know out and
about let's go ahead and say every week
let's go ahead and say every week and
then down a well and then why don't we
like explain to people just what the
remember last time you were here we had
no idea what I'm doing I do remember
that um I can actually say what I'm
doing now oh you mean we're cool enough
to be let in on your little secret you
know you guys were I would think 64th in
terms of the people that I was able to
tell but there was like a lot of
important people before you so don't
think the top 100 is no very important
very important so what is it you do sure
so I work at a company called product
hunt you may or may not have heard of it
either savvy therefore if they're savvy
they've heard of it it's sort of best
way to think of it is sort of a
community of folks that submit cool
stuff to this website called product
hunt unlike a site like reddit it's just
products it's just stuff you can buy or
stuff you can like sign up for stuff
like that but yeah so you go on the site
you checked every day and every day is a
different list of cool it started
as a tech site so there's a lot of tech
stuff already and they brought me on to
launch the game in category for them
which launched a couple weeks ago and so
I'm going to be joining Jeffrey here
once a week and you know maybe we'll
talk a little bit about what's going on
a product hunt but mostly we're going to
talk about what's going on with you
right this is going to be a call-in show
where we talk about romance and
relationships we're gonna we're gonna
hash out a lot of like peoples you know
romantic queries awesome no that's man i
miss love lined you ever listen to
loveline yeah big time formative years
with like corolla and after doctors are
you I always felt like whenever I would
put it on I was like listening to porno
radio it was it's scandalous yeah it was
an edge to it was definitely like yeah a
little red shoe diaries desk right it
would be on it like 10 am-10 p.m. yep
and I remember whenever I would listen
to it I would I would lower the volume
on the speaker
just enough lock the door at all the
bottom of our all that hard core and
then listen to it you know like if the
radio had a dial it was on 14 volume
yeah and I put my ear up and be like oh
there's like one of those old-timey
radios right you're like hearing the
funnel in your yeah I was like oh my
Kermie just got bombed they're talking
about angie's oh my they did I'll tell
you a basic cable when the show came on
that was a harrowing moment for me good
times you watch the video show or is
amazing it was amazing amazing um
alright so in addition to a new face of
the 44 show we are you know we're going
to keep a few things similar to what
we'd been doing on this program but
we're going to pepper in a few new ideas
and see where it goes but of course we
are a show that likes to round up some
of the week's news and we're going to
start off with a little little little
friendly gentleman's competition between
two superpowers in the world yes we all
know them as you know the United States
in this corner and in the other corner
Japan now the last time these two went
at it well it was a little crazy let's
say it ended abruptly haha oh man but
can I before I'm talking about u.s.
women's soccer what are you talking
about you know what's crazy I'll
speaking of the u.s. women's soccer
match yes between Japan and the u.s. in
which the u.s. obliterated yeah Jib
Japan very abruptly that's are they
people were making hiroshima on twitter
lately you know what you can't do that
not on Twitter nah you can't oh it's
terrible ok like that was its that is
something I is an American and
definitely ashamed of ya like that is
the skeleton in your closet yeah right
oh it's terrible and people on on
Twitter being like oh whoa haven't snuck
up on Japan like that in a while yeah
come on how old does an atrocity need to
be before it becomes ok in the case of
911 it was like three years yeah it was
like ah Larry I think that the new
yorker thing where we're just sort of
coping with our snarky jewish
sensibility right cuz it's nothing but
Jews he
whew Newark New York um so yeah uh u.s.
and Japan are engaging in a very
interesting friendly competition it's
not friendly know this seems to be a
serious grudge match here yeah so it
this was born out of a company based in
the u.s. that was literally had built a
large robot we're talking I don't know
how many have tall is this thing 50 feet
yeah something like that 50 feet and
this company comes around and they're
like okay well we have this large robot
it's just sort of sitting here it's not
doing a holiday it was 50 I'll you said
15 or 50 if d okay well cut that down by
35 and that's how big 15 yeah 15 um and
so they had this 15-foot robot pretty
pretty good I don't know what that's the
Voltron no he was probably smaller maybe
Voltron's hand maybe yeah like accessory
would have liked his pocket watch it's
so significant and I guess it's like
titanfall right those titanfall robots
right so they had this thing lying
around they're like okay well it's just
sort of sitting around here so instead
of him just have it sit around and be
awesome they created this video and sent
to Japan to Japan to this other company
in japan called Suribachi heavy industry
while also makes robots I feel like I'm
in like Pacific Rim right it's fantastic
it's the best thing ever the American
companies called mega bots and they
challenged Suribachi to a giant robot
fight and the impression that I got from
the initial video was essentially was no
holds bar you could do whatever you
wanted to the robot they were gonna go
at it and there weren't people inside it
and there weren't people inside a
stranger that would be unfortunates
dangerous there weren't people inside it
but you could latch on rocket launchers
and machine guns whatever you want to do
and it would be a robot fight okay so
sir vashi a couple weeks later this this
past week responds with their own video
and they say deal sounds good we're in
but stipulation it needs to be melee
combat because let's be honest you stick
a rocket launcher on that thing that's
getting real quick if I it's gonna end
in a minute it's like it's basically
just like a Wild West Show time like
whoever gets the rocket launcher off
first right so
here at least it we don't know what's
gonna happen but at least it's gonna be
a little prolonged it's not gonna be
like you spin the dice roll the dice and
rule out what I don't know anything but
well basically this is like the plot to
that movie uh with Hugh Jackman because
now it's like robot yeah biting like
this fighting right melee fighting yeah
in that movie they were very open yeah
they were very agile they're like boxers
I don't think there will be capable of
this decade they're just gonna build
alike chop yeah if they might be able to
walk a little bit but I can imagine once
they like run into each other like
they're gonna be just jammed I thought
it is not gonna be all like oh no this
sounds way cooler on paper but think
about it for those 30 seconds as they're
slowly lumbering towards each other with
like a flaming sword and like a chainsaw
right that's gonna be the best moment in
history well that's like the ultimate
like Mortal Kombat fight screen oh it's
it's fantastic and it's actually gonna
happen in real life like the best we've
gotten so far is battle bots which is
like oh here's a 10 inch like really
robot rolling in another 10 inch really
robot right like someone lame you're
like oh I I attached like a saw to my RC
car that's the equivalent of what we've
seen so far so this is stepping it up a
notch and it seems like a very it is a
friendly match in so far as you know no
one's gonna get killed for it yeah but I
did some level we going on and
especially after after the World Cup it
feels like some hurt feelings it was
like they owe us one well this might be
them coming back at us I don't know man
I think it's amazing do you you think
it's amazing 12,000 pounds of gasoline
powered fury I don't know what happened
but there's probably gonna be a giant
explosion there isn't i'm gonna be
really just like are people gonna wash
this live they would have to sit fairly
far away like they have to I feel like
it's gonna be like a space shuttle
launch like binoculars right how far
away are you you're basically in Georgia
when you are ya are you would you watch
this mage that'll take off yeah in
Florida it seems dangerous but you know
again that awesome things are generally
dangerous yeah I guess so you can't have
any fun unless someone's at risk yeah so
this came out yesterday and it
it didn't really make headlines because
I don't know I have no answer why it
would not make headlines but uh there is
some really exciting stuff happening in
the world of comic books back to the
future I've heard of it right you've
heard of that yep uh is getting who
keeps falling on a guy that's all I
remember poop yeah right manure in there
is there more to it that somebody
pronounced manure met like manure missin
mini Eric someone added like a why awful
over the weekend dressed as ups that was
upsetting uh guess what kids idw
publishing big maybe more of an
underground comic book publisher are
they like third so you have DC you'd
marvel no they're not third I was third
I don't know I may be dark or third I
don't know I'm not I just feel like
there are that many that I've heard of
idw there's a lot but there's more than
you think okay uh there's also image
probably images three I'd say yeah uh
but nevertheless alike that Kathy they
do Kathy uh no okay that would know
you've dated yourself quite a bit
haven't you idw publishing announced on
wednesday that they have plans for a
Back to the Future comic book series
spearheaded by the original movies
screen write amazing mr. Bob Gale very
talented gentleman so that's a big deal
and that should come off as a comforting
little detail because the second you
hear about it back to the future comic
book reboot you're like what the hell is
this yeah joke are they gonna get to
write this but guess what it's Bob Gale
he wrote the original what's up they
they've subtitled it untold tales and
alternate timelines which I'm okay with
because for years fans have asked
questions about things that happen
before the events of the trilogy like
how the hell did doc and Marty meet and
it seems that they have almost an
inappropriate relationship considering
he's a high school kid and doc is like I
don't know a 50 year old scientist alone
that's weird he's just like science like
how did they mean why do I don't know
how does it meet how did they meet and
how did it not involve like a vandy in
the van okay like I said not come
together nevertheless back to the future
issue number one which is scheduled to
be released in october of this year
her will tell the story of that of how
Marty first met Doc Brown prior to the
events of the first movie a second arc
what did he call Marty when he first
song because I can't fathom a world
where he doesn't always just call mod
yeah what are you calling like you you
that you there boy with the vest I don't
know what would he go on it's very
bizarre I can't wait well that's why
you're gonna be able to find out a
second arc in that issue as well will be
set in 1943 with docs involvement in the
Manhattan Project ok was he alive back
then I guess they're implying that oh
let's do that so at the 80s so what a
tease the backgrounds what 120 like what
the freak man that does make sense if
he's involved if he's old enough to be
involved in a 1943 manhattan project or
either he's been traveling back in time
already and just I don't know if it was
60 in the movie so he could be 20 cuz it
was the 80s so it's 40 years before that
so he could be 20 years old and working
on the Manhattan Project alright of a
young diving tour what he's an intern at
the door what they're implying is that
he travels back in time to do it but
like the man still works it does I guess
all right I'm I'm okay with it if Bob
gales involved sign me up back to the
future issue 1 October 21st is the
specific date they're gonna try and
shoot for is there any chance that Doc
Brown is Marty from this like a no Marty
how dare you mess with I'm lines just
there's no chance of that happening
continuum is a sacred concept sure and
you cannot just come in here on your
first show as new co-host and just
all over that time where is that what is
the rule so you can you can see yourself
but you can't interact with yourself
right there little vague on that yeah if
you and we've definitely talked about
this before but if you watch some of the
deleted scenes scenes of back to the
future two you will see a scene where
old Biff from the future yes about right
like disappear he's like editor and it
hurts amusia and then all of a sudden
his turn to nothing because he did to my
t change too much he changed enough that
he does know he know
exists your 2015 right which by the way
oh wait a minute I don't even put that
together october twenty first 25 the day
they travel to the future mazing good
for that that's kind of all that's
pretty good hey we just figured that out
freaking uh not the pressure face not
that no it's not a press release i wrote
up Newsarama failed to recognize that
significant day terrible the Joker's
over Newsarama calm also on the same day
jaws six comes out jaws 5,000 uh so yeah
that's really exciting stuff I don't
know if you think we talk too much about
back to the future go listen to a
different show right now so long is not
about 3 i'm fine oh yeah well look
raised bed 3 is like the you know the
the sort of like stain on the trilogy
yeah uh I mean don't I returns if you
will okay which fine I'm okay with using
that analogy because Dark Knight Returns
is the weakest among the three yes but
it is also in itself not a terrible
define move it's fine fine there's a lot
of stuff that's we and if the other
movies didn't exist that people would
probably look at it more favorable it
would be regarded in a much higher
capacity yeah back to future three yeah
it's a little weird dopey it'sit's dopey
there's a scene where a little boy
appears to point at his own crotch yeah
I look that up if you have a moment
anyway so we're very excited about that
and just as a little side note we've
been lucky enough well I've been lucky
enough to work with some of the sideshow
collectibles people who and we just shot
a video with back to the future one
Marty McFly oh my god the hot toys
version yet so go to cnn.com and then
this week at comic-con which is going on
right now a whole lot of great news
coming out of there but sideshow
announced that they're going to be
distributing the back to the future to
Marty McFly complete with Lotus years
and they've got the nike license well
maybe it's the prototype but if you go
on the website you can see that like
that sort of like us black cylinder uh
you know shoe case yeah it holds the
power mason that's pretty that's in it a
hoverboard hours obviously and a few
other really
inhale license probably not yeah maybe I
can't you can't tell from the photo they
have on facebook but the hoverboard is
definitely there also they're doing a
six scale beetlejuice Oh which kind of
tickled me in ways I hadn't been to a
sick Beetlejuice form with this the
black and white striped suit yeah okay
like ghost with the most right that yeah
and then the little uh the little
gargoyle tombstone that says he dies how
did why that discovers another day but
bilges of the weirdest thing goddamn
right like how is who put that out
dimension films is like that I'm like
who was like okay and we'll call
Beetlejuice yeah our first a second time
director others the pee wee pee wee's
big adventure it's like an alternate
universe where monkey bone was a success
right so weird that movie got made very
odd but you know fortuitous in the long
run obviously okay let's get a little
switch gears just a little bit that way
and get into something that happened
this week that I look I am NOT a
conspiracy theorist yeah I am NOT okay
but some weird stuff went down on
Wednesday okay just what the hell
happened on when a lot of stuff went
down okay be very weird if you're
following the mainstream news you would
a lame stream media you're talking about
thanks thanks uh mr. uh what I Rush
Limbaugh hey you don't want to call you
yes ah really a trilogy of strange tech
failures now in their own rights maybe
if they happen separately it wouldn't be
such a strange thing but three major
things happened on wednesday united
airlines entire infrastructure okay was
halted to a stop not like you couldn't
buy tickets nothing was booked able
nothing was purchasable no flights in or
out of any airport on the planet that's
a lot of flights that's hot tens of
thousands of line how long was down for
I I mean I was it was funny I was at the
CBS News room okay I was at the the
broadcast Center while this was going
down people just running with papers it
was you know what I felt
really did feel like a scene out of
newsroom yeah you know if there's one
thick so like there's a lot of like
romantic triangles that Britain poorly
uh no but there was really you know
people people over there tho those
reporters who who are on their toes in
on their feet that it was intense this
is a very big deal I actually got bumped
for it which you know is way more
important than I was going to talk about
Facebook uh so this happened it was a
major major deal i want to say was down
for like two hours yeah i'm looking it's
let's see yeah it looks about two hours
about two hours or so give or take hour
and a half uh it was a big deal right
and then we find out that the new york
stock exchange had a network malfunction
that halted trading okay for a
significant amount of time two things
yeah it could be coincidence that's
weird yeah and then the third one which
i think is the least significant or is
it or is it conspiracy theorists yeah
The Wall Street Journal their entire
computer server system failed to respond
okay that what this sounds to me like a
coincidence mmm sounds more like a
die-hard heist scenario playing out like
we're gonna find out in two weeks like
all the gold in Fort Knox is gone is
that yeah and they used United to escape
and then your it was like in the
basement New York Stock Exchange and
they had the busts through the wall
street journal's offices to make their
getaway ah they bought it see that like
that it's a pretty simple scenario like
Jeremy Irons is just watching the whole
thing I know you're speculating like
Illuminati or something like that but no
it's jeremy irons what's crazy to me is
like you use you bring up die hard three
yeah but like modern entertainment has
trained us to sniff stuff like this out
yeah as like plant like you know heists
came in great seems yeah it's in this
direction this actually matches a
terrible movie that I saw very recently
called black hat with I think Chris
helmsworth Thor himself where he played
a hacker if you can imagine that and it
Ole Miss there are no beautiful ackers
like it really was like someone hacked
the stock exchange and a bunch other
things to like get
oil prices to act funky and then by land
it was terrible movie um but you know
that's yeah one hundred percent like if
stuff like this happens especially in
concert we definitely think something is
up right it's weird yeah and and you
know all the news outlets had security
experts and all these people coming on
TV and saying oh that's that's uh that's
a coincidence there is nothing to get
worried about yeah right you don't you
don't don't don't worry about any of
that meanwhile the news outlets are like
Oh can't we get some way I that's like
the world it's coming to an end of the
Second Age just to like get naked yeah
you know just be like hey that's all
they wanted someone freaking out yeah
hair they don't want someone to be like
yeah yeah it's gonna mahjong tonight
it's fine it's very it's very weird
story I want to hear what you think
podcasting audience just what the hell
happened on Wednesday yeah come up with
a good a conspiracy theory and you will
read it next week I don't even know how
I'd go about hacking the new york stock
exchange how would you do i'm not sure i
could even hack that just plug in an
ethernet cord into someone's like laptop
no you get like bein okay how did bein
do it he blew it up didn't he he blew up
the stadium and it was of course Batman
forgot you were doing I just walk
through the front door and hack the
out of york stock exchange remember me
from prison I was not the little girl
hey that was probably another coward or
you might be convincing me what is this
Raja cool no I'm a ghost okay all right
we're gonna do more impressions before
yeah where I promise that real quick
before we hit the first break a funny
little headline today we did a comic
about it today logitech rebrands itself
as Lodgy logie or is it look we talked
about this on the Beast guest is it low
G or lodging I think it's probably lied
just to be maintaining the like logitech
connection right but i just seeing it
alone just the letters Lodgy it just
looks like an anime like the name of an
anime character like little sprite that
comes out of the woods
hello logie oh you is that low G the
gnome have you brought us mice to play
with low G the gnome can make fire from
anything really weird I don't know it's
I mean a logitech is I think next step
next to like I mean there's a few brands
out there that like the name alone just
like the equivalent like a
hewlett-packard which just in your mind
is like oh that's super dorky and
logitech was definitely up there and
didn't really connect with like the
general consumer base that would buy
like an apple phone so I guess it makes
sense but they make good like I use a
Logitech mouse they make good hardware
oh don't get me wrong they make
fantastic stuff their stock is up today
throw a 33 cents as well at this with
eleni guess what their stock name is low
G yeah that's how maybe then that was
the plan all along people didn't want a
google so they're like we'll just make
it the same the bad all the coverage you
know 72 days ago the all the coverage
was you know mediocre little you know
sort of snarky the comic we did today we
like chopped up all brand names those
like Toshi pani Sammy stuff like that um
gizmodo did a good headline there
logitech is changing its name to LA G
because tech means nothing those it does
it means nothing pretty great alright we
are going to take a quick break a word
from our sponsor more 40 for the new 404
if you will the reboot reboot like the
real ghostbusters yeah all right why
they mad about the request they didn't
need the word real like who would
confuse them for other ghost bus while
the other ghostbusters so in the show
initially launched metal and right hand
random Ghostbusters and everyone's like
those aren't the real ghostbusters I saw
the movie oh and then they're like oh
these are the real ghostbusters you know
what you explain that perfectly am there
you go be right back after the break hey
a big shout-out to our new sponsor for
the week hip check Thank You hipchat for
sponsoring the 404 show okay so what is
hip chat HipChat is a game-changing team
communication app that helps teams work
together more effectively how do they do
that anybody could say that right yeah
but eight years
there's always these times when I'm
trying to get in touch with you and
you're not on whatever I am you're not
on all these part i'm texting you you're
not responding seeing you in like a room
a little chat room situation would be
amazing i'd be able to talk to us like
we're in the same off are you saying I'm
inaccessible massively fair enough I
think you're too famous is the problem
well clearly that goes without saying i
am very famous the cool thing about
HipChat is they live on a philosophy
that says email is too slow and they're
right it's going away HipChat gets you
the information you need faster than
email and reduces meaningless
face-to-face meetings like the one I'm
having with Russ right now this
meaningless agreed it helps you keep
your team's connected hipchat is a great
solution for remote work as well you got

exciting day today because we're
welcoming our new host mr. Ross rustic
ahoy there that's how I'm gonna be
welcome who's the dirty pirate boy I
don't know dirty it sounds like very
pleasant no rush doesn't work for seen
it now Russ's kicking it over at product
hunt running the games section yep
here's the ear we're doing a little
cross brand action here it's nice we let
me like we're gonna get some love on
product on yeah is there a podcast
category is it that's probably there is
a battle become a conflict but product n
also has its own podcast called product
hunt radio all right listen to on
serious no surprise it's an actual radio
well satellite it's a show right yeah I
mean it's a podcast / radio show okay
who's on that so that's run by Eric torn
burgers one of the cofounders of product
hunt and various other guests generally
like people in the text Silicon Valley
space so if cooked into that space tune
in all right there you have it check out
product on I could have the way explain
that site to people I'm still working on
the elevator pitch yeah the elevator
pitches tell the way I my elevator pitch
is like well it's read it for products
yeah yeah that's right that's it that's
the way you gotta get but it's it's more
complex the whole commenting submitting
system is like not everyone can submit
something right the fear is you you open
the floodgates about everyone submit and
then suddenly the every single day is
just like spammy like you know crap that
ritee people promoting it nipple can
game it right but so we you know
whitelist people that we think are okay
to submit stuff and we also have
algorithms to like see oh all these
users are new so clearly someone's
trying to like do a vote ring or
something like that right so we have
mechanisms to fight you cheating
bastards okay well that's that's that's
pretty aggressive yeah I want to talk a
little bit about um well we'll talk
about them in
I was a red band because he the Dark
Knight has been we're not talking about
man-bat yeah not man-bat not because man
that not which is a thing yeah in the
Batman universe are confusing um which
they couldn't come up with a better name
for that well even more so so man bad
for those that don't know is a dude that
looks more like a bat that he doesn't do
like he he's actually the real but
that's what I'm saying it's like it
seems weird that they would prioritize
the man in that when really he's more
bad than man and vice versa correct but
man that is was was introduced way after
Batman yeah but I think what's his name
the Creator Bob Kane Bob Kane what's
really the finger guy what yeah so the
Batman was created by Bob Kane gets
credit okay for creating Batman what
does that mean the finger guy I think
his name is like Bill Finger oh okay I'm
gonna look at you from is amazed the
finger guy hope he does sound like a
Batman villain yeah it's bill finger so
here's a deal and I don't want to get
too far into this cuz this is not what
we're talking about to get Batman but
there's a lot of controversy with the
cane legacy versus the finger legis okay
bill finger verse Bob Kane apparently
these guys did not like each other like
in capturing my type situation right Bob
Kane is the guy who gets Clarissa
fiction but but apparently bill finger
is the dude who really put Batman
together who like put the cape on them
man and and did his whole thing now the
you can talk to historians comic book
historians who have their version of how
it went but that's from what I gather is
the way it played out okay anyway we're
talking about Batman and we're going to
talk about his code okay his code
everyone knows that one two three four
right to his luggage to his security
system to his safe Batman's code is that
he doesn't what he doesn't kill Pete
does not kill people he doesn't use guns
out kind of use his gun yeah but they
don't shoot bullets they shoot like for
smiles yeah happy happy hugs issue
diplomacy the shoot rainbow bullets um
so Batman in the news lately obviously
because batman arkham knight one of the
best games of the year so far uh
although maybe not the best Arkham uh
you know game that we've seen on the
last decade or so nevertheless Batman is
more powerful than he's ever been in
Arkham Knight yeah and it raises the
question okay well how is Batman just
not killing everyone in sight in this
game and they put a lot of effort behind
it because you really have you have the
Batmobile in arcanine which is the most
lethal thing he is given yes without
them straight up runs over you've never
been given anything remotely as powerful
as this thing and the Batmobile has in
its arsenal a machine gun a rocket
launcher a charging ability so you could
run people over electrocution
electrocution so the way they
rationalize it in the game is that when
you're shooting like tanks and stuff of
which there are many in this game you're
using those lethal explosives because
there's no one in them they're just
drones right but when you're running
people over or shooting guys with like
your cannon which automatically changes
to like a non-lethal like beanbag round
it just knows it just knows
automatically oh this is a human I'm
gonna kill that I can't kill it i'm
going to use something non-lethal the
problem is let's say you're driving at
65 miles an hour not crazy speeds but
like through the streets of Gotham of
the streets of God 65s fast and there's
a mugger standing in the street and you
drive right Adam and even if your car is
coated in a magical electrical field
that will automatically shove people out
of the way the inertia of going from
stock straight to suddenly shoved 50
meters because you got hit by a car dead
you're dead you're dead the g-force
alone would GU your brain in an issue
would be turn to do a fine paste that's
not to mention the numerous other times
when people should die based on the
things Batman does like you know
sometimes they accidentally get kicked
off ledges and but that's what's so
funny in the games like the game has
this thing programmed into it where if
you're on a roof yeah or a high you know
surface and you kick
an enemy there's this invisible wall
there's a sizable fan bed prevent now I
took some footage the other day I kick
someone off okay I did that's I'm saying
at least cuz it doesn't work right and I
need to grab that and post that online
but yeah it's kind of hilarious because
you're like oh man BAM industry have
killed somebody yeah like in cold blood
and it's such a focal point especially
for this series but but also for like
the Chris Nolan movies is like such a
major focal point because I don't know
it like differentiates him it's right
it's it's it's redefined him because I'm
not sure this code of conduct was of
sticking point earlier in his in bat me
a like when did this come about great
question do you know no idea no idea cuz
yeah I I would admit like I didn't read
comics growing up and I find that very
hard to believe i know i'm nerdy in so
many other ways um I didn't read comics
growing up I guess the first I was
trying to remember the first time when I
realize like this is a code of his might
have been like the first Arkham Knight
first was an arkham asylum game right oh
really that may have might have been the
first time yet I don't know I definitely
discovered it later than being
familiarized with Batman obviously
because I wouldn't realize that after
Batman Begins because this is what made
me rethink of it recently is at the end
of that and begins spoiler alert he
straight up kills Ra's al Ghul Ra's al
Ghul is there he could save him instead
he lets him plummet in this train and
he's dead right uh yeah and you could
make the argument that he kills people
in the burton movies as well right I
think you could very easily make that
argument you mentioned two examples to
me that were like straight-up murder
scene straight up murder in the first
Batman when they're at the top of the
bell tower uh obviously he'd let's Jack
Nicholson go like he dropped him right
uh you could leave you I'll give you the
benefits out there but then like before
right before that he he fights this like
karate his like right there man wasn't
it no no that was like that greasy
looking okay it wasn't what the hell's
his name was like with oh no Jack
Nicholson kills him
red-billed gun it's all right under the
parade um and then this guy who's like
doing all this fancy karate he basically
like ducks out of the way and allows him
to fall 50 stories as death right or he
just lands in like bad as I put a bunch
of footage billows at the matter they're
like I think the point we're trying to
an i'm batman returns in the beginning
with the demented carnival scene where
they take over the christmas uh ceremony
uh Batman appears to like drop a hand
grenade or in a man who could be a
concussion grenade but it seems unlikely
he's probably already knocked out from
falling down the manhole I would think
so so you know it so I guess the funny
thing is like what's starting to happen
is all of these ways in which batman is
being portrayed are they're going out of
their way to make excuses as to why
under any normal circumstance you would
have killed somebody they're going out
of their way to like sugar coat it and
and literally pet it yeah so that you
don't kill them in the new game right
yeah and in an in new media like you
know the Nolan movies but the no.1
movies in particular especially starting
with Arkham whatever the second was dark
night and dark knight rises like Dark
Knight the whole movie is about that
right so they're very careful about like
making sure that he doesn't kill
anything which he does not appear to
know I don't think he does and then the
third one I think that's probably the
case to like oh wait he does use his
doesn't use his motorcycle to like oh no
that Catwoman kills right Catwoman kills
Ra's al Ghul's daughter with the
motorcycle cuz she's like I don't care
about killing people Frank and that's
such an easy like there's like right be
like Oh Batman didn't do it so he's his
conscience is clear and then he goes off
and like mary's ER right lives lives in
Italy with her so clearly doesn't have
that many qualms about killing people I
can't do it but my wife game go ahead
honey no could Batman control robot that
kills people then that'd be okay no
because that's like in a game at Amelia
yes I him using a great what if it's
like he had a really long extension arm
what if he set up a Rube Goldberg my
contraption that ultimately ended right
you know cutting the joke like two hours
to run through right any like left the
the the zip code yeah but I do like in
in the second arkham asylum game Arkham
City like they make a big deal of that
at the end of the game I don't really
want to ruin it for people because it's
one of my favorite game endings but yeah
it don't make a big deal about it and
it's like really i don't know i mean
it's it's a weird thing and i like it as
a character development piece i like it
but it's also like you're making an
action game it's really tough to
convince people that this isn't a joke
yeah and the flip side to that is if you
go whole hog on it how can you have like
an honorable guy that's going around and
just murdering people exactly ie
uncharted ie there uncharted is the
perfect example I'm sure you've heard of
Uncharted is a mega mega top tier
flagship series for PlayStation you play
as nathan drake in your vet you're
essentially uh you know like an Indiana
Indiana Jones kind of guide to a lara
croft kind of person man you go around
hunting for treasure but in the process
you are straight-up shooting everybody's
mad next and kicking people off ledges
and you're joking about it the whole
time to you're like oh so he's not gonna
need that anymore cuz i said brains on
my forehead and what's so funny is we
were when we're at e3 a couple weeks ago
i was watching a playthrough of
uncharted 4 which is the new one that
comes out next year and the guy playing
the game wasn't aiming at anyone's head
interesting he was aiming my legs or so
think legs people were dying yeah and
I'm sorry like there's not enough blood
in uncharted say not a mature rating
it's always t it's always t4 so that's
why there's not but I get it but you're
shooting people with an ak-47 in the
face okay so that doesn't end with like
a smoke tray but they wanted team rating
is just a problem with that we don't
want to get too much into that but but
yeah so that's essentially what we
wanted to get to with Batman let us know
what you think yeah I don't know
Batman's a complicated dude he is my
favorite superhero oh yeah he's he's the
most interesting superhero he's great
he's great
um all right I want to talk quickly
about so what we want to talk about like
game ratings with Android and iOS and
like the other day I was talking to you
about a mobile game like game of war
that the Kate Hudson yeah you know
weirdo sort of game and I was like how
is that game getting five stars on
Android yeah and I guess this like works
in with your game of the week stuff sure
you but you you've been working with
product right now and you're like very
hip and close to the rating system yeah
we're iOS you know you buy a game in iOS
and you can vote on you can give it a
star where they have it is same thing
with the Play Store yep so what do you
have to enlighten sure so those those
ratings in games for mobile games for on
Android and on iOS make and make or
break your product if you have less than
four stars your thing is not going to
sell it the major impact on sale it's a
soul psychological thing where like
someone is just not willing to spend
more and download oh yeah forget it even
if it's free they won't download it if
it has a less than force them right so a
lot of these developers use some sort of
psychological tricks as to when to
present the police radar screen this is
slimy this feels don't think it slimy I
think it's smart mark it's smart but
it's yeah it feels don't like it feels a
little greasy well there's a lot of
these decisions that people make
regarding like well what should we price
this and where do we do internet
purchasing and stuff like that so there
are this like this is this invisible
layer behind all these games that people
don't really think about that's all
driven by analytics and testing a be
testing and all that stuff so this is
one of them and I've spoken a lot of
indie developers and one of the things
they've said is you should never put
this at the top of your game like the
second you load it up you shouldn't have
like raid us please write the time to do
it is essentially if the player has just
accomplished something awesome like they
just beat of massive boss fight or they
just unlocked a new level or whatever
something amazing just happened that's
when you hit them and it's almost like
they just did a hit of heroin and it's
like hey man give me 20 bucks
they're like it you did a hit of heroin
it's basically like no give me a high
five yeah right right time tell your
friends baseball yep this bump that
yeah buts crazy it's pretty interesting
and then again this is not the only time
that they use these there's a lot of
like mental gymnastics that happen to
try to get players to do what they want
to do right what they're doing yeah the
way I break it down for myself is there
essentially game affine a rating system
within the game yeah I hate that word I
know but guess what buddy I hate you
hate the word URL need to work violin
that what Papa viral I have such problem
with our okay anyway but uh you know
I've for me it's like that's what
they're doing yeah there there I mean
it's using strategy on something that's
colossally important to the success of
their game and it's interesting um but
yeah I think a lot of people don't even
think about it they're like oh why not
like oh well whatever i guess i'll write
it now oh no i mean i desperately search
for the no thanks don't ever bother me
again but sure but there are for the
people that do great you want them to be
in a good mood when they write you don't
want them to like oh i just lost the
same level five times please rate us or
or right after Buddha or right after
Buddha yeah when you don't know whether
it's good or not so just kind of
interesting all right very cool now you
know now you know I want it before we
get to some more talk about PC let's uh
let's talk about um one of our favorite
film actors okay of all time yeah and
he's in the news lately cuz he just had
a son Charlton Heston yes very versatile
very versatile no Jeff Goldblum Jeff
Goldblum so horrific guy I don't know
why she is just enjoying so many
consistent years of success yes it's
been very Annie Hall like he's been
successful since Annie Hall came out in
the mid 70s like he's like what do you
woody allen's like friend in Annie Hall
this is like busy yeah that's not like I
always tennis for them or so oh yes yeah
yeah or he's in like the LA like swanky
party I know that was all time oh that's
Paul okay well whatever jeff go boom is
in that movie and he's an iconic
legendary and of course
fleischer Jurassic Park Park and and uh
ID for you to with abbreviating in it
still on uh so he came into the gaming
world a few days ago when activision
announced that call of duty black ops 3
zombies the zombies mode is gonna
feature not only Jeff Goldblum but also
heather graham neal mcdonough Ron
Perlman and Robert Picardo I love Neal
McDonough do you know who that is yeah
super blond guy huh he's like super
super blonde who is he though he was in
justified as one of the season-long
daddy's here on band of brothers go on
you never seen either those no uh-uh
yeah I know it recognized I know a band
of brothers is he's a character actor
you would recognize him so Jeff goal and
not only that so it's like this co-op
zombie campaign which is pretty standard
which is pretty soon but like you've
seen the trailer for this no I have it
it's it's like a bioshock world oh
really yeah it's very weird i I it sort
of done that in the past though like
like all the zombie games generally are
like um you know you constructing weird
laser guns right they're not realistic
what you got to watch the trailer this
thing it looks really good it's kind of
like left for dead alex navarro
described as left for dead meats
Bioshock okay kind of cool sure anyway
they're using their likenesses like it
looks like jeff goldblum yeah it looks
like heather graham it looks like ron
perlman got us thinking all right what's
your favorite Jeff Goldblum movie yeah
and if you wanted to try an impression
I'll let you I don't know listen to the
show for a long time no your track
record when it comes to impressions and
you're like Jeff you're like oh for 400
so I'm gonna ask you to tread lightly
with that but uh put what's your
favorite Jeff Goldblum thing I think the
easy answer is probably Jurassic Park
haha right because people you know he's
like the edgy guy that everyone quotes
and he's his shirt is ripped most the
movie who doesn't love that he's also
certifiably crazy yeah like it plays a
crazy person
I you know I think he makes I think
independence they would not be a movie
that people love if he wasn't in it
Jurassic Park might have been able to
squeak by I think Jurassic Park would
have been fine without yeah just go blue
yeah i would say independence day
probably for me okay this he's just
like so in his element of like worried
jus that whole entire movie where's
jurassic park sometimes he plays like a
badass sometimes she's like what's that
leather yeah sport cuz like lying in the
back are with his leg broken he's like
Moscow faster yeah which he also says an
Independence Day oh my god he does as an
exact same line but you know he doesn't
say in Jurassic Park what's that the
line he has an Independence Day my
favorite line people listen to the Beast
guess already heard me talk about this
okay zine when he goes up in the
spaceship with Will Smith they're about
ready to light their cigars yeah victory
cigars yeah they closed the window the
the front windshield right alien
overrides their system yeah starts
opening Will Smith's like this is stupid
this is stupid they could see us Jeff
Goldblum leans back in his pilot's chair
and girls oh which I do remember
that yes is for me for Jeff for like I
said one Jeff to another Jeff it's so
Jekyll perfect it is a really perfect
the way he conducts himself his he has
this amazingly calm steady gait yeah him
where he's just like I'm never going you
know he's not he's the total opposite of
like a nic cage right he never he's
spikes whereas cages rougher and sharp
around the edges Jeff Goldblum is like
drinking a glass of silk yeah he's like
a waveform that just slowly goes long
goes along and sometimes he'll be like
I'm not happy about this situation but
that's the limit right that's the extent
that's the most emotional hug yet never
yells yeah uh when the scene my favorite
though I enjoy him the most in the west
anderson movies in zissou yeah he plays
I don't know he isn't is the he's the
competing oh yeah oceanographer guy yeah
yeah and in grand Budapest hotel he
plays the lawyer the yeah the state Rep
rioter yeah he always plays like an
erudite right suited like glasses
wearing like high-class very stoic New
York early kind of dude right and uh and
in grand Budapest when he's explaining
to the extent a close and extended
family about the will that tildes want
us yeah I am her character leaves and
he's just like I will elucidate in due
time and like just everything he said
it's just it's amazing yeah he's
fantastic I yeah so Jeff Goldblum that's
you bless you but star bless your heart
we should do this every week where we
just were just lose it over a character
the character I don't know I feel like
we started at the peak and it's all
downhill from here you can't match this

rating us on iTunes it means a hell of a
lot to us thank you on behalf of Russ
and I a big thank you let us move on and
talk a little bit about russ's newfound
pc gaming success so i have not i used
to be a pc gamer we're talking about 15
years ago i had made my own box i was a
pc gamer that's what i did i played
worms armageddon and all those quaint
watch out for this guy wolf 3d I
probably got a badass over here write
them all and then I took a very long
break and it wasn't for any particular
reason but I took a long break and now I
am back on the horse as of like the last
week um with a pc in my home now how are
you finding that are you able to
navigate the choppy waters that is pc
gaming now i've been using a mac
consistently through that 15 years and
here obviously like I'm steam savvy I
know how to use steam I know how to
download stuff I'm not an idiot mostly
okay it except for the time you texted
me and said well let's not we're gonna
cross that bridge when we come to it
okay it seems like all the most of the
issues that I'm running two are like
I'll be like I'll fix something like Oh
your USB stick is not being recognized
for no reason because it's just a USB
stick it should just know it's usually
thing yeah and it doesn't work and then
I'll like install drivers and like
restart the computer and
I won't know again that it's a USB stick
and I want to strangle the pc like and
throw it out a window like that is crazy
to me that we're still running into
these issues the other issue that I had
just the other day I was trying to
activate windows as you're aware i enter
the code the message that pops up says
this code did not work and I'm like okay
I guess it was a bum code I turn off my
computer I turned on the next day the pc
is activated what is going on ok someone
needs there is like a layer of like
mystery 2pcs that granted max can
definitely not do as much they are not
as versatile they're not good gaming
machines unless you spend their nine
thousand dollars they are definitively
poor gaming sharon's not that but from a
day to day not running into issues
standpoint Oh Mac has it be it's like
Max are much more consistent definite
but you can't play a lot of games on max
journey you know they're not built for
that it's well ok so that those are all
that I think reasonable complaints that
I've had with pc gaming sure less
reasonable issues that I've had include
you giving me that what is it a
displayport cable ok so Russ got a
monitor that can only use a displayport
cable which is I guess I'm here to hdmi
it is very good it's better than hdmi
pretty silly yeah it can do more it can
it has more been more flaw the way I
understand it more giggle flippies yes
what it's called uh so Russ it's like a
pretty decent graphics card in the
computer yep so you know it obviously
had like if you know it obviously has
hdmi and displayport and yes as
offerings so so I got a text message for
us and it says I can't find a display
for another thing is only hdmi what's
going on yeah and then what happened and
then I didn't hear back from well no you
said it's definitely in there is what
you said I'm like it's definitely in
there does that way this pipe or it and
then so I climb under my desk and i'm
peering at the back of the pc and I'm
like maybe these black things are not
just part of the case design so there's
these little plastic pieces yeah
they put inside before the ports to sort
of I don't know keep them clean and from
dusty whatever ever yeah and this guy so
I I don't know went to college I yeah so
it turns out there was a smart do
literally all account plugs that were
just blocking displayport so I like very
feebly removed it I was like oh well of
like a shape matches like the amount of
time that I spent looking at the plug
and being like that shape doesn't match
and the only benefit of any dad I'd give
you is like all right hdmi and
displayport are similar ish yeah they
are they are but yeah it was humbling
it's also crazy to me that like most pcs
just like don't necessarily ship with
Wi-Fi yeah that's done it was a very
look that's another thing a very easy
thing to solve I went to the store I
bought a 30-hour Wi-Fi dongle it works
fine every two days for whatever reason
the pcs like I don't like there's Wi-Fi
dongle anymore you really have to reset
it and it does do a good job resetting
it but like why does my internet turn
off every two days that's weird like
it's weird huh so it's been interesting
sometimes the keyboard my wireless
keyboard stops working yeah that's you
know because it's Bluetooth is wonky
well i'm using the logitech sorry Lodgy
unifying Oh which is relatively it's
very good but it needs a line of sight
right it's not quite as like a desk in
the way yeah it's tough man you know
just jump you have such a tough life I
know it's the worst you know really is
the way I don't know how I live with
myself this is what our ancestors are
planted I will say the game specifically
it's been very delightful um I've been
playing a lot of wasteland 2 which I
couldn't recommend more because a
tremendously fun game and I downloaded
this mod for portal that someone made
like a mod calomel yeah very cool
stories mail which I haven't played yet
but universal praise for that so it's
great to like not have to stress on
things and like be able to download
whatever I want right and check out new
games and not have to worry about
running stuff it's terrific I'm glad you
I don't want to be a grumpy
snow but you graduated to the big boys
I'm a big boy big girls and the big boys
now I do sort of want to use that
streaming thing that steam has the
shadow play yeah boy we talking about
they're selling like a physical box oh
where you can I stream a game from the
pc right TV TV without having a second
so not always also no no probably has to
be wired a little bit yeah what you
really should do that like I know that
your computer doesn't have Wi-Fi but you
probably hardwired that figure out it's
not gonna I have to move get a long wine
okay I'll move apartments do something
all right very good and before we hit
the subreddit oh you have a few games of
the week you'd like to mention yeah from
product on sale again Russ is heading up
the gaming category section of product I
can just go to product hunt calm / games
you want to check the games you can go
to the main page for all the tech stuff
now these are not just console games
these are mobile games these are a very
accessible games it's everything so we
do everything we do console games we do
mobile games you name it what I wanted
to bring to the table is actually not
one game usually I'll probably just
bring one game but I've been seeing over
the last few days we've been getting a
lot of submissions for a handful of
games which are actually remakes of
classic games and they're all called
stuff like freeciv free call open red
alert and what they what they are are
essentially people making open source
versions of these classic popular games
so free civilization it's like
civilization right colonization is
another one and red alert is obviously a
command and conquer command and conquer
how how are they able to do that so
here's the thing it's not really leaving
so here's the thing we're all going to
jail I mean I've does give me the
impression that like one day yeah is
gonna wake up and be like nope and I
clutch it it's kind of amazing how
dedicated these fans are tour recreating
these games and making sure that they
work well on new platforms and like any
platform you can imagine like something
you know linux and you name it they're
really dedicated to them these aren't
necessarily games the like I'm into but
right it's pretty cool I think there's a
lot of people out there that like have a
fondness for games but really just from
like this era of like early 90s and for
those people if you dig like
civilization check it out freeciv or
open red alert you know who knows
there'll probably be
down tomorrow but get it while you can
get it get it while the getting's get it
while you can it's pretty cool all right
excellent check out product contact calm
/ games time for the subreddit portion
of our program go to reddit.com / r /
240 for each week we post a show thread
where you can submit questions and
comments that we will address at the end
of each weekly episode bulu jenkins
rights in fresh dick friday on the 404
super awesome yep it's gonna go to
alliteration be especially friday for a
while so these are questions about the
game destiny ok Lou Jenkins says have
the expansions and update / changes to
destiny kept either of you hate playing
the game or have you completed your
destiny rehab and shut it down are any
of the expansions from the past and the
future worth returning to the game good
question and this is very timely because
I am right now in a destiny hiatus after
eight months of playing thank God I am
NOT playing destiny we had a life pretty
nice to be able to take a break even
though I did enjoy a while I was playing
it had the expansions changed so it's
interesting thus alas expansion that
came out had all these features the
community wanted all these upgrades
where you could like upgrade old guns
that you had to the like max power
levels and you could like bring them out
of storage and it was like amazing and
super cool and the end results of that
is that everyone upgraded their favorite
guns and then had zero motivation to
play any of the new content so is this
like really thoughtful nice thing to do
for community that was already
disenchantment widespread disenchantment
Oh Mike they did add a very cool mode
called trials of Osiris which is a very
intense throughout three mode that if
you love multiplayer and have like two
other people that love multiplayer it is
tremendous and super super fun but other
than that it's been hard for me to get
motivated yeah I played taken king and
l3 what do you think of that really
enjoyed what I play yeah but there's
still a lot of question marks like how
much like am I going to be able to carry
over from the old game is it even good
for me to carry stuff over because
again it might just make me lose all my
motivation god I'm so good it's a fun
game they are they are well made games
they're well made but and they have
gotten better over time from what it's a
slow burn a destination slow it launched
very weak I am just so glad to not be a
part yeah it's i'm glad that i have a
multiplayer game yeah that like i play
on the right because it's literally it
like other splatoon that's true you
could get into cook yet in splatoon but
like this is good to have like a game
that i can play with friends sure it's
like a social experience like playing
good it's great but nerdier but we know
you don't like golf I actually do like
up I'm just bad at it well yes Side
Story Russ and I one time played around
to golf and and when it involved a great
deal of rust picking up his ball in
throwing it towards the green very
effective hey followed by F this game
yeah and yeah a falcon ultra says how
was your guys's fourth of July weekend
did I bring Dylan out to see some
fireworks question did Dylan freak out
no that was he is caused by some idiot
saaphyri yeah like he heard him I think
he's too young to be freaked out like
he's at the point he's only three months
old so he's at the point where anything
startles this kid sure like the fan the
ceiling fan freaks him out yeah uh so
you know I I'll grab his foot know be
like oh yeah holy dead yeah you're
quick so the long as it's sustained
right that becomes normal like his his
entire existence is a non-stop cavalcade
of stimulant yeah right so he's just
constantly taking the world in 24 hours
a day uh eight hours a day this guy's
not for a lot he said he slept nine
hours last wow so he's he's well on his
way to becoming the the lazy dad that I
am yeah so anyway he um you know he was
out we had a BBQ that I was at in my
hometown we did we had a nice little
thing we passed the myrrh and it was a
nice experience all my extended friends
and family got to meet him that was a
lot of fun and then we drove back to
hoboken that night and the cool thing
about that is when you know you make
that drive towards Manhattan me
you know where Hoboken is uh you know we
left like nine o'clock at night on the
right way that's great and the whole way
back you all you do is see fireworks we
had the sunroof open and we're just
having our own fireworks display the
entire 40 minute drive back to of the
city you weren't driving you were your
stick your head out of the roads you can
kind of just look up the whole time or
not worry as long as you have ez pass
you're sure you don't have to look any
GPS how about you how was James good i
hung out with my girlfriend's family out
in Long Island and you know it was a lot
of fun we had a good time good weather
surprisingly was supposed to be gross
had some fireworks and there was also a
small baby there that didn't seem to
care about the fireworks so I know
that's probably on par I think you know
and I and Marty doesn't carry their
martyr doesn't care about anything well
he does if you touch him always sleeping
he freaks it well if you touch me while
I'm sleeping I'll probably freak out
well we'll see how it pans out we'll see
how that pans out tonight um and uh the
great thing about him is like he took me
a thunderstorm yeah yeah he's like
whatever he's like an old man yes oh man
old soul finally we'll finish this off
with flying donkey 04 was very active in
our subreddit appreciate that flying
donkey up big big news at ed three was
the remake of a classic Final Fantasy
game Final Fantasy 7 yeah so he uses
that and says hey is final fantasy 7 is
that remake another sign that we are in
a wave of 90s nostalgia and we are and
I'll get two more that as well you know
music games TV shows fashion where the
nineties really that great or will we
realize that it just seemed great
because we were kids during that decade
we just don't know anybody yeah it
happens every single time like every
decade this happens contrary to what
he's saying I think we're actually at
the tail end of the 90s nostalgia
happening I still think 80 stuff is
still pretty popular it's but I think
it'll be as like it it's sort of
stabilized like I think it'll just be as
popular for a while as it's been yeah in
the same way that like 70s like rock
music is still popular you know what I
mean though you're seeing
there's always be a place for it in
culture but will not be as dominant
front as it is whereas right now it
feels like 90 s like cultural references
and stuff like that have really taken
over I think it's more early 90 stuff
because I feel like halfway through the
90s then 90 the 80s hangover left
because a lot of this stuff yeah if you
and we it's funny we there's a lot of
overlap with yesterday's B's guess but
we talked about this thing called
vaporwave yeah you know what that is now
vaporwave is like that 90's nostalgy
late eighties nostalgic um aesthetic
works like shitty clipart oh yeah
windows 95 like those freaky frizzy
clubs yeah like you know pixelated
characters and you know lots of neon I
think like Nittis ya think of the
opening credits to save by the bell and
that's exactly where it is weird Square
and weird you know odd things quiggily
Nickelodeon double dare ya you know
think of that oh so you're saying that
fashion is like sort of back now and the
music so like you look at like calm
throughs you look at kavinsky basically
the soundtrack to drive yeah where it's
like taking this synth infused sort of
thing and turning it on its head and
believe it or not mtv has just gone
through a whole rebranding is that
exactly yeah there's a motherboard which
is vice is sort of tech branch did a
whole piece on that so you can check
that out and about thing yeah it's well
that's especially funny because you
would think mtv would be going after
like the 12 13 year old crowd yeah but
no but they're digging this yeah they
find some sort of like you know for its
to them it's probably like what the 60s
and 70s were to us where it's like we
did a Billabong and entire like tie-dye
to us yeah this is to that slap
bracelets yeah which apparently are
still popular oh yeah up so excellent
