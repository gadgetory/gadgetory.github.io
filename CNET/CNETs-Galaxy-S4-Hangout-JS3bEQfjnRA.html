New York actually where the phone
launched at an event last night and i'm
joined by kent german in san francisco
hello how are you I'm tired yes I
imagine you were up pretty late last
night yeah I was it's been a busy couple
of days but a good couple of days and
the event started I guess they do this
we're not accustomed to event starting
so late in San Francisco but i guess in
New York this just happens all the time
it's normal to have a seven o'clock
start okay well um it was a very
interesting event wasn't it it was
extremely interested I was live blogging
it with Roger and we were expecting
something because it was the Radio City
Music Hall but I don't think we were
expecting quite the theatrics that we
got where Samsung was basically creating
its own Broadway show in order to tell
the story in the futures at the galaxy
s4 we seriously everybody who's there
char tip can Maggie Riordan Sarah to on
photos everybody pretty much thought
that we were going to have the Rockettes
because this was their venue but um yeah
didn't show up yes now I wanted I want
to broadcast dresses into Android
costumes you know are with green
androids dancing in a line I think
that'd be pretty cool it's kind of like
dude you okay lion right there yeah
that's one good that would have been
something to talk about um you know
another thing that we were saying around
the office is that you know how they
have a whole campaign and they had the
kid Jeremy in his box so here's kind of
play a pivotal role but what we were
thinking is how cool would it have been
if they had to actually instead chosen
to extend the whole super bowl
commercials and have supper again and
Paul Rudd there actually that would have
been very cool I didn't like the sacral
commercials another kind of funny but I
eat I actually thought that the prequel
to the super bowl commercial like the
teaser post I thought that was better
than the Super Bowl commercial they had
yeah I'd agree on alright so I got you
got the has a chance to handle the phone
yeah I checked out the phone before the
event and that was pretty cool and we
were really rushed for to him there were
a lot of people in there and there were
a lot of different journalists to go
through so it definitely didn't have
quite as much
I'm you know I could have spent hours
they're looking at the phone there were
so many features in there there's just
no way to digest them all in the short
amount of time that we had and even
afterwards seriously you could not
believe it we were sitting in these cues
right these rows in an auditorium and as
soon as it was over the MC said okay if
you're in the first like four rows come
to the ones in the front if you're
anybody else go to the ones in the back
well everybody took that to mean why
don't we just go in this massive cattle
call to the ones in the front so I had
to push and shove and elbow people out
of the way just to get out of the row we
were just trapped yeah and I heard that
it was hard to get out exactly it was
yeah I think that's why was there so
long I just couldn't leave pinned in
well so you know a lot of people are
asking about the release date and it
seems like we you know we know a window
right but we just don't know exactly
when that's going to be correct correct
last night was a global release and
launched so they didn't want to well in
one way they didn't want to preference
any region by saying it's going to be
launched blah blah blah sometimes they
do that which tells me that they also
just don't have it we do have the window
of q2 so that's basically April and May
samsung did say that they wanted to try
to release the phone as quickly as
possible in as many markets as possible
so hopefully not where we saw like May
first for the galaxy s3 or May eleventh
whatever it was last year and then you
know middle of June for the u.s.
hopefully it will be a little bit
tighter and won't be able to see those
phones in other markets because it's the
worst thing if the phone that you want
shows up somewhere else months or weeks
before you can get it well that's really
the that's that's really one thing I was
hoping for this phone i mean i was even
looking beyond the specs and I said
Samsung really needs to release this to
a lot of carriers in a lot of markets
and do it quickly and then all at the
same time so we have this you know we
don't have the scenario where it's
verizon gets it may 14-18 t gets it may
twenty first and then you know t-mobile
gets at me 28 and then and then in the
meantime retardation yes yeah and then
in the meantime somebody else has
released another phone that distracts us
away from that one I don't know why they
do that I think for production reasons
but it just seems like it would be
everyone to follow apples model
announced the phone one week send it out
the next week yeah so we still don't
know so and we if you mind right into
the carriers so for people that don't
know the carriers that are going to get
it in the US at least yeah US carrier so
it's going to be the major big for
carrier so that's verizon AT&amp;amp;T sprint
and t-mobile / metro right since they're
merging and also US cellular which got
the galaxy s3 and the note 2 last time
and then cricket is getting it right off
the bat too and then actually also can't
you wrote about ting getting it yeah
this is a bizarre story because you know
this was the night before that we this
is the night before they haven't even
happened and you know when we knew the
galaxy s4 was coming but you know all of
samsung instead of the invitation was
the next galaxy phone so feeling on
actually it could have been anything it
could have been a tablet it could have
been something else but and this carrier
ting which is a MVNO that uses spread
service so an MVA now if you don't know
as a mobile virtual network operator
that's a that's a carrier like horizon
I'm not with sorry verizon virgin like
boost where they don't operate their own
solo network basically they rent space
from a cellular network and they roll it
out to answer them and then they usually
have phones that are around a specific
theme you know virgin is sort of like
youth-oriented boosters tend to be a
little more budget models but anyway
ting said the night before the event we
are going to carry the galaxy s4 when it
comes out in a few weeks time and we're
going to have the galaxy s3 mini and the
HTC One you know which is a new phone so
even before the night even for the event
we a carrier saying hey we're going to
get it which was just odd because
usually that never happens and I don't
know whether though is you know maybe
they had an agreement of rice or Samsung
to do that err maybe they just said you
know we're just gonna do it ourselves
because we want to drum up some
publicity and of course they were very
successful in that because I wrote a
story but it was it was just a very odd
thing about it um and it's wise that
spurt was going to get it because
they've gotten the note 2 and they've
gotten the galaxy s3 so they were
obviously going to get this phone yeah
so anyway we'll see it a lot of phones
which is good um in a lot of carriers
yeah yes so
oh wait I know we're getting some
questions and seems like Matthew was
wondering about and this is a question I
have because it seems like it's not
quite sure what's going on with it yet
so we have two months like the galaxy s3
where we had two different models we had
a 1.5 gigahertz version for the u.s.
that was LTE and then we had a 2 Giga
heard right was to get hers that was not
processor and so we have two processors
in this phone you can you know two
versions of it so what are we going to
see in which market do you do we know
that yet samsung hasn't said anything
really they have just said that there's
going to be the quad core Qualcomm
Snapdragon first they said fusion pro
and then Qualcomm just literally 10
minutes ago released a statement saying
that it's going to be the Snapdragon 600
series which was announced at CES we're
trying to find out you know all these
things like why the discrepancy y will
be quad-core for some and why it will be
the octa-core the Exynos 5 octa that
Samsung's own ship in other markets and
we're not sure which market gets wet so
if we find the answer to the question of
what the difference is between those
chipsets it could be the cdma radio it
could be LTE my guess is that the u.s.
is going to get the Paul conversion just
based on sort of what we've seen in the
past with the u.s. getting Qualcomm and
elsewhere getting something else and
usually that's an LTE issue even though
Google global LTE roaming will be a
possibility with this phone I don't
actually know which version I tested out
the same time representatives that I was
exposed to didn't seem to know what was
in the phones that I was testing and to
be honest we weren't testing games we
were really testing and doing and so it
seemed fast but it there I mean there
are a couple benchmarks out right now I
don't really know how useful those are
because this was still pre production
software so i think that when we
actually get the full device in for
review as one will be able to sit down
and really contemplate the processing
speeds yeah cuz you don't have enough
time really to run a lot of spin marking
tests or anything so i didn't have time
to really test the camera mm-hmm it was
more like let's quick
look at all the new features and now
please leave yes what so what exactly
I've heard a company will assess what
exactly is an octa-core phone our
process Iranian right so instead of so
quad-core processor has for application
processing course CPUs basically unless
one has eight so maybe that would octa
but you never know great in theory I
always imagined an octopus I don't know
it's like an octa-core phone and I think
about like all these tentacles coming
out of the phone anyway um well I device
anyone listening to Jessica wrote a
really good piece as part of her
smartphone some large column a few
months ago there's miss about quad core
phones and you know we think that I
think that quad core phones are
automatically can be faster about
everything and so well tweet that out a
little bit when we're done but it's a
pretty good piece about quad core phone
so I heard you to read it give you some
background thanks yeah so in theory it's
supposed to be much faster but in
practice it really just depends on the
quality of everything and how well it
all works together sure you know you
mentioned LTE roaming that's something
that I'm really interested in about this
phone is cuz you know LT mark lt's it's
you know in the US has been around for a
while it's it's gaining in other markets
you know we have seen at office in
singapore UK asia australia and they're
getting to get LT more there but one
thing that you know we see with a lot of
LTE phones and this was true with the
iphone 5 is that it wasn't necessarily
transferable so if you had an LTE you
could take the you could take the iphone
5 overseas you can make calls you can
send data but you're going to be on 3g
most of the time even if there's LTE in
those markets LTE roaming sounds like a
pretty big deal and if they can make it
work yeah but we don't know a lot of
specifics right about where we're like
if i have a US phone for instance one
from AT&amp;amp;T for instance would i be able
to take it to UK would i be able to take
it and use it in france or Australia so
we don't know those specific my guess is
more Asia like Korea for example and and
you know are these the same bands that
are being used will it be supported it
sounds like it will be because that's
what they're trying to do here so my
hopes are high there yeah I think it's
pretty cool though I'm really interested
in that that you could get the same data
speeds um and pay for them of course
just wherever you go yeah yeah
and one question I think it's
interesting is Maurice del Prado is
asking one concern I have is that the s4
has too many features eyeball tracking
gestures that will make it slow and
prone to problems and you've written
about this a little bit that Samsung and
this is a typical Samsung thing you said
in your first take of they just kind of
throw everything in the phone and not
that that's necessarily a bad thing but
do you think we could suffer from future
overload and almost having just so that
things get lost in the details so to
speak definitely and that's a risk that
Samsung's taking it's a calculated risk
for them because their hope is that
either the majority of people or some
people will really glom onto one feature
or another future and that for them will
make the difference between buying that
phone or loving mouth phone or buying
another phone or ditching the galaxy s4
short tip kenna has written about this
to a really good article that I believe
she updated today as well about how
Samsung can control its feature itís
doesn't seem like Samsung wants to
control a feature I this but it's
definitely a problem you know and then
you have something like the eyeball
tracking that I think really captures
everybody's imagination but in reality
this is a very minor an optional feature
that in my experience worked okay but
not great and part of that could have
also just been done its pre-release
software part of it might be because
that's just the way that it works it
just depends i tried one camera feature
and on the test unit that I had it
didn't work at all I couldn't make it
work Samsung people can make it work
you're like well it works on this one
and it did because they just showed it
to me on that one but that's not the one
that I had in my hand so some of these
features if we can sort of get the idea
of them now but it won't be anything
really concrete until again we get the
phone in our hands but as for all of the
features I agree sometimes I even forget
how to do it there's this one called
group play and it's basically if you get
all of your samsung galaxy s4 phones
together in a room you can I guess do
simultaneously or do simultaneous
gameplay in a room share music share
videos share photos so there has been
something like this before it was like a
group cast or a group chair I do like
that idea kind of music just because
just thought of having surround town in
a room so I could picture that for a
party but everybody has to have a galaxy
s4 and the same taste in music exactly
well it's funny this phone Sam sensing
something big everyone that uses is or
everyone that uses it has a lot of
friends like that you're always
surrounded by 20 people that you want to
share all of your life with but yeah I
also just remember one of the use case
scenarios from the galaxy s3 we're like
the scenario is we're all at a concert
but we're standing in different places
and we want to see what it looks like
from each other's viewpoint mm-hmm I
just thought like that just seems so
silly because whatever happened I've
never been able to devise reasons for
that feature or some other ones like it
but I guess what guess it's cool but
it's there maybe enjoy your own view not
someone else that's right um so what
about which we think about this phone I
got this question actually today is is
it if you're a galaxy s3 owner and let's
just say for instance that you are at a
place in your contract we can extend a
contract and get the discount on this
phone you know they're all these
carriers have different rules
surrounding by that but do you think
it's worth an upgrade my thought is not
really uh you know maybe if it's you can
get a really good discount on it but I
don't see a lot in this phone that would
make me stitch it and go upgrade if I
had an s3 I agree with you I mean it's
hard to say because I do and am
definitely lured by the next new thing
but in terms of features i wouldn't
spend any money really because i don't
think that the future differences are
that great and some of the new software
features are supposed to be able to come
to the galaxy s3 so for example there's
the Google s voice drive no not Google
sorry what am I saying it's s voice it's
samsung s voice drive so it's basically
a dedicated driving doc app and you can
give voice commands and pull up the
weather call somebody hands-free and
navigate to a certain location so it's a
break away from the google earth i keep
saying Google why am I saying Google
from the samsung s voice and that
specific
for cars and maybe I kept saying Google
because s voice in my experience with it
previously was really terrible and it
was a lot worse than google voice
actions and a lot worse than Apple Siri
but I did talk to some Samsung
representatives last night and I tried
out the future briefly and they said
that they've put a lot of work into
improving s voice now I was testing a
driving app sitting in the middle of an
auditorium and could not even get any
GPS signal so really there are
limitations to what my tests could cover
um but it is one of those things I guess
um but again if that comes to the galaxy
s3 then you don't mean by the galaxy s4
what is your as far as the best voice I
know that that was one of your big
issues when your Galaxy s3 review that
you just think it didn't it just didn't
quite cut it as far as its effectiveness
as far as you know how you can use it so
did you and you said they've made
improvements did you get any specifics
on what they might have improved not yet
I'm working on that ok yeah it was one
of those features were like why I don't
understand why they spent all that
effort and money ain't paying engineers
researching it they probably paid
partners on the back end they could all
of that effort into creating a product
that just really wasn't anywhere nearly
as good as Google's which was already on
the phone part of the reason is because
Samsung is just all about
differentiation differentiation and
getting ahead of the competition and
offering something new they kind of want
to steal some of Google's thunder Roger
Cheng has written about that as well and
you see that happening but I think
they're also trying to play the long
game with this in mind and maybe other s
voice implementations in mind for future
releases is that they're going to start
with something they don't care if it's
that bad because they'll improve it and
then they'll create something that
people actually want to use yeah well
and Samsung I think more than some other
some other Android manufacturer hansard
manufactures really likes to put a lot
of their own stuff in here and in these
phones I mean you know HTC certainly has
its own customized interface but we tend
to like that one a little better and
Motorola thankfully has moved away from
motoblur so this distinction be a
typical Samsung thing and for someone to
follow Samsung like yourself I mean
GG would you agree with that um yeah I
would definitely so a couple people are
asking about and we'll circle back to
this for a second you know we we don't
know exactly if the eight-core octa-core
is going to come to the u.s. samsung us
and provided that information and
hopeful egg it looks like we might get
the the Qualcomm chip in it that's what
you said correct yeah but at the same
time you know for the galaxy s3 we got
the Qualcomm tip instead of the Samsung
chip but for the galaxy note 2 we got
the samsung chip so sometimes for my
understanding is that the first go
around on the chips you don't get
everything you want and then as it gets
developed they are able to add
everything so it might be that for
future devices we do get that octa-core
I think that's what Samsung wants but
then again you know Qualcomm is also
probably going to follow suit they're
just a little bit slower well I think
that I think again it just seems like a
chip is something you shouldn't really
concentrate you shouldn't focus on too
much like as far as that's your
make-or-break spec because even this
Qualcomm chip is going to be really fast
where I mean yeah examine the jump up to
I octa-core is you may not it's really
not enough to be sort of a deal breaker
i mean you're gonna want LTE on this
phone you're going to want to make sure
that it's out to a lot of people are a
lot of carriers and yeah that is price
well but it has so much else that I
think the chip is something that we can
you know still disappointing if we don't
get the top one but I wouldn't make it a
deal breaker certainly yeah I completely
agree so here's one question from
clifton PO about motion tracking and
gestures which i would love to talk
about so he asks will it be a standard
on high-end phones this year or just
something on samsung phones and actually
LG tried to jump the gun a little bit by
announcing this yesterday and the LG
optimus g ro ro ro yes oh yeah actually
announced that the day before right so
there were all of these rumors i wrote
about them Shara wrote about them all
these rumors about it and then as soon
as LG released that announcing that
their phone would have it too that's
when I thought a hot they definitely
think that
this is going to be in the device or
they have knowledge that it's going to
be in the device because they are
pre-empting so there are already a lot
of gestures motion gestures especially
that are already in phones we've already
seen some hands-free gestures to where
if you wave your hand above basically I
think it's the camera that's sensing it
if you wave your hand above and it will
advance through your gallery something
like that so we've seen some of these
some work better than others a lot of
Samsung's motions and just really annoy
me okay there's one where it's like tilt
to Pam and all of these little alerts
come up all the time and you have to say
never show me this alert again and then
no I don't want it you can always go
into the settings and get it too but I
just don't think it's very natural
because your hand moves every which way
when you're holding phone it Jocelyn
sometimes you don't want to tilt to pan
you just want to do it yourself so I
think that some of them are good I
really like the one where if you're
looking at the screen while a video is
playing and then you look away it will
pause because I think that there is
actually a use case for that so yes I
think that motions and gestures are
going to be part of the experience but i
think that smart motions and gestures
make more sense enter some of those have
been around for a long time like
flipping your phone over to muta call
yeah i mean sony ericsson ericsson had
those in phones god you know when like
2007-2008 I remember it's the S plane
with those so that's been around a long
time I do have to say Samsung's the
first that i know of that's actually
used sort of the eye tracking feature
and that was actually in the samsung
galaxy s3 with a little thing called
smart stay where if the screen started
dimming and you looked at it then it
would stop dimming oh that's right
remember that yeah and that's that's
here too they've just expanded it
Randall's asking Randall Evans was
asking if I ball tracking can be it
could be go to mobile ads so if you look
away like a mobile ads plane if you look
away and then it will start playing
again I wouldn't put it past them but
yeah what to see very astute yes uh yeah
there's I so was i can't remember two
weeks ago i think i was right before
more will congress so they begin this
month HTC just introduced the one which
is there a big new smartphone and if you
followed yesterday's press conference
GC his Twitter account was sitting out
some snarky very snarky tweets
surrounding the event about calling it
off off off Broadway and so forth but
the question from Dustin and Justin
Murphy is how would you compare it to
the HTC One personally I haven't held
the HTC One yet but Brian Bennett who
works in New York and covers phones with
us he's held it and you know everyone is
very positive on the HTC one's design as
far as its aluminum body and this young
with galaxy phone samsung a common theme
throughout them as they use plastic and
samsung says that they do that for they
can mass mark thick for keep them cheap
they can it's an easier material to work
with to really make the devices mass
market and distribute them but you know
those those metal phones do feel a lot
better they feel a lot more secure and
but Jessica you've held both of them
correct both phones yeah um I was very
excited I cornered Brian and forced him
to give me the HTC One and
overwhelmingly you look at the phone
you're just like wow that's a nice
device it looks really good it does look
premium and it's the kind of fun that
you want to hold and as much as it
doesn't matter what's on the outside of
the phone it matters what's on the
inside sometimes it really just comes
down to which phone do you want to hold
and i found this with the HTC windows
phone 8x and the nokia lumia 920 the
Lumia 920 has the better lots of stuff
you know it's more advanced the camera
was better you know sort of like smaller
details but the HTC when his phone 8x
was the one that I wanted to hold in my
hand there's just something about the
design and the materials and finish that
really drew me so it doesn't matter I
think you're right i mean I the plastic
turns out is pretty durable in most
situations but there is a nice
psychological thing about having a
middle phone in your hands it just feels
a little weighty and as you see
throughout its history is always built
pretty well crafted devices there's the
g1 well there was that but if we can
give them a pass on that it was the
first android phone there's a lot of
things about that they weren't great but
that was their opportunity to wow
everyone instead they made this thing
with the boldest chin and a stupid
keyboard trough and I hated it how that
flips kind of up and over it was very
strange but we'll see and welcome as
soon as we get both
devices review you know will certainly
do a good evaluation between them well
one thing that strikes me too is that
HTC was very intelligent in pre-empting
Samsung I think to show we're not just
following we're also innovating too
because what they did they already have
some of those camera features like the
one where if you jump and it shows every
stage of your jump samsung just
announced that but HTC has that they
have a video you know and still picture
option and they actually have an IR
blaster as well so they have that TV
controlling capability it's actually
built into i believe it's built into the
power button on the front so that's even
better design I think yeah yeah I said
it was uh and then we're HTC people
walking through the line when you were
getting there I've heard I heard that
but my side of the building everything
was complete and total chaotic madness
there were apparently three different
media lines but four different kinds of
media so we were originally in the
broadcast media line and then we were
told to leave we had a little past that
was supposed to give us an faster so
they told us to leave and go to a
different line so it was like Roger and
I went with some of our other crew to a
different side of the line and then
Shara and Maggie stayed in their line
but then they were kicked out of their
line and moved to another line but then
they still got in there first it was
awful but apparently on their side of
the building HTC was passing out
Pringles and water it's a very odd
combination for a cold day but it was
really smart because it was five o'clock
six o'clock and i'll be here over the
loudspeaker is that you can't bring in
food or water so charred Roger were
saying or char was saying that a lot of
people didn't actually accept the snacks
because they were so concerned about
getting in and it turns out I snuck in
lots of snacks in my backpack and it was
fine that was just sort of the default
rules but when we got to the fight after
the event they gave us all lunch bags
with food in it you could call it food
it wasn't very good food but I mean it's
not like there was a new food rule but
anyway I thought it was a really smart
move by HTC they also had a el visit LG
who had their time square spoofs as well
oh yeah you know and one thing we have
to consider with the HTC one of course
is that Samsung
has a tremendous amount of money and to
market this phone to distribute bit to
advertise it everywhere it wants to and
it's advertising budget is a lot bigger
than HTC's and it's reached its ability
to reach people it's a lot bigger and
you know that certainly shouldn't define
it certainly shouldn't be a real
determinant as far as what phone is more
successful but in fact it is so that's
one that's a big thing that HTC is gonna
have to work in against it especially
with the one it can get it out to as
many carriers in as many places and as
quickly even if it was a better device
then that's really going to be a
struggle for HTC so Roger had a really
great coup he spoke to HTC president
jason mackenzie last night right after
the event and every competitor was
watching this you better believe that LG
nokia HTC they were all watching this
and probably equally so he actually got
quoted saying i went from laughing
feeling embarrassed about the
presentation and it goes on to tell how
here i want to find this exact quote but
it was something like each according to
HTC Samsung spends like more than three
times the combined budget Wow all the
way editor's I'm still trying to find
out where it is but it's something like
that you guys should find the article
