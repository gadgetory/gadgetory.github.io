vehicles cars are integrating all kinds
of new technologies all the time
Ford has made a commitment to build
fully autonomous cars for the purpose of
ride-sharing in 2021 however a new
patent to Filan shed some light on some
other technology Ford is working on the
patent title is method and apparatus for
crowd-sourced vehicle identification
here's how the system would work the
system would be able to obtain an image
of a vehicle plate then it would
identify the characters on that plate
here's where people start thinking twice
about the tech the license plate tag
would be checked against a database of
sought vehicle plates if there's a match
of a sought vehicle and that license
plate the system would report it the
patent says the system would even be
able to check partial images of plates
so in theory if his tech was in many
vehicles those cars could act in concert
to consistently check license plates all
the time
Ford also outlined a potential business
model for this tech here's what the
patent says for example in one model use
of the vehicle tracking may be free if a
user participates in finding other
vehicles but may cause some nominal
amount if the user wants the service
side only without participating and
locating other vehicles that could mean
that if this tech does reach a four
vehicle the company could incentivize
people into allowing their cars to
participate in the tracking network now
this is just a patent not some grand
announcement that Ford will track all
the cars ever so stay calm for now if
