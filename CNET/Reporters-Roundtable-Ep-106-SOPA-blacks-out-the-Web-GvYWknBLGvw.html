edition of reporters roundtable and
welcome back to San Francisco this is
our first show in 2012 back in San
Francisco studio we were at CES last
week of course I was planning on
starting round table this year on Friday
in our normal slot but there's so much
happening today that we had to do a show
today on SOPA the Stop Online Privacy
Act and PIPA what does people stand for
protect IP act yeah anyway these are
both two really important pieces of
legislation that are heading two votes
very shortly and in protest of these
these bills which I'm sure you've heard
of several rather major sites have gone
dark they've black themselves out to say
we protest these at these these bills
and we will be at back online tomorrow
until then we're doing this to show you
how important this stuff is to us now to
talk about what these protests mean what
effect they are having what this means
for the future of the Internet in the
future of this legislation we have two
great guests both joining us by Skype
first of all our chief political
correspondent for CNN news it's Declan
McAuliffe Declan thank you so much for
joining us thanks and also joining us
from the electronic frontier foundation
is activist Trevor Timm Trevor how many
jobs can you have where you get paid to
be an activist I mean I might have one
of the only ones but you're lucky man it
must be fun interesting oh especially
now so it's a very exciting day today is
January the what is it the 18th January
18th the day wikipedia went black the
way today craigslist went dark the day
Google censored its own logo a gentleman
declan first what why are these sites
doing this what is behind these protests
well this is uh what could be a historic
moment in the history of internet
politics and maybe even American
politics this is pretty remarkable the
reason
the sites are going dark and you're
seeing all of Wikipedia go offline if
you're a student well-being of your
homework a day early is to protest to
stop off of the Stop Online Piracy actor
and the protect IP act which
collectively would create kind of an
Internet blacklist this is a list of
copyright holders and the Department of
Justice would come up with that would
get court orders and then the US
Internet service providers comcast ATT
whatever you use at home you just
couldn't get to these sites anymore
these are would be primarily offshore
sites that are accused of infringing
piracy and so there are some free speech
problems with that but how we can go
into those later that's kind of a
high-level view and the protest is has
been planned for a few weeks and it's
actually having some impact already you
have five four senators so far today or
sponsors of protect IP say oh yeah okay
and no more we're withdrawing our names
it's fascinating stuff Trevor from the
eff what first of all was the eff
involved in organizing or being a part
of it in any way of this joint to
protest yeah we've been working behind
the scenes on this for a couple weeks
ever since we found out that it might
happen Retta of course started it a few
weeks ago and then Wikipedia followed
which is great they're the six largest
US site they get 25 million hits a day
and you've seen it already with the
congressmen and Senators coming out
against this bill today I think the last
count was 29 congressman had said they
would oppose the bill today that they
were either for the bill before or
hadn't made a decision and I think that
numbers a couple hours old and there's
been a few more 14 Rhode Island and one
from Maryland since we've been on the
air um so it they're falling like
dominoes so what's blacked out today and
and and when does this end we talked
about Wikipedia and craigslist being two
very big ones pop URLs reddit a huge
site social site is down any other big
sites that are they're not down to
excuse me they're blacked and in fact on
wikipedia it's very interesting because
you'll sheet you'll see a flash of a
page and then you'll get this pop-up
page in front sayin you know we're off
for the day any other big sites that are
today well wired is protesting BuzzFeed
is protesting all an eff I've is showing
solidary by darkening our whole website
all in all I think there's about seven
thousand sites that are currently doing
this there is an easy easy widget you
can get for your wordpress personal blog
it can black it out very easily and it's
great because you know a lot of the tech
world have have known about these bills
in the dangers for a few months but it's
the ordinary Americans that were that
we're really trying to target with this
because as you might have read many of
the network news casts have been
basically ignoring these bills even
though it's been the talk of the tech
industry for a couple months and finally
people you know if there's 25 million
people going to Wikipedia day you know
there's going to be millions literally
to learn about this for the first time
and we're seeing this the the so-called
network TV blackout kind of fade away
tonight actually our own Julie Samuels
is going to be on ABC world news tonight
so and then obviously we saw this
morning on the front page the New York
Times Washington Post LA Times USA today
was all about the protests so it's
really captured the imagination of the
public I think declan any surprises of
the event the effect of these black got
any surprises if these are having well
let's see uh it would have been pretty
easy for google.com and amazon com
facebook com and so on to say here's how
to contact your member of Congress we
use geolocation to try to serve you ads
we know that you're in a Palo Alto over
San Francisco or whatever and it'll
throw bad that are irrelevant to you and
then you could have really overwhelmed
the switchboard get could have found
this could have been a really historic
day when it comes to really pressuring
Congress putting the screws to members
of Congress but instead they chose a
milquetoast approach it was google's
let's just have a petition these on a
petition like if you remember how i do
you hear about petition hear what calls
to your office and the amazon has had a
link to a trade association facebook
just how to walk
from Mark Zuckerberg and so they could
have done much more wikipedia did do
more but that they didn't it wasn't
quite the nuclear option that I wrote
about last month instead it was just
maybe a heavy artillery option and so
when I talked to members of Congress
because the switchboard was still up and
running they reported heavy volume but
some said well you know we've had worse
when it's abortion or gun writing
something like that we've had lot more
calls and we've and they I heard numbers
between three hundred and four thousand
calls today to members of Congress or
senators that's but that's a piece
that's a lot but it's not millions so
there was enough of an effect so the
withdrawal of support by key members of
Congress is a direct response to these
blackouts today is it not it is but
let's also put in perspective you had 41
sponsors of say the Senate protect IP
bill going into today now we have 40 1-4
so in other words it had the ten percent
impact of ninety percent of the sponsors
are still saying we like it and they
might be saying we like it was
reservation to certainly know what's
going on but it's not like it's half of
them dropped off or something like that
so since these these congressmen and
women are now expressing reservations
about this bill will that cause the vote
for this or for this legislation to be
delayed in any way or is it going to be
redrafted and go to a vote on schedule
well we don't know yet it's a very fluid
situation Senator Harry Reid said on me
depressed earlier this week that oh yeah
we're going forward with the floor vote
which is scheduled for January 24th the
day after the Senate returns from its
holiday recess and in terms of the house
and the sofa bill its author a
representative Lamar Smith said
yesterday yeah we're going ahead with a
committee vote as scheduled next month
we're gonna get this reported out and
move to the House floor as soon as we
can Republican leadership is having some
second thoughts about how it's going to
happen it
real things it's just too early to say
uh Trevor from the FF you guys are
tracking all these sites that are
protesting the PPA and SOPA when is this
are these protests going to end or is
this going to pick up steam and are are
we going to see tomorrow being what's
tomorrow going to look like on the web
when the 24-hour blackouts are supposed
to end on the big sites um well I mean
these are going to be continuous
protests obviously the sites won't be
blacking out like they are today but we
plan on continuing this fight because as
Declan said the Senate is voting next
week I just want to push back in a
little bit of what he was saying um you
know it's been less than 24 hours since
this main protest started and we've seen
huge numbers google has a petition as
Declan said and it's gotten over four
million signatures today which is just
an astronomical number for being up for
what 12 16 hours now ah eff alone has
sent over 750,000 unique emails to
Congress today um and that's not
including the dozen other organizations
who are mobilizing people um you know
having 29 or 30 congressman's switch
their position and one day I think's
kind of a big deal and sicker so I
tremor sorry to interrupt but you got
four senators to switch their positions
out of 41 we're not talking about people
who've never never really liked it in
the first place we're talking about
actual sponsors listed on the bills web
web page you know one of the things I
very one of the things I'm very curious
about is uh declan to go back to that
point you're talking about sponsors of
this bill who in light of this internet
protest which is not even as big as it
could have been have changed their
positions kind of egg on their face for
maybe not reading the bill they
sponsored ahead of time or what's going
on with these with these folks I think
so my colleague our colleague Eleanor
Mills contacted all of the sponsors of
sofa in the house and I contacted all
the sponsors of protect IP and that's
why ever
I think a reasonably good feel for where
they stand and and how many are
defecting but it's thinking to think of
it this way I mean if you're a member of
Congress you've been supporting all
these MPAA are a back bills for the last
decade it's only since the DMCA since
the no electronic theft ackwards made
not a non-profit contrary infringing a
federal felony The Hollywood has kind of
got what they wanted there's been this
with one exception maybe the senator
senator Hollings build an implant copy
protection technology spit a ratchet
effect that noose tightening whatever
metaphor you want to use they're getting
what they want out of Congress and so if
you are if you want to cozy up to the
NPA or you think that you know maybe you
are a Republican you think property
rights extend due into intellectual
property rights you can there's little
cost a year ago in signing on to this
kind of legislation and you may have not
really paid close attention to it but
now there's a price to be paid this is
this is the real victory for the
internet if it actually pans out now I
want to talk about the loyal opposition
to these protests there are several
sites we in addition we mentioned
WordPress is another one who are very
vocally opposing these bills but there
are some sites and some people who are
taking either moderate positions or are
supporting it throwing the weight behind
these bills in fact or writing these
protests in particular some media
organizations a Trevor or Declan do you
want to talk about the opposition to
these protests I'm sure I can do the few
record not take it okay well like I was
saying before um you know all the
content companies which owned the the
major television networks have been
against these bills for a long time it's
kind of turned into a you know internet
community tech sector versus Hollywood
and the NPA has come out and said today
that you know these protests haven't
really worked because they didn't get
the big sites um but you know I think
that's a little disingenuous they're
trying to just put a spin on it given
that Google has a petition on their
front page which they've never done
before you know Wikipedia with their 25
million users
so you know they're trying to spin this
in in a sense to make it seem like you
know this is just a publicity stunt but
it's really getting people who have
never heard about these bills before to
act and that's all we can ask for you
know I think the problem is that when
people hear copyright a certain segment
of the population kind of tunes out
because there's always copyright bills
in Congress I believe since about
nineteen ninety-five there's been 32
bills that have been passed through
Congress that have strengthened
copyright protections and so you know
they didn't realize how this is going to
affect ordinary Internet users is as
just law-abiding citizens who don't
infringe on copyright so hopefully
that's what we're getting out of this
that we're getting the people who
normally wouldn't pay attention to the
political process kind of jumping in and
making their voice heard Declan can you
discuss the wall street journal and also
Rupert Murdoch's opposition to these
protests as stunts oh no I mean I have a
lot of respect for the quality of
writing an argument on the wall street
journal editorial page agree with it or
not I probably do a half the time and
there's nice recently well well argued
editorial today I don't think they're
just carrying water for the content
industry I think that they're falling
into the trap that some conservatives do
and that is we like property rights this
is the this is a fundamental to a
conservative or libertarian position and
so therefore intellectual properties we
have to defend defend with the same
vigor but if there are some differences
we can talk with those in some detail
but and that's why this is something
that splits the conservative community
if the Heritage Foundation has expressed
concerns with the legislation the
libertarian groups like tech freedom
kato SI e I have as well when you have
other other groups some other
conservative groups including Americans
for Tax Reform concerned women for
america and lamar smith who represents a
conservative district in texas hill
country's got a 0% rating from they
around abortion rights group I mean this
is a conservative fellow but would be
supporting the legislation is so I one
more point and that is in terms of
Rupert Murdoch
can that I'm his twittering now that I
was just kind of kind of silly and he's
new to new to Twitter and was taking
some hot shots at Google on some of the
other companies that don't exactly like
this legislation now it's interesting
there are also voices in the middle
which I find very interesting for
example Twitter Ditka solo the CEO of
Twitter says closing a global business
in reaction to a single issue national
politics is foolish and that was on
where was that on quisitor I think I
found that an interesting quotation you
know there I think that that echoes some
of the derision against the protests
where some people have been saying that
shutting down Wikipedia or shutting down
our potentially Twitter or something
like that is I wouldn't call it a
national security issue but it's taking
down services that people rely on for
what other people see as grandstanding
it let's talk about the the moderate
position the Castello saying this is not
the right way to protest this issue yeah
I mean I I think he felt you even said
that he was kind of taken out of context
there yeah I think he was talking about
just Twitter and not Wikipedia and these
other sites in general but you know I
can understand his position because you
know Twitter's fundamentally different
service than Wikipedia Wikipedia you go
for information we're Twitter's kind of
a communications device and by I don't
even know if shutting down Twitter would
have been as effective as you know
millions of people tweeting about it
today and amplifying the message
Wikipedia is different because people go
there for other information and you know
they wouldn't normally hear about sopa
on Wikipedia unless they specifically
went there for that information so i
think you know twitter has done a lot
their general counsel has been writing
blog posts about the subject didn't come
out strongly against that they signed a
letter with the other big companies I'm
sorry Nestor I wouldn't necessarily
fault them for that but I also want to
go back to what Declan was saying about
this being a conservative issue because
I think it's a really good point out of
the 29 Congress people who have switched
or opposed the bill today 26 have
actually been Republican and a lot of
them are Tea Party leader leaders like
Marco Rubio from Florida or jim demint
from South Carolina even the long time
dude
sure a committee member orrin hatch from
Utah came out against this bill today
and he had been a co-sponsor before and
it's actually strangely becoming more of
a conservative issue than or republican
issue than a Democrat issue I you had
bred state the influential Tea Party
blog saying that they were basically
going to primary any Republican who was
going to support SOPA even if it meant
taking down some way they normally liked
um and so I think that kind of caused a
rift within the Republican Party and it
seems like they are coming out and mass
against it today at least for the
members that are usually associated with
the tea party declan do you think these
bills have any chance now that their
most loyal supporters are turning
against them not quite the most loyal
supporters I mean LT say members of
Congress and representing Hollywood
turning against this but I haven't I
will be whatever on this point and that
is that this is becoming them that all
of the Senators who called effective my
list of 41 today we're Republicans and
this is becoming kind of a partisan
issue generally copyright isn't but if
you look at the numbers now it's a I did
a google plus a post about this and it's
24 Democratic sponsors in the Senate and
ten Republican sponsors and that's
starting with Alexa 122.5 ratio mean
this is starting to become a democratic
bill and Republicans are I think they're
going to enjoy finding themselves in the
loyal opposition my colleague set our
colleague Seth reminds me that Al
Franken is a sponsor of protect IP and a
Senate which might surprise some of his
early supporters I I think Republicans
would actually have a lot of fun be able
to raise money the party of the internet
now the Democrats of the party in
Hollywood where would you rather be
where's the money where the votes
guessing yeah well this one off now as
we go ahead Trevor I was gonna say Al
Franken is is one of the craziest cases
out there when he was talking about net
neutrality he called it the greatest
free speech issue of our time and he
wrote an op-ed talking about how we
simply shouldn't give corporations any
control of the internet and now he here
here he is as a co-sponsor of
and he hasn't made any move toward
taking that back and you know obviously
these bills give corporations vast more
power to censor foreign websites so it's
just amazing that he couldn't say that
less than a year ago and and still not
come out against this bill now I want to
as we begin to wrap up here look at some
of the extreme positions on on these
bills and try to find the truth between
them on the one hand the mpaa sent out a
release today in the middle of all this
hullabaloo saying the protect IP act
narrowly defines an infringing website
is one dedicated to infringement that
has no significant use other than
engaging enabling or facilitating
infringement and no provision of protect
IP will shut off access to any site that
has any non-infringing use alright
that's what the NPA its supporters of
the bill is saying on the other hand you
have sites like pop girls which I
mentioned earlier which has gone dark
today this is a linked site a very
useful a great site i use it that says
in on its notification that the site is
offline this legislation protect IP
would put a site like this in trouble if
it linked to a web page anywhere online
that had any links to copyright
infringement which of these is true and
which of these is false ah well the NPA
is extremely exaggerating on their claim
that this this only affects foreign
websites and only sites that are you
know wholesale copyright infringement
you know that's just not true they have
taken out the most egregious provisions
and SOPA which would have given
corporations carte blanche to take up
take out any site in the u.s. even if it
was just one video out of a million that
we're copyright infringed but there are
a lot of a lot of provisions that still
apply to american sites for example the
immunity provision which gives ISPs
broad immunity to over block users is so
if the Justice Department is signaling
that they want that they get a court
order and say block the site if they
block more than that site they're immune
from from being sued over it they're
also they can also block sites
voluntarily and get immunity which means
corporations can essentially make a
backroom deal with these ISPs or if they
own them like Comcast and NBC
to shut off sites that they don't like
that might be competition and then
there's the anti-circumvention provision
which says not only can you not you know
these these sites will be censored but
anything to get around the bill and it's
censorship mechanisms will be censored
as well so that's where people are going
to have to start policing their own
sites for links and that's what
Wikipedia is worried about you know a
simple list of IP addresses of these
these block domains may be considered
under this anti-circumvention provision
and being joined by the Attorney General
so to say that these don't affect
American sites is pretty disingenuous
and what about the extreme position that
pop URLs which is a site has said that
links to other useful sites says that
any time we put a link up to an
infringing site our whole site could be
taken offline by protect IP or SOPA okay
I mean that's probably an exaggeration
that might have been true you could have
read that into the bill in the original
the original SOPA but after the managers
amendment they took out the parts that
said a portion of the site can be taken
down by corporation with five days
notice or cut off from payment
processors so you know it's not just a
link that's going to get your whole site
shut down but it could get pages
censored essentially mom and the ant
like the anti-circumvention provision
the language is really unclear so if
would with the prior restraint before
the page that is on for the whole
website we're not really sure so there's
a lot of you know holes in this bill
another another part of it is the
definition of foreign site you know a
lot of American sites have their own
domain names in other countries like
google.ca or amazon.ca UK so do those
fall under foreign sites and you know on
the flipside Pirate Bay's piratebay.org
which is a u.s. domain so are now they
domestic site it's very confusing and
it's very clear on the other hand that
these will definitely affect us site say
well okay Declan what do you think is
going to happen next even following this
for a while you predicted back in
December that there would be a blackout
based on this
uh what tell us what you predict is
going to happen next with these bills oh
boy I I was pretty pretty right for once
i inferred I'm predicting a few weeks
ago they'll be a blackout today though
if what I what I want to see him it's
not quite a prediction it's more like a
hope is that there's a houseboat
scheduled well in advance and that gives
Internet companies enough time to really
do it right I don't want to have some
sort of like sign some petition nobody
really cares if you're ever primer you
might be a little threatened but not as
much as I say your primary challenger
being fun to that and that really hurts
another thing I want to see I want to
see a concert on the mall in washington
DC i want to see mr. a plus k on from
twitter himself being the MC I want to
see senator Wyden giving giving the
opening remarks and the musicians who
have taken to youtube and twitter to
protests open protect IP obviously then
do the concert you have a hundred
thousand people there pretty easily will
just cost a few million dollars that's
nothing compared the MPAs lobbying
budget if the Google and company did
that it would be an amazing day we'll
see the the million page march coming to
the mall near you uh Trevor any final
words on are we going to see more
protests like this over this or similar
issues in the future more big sites
taking themselves offline and forms of
protest what do you think well I think
the sites this time took themselves off
line because they thought that these
bills actually threaten their existence
um but you know I don't think that you
know that's kind of the nuclear option
as Declan said so I don't think that's
going to be kind of a common occurrence
but it is great to see that the internet
has been mobilized this bill you know
before this there was never any great
urgency to petition Congress for bills
and and you know there are many bills
coming up in the next few years that are
going to affect the internet like data
retention wiretapping and kalia um so
you know this is really good for online
activism in general and we're going to
see this continued for SOPA too because
then it comes back next week we got
remember a
you know congressman aren't even back in
Washington yet so a lot of their phone
lines were closed today so when Senate
couple returns next week again we're
going to ask people to call and I think
we're going to see a slow steady stream
of senators starting to you know really
really change their position and
hopefully kill this bill for good Trevor
