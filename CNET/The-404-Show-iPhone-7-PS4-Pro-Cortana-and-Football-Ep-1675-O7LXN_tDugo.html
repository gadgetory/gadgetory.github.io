show today is Friday September 9 my name
is not Jeff Bakalar my name is Russ
rustic and I'm not joined by Jeff
Bakalar i'm joined by chris plante of
the verge who has joined us out of the
kindness of his heart while Jeff is on
honeymoon somewhere in the Alps I
believe welcome Chris I I would rather
be where he is yeah it's somewhere not
in America okay hey my man yelps Alps is
not in America right sure yeah that
leaves a lot of places yeah let's name
them okay Tokyo Spain mm London
Barcelona okay I think we've officially
lost half the audience well indeed
welcome everyone pretty big week for
technology we've been in a bit of a dry
spell the last few weeks / months in
terms of like big tech news certainly
there's been speculation and stuff like
that that's been going on but there
hasn't been anything like concrete until
this week when it all sort of came
tumbling down upon us obviously the
apple press conference called
immediately thereafter by the Saudi
press conference and there was a lot of
stuff that came out of that so I guess
you know this being a tech podcast let's
dig into Apple a bit Chris do you know
that there was an apple press conference
this week it turns out I do because it's
my job don't care good well I don't know
if it's your job to care but it is your
job to watch it write about it so yeah y
SE care i mean like be available
emotionally to cover it and not just
like crawl under my desk and weep what's
the sort of five-minute speed on what
they announced I don't even do five
minutes to an elevator I'm in an
elevator with you have just gotten in
okay i'm holding in a fart so i'm trying
to be very polite okay tell me what just
got announced at Apple ok here is the
elevator pitch we're
pressing the 19th floor now the doors
are closing okay so there's a new Apple
watch and if you care about Apple
watches that's probably a thing and if
you don't there's nothing so special
about it you're gonna be like oh man
finally now I can get that Apple watch
is it like is there literally anything
sorry to jump in is there literally
anything about the Apple watch that
would like maybe cause someone to be
like okay I'm getting one now has like
GPS features like no I right I
personally don't understand who the
Apple watch is for sure but the elevator
is moving up we'll get back to that okay
um there's also more importantly the
iphone 7 yes and the month sighs iphone
7 and the big change here big change is
that it's faster it comes and the old
kind of like Darth Vader mask black
which apparently scratches easier the
feelers and uh there's also an improved
camera yet again especially on the
larger phone which has the like a
telephoto lens to go 100 melenz yeah and
it uses artificial intelligence to
create images that in theory look as
good as say using like a mid-range
compact camera like a fuji x100 t which
is a camera that i recommend really you
think it's comparable to that no i don't
but like that's what people are saying
that's also article with artificial
intelligence really i mean that's that's
the line from me life from the Apple
precedent right yeah that we thought
they were gonna take over the world but
instead they're just making our pictures
a little nicer that's gonna be in their
quest to make our pictures nicer they'll
accidentally take over the world yes um
yeah and it and there's also no
headphone jack anymore um there's just
the Lightning port and if you want to
charge your phone well also using
traditional headphones wired headphones
you have to get a special dongle for
that which if that sounds awful wait
till you see a photo of it
it's just as mad as you picture um it
looks like a compact flash reader that's
how big that dong yes its enormous I
don't want to say this is a deal-breaker
because this phone is like still it's
still a great iphone right like I phones
are still yeah if you like distance
yourself from all of the hype and the
annual releases in yada yada yada like
it still is this like tiny little slab
of like few metal and future that you
put in your pocket and it does all these
wonderful things yeah that said there
are a lot of other slabs that are
comparable um and don't I it just feels
so hostile taking away my headphone jack
and i know that there's a dongle and i
know that i will lose it immediately
because i lose anything that is smaller
than like my pinky finger yeah uh just I
don't know I I I didn't I have not made
a pre-order on this phone and the reason
why is that I'm just not sure that I
like the idea of not being able to plug
into my phone without knowing where
add-on was it all day did you mention
the water resistant aspects of it yes
its watering industrious tened is the
claim I am curious how true that is as
someone who has had to clean out grime
from life beat the app be what is it the
Lightning port well a paper clip before
right so why would that be any there is
the same court right yeah i mean i don't
know i'm curious to see if people have
that problem it's a space-age polymer
perhaps mmm yes it's probably a
space-age polymer i saw in the
commercial the only representation of
the waterproofness was I guess they
threw a water balloon at it and that
looks pretty good I mean I wouldn't
normally do that with my phone so I
guess that's a plus but the headphone
thing I mean you you were questioning
whether it's a deal breaker I think for
me it's a deal breaker like I think that
is acceptable I am like like we've
talked about a lot on the show like I'm
a big apple phone guy I like Apple
compute
as well and but I every single day when
I use my phone I am plugging in my
headphones that I like and are
comfortable and don't need a battery and
the idea of giving that up in favor of
some features which are like nice but
not at all mandatory seems totally crazy
yeah totally crazy like cutting off your
ear despite your face or whatever yeah
and I know people will say the dongle is
there but like it's just such a silly
step the idea I mean it's why Apple has
you know that the ultra-thin macbooks to
right where you can also attach a dongle
to it and it's that I that it's I I
still understand it the idea of we're
going to trim be like this itty bitty
amount of space off of a thing is
already small at the sacrifice of just a
really obvious feature um I mean I I
know that's not why they say they're
doing this like they have their own
bizarre logic for why this is a
necessary step uh but I I just doesn't
track for me the idea of losing core
features to remove the like tiniest
fraction of additional space let's talk
about their quote because I was
traveling while this was all happening
so I sort of picked up bits and bobs of
it but as I understand it the quote that
they go back to of ever moving the
headphone jack is that it took courage
is that an accurate um ah yeah i mean
that's false what currently not that's
not what the word means you could say
bold yes i agree with both at courage
iie courage implies that they are doing
some like great thing for the betterment
of our species and in it's certainly not
that i mean i think it yet if you work
at a company like apple or ever a
company that is obviously driven by
profits and driven by the success of
their products and I
imagine are pretty heavily focused
tested at least in terms of the feature
sets you could see how someone in that
environment could do let's say 50 focus
test where they say hey we're going to
remove the headphone jack from your
phone and every single person in the
room is like don't do that that's an
awful idea and they ignore it and that
person is like wow we're being
courageous by ignoring these 50 focus
tests yeah that's a bad idea it will
it's such a it's such a smug Silicon
Valley thing yeah our Virgin version of
like the most courageous they could
possibly be is that because the
assumption is that all of their
customers are wrong yeah and that
they're the courage comes from doing
something the customer doesn't want
which is like that I mean not the
courage part but that is a fair line of
thinking the customer doesn't always
know what they want sure and it is your
responsibility to give that to him I
mean that's how we got you know a phone
that doesn't have buttons on it yeah but
the the the every idea every example
that I can think of where they took
something away from the customer it was
very obvious what they were placing with
it with yes be perceived as better like
yeah I'm I really wanted you know
buttons on my phone when i switch to an
iphone i really enjoyed my sidekick that
I could you know tap all of the the
letters and to while i was texting at
the same time it was immediately obvious
to me that there were benefits to not
having having you know the basic buttons
and switches right and it's sort of on
the same token I mean you look at the
Lightning port so the Lightning port
granted a lot of people were pissed off
because it's like not a universal USB
input but compared to what Apple was
using before which was the wider like
clicky weird charging thing it is better
like you can plug it in any way you want
like you don't have to like plug it in a
certain way like USB so it was like at
least you understood the trade-off and
here I don't know
what getting rid of the headphone jack
gives me I honestly don't know do it
reminds me of have you ever had this is
very judgmental but have you ever been
to like a friend's house who has like a
really modernist design aesthetic that
they've chosen to decorate with I'm
happening like the first buer Cameron's
dead how does that kind of place yeah
kind of like that where it's like they
have like chairs that are shaped like
eggs but they're not terrible yeah and
they only allow themselves to have like
one bookshelf and it's like with like
five books and at a certain point like
the place ceases to be a place that you
actually want to spend time in yeah
that's kind of how I feel about the form
over function thing it right where it's
like yeah I get it like there's one less
slot on the bottom of this thing it
makes the design a little bit better for
someone who like all they think about is
design but the actual experience of
using it becomes like a chore yeah and
at that point you have to ask yourself
like it's designed getting in the way of
just normal people using this thing yeah
okay so to wrap this Apple section up to
prediction time ok we'll we'll the
blowback be strong enough for Apple to
reverse course next year and include a
headphone jack I I don't think so I just
don't think they're that sort of company
you think like recovered yeah I
definitely think they're too stubborn um
i would say that like the Apple watch
kind of shows that like yeah the the
continual push on the Apple watch
without I feel like really understanding
what people's issues are with it uh kind
of encapsulates apples willingness to go
for retreat further into its own design
philosophy rather than consider you know
what people actually want yeah although
they have admitted I mean it feels like
they have sort of admitted failure with
the Apple watch whereas with iphone
obviously it's still success it's not as
successful as he once was in terms of
grow
but it's still successful whereas the
Apple watch like they took what was it
two years to sort of reup it and even
then I mean I think it's clear that they
considered as a side piece it's not like
a primary device yeah I also do wonder
if so they're all these rumors about the
iphone 8 already right I'm for next year
yeah I will see if that is what actually
happens I mean I would skip an S phase I
guess yeah but there's this feels like
an S phase i think is the point that
everyone has is like this feels like a
stopgap phase right now and the eight is
supposed to be you know a pretty
significant leap it is how the rumors
make it sound and I kind of wonder if
the reason that we're seeing the absence
of the headphone now is trying to get
that out of the way oh yeah and then
it's like next time it'll back well yeah
there's no headphone jack we're used to
that yeah and she was like all of these
great features and there's not as much
bad blood when that when that leap comes
around yeah um I mean that to me seems
logical considering you know they're
playing such a long long game the in
terms of how they introduce features for
their hardware that it's the only
explanation I can think of why they
decided to do it this time around they
should just have the camera I sing to
you I think as a guy's it makes your
photos so beautiful perfect pitch
alright well that's pretty much wraps of
Apple I'm not planning on going nuts on
it it sounds like Chris you are not
either I like my headphones my old timey
headphones another big event that
happened no joke an hour after Apple
ended was this Sony event that happened
in New York City announcing what had
longed for a while bin the neo the
PlayStation neo and now we know it as
the playstation 4 pro so it's enough
it's it's kind of a weird device and i
don't think it's quite what people were
expecting what was your take on it Chris
um I feel like I might have been like
out of the loop on expectations because
this feels like kind of exactly crazy
 with me like I I didn't expect it
to be announced that it would be
available this year yeah that was for us
the basic gist is there's a slimmer
normal xbox or thank course i'm a
horrible playstation 4 and that's just
gonna retain the normal ps4 branding and
there's ps4 pro and it has more power uh
but all the details are pretty vague in
terms of what that power does Leo it
some games will look better on your on a
traditional 1080p HDTV but how they'll
look better is unclear in it doesn't
sound like we can expect it to improve
things like frame rate but there might
be like better maybe anti-aliasing or
better textures they're not really
telling us what it means and it seems
like it might be up to each game
developer yeah that's that was my
impression as well they like punted it
two games overs yeah and then games will
be in 4k but I don't know what
necessarily how it true that is or like
what their definition of 4k is because
to running game at 4k on like a mid to
high-end gaming PC is tough like I'm
deaf you'll have to have a pretty solid
set up so there's I guess it sounds like
they might have a solution for
oppressing 24 yeah that's that's my
impressionist yeah like how you up res a
DVD or blu-ray for your 4k TV it's not
actually a native 4k output right um in
which case that's neat but like what
does that really look like and what does
that look like compared to native 4k you
have a 4k TV right I do yeah and how
much 4k content is there on the planet
not much to say the least um so if you
have 4k right now I mean this is I think
the big selling point for it and white
could actually do well if you have a 4k
TV right now you have to basically turn
to a 4k blu-ray player
UHD blu-ray which is expensive the
blu-rays themselves are expensive the
cheapest option for ultra HD blu-ray
player is ironically an xbox one s ah
and the new playstation poor pro doesn't
play those discs right the other option
you have if you have a fast enough
internet connection is Netflix and
Amazon and there's like a slew of kind
of like weird streaming apps that are
kind of trying to get on that bandwagon
and that's assuming you have the
connection to support 4k streaming not
only that but it's assuming that you
have the right Netflix and Amazon abs so
not every netflix and amazon app is
going to load 4k content oh wow and
there's also like no good way to like
force the apps to show that content so
for example with me I've tried to get it
to show up on my pc and it's unclear if
that works like the traditional these
are our 4k things don't automatically
appear sure and it doesn't work with my
old xbox one or Playstation 4 so my only
solution is to use the apps inside of my
samsung tv and then feed audio from my
family might be got a receiver yeah so
it would a mess it is it really is a
mess and having in theory a box that
plugs into your TV that like will
guarantee that the things that are
streaming are going to be able to load
4k yeah deal you'll need they are
literally releasing either updates or
new apps so that Netflix and Amazon on
the ps4 Pro will show that they had to
do a kind of similar thing with Xbox one
s so complicated but but here is like
again the big thing it's so difficult to
really make use of your 4k TV that I
think just being able to like go out in
stores and say hey you have a 4k TV you
probably have not used it for 4k right
like there are pretty good odds actually
that that a portion of the audience is
not using the 4k TV to you know its
fullest potential here is a device that
gives you a showpiece a century to like
when people come over and be like oh
look this is what 4k looks like the to
make question that I have though is like
it's kind of weirdly what PS VR could do
for VR is is it going to be a bad first
impression right oh PS VR is I actually
I don't think for if you've never used
VR before I think p SVR is a good
certifiable but if you've used oculus or
whatever it looks much more basic yeah i
think p SVR is fine I I do wonder though
if like up rezzed 4k on a game that
itself I'm not sure of like they were
always 1080p in the past like it's just
so bizarre and it's so pedantic and so
hike it's just getting so tech-heavy
yeah inspec heavy I mean it's hilarious
to me that we were promised 1080p last
generation essentially didn't get it
sure and now we can't even guarantee
1080p on the original iteration of xbox
one and ps4 on every game right and
suddenly like somebody's coming at me
like yep 4k gaming it's like yo yeah
well they're not going to be like hey
remember what we promised NEP no no it's
really coming now yeah I guess not a
really a selling point they've been
doing so well and i'm not sure getting
out in front of everybody and promising
something that isn't that has like so
many asterisks next to you is like the
smartest move yeah but you know i'll say
for me so you know i have a good pc good
gaming pc and but i do play a lot of
games that come out on pc on ps4 simply
because the way you know I've got a
living room and a couch and I want to
show on my couch and obviously I could
plug in my computer to my TV use not the
way things are set up so i play games
like deus ex which just came out on ps4
and it clearly struggles to run on ps4
like this certain like city scenes that
like the ps4 chugs with and there is
something appealing to say like
for games like that you know or like a
dishonored or like a battlefield that
like you're not going to go from 30
frames a second to 60 frames a second
but run a game pretty competently and
smoothly um he's pretty appealing to me
I just don't know how consistent that's
gonna be honestly like I don't know how
many developers are gonna offer that
sort of support yeah and in the you like
the weird thing for me is they've been
saying again it's so hard to tell like
what is true right now but that some of
the stuff I've read is that if you have
if you play ps4 games on ps4 pro they'll
run smoother but they won't run better
and I don't like let me explain that
like what I mean is if a ps4 normal game
shoots for 30 frames per second yeah but
doesn't always hit it on ps4 pro in
theory it should like be locked on 30
exactly you're not going to like it's
not gonna it'll basically lock there so
even though it might have the extra
power to shoot for you know say 45 or 60
frames per second they want to have some
general parity with what's available on
the ps4 yeah what you guys a multiplayer
game for multi-part you need that like
you can't have call of duty being 30
frames on one console and 60 on another
sure but this is like it's silly when
you think about PC gaming where if you
have the extra power you throw it
whatever you want wait mr. its it
basically feels like we're getting
closer and closer to pc gaming without
the options ah yeah yeah it feels right
it feels like you know it's still this
walled off garden which obviously has
benefits in so far as like you know pc
gaming can be a minefield of getting
everything working and updating and
video drivers or whatever you have to
deal with and it's gotten much better
over the years but still like most
people that want to play games do not
want to spend 15 minutes troubleshooting
what just happened which you know
consoles sort of fill that gap but it is
not like I guess I was expecting from
the ps4 pro I was expecting much more of
a
comparable system to what Microsoft
seems to be offering which is to say
like their it sounds like they're going
to throw a ton of hardware at the
problem and speaking of someone that is
has been pretty unhappy with what
Microsoft has done this generation at
least this feels like a noticeably
different product of what they're
offering right now whereas the ps4 pro
really it doesn't even seem like a half
step like it seems almost like a quarter
step to whatever their next-generation
console is yeah i I'm I'm really
reluctant to like say much about project
Scorpio though yeah considering we know
next to nothing sure about what it will
actually look like yes and like other
than them being like well ps4 pro has
four teraflops and we have six yeah no I
do I'm right yeah until until I see what
it actually does that is better than ps4
pro I am kind of skeptical I think the
the big advantage they have is they're
gonna have what six months before they
have to show the project Skorpion
Scorpio yes right so like they have a
lot of time to like start making
decisions i'm not a lot of time but it
feels like they have enough time to say
hey we need to add one or two things
that give us a real competitive
advantage yeah what is available here
although obviously the concern is they
run into the same issue they have with
launch on the Xbox which is to say like
so the PS were pros selling at four
hundred dollars if Microsoft comes out
at five six eight hundred hours what
does that mean and like does that sink
them I think it is a huge issue for them
if they come out again at a higher price
point because people are just gonna be
like I don't you know whatever I don't
need all these flops I have a job well
in any other thing is it's where things
get calm complicated with it being
essentially the same games on all these
systems but with better graphics yeah is
yeah how many people are just gonna be
like yeah I guess it looks better like
yeah I'm okay with what I already have I
I'm those people i think are on
you see right now right yeah are really
like obsessed with graphics I I think
have a place for that I don't and all
these Xbox games are coming to pc like
that's a marketing point for them it's
like all these Xbox one exclusives are
coming to pcs day and date yeah I feel
like the thing I keep waiting for
Microsoft to do with project Scorpio or
whatever they do next is not connect but
something that makes that experience
unique right like what is there what is
their camera essentially for the
smartphone for you know the iphone like
every year apple update its camera
showing everything on your iPhone is
totally fine and you can everybody can
enjoy all their apps you know maybe
they'll run a little bit better on one
but 99% of this stuff is gonna run
pretty similarly similarly across like
the three most recent iPhones do but for
people who really want that camera like
there's a reason to buy the phone every
year and that's what I'm curious about
with project Scorpio is like why do I by
this system if I have a good pc or on
the flip side I'm like okay just having
pretty serviceable graphics on xbox one
or xbox one is ya know i think it's a
it's going to be a tough sell for them
and I think you know I think there are
people you know hardcore gaming folks
honestly like like me that like wants to
have steady performance on ps4 and forty
dollars you know is cheaper than I was
expecting it to be so I don't know that
I'm gonna get one at launch but but it
is sort of appealing and I'm sort of in
wait and see mode with with Scorpio then
I do want to mention that we were
talking about improvements you were just
saying improvements that Microsoft can
make year-over-year I wanted to talk
about one such improvement that recently
came to the xbox one but has obviously
been on PCs for a little while I guess
since Windows 10 and her name is Cortana
the halo robot hello halo robot um
Cortana is a voice interpretation AI I
guess that takes orders similar
Siri and Amazon's Alexa and I never used
her on windows because why would i but
it recently came to xbox one and I use
the xbox as a media box so i actually
use voice controls pretty frequently
I've used them since launch they are not
great but I was kind of hoping that
Cortana would sort of right the ship
there now before i would say connect
voice controls worked maybe fifty
percent of the time if things were
things were ideal cortana seems to work
sixty percent at a time nice but that's
nice she takes about 15 seconds to get
my video to stop and it's nice it's
literally this is this is the
interaction i have so i'm watching
netflix i say hey Cortana stop and then
she thinks about it for a while and then
she makes a tea then she comes back just
like did you mean snap and then she
snaps and I want to throw my xbox out
the window like it is like xbox they've
made some good improvements that
dashboard since launch Cortana is in an
awful state that never ever ever should
have come to the forefront do you like
it do you think maybe that is like the
wait is this on xbox one or xbox one s
it's on both oh it's low on both I don't
know if it's slow on both but my
interpretation is that it's not that
it's count because it's all like
calculating in the cloud so it's a it's
a network connection thing it has
nothing to do with this the system power
and that's the big issue is that my
interpretation is that every single
thing that you say to Cortana has to go
to the cloud before it can come back and
be interpreted whereas the logic would
say hey here are these 60 words that
people use on the regs maybe throw them
into the hardware memory maybe you don't
need to go to the cloud to figure out if
they said play or not yeah and instead
they're so tied into this idea of cloud
computing or whatever the hell that
they've totally hamstrung a feature that
I use all the time I mean it's like it's
honestly like removing the headphone
jack like why have you done this to me
it has not benefited me in any way shape
or form I'm just impressed that you're
still talking to your xbox it's it's
laziness generally I mean it's it's the
remote is out of reach and I'm willing
to yell at it instead of reaching for
the remote but at this point I can't
even do that so your collectors still
plugged in romantically well it is I
know it's shocking um I don't know but
it's it's just there for the mic I don't
we say like they should just show as
sold like a USB mic attachment for
people that want to do that it's not an
option now me well you can just I guess
plug in a headphone into the controller
and do it that way but yeah they find
your controller God yeah things are in a
very weird state with with I think both
of the console manufacturers oh there's
a third one isn't there does this
another company may cuttle no well so
here is I think this could be an
opportunity for Nintendo I completely
agree totally I think all of this like
it's so complex so headache-inducing
anytime if somebody asked me to figure
out how HDR works really literally my
eyes glaze over and I just want to boot
goombahs let oh my goodness what if I
told you there were two formats and they
only worked on certain TVs he was never
really sure if they were even working
like have you ever tried to watch
something wait jet you have 4k no okay
I'm too far from my TV so I think
visually recognize the difference degree
in 4k and not but I did I looked at that
chart which was like I'm whatever seven
feet away from my TV and it's too much
like I wouldn't be able to see it that's
HDR I feel like was built for when
people like you walk into the showroom
yeah be like well what if I told you you
could have like a jillion more colors
and I'm color one so it's like sorry
whoa oh my gosh um yeah I do feel like
Nintendo has has a real shot here
between its
sudden renaissance of popularity on
mobile phones and just the simplicity of
the NX I mean we don't know how simple
yeah it probably is we can assume that
it's not going to have like three
different models for you to choose from
yeah um i don't know i think my crackpot
theory I there's people have always been
asking for the net flat netbox the
netflix of nintendo games right but you
can sure have simply the dreamcast era
right yeah yeah like everything from
nintendo and it'd be great you should
practice sega put it all into this
system and you pay a fee a month but i
judging from how much attention the nes
classic edition edition has got which if
you have seen this it's a tiny
recreation of the original nes with 60 i
think games pre-loaded on to it yeah
it's it's we talked about a little bit
on the show it's definitely I think
could be a huge huge holiday gift yeah I
know Nintendo loves reselling classic
games to you over Wi-Fi or over your
internet connection ah but my my fantasy
for I guess in X would be that it comes
with a hundred games on it like that
like you you you get this and you know
hey hey everyone who now has kids that
grew up on the NES here is to start
introduce your family to the joy of
Nintendo like that yeah the whole angle
and then here is a system that you can
have in your home you can take on you on
the go and cheer all these games to
start with and then on top of it like
here's the new mario that you're going
to write by um it just feels like it's
such an advantage they have just so many
old games that they could stack on and
there's still be more games for you to
buy yeah um that I I just would they be
willing to rid themselves of that
potential
source though is the question I
completely agree that's up from a
business model standpoint super super
smart especially if they have trouble
with stocking the that the mini micro
Nintendo like this seems like you know
another alternative but I Nintendo has
so like held on to that arcane method of
like reselling you old nes game for
fifteen bucks a pop that I don't know
we'll see yeah and I eager to find out
yeah I I just feel like they have to
come up with some better solution for
their classic titles like whether it be
that or it be the netflix thing I just
don't think they can for the umpteenth
time resale people you know a 30 year
old game for 10 or 15 bucks yeah and
this would be a great way to like fix
that problem because I do think a lot of
people if if they don't find a way to
transfer your games from the wii and wii
u to this new system yeah like I I will
be upset if they try to get me to pay
for super mario three yet again exactly
or super metroid which I fee like I you
know bought on board countless yeah
countless systems yeah it's ridiculous
okay well I wanted to wrap the show
talking a little bit about football okay
I was flying home on a red-eye last
night I landed at 6am this morning and
I'm very sleepy but while I was waiting
for my flight last night I was watching
the the football match last night
between the Carolina Panthers and the I
forget the Denver Broncos name is our
denver by the orange gentleman shah the
Denver Broncos and I saw you tweeted
about this it was a moment very late in
the game when Cam Newton their star
quarterback was given a concussion in
front of the America Marika's like eyes
it was horrifying like this shot that he
took to the head and I mean you watched
football I do fantasy football you do
fantasy football
how long can you sort of do this before
it just gets so terrifying yeah so I
have to tell you I I tweeted something
what was most people I enough it was
what was most offensive to me I think
them the NFL just not caring at all
about this man who clearly looks
concussed trying to still play for
another minute yeah pretty disturbing
but also what happened on that play was
he took this uh how much a helmet shot
right at his head they didn't call it
helmet to helmet and there had been he
got an intentional grounding on it
probably because he was getting hit in
the head by another man's helmet it was
the part it was a personal foul isn't it
yeah that the two fouls equaled out
right over the offset so basically what
the NFL's logic was this man only 10 is
next snapped in half and that is equal
to penalty wise him intentionally
grounding the football again which could
have been a result of him not knowing
where he was anymore um yeah that that
seems especially silly but yeah I
tweeted that and immediately it got
retweeted by like some mmm area editor
like bleacher report and it was like oh
somebody got hurt in sports what we do
like of course there are still people in
the world who like a person gets
seriously injured and it's like well
that's the expectation they get paid
millions we should if they die it's
their own fault like it's such an ugly
attitude that like I'm surprised is
still so pervasive towards athletes it
like also yeah I feel like MMA is
interesting because you don't hear a lot
about this stuff and must be because the
fights I guess they're so short that
like I don't know that there's like a
lot or I guess the sport is much newer
so they don't have a lot of a history of
potential long-term damage whereas
boxing obviously does and football dies
yeah i think there's also an attitude
sometimes across like everything in a
modern am
American culture if something owns up to
something it's somehow okay would be
like like um Donald Trump like if you
say it's like well he's just a straight
talker you know like if if Hillary
Clinton or any politician basically
before him said something racist yeah
like lose their minds sure but because
he like basically it's like yeah I mean
this is just who I am pivot I like well
I mean what could we expect of course of
course how does that apply to the NFL
though what I'm saying no I was talking
about MMA I think like people are okay
with MMA because it's like well I mean
it's always always been a blood sport
like yeah what respect like it's totally
okay and i think the rear the troubled
the NFL is going through is in the 90s
like in the NFL blitz era it like kind
of seemed to take a pride Oh a hundred
percent you're like oh man this but this
thing is not a nice as the seriousness
of the injuries and guess is you know
kind of taking center stage the NFL has
had to kind of pivot away from just
leaning into it yeah and really now it
doesn't really know how to handle itself
well it's funny because I watch hard
knocks on HBO and hard knocks if you've
not seen it it's like a really great
documentary series about following a
single team during their preseason and I
say great but I also fully realize that
like hard knocks is very very
intentionally does not delve into a lot
like the concussion stuff o'donovan to
anything complex I mean they'll die
they'll show like a guy tore his ACL or
something like that but in terms of like
long-term you know damage your yeah it's
it's very surface it's not like a super
but it does i would say morse more so
than any other thing that i've watched
it does humanize the players on these
teams and it's ironic because it is
designed to humanize the players and
make you more excited to watch them play
football but in truth all it does is
make me more horrified when they get
horribly injured on the field yeah yeah
no I I do think you're right in that it
uses the power of reality TV
to make you feel an affection for really
the sport in general yeah like what I
loved is this year they they followed
the los angeles rams who I despise as an
idea because they moved yeah well not
because they move but this the whole
idea of user boy over here yeah using
using a team to leverage your city to
pay for stadiums is like grotesque yeah
and real and they are I think like the
beacon of all of that behavior and then
FL and then you watch this show and
you're like oh yeah I mean I hate I hate
what they represent and I know they're
like a team that somehow is also kind of
the NFL's team because that stadium is
going to be used for like special NFL
things that are a separate from the own
team which creates this weird conflict
of interest for me of like cool it's a
standalone team but the NFL also used
it's like space for its own stuff that's
what here to see flake gate to plug not
even a conspiracy because it's just the
NFL there's like yeah this is what we'll
do is exactly let's talk about there is
like we own it no problems here um and
yet yeah you watch the show and then
you're like oh yeah I could release you
myself this guy has a lot of tank tops
yeah okay what she really knows how to
keep these guys together yeah it's it's
tough mental gymnastics that I have to
go through every year and and it looks
like I'm still going through it so I'm
certainly not out of the blame field if
I wanted to swage myself I would have to
quit watching football and I really like
watching football so make the helmets
better that's what I'm that's all I'm
gonna say and that fixes everything
chris is there anything else you wanted
to touch on before we wrap things up no
I mean I think that's it nothing's
coming to mind do you have weekend no I
really don't is there anything that
you'd like to plug as a member of the
verge sure the verge calm okay there's a
technology and culture website for the
modern age you can also i have a podcast
okay it's called what's
it's on all of your favorite podcast
catchers and it's short that's why I
recommend it each is there well is there
an episode of the podcast that you'd
recommend for people to start with um
okay so each week we cover like just one
topic and they're like 15 to 20-minute
nuggets and there's an episode about
fanfiction that I think is a pretty
pretty tasty there's an episode on
daxing which i think is really
informative and any of our space
episodes like if it's like Oh alien life
or space colonization or rockets all
those episodes we have my friend and
colleague Lauren crush on it and
ninety-five percent of them just end up
being conversations about Nick Cage film
knowing which if you haven't seen one
little odd numbers uh yes kind of plane
so plain the end of the movie there's a
terrible plane crash the end of the
movie I'm gonna spoil it for everybody
so thank you turn it off dude if you're
worried about spoilers the end of the
movie is Nick Cage can sense that bad
things are about to happen and all leads
to like these like these numbers are the
clue and it leads to just like the end
of the list and the end is the
apocalypse and she actually doesn't get
off planet Earth and the entire planet
is engulfed in flames and everybody dies
except for a few children including I
believe like his his friends children or
his children and they get taken away by
aliens except when we see them like post
Earth's termination sure they're on
another planet and it's clearly the
Garden of Eden and the aliens look like
angels so also believe that it's a
prequel to our lives exactly this is
that that God and angels are actually
this alien race and every time earth
begins to like its timer expires we get
like a few of us are airlifted out and
we're even by a different weight plan
and the implication is at the
we need to bang um I mean I am not the
person who said that that was you said
that but I mean you show me that God is
making that leap like well let's just
stick a bunch of children in this garden
and hope that Scott space aliens are
twins let's yeah but God is that the
he's the chief of them right I mean well
God alien I'll let you be you know the
Space Jockey geology and yellow June the
allergen shore ah yeah yeah anyway
that's my plot the knowing and chris
plante what's tech thank you very much
