cause behind the exploding note 7
devices joining me is cnet section
editor Jessica dole court nods Jessica
what exactly happened and why did the
note sevens explode so Samsung with the
help of some independent contractors who
were working with the company discovered
that there were actually two separate
unrelated fires we had the first batch
of note seven phones that was their
original run and those had a fire based
on a design flaw in the battery itself
basically had two very volatile parts of
the battery touch and then it went boom
that was a very bad thing so then there
was the second run that was the
replacement phones and that had a
completely different battery error that
was actually made by a different battery
company as well and that when there was
a welding error that left just a little
bit of material that actually punctured
a separator and had those two very
volatile chemicals touch so this was
very very bad luck for samsung now
Samsung has also decided to roll out a
battery checklist how will this affect
future phones such as the essay right
there is an eight-point safety checklist
now these are either new protocols or
enhanced protocols that Samsung already
used and they're already going to be in
future phones like the galaxy s 8 so
Samsung said that at the time of the
discovery of this issue that was the
time that they were actually working on
the s8 batteries Samsung is also going
to be leaving more room in the s8 for
the battery to contract and expand even
though that was not the source of the
issue so right now they're playing it
safe so what does this mean for future
note phones will Samsung release a note
8 yes there will definitely be a no date
and we are going to expect it around the
same fall timeframe late august early
September the note is incredibly
important to Samsung's portfolio the
device which features large screen in a
digital stylus is one that Samsung
actually pioneered it wasn't following
Apple or anybody else and there's an
incredibly devoted following so this is
a phone that we will see this is a phone
line that we're going to see for years
to come Jessica thank you so much and
