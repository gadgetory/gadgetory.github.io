Lexington Kentucky at the test labs of
Big Ass Fans
now that's a funny name but they're very
serious about ceiling fans and their
haiku ceiling fan is a very high-end
model that they're putting smarts into
this year they call it sense me
technology now these smarts bring a
whole extra layer of modern luxury into
the picture they can tell when you come
and go they are programmable the light
can come on in the morning to wake you
up or it can simulate occupancy while
you're on vacation and there's a lot of
cool things through there very handy
sense me app on the iOS device of your
choice now the app isn't going to be out
on android for at least six months they
tell us which is a little disappointing
but the app is very cool we played with
it quite a bit here at the lab you can
set it to tell when you come into the
room and when you leave and turn off
automatically you can have it turn on or
turn up whenever it gets too hot so it
just makes you comfortable on its own
another impressive thing about this fan
is the build quality take a look at
those blades or not actually blades at
all their air foils they're curved and
they're kind of delicately constructed
but they're not delicate either if you
take a look at this test we were able to
actually smash it against the table and
doesn't put a dent in it they're very
very sturdy made out of compressed
bamboo that they claim is as strong as a
flexible steel and we're inclined to
believe them after this test anyway the
Haiku with cents me clearly a very
high-end fan the normal haiku retails
for 895 and you'll pay an extra 150 to
get the haiku sensory technology built
into it so a grand total of 1045 if you
want this connected ceiling fan the
first of its kind for seeing it I'm Rui
