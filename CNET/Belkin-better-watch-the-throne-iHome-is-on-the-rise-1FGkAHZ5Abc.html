connected in wall switches can be a
great way to smarten up your lights the
problem is when you're in a rental space
like this the CNET smart apartment then
you have to have something with a
lighter install enter the smart plug a
smart plug can give almost any pluggable
device a brain and in the case of this
the $50 I home is p8 smart plug that
brain means that you can connect that
dumb old lamp to Siri Alexa smart things
wink and even nest the eye home isn't
perfect though I found it set up
especially cumbersome pairing the eye
home with the Wi-Fi took a couple of
tries and more importantly when I wanted
to connect the device to the Amazon echo
I had to actually download a separate
app wink and setup an additional account
in order to connect my eye home app to
my Alexa app if that sounds like too
many steps for what should be a simple
pairing it is now once I home is set up
it does work pretty seamlessly with home
kit and Siri the is p8 even comes with
this handy remote control to let you
toggle it remotely between the remote
and the pretty impressive platform
interoperability the eye home is going
to work pretty well with gadgets in a
lot of people's houses the problem is
that broad interoperability doesn't
correlate with depth of integration
other than what's now pretty standard
energy monitoring the eye home doesn't
bring very much new to the table
the lack of if integration in particular
really means that you don't get those
same creative and cool triggering
scenarios that you can get with say the
Belkin Wemo insight switch at the end of
the day the eye home is pH smart plug is
a reliable device and if you have a
particular device that you're wanting to
automate with it then it's worth the 50
bucks the problem is it doesn't
distinguish itself from the rest of the
larger market and I can't recommend it
over the industry-leading Belkin Wemo
insight switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
