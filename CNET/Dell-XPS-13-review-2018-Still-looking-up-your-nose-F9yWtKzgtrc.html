better time to go out to the park to
demo and talk about one of our favorite
new laptops of 2018 and that's this guy
right here it's the new Dell XPS 13 it's
been redesigned and reimagined for 2018
and it's a nice evolution from the
system that we reviewed each of the last
couple years that frankly stayed the
same for the last few years now there's
a reason why this was always one of our
favorite laptops and that's because this
is one of the first models to decide to
following the footsteps of the big TV
manufacturers and get rid of the bezel
that's that big thick border that was
one of the first guys to try to get rid
of it a few other laptop makers have
done the same since and even today now
you have edge to edge screens on phone
so clearly getting rid of the bezel is a
top priority for a lot of people you can
see just a little tiny border around the
two sides and the top of the laptop and
that lets you basically see a lot more
screen and a lot less plastic or glass
or metal or whatever is around the side
now even though we've always liked the
XPS 13 the design kind of stayed the
same for the last few years while other
laptops got thinner and smaller and
lighter and maybe fancier looking so
it's definitely time for an update this
is the updated version you can see it's
a little bit smaller they managed to
squeeze a little bit of the volume out
of it largely by improving the cooling
inside which means that you don't need
to have as much air inside for air
circulation so they've managed to get
rid of some of the half there even
though it's still a little bit on the
heavy side another big thing that they
changed was they got rid of something I
liked a lot which was the soft touch
dark gray black wrist rest was kind of
almost a rubbery feeling material I just
thought was very cool and said now it's
a white fiber white glass fiber even
though it's white Dell says it's very
stain resistant I still like that dark
soft touch feel but this is very nice
too of course it's white on the inside
on the outside you see it's got this
rose gold coloring out that's actually
an extra $50 option you can just get I
think basic you know silver instead but
you know everybody's got a rose gold
product now why not here and of course
that helps frame the screen very nicely
and now that the bezel around the screen
is why did almost fades into the
background even
when we had the black bezel before now
of course because there's no space here
in their space here what do you do with
the webcam well it's this little guy
right down here and that is one of the
classic problems with the XPS 13 line
everyone's had since they viewed this
basic dental free design several years
ago it's you put the webcam down there
what do you have you have an up the nose
shot basically nobody looks good with it
it's kind of weird if you're a
professional youtuber I guess or you do
a lot of skype video meetings all day
long this may be a deal breaker for you
I don't use webcam that much if you
don't then that I wouldn't worry about
it a heck of a lot it does have the the
two lenses there so you can do things
like Windows hello facial recognition
log in but it is definitely one of those
quirks about this particular line that
everybody always says why do they do
that and they did it again it's also
harder to fit a post-it note down there
if your privacy obsessed and you're one
of those people we like to put a post-it
note over your webcam now I don't want
you to think I don't like this laptop a
lot because I do but I am going to tell
you about one other thing that's bugging
me and that is the configuration option
you can get a perfectly fine high-end
configuration with this core i7 4k
screen touchscreen but if you get the
base model which starts in $1000 still a
very premium price you don't get the
touchscreen with that it's not for
managing people spending money on what
they think of as a very premium laptop
and not having that touchscreen it's not
something you use all the time in
Windows 10 but every once in a while
you're really gonna wish you had it and
frankly anyone under a certain age is
just trained from birth think of every
screen as a touchscreen now with the
possible exception of a matte book so I
really think that even the lower end
versions which are still $1000 should
have a touchscreen on this I'd also say
just watch out this new version has gone
to USBC only for all of its ports so if
you have a lot of stuff you want to plug
into it make sure you have all the right
dongles and connections I frankly think
we're in the USBC age already now and
that's what the Mac books have and
that's what a lot of other laptops have
but if you're gonna do a lot of
outputting by HDMI you want to plug in
your old memory sticks just be warned
about that so those small quirks and
annoyances aside this is actually a
fantastic laptop and still one of my
favorite 13-inch laptops in fact it's
one of the ones in our testing lab that
I go back to again and again and I pick
up whenever I need to use a laptop for
something the keyboards fantastic the
touchpad is
very good the screen this is the 4k
touchscreen version looks great great
performance from the core i7 processor
and of course just a really sharp design
isn't enough to take everywhere and it's
also got one of those features that
that's an intent over I like a lot which
is that it's unique looking so when you
go to the coffee shop for some bits and
you pull out people are really gonna
notice it well that's what I think of
the Dell XPS 13 what do you think let us
know in the comments below thanks for
watching
