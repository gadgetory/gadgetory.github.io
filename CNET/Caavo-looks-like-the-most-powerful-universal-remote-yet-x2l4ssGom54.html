inputs and start watching a show using
just the power of your voice that's the
promise of kaavo a new home
entertainment device coming this fall
for 400 bucks think of it as a smarter
version of a universal remote control
the two-piece system that consists of
the remote and a box that sits in your
entertainment center you connect your
gear such as your cable or satellite box
Apple TV Roku or game console to any of
its eight HDMI inputs and connect its
output to your television the box has an
IR blaster you can stash it out of sight
and USB ports for power it comes in a
choice of woodgrain finishes seen here
is the bamboo the second piece is the
universal remote itself as most the
standard keys such as a circular cursor
control power and menu commands although
it's missing a numeric keypad the big
difference is voice control speak into
the clicker with commands as simple as
watch Deadpool or watch cooking channel
and the system springs into action it
turns on the TV switches the correct
device and begins playing which you
asked for the key is integration of your
watch lists across different streaming
services like Netflix Amazon and even
your DVR Cobo knows which show is on
which service in which episode you last
watched as well as which device you
prefer to use for each service you can
tell you prefer to watch Hulu on your
Roku for example and next time you say
empire it'll just start playing the show
you can also use an Alexa device instead
of the remote to issue commands and
kaavo says Google home support is being
added to the system also works with
airplane Google casts you can initiate
and control playback of videos from apps
on your phone in addition to voice and
watch lists cava has a cool ability to
let you keep using your original device
remote controls and game controllers
traditional universal remotes like
harmony lose track of devices if you try
that Cabo is more expensive than a
typical harmony but it also promises to
make watching your favorite TV shows and
movies as simple as possible we're
looking forward to testing it in full
when it comes out later this year
