important tech of 2015 I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update 2015 was
a little strange if you think about it
Microsoft gave us Windows 10 but never
windows 9 amazon created little buttons
you press for more toilet paper and
Google isn't really just Google anymore
it's alphabet aside from the odd there
were innovations that made a big impact
here are the top 5 tech stories from
2015 that are going to shape 2016 number
5 USB type-c you'll soon be saying
goodbye to the typical USB port as
laptops tablets and cell phones start to
use USB type-c it's a fast report that
can transfer power and data and it fits
in no matter which way you plug it in
apple's new 12-inch MacBook there's only
one USBC port and that's it nothing else
now don't hate me for this but I'm
putting Apple watch on the list at
number 4 yeah there were smart watches
in previous years but when Apple got
involved it changed the conversation we
now have luxury fashion brands like
swatch tag heuer Gucci and fossil
jumping into the SmartWatch space at
number 3 meerkat and periscope when
meerkat came out in March it was an
overnight sensation being able to live
broadcast video from your phone and
share it on Twitter and gain fans from
around the world was suddenly so easy
and because the videos disappeared it
played off our fears of missing out so
you how to watch at that moment Twitter
quickly declawed mayor cat and launched
the competitor periscope which is the
more popular choice these days at number
two Google's self-driving car in May
google revealed its prototype for a
self-driving car it built from scratch
it had no steering wheel accelerator or
brake pedals but it's not just Google
that's accelerating in this space Tesla
rolled out a software update to give
some of its cars the power of autopilot
and at number one hollow lens at the
start of the year Microsoft surprised
everyone by showing off a sleek flashy
headset with transparent lenses this
augmented reality tech kicked off a year
of everyone seriously believing in the
future of virtual reality and with
oculus rift PlayStation VR and HTC vive
launching next year it sets up 2016 to
be the year of virtual reality
now I've had a blast covering at all so
I leave you with a few highlights of
some my favorites cnet update moments be
sure to catch us again at CES starting
january fourth from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey it's simply
perfect marshmallow excuse me I'm afraid
to actually take it there shatterproof
is plate where you strap yourself to a
Yoshi to travel with your green tights
I'm gonna ride in a pity add one of the
world with us and have a the Cena time
for Joe Perry to you
