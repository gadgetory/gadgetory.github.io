Wi-Fi smoke detector what does that mean
it means that there are batteries in
here or you can wire it to your wall and
it talks to other smoke detectors or to
a nest thermostat over your home Wi-Fi
it has six double-a batteries in there
lithium batteries that let it run Wi-Fi
for a long period of time and work over
your home network now why on earth would
you want a Wi-Fi smoke detector well
Ness argument is that with the Wi-Fi
smoke detector you can learn both from
an app that works with this or from
other smoke detectors in your house
what's going on in different parts of
your house so this smoke detector here
is sort of a smoke detector rethought
it's square not round I was surprised to
see that it was square and not round
like the nest thermostat but nest really
wants to make it look different it will
tell you when there's a problem before
the signal needs to go off before that
blaring alarm that a smoke detector has
needs to go off heads-up there's smoke
in the dining room has a couple of other
neat features it will it actually has a
glowing light that will light the path
when you walk underneath it when it
senses motion and it will also work with
the nest thermostat which is interesting
right now one of the challenges with the
nest thermostat is that if you are in
another room for a very long time it
might think that you're not in your
house and then lower the temperature in
the house to save energy
if you have both that thermostat and
nest smoke detectors that smoke detector
in your bedroom will tell the thermostat
that you're actually still home and it
will stay on so when you think about
this it's really an interesting
beachhead into having sensors all over
your house that interact with each other
and can sort of collaborate so the nest
is not cheap it is going to cost $129
per unit and really you'll need a few
units to take advantage of how these
work for a three-bedroom house you're
probably going to need four or five to
be
above every bedroom door and in cooking
areas and other places where there may
be a smoke or carbon monoxide which this
also test for the idea is that with that
investment you also get this sort of
collaboration between the smoke
detectors
so the smoke detector can tell you when
there is smoke in a different room you
may be in the den and the smoke detector
near the den tells you that there's
smoke in the kitchen you can go to the
kitchen and wave at the smoke detector
to silence it it's the first smoke
detector with an app and it will work
with the nest app the new apps will come
sometime in late October so that needs
to be already have a nest thermostat
your software will be updated
automatically and will be able to work
with this and if you don't you'll be
getting that new 4.0 software running on
your phone or your tablet so that you
can control these remotely new apps for
this going to be available in late
October and the devices themselves will
come on to the market sometime in
November I'm Lindsey turn time for
student reviews and look for our full
review of this product sometime in the
coming weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
