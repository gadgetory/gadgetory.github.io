entry-level Yankee reader it sports a
touchscreen and starts at $79 for the
special offers for ad-supported version
hi I'm David Carr Noy and welcome to
another seen at first look video like
the line topping voyage this is an
entirely new Kindle lost a little
generic looking it seems a bit better
engineered than other entry-level II
readers I've used weighs in at a pretty
spelt six point seven ounces and
measures 0.4 inches thick and there's
something endearing about its clean
utilitarian design that seems to say I'm
boring but you can count on me to do my
job that job is to store and serve up
ebooks and other documents on a screen
that's easily readable in direct
sunlight in this case the screen is a
previous generation pearl e-ink display
that's not quite as sharp as the higher
resolution card a display found on the
top-of-the-line voyage but the good news
is that the core specs for all the
Kindles are now virtually identical the
internal memory has been bumped up from
two gigabytes to four gigabytes which is
enough to store thousands of e-books and
amazon has unified all its readers under
a one gigahertz processor with all its
readers now on a touchscreen platform
that also means that Amazon can offer
the same suite of features across its
entire eReader line and stream line
updates the experience and all the
devices going to be pretty similar but
one key feature you gain by stepping up
to the paperwhite and voyage is an
integrated light those models also have
a slightly more responsive capacitive
touch screen while this one goes with
the older IR based touchscreen with IR
sensors embedded in the bezel this
device charges via microUSB though only
a cable and no power adapter is included
in the box
battery life is rated at four weeks
based on half an hour of reading per day
with the Wi-Fi off that's less than what
the paperwhite and voyage offer but at
this point with battery life measured in
weeks rather than hours that reduce
battery ratings shouldn't be a serious
issue it's worth noting that's a good
idea to get a case for your Kindle
Amazon sells a couple nice ones for this
model but they are a little pricey
starting
at $29.99 other more affordable case
revell and just be aware that whatever
case you do get is what will give this
eReader its personality for ultimately
the kindle 2014 is a bit of a blank
slate
perhaps purposely so in the end I think
this Kindle is a good deal at $79 my
only reservation is the lack of that
integrated light but if you can live
without that feature this is a solid if
unspectacular
ereader that delivers the full kindle
touchscreen reading experience for a
very affordable price I'm David Carr Noy
