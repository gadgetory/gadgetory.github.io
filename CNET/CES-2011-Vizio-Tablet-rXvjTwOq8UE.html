watching CES 2011 I have with me here
the Vizio via tablet this is the first
entrant into the tablet market by Vizio
which is the company you normally think
of for TVs the reason they're getting
into this mobile space is because
they're trying to merge the TV with the
tablet with the phone and make it all
one seamless experience so the same
software that will run on the Vizio via
phone will also run on this tablet which
will work with Google TV now this is
running a version of Google's Android
operating system and we're not exactly
sure which one yet this is a prototype
device it doesn't come out to the summer
but a couple of things we know about it
are pretty impressive first of all it
has three different speakers two along
the top and one along the side here so
that when you use it in landscape or
portrait mode you always have surround
sound with two speakers at a time it
also has this IR blaster in the front
meaning that you can use this as a
universal remote so when you walk into
your house you can control the
electronics in your home entertainment
system with the Vizio app and this is
running a vizio skin of Android now this
is a Wi-Fi only version of this tablet
we don't know when they'll come out with
a mobile version like 3G or 4G but we
think that is in the works we also don't
have price or release date for this yet
we just know that we'll see it sometime
in the summer of two thousand eleven
again this is the Vizio via tablet I'm
Natali Morris for Cena and you're
watching our coverage of CES 2011
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
