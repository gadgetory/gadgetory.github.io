Singapore a really really really really
tiny robot claw that's going to help you
maybe someday in surgery and Star Wars
via are coming soon baby got your
headsets tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the universe I'm ashley's
together that's killing honest it's
monday we're here yeah we survived I get
on another weekend yet another weekend
degree of slight freedom they let us go
to the bathroom and then they put us
right back in the studio so that was
pretty much it yeah about it it's like
big brother like the show big brother
well bet also on CBS is that it looks
like a weirdly shameless plug on your
behalf now hopes I'm why I guess I'm
what kind of somebody here is my money
for doing that all right let's a
babbling okay I'm gonna tell you about a
robotic surgical instrument that could
in fact save your life give you less
downtime after your surgery and help you
heal faster all right you ready yes this
is a little tiny claw from a team of
researchers at Vanderbilt University
that's how small it is that's a that's
not a that's not a giant penny that's
just a normal penny that little wrist
that it has is only two millimeters wide
so the claw part of it is a little bit
wider okay so yeah it's really little
and the eye this is gonna freak you out
a little bit okay i'm sorry but this
claw can go up your nose and in your
brain okay and like it can do things
like removes pieces of tumor tissue or
like help doctor so which is pretty
remarkable considering if you need brain
surgery in some fashion usually they
have to take a piece of your skull out
and get in there this would help not do
that it's really gross no that's great
it's cool but I don't like you talking
yeah yeah exactly um but one of the
people working with the project was
saying that this type of technology
could be really incredible in terms of
helping patients heal faster because
it's not as invasive obviously see
you're not sawing off the square of your
skull and opening it up and then just
takes forever for you to healing hair
has to grow back and it's all terrible
so much work um so how it works is
there's this this little clock type
thing and then there's a tube that's
Hollow and there's a wire in it and
so the surgeons are able to bend retract
and extend this object is tool with by
pulling this wire so they're actually
pulling a wire inside it that's allowing
it to sort of Bend like that so what
they're saying is is the reason this is
really awesome is that it's almost like
a steerable needle so instead of only
having access to things that you can get
in a straight line yeah you can actually
go around stuff oh cool during surgery
like this could be very handy it could
help doctors tie really tiny knots
inside the body without having to like
make a big incision things like that is
that the only video they have I think so
yeah it's like a really short video
that's what only have sort of looks like
they've I mean it really tells the story
I wish there was more but unfortunately
hey I wouldn't want to show you surgery
and at the on a Monday that's like seems
maybe thursday guys thursday seems like
a surgery day for beer all their
zypson's be rolled surgery but yeah
they've been working on for six years
and they're not here's the thing though
they have not quite made it ready for
surgery because there's an interface
that needs to go with it and some
software for surgeons to be able to use
in surgery so they're still working on
that and then they'll get it all
together that's really cool kind of
impressive I love medical tech it's
really it's really interesting to me so
that brings us to our hashtag of the day
which it um I thought we could have a
lot more fun with the clock yes my clock
so the hashtag is TD claw and what
exactly what else one of the fun things
could you use a robotic claw for that's
that tiny Oh getting stuff but beneath
the cushions of your couch without
taking the cushions off I like that no
it's pretty stupid in comparison to
saving human lives but go ahead what's
yours I would like to deceive my lemons
with that thing I get real aggregated we
have to DC to lemon so it's super dumb
like I said pick a petty thing pick
something that is Arizona be the most
pay we're gonna waste this Technic
everyone else is gonna be like you know
nano like technology fixing tiny robots
to kill cancer in the body like know who
you're picking d seating lemons and
reaching between our couch cushions yeah
great waste your tech tell me about Star
Wars hmm ok Star Wars be art show it
just show it just show it I'm not even
gonna we don't even
not gonna send up just show it and then
I'm gonna tell you play that be the
thing play that beautiful star there you
go okay so what you're looking at is a
concept for AVR Star Wars experienced
director rub McClellan and VFX artist
Craig stuff worked with hammerhead VR to
make this demo of VR star wars game now
it's not an official game but it's
really impressive it runs on the unreal
4 engine it looks amazing it's not a
commercial time at all it's it's not
sanctioned nothing there's no time
there's just kind of like a pitch roll
like something they want to do when the
oculus comes out officially next year
thank ya like go to Lucasfilm whatever
be like look what we made you should let
us make a star wars game okay cool look
at those chumps yeah it's an older great
as it comes around in since Star Wars is
coming out in 2015 so maybe they'll
start you know working on that but this
is on this is an idea this is something
that somebody's already put some time
and effort into and it looks like the
ability to actually make it again we
don't know again this is just showing
things off we don't know exactly how it
works we don't know if you know you fly
any of the stuff we there's I didn't see
any lightsabers in this trailer i do not
see which is kind of boiler we don't
know if you get two plays the rancor
nothing we know nothing it's just as
visual all the possibilities that can
happen so there you go I would like
feelings are here in which you entirely
play and first person is a rancor do the
whole game is for rank whores POV but
like Sims and you like work at Jabba's
palace you gotta go there like nine to
five you eat people that they throw into
the pit fine wait you like you get like
an employee review yeah you get reviewed
you got to sit in front of job on he's
like okay listen so your productivity is
through the roof you're just eating
people like crazy what I think maybe you
should you could you could lose you
could lose 15 pounds as I'm saying oh
you know are like shorter skirts this is
an entertainment establishment this is
Jabba's palace this is just like a
palace this is not a place where you can
let yourself go after eating like
hundreds of people so just you know what
you need CrossFit yeah they're CrossFit
turns into just dance I play that game I
think we all would just like it seems
like a great so there you go and we can
be hopeful kind of
like maybe it'll happen could I don't
know I look tried to look at the video
on vimeo and it was like taking down
those rape made now oh yeah didn t
coming at you so Carol no no baby out
maybe maybe won't happen or maybe
they'll go these people's houses or
maybe lucasfilm's like this is amazing
we want to talk but make it private we
never know click on which part of the
screen who you agree with you click on
this side with me and click on this I'm
probably just gonna pause your video
yeah whatever all right all right tell
me about your last thing let's talk
about robot swans this is very it's a
very clever way of measuring water
pollution so researchers at the National
University of Singapore have created
these are robots in the water they're
not real swans there robot or adorable
they look like real swans from far away
but up close not so much so you can
obviously tell there they are definitely
not real life swans if the program is
called New Swan and it's designed to
test the pollution levels in water
around Singapore over time the Swan
apparently that sighs bird was the right
shape for the robot that's inside it and
they test in water that's subject to
polluting by recreational and industrial
groups so they're not just watching
corporations they're also watching like
people and different events and things
like that and testing the water for
things like chlorophyll pH levels oxygen
and then they can also have these sort
of add on sensors that they can put
inside the salons likes and say oh well
we have this one very specific sensor
that we want to test for this thing and
then they can add on different sensors
so they say they're way more expensive
than underwater vehicles the autonomous
like underwater vehicles that can go
around and get samples and also way
cheaper than actually sending a human
out to do manual sampling to all these
different spots they can operate
autonomously they can be set up and
track their own GPS marks so they don't
re cover their tracks or you can
actually operate them via remote control
so you can send them around like you can
drive them around the lake like bumper
boats yeah ray Swann fights Robo swamp
fights a shag battle TD robust off ice
Swan buzz listen guys if you want to
bring
these bought these swans to battle bots
maybe next year for the next round of
competition I bet that'll give you
enough time to put some really dangerous
stuff on them I'm just saying yeah
they'll be little flamethrower coming
out of the beach just putting it out
there seems like it could be good quick
note before the break I didn't see any
other actual swans in that water no
that's gonna but apparently even though
it's not like us like Swan infested
waters that sounds crazy uh but the
environment around them used to seeing
Swan so it's actually less stressful for
the nature surrounding them regardless
whether it's a bird or not nice it um
all right we're gonna take a quick break
however we actually have it's a first
hour break video is a fan submitted
video what yeah this is from Eddie and
he says hi Kailen Ashley big fan of the
show just wanted to share with you a
cool video that took me two years to
make he actually made it made this video
shot it using my Canon and combined
hundreds of four thousand by three
thousand images to produce this quick
time lapse video of a building being
constructed across the street from my
office it is in 4k which you can set on
youtube to see the amazing detail enjoy
it here's the link and so here is this
wonderful video from Eddie and we will
be right back with back at her Hackett
and your user feedback check this out
welcome back to the show returned thanks
Eddie once again for the delightful time
lap it's unbelievable night so good on
all right so it's Monday which means we
have to talk about crowdfunding and
whether or not we're gonna give our
money to something so it's back at her
Hackett kill you like music yeah I like
to your things you like technology oh
yeah that's why I'm here all right so
I'm gonna tell you about helix I saw
this and I was like kill might really
like this okay Logan will too Logan
producer Logan also likes music and
technology so you guys might like this
if you also like music and technology
this is a wearable that's a cuff okay
looks a little bit dorky but it's
wireless bluetooth headphones oh look at
that that live inside your cuff which is
pretty freaking cool yeah so this is a
discrete pair of bluetooth headphones
that live inside like these top sort of
compartments on the wristband so you can
see that metal part of it is actually
the compartment where the earbuds and
the control unit live which is awesome
so the band is made of the same material
as the Apple watch bands so they're like
really durable it's kind of soft that
sort of soft rubber it's curved so it'll
be pretty comfortable I i watch this
part of the video and I'm like you have
headphones in your walking across the
street not paying attention or get hit
by car it's dangerous yeah but Bluetooth
4.1 you can do up to 8 paired devices
you can be up to 30 feet away from that
pair of device so you don't have to be
right next to it you get three hours
straight of live music time and 200
hours of standby which is pretty good
and so they want a hundred thousand
dollars they have almost eighty thousand
dollars they're definitely gonna hit
their goal yeah it's a gorgeous it's
gorgeous yeah it's really nice look
slick I it's it's subtle enough to where
i would feel okay like wearing down the
street when it's like a total dork um
and so they have close to eighty
thousand I think they have like fifty
two days left they did a longer
Kickstarter so it's it's around you have
time but the early birds still available
so okay tell me what you think
the regular retail price of this is
going to be like when it comes out in
stores after Kickstarter is over like
what would you guess one fifty plus 1 99
which is usually like we see that a lot
okay okay still super early bird levels
available like 500 of them so if you
watch it like relatively soon you can
probably get one for 99 bucks which is
pretty decent and when you look at the
delivery date on it it's December of
this year so it's not like hey by this
bracelet and you get it in like a year
and a half they're saying December of
this year so are you in no no not really
much I don't I don't really understand
the bracelet aspect of it like I could
just shove a bluetooth headset thing in
my pocket like I don't really need to be
carrying it around like and if I'm gonna
use it i'm gonna use it and the dangly
thing when she was dancing around was
going well yeah that was going the only
reason I can think of wearing up like
wireless bluetooth headset it's because
i'm going running or something like that
and that would not function very well
maybe we can put it on your back the
bracelet didn't look like it grabbed to
look like even when he like movie like
just to go far like I think they don't
have to defend but no I I just think
that one part was it looked like you're
able to you know those like those word
bracelets when you're like in high
school or that you were able to like
squish them together or like rings
they're like open sure yeah kind of push
them a little farther oh I thought
that's what it looked like I could be
wrong I don't know it is that but with
those types of it seems it doesn't
always always like grass yeah you all
the way especially because it's got like
tech inside everywhere so I mean I three
hours I wouldn't need this and I also
know I can't really think of anybody
that wouldn't just like earbuds are fine
for me I mean unless they're like crazy
like light and they're just the earbuds
I don't know you I think I could see
where this would be really handy if you
took a lot of public transportation so
like friends in New York this might be a
thing but for me I don't use ear buds
out and about ever like if at like ever
so it mean if I'm walking around in la
usually I have somebody with me and I
don't want to be rude and like what's
that folks in
that seems rude and then if i'm in my
car i'm listening through my car like
why would i have bluetooth headphones on
so maybe less for a car culture
community more for people who use public
transportation a lot I got you maybe
international like I can see a lot of
people in like London using stuff like
this like London New York places with a
lot of publishers named Charlie that I
listened to so many different like I
don't know it's fun to take out my phone
anyway to hit it I my toes and I have a
really good at pair of your bud so I
have a really good the only argument I
could make for it is I have a wallet
case and I don't carry a bag and I don't
want to stuff I can't stuff headphones
into my pocket like that would make me
crazy producer Logan would you back this
or hecklers no he says no he's out no
all right yeah i don't know i mean
that's that's three not that three
Hackett's really yeah I'd say for me not
personally interested like I like the
idea and I think it's cool and I love
the sort of compartment like secret
compartment and it looks like an actual
piece of Joel like a jewelry or you know
something interesting looking as a
pillow I like it already SmartWatch if
like I had money to throw everywhere
yeah then maybe I would do indeed I do
it but probably not here it just doesn't
make any sense but if I lived in New
York i think maybe yeah that's good
thinking you can't just think what you
do so yeah there you go that's what is
again it's called helix but let's go
from crowdfunding to the delightful
people known as you it's every user
feedback
I knew you'd like that all right so we
asked everybody last Thursday to tell us
about kepler-452b and if they would move
there not really knowing anything about
the planet we've learned a little bit
more apparently the gravity there is
pretty intense because it's bigger than
Earth yeah but they said that because
it's in the habitable zone like plants
could photosynthesize which means we
might be able to take plants there and
also over time over generations we'd
probably become stockier because of the
gravity like the extra gravity but we
could survive it like we we wouldn't die
like wouldn't be so much gravity that we
would immediately be squished like our
bodies could handle it it would just be
a little tough they they likened it to
like firefighters and people the
military who have carried really heavy
packs they're like we can do that like
physically humans will be able to handle
it it's just over time hat being weighed
down all the time we would probably
breed shorter stockier people that our
bones would be denser like we you know
that's so far down the road a time
people's backs are hurt oh yeah legs my
loss would be killing me anybody that's
in some sort of physical activity like
sports are gone and it like it's yet
water sports only just get a pool out
all right let's talk about what you guys
thought Paul wrote in and said I would
love to go I procreate the heck out of
that planet oh love the way yeah the
Winx but check out there man yeah get
out there and get it good Rick Rhoden
said I would go all interstellar on it
and half the like Anne Hathaway raise my
own community and they will praise me as
Lord Almighty hahaha well I don't know
man you got Darren have this like super
advanced group of people who are like
hey dub dub hey dub dub human get out of
here well I said I'd go there and like
read books and watch Netflix and stuff
and everyone else is like I would net
flix and chill over there 71 drive of
you everyone's like I would I wouldn't
impregnate everyone to be just like
fallout shelter I kishan wrote in and
said I'd moved there after I establish a
penpal earthling 2 point 0 keplinger
like kept llings we gotta calm Keplinger
yeah so I have someone to show me how to
survive their ID
think that's a really smart idea and I
bet if you cuz aol's still around i bet
you could still sign up for a pen pal
you might get one on Kepler 45 something
you don't want to know what kind of pen
pal you know weirdo pen pals on AOL I
used to have one when I was like a kid
right when the internet started her name
is Jenny and shielding Gainesville
Florida how long she same age yeah like
say me a gym to shoot semi school
pictures and I sent her school pictures
and we write each other letters and then
one day I she came to California and I
got to meet her and her family she's a
real person I had one that was like a
guy in a different country who knew his
own language and English and it got too
intense because like his life was like
way more difficult but he was like way
smarter than me and I just like I'm
wasting much hey sorry can't write back
to you you're better than me then he was
sad for the rest of his days there's a
guy out there who's like kale my pen pal
kale what happened uh Mitchell wrote in
and said no Mitchell says no he would
not go if they presuming human life have
not seen or discovered space activity it
could be underdeveloped forms of life so
that that might be true that might be a
thing so like if we haven't noticed but
a lot of people wrote in for this one a
lot of you guys wrote it and so many
people have great answers like pin was
mentioning he's like and a few other
people also mention they're like we
don't really we can't really see
anything about the plant we just know
it's there like we've we have detected
it and we know where it is and how about
how big it is but we don't really know
anything about we can only guess like
what's there what it could be rocky it
could be it could be covered in terrible
poisonous gases we don't we have no idea
I mean there's no way to really tell
until we can get you know a mission that
either we have like way better equipment
to see that stuff or detect it or we get
closer which yeah you know 1,400
light-years away not so great the series
of Kepler planets are not close the
planets orbiting 45 to are very far away
so it would take a really long time we
would be really dead unless we were
robots which cool all right last piece
user feedback it's time for our photog
refer the day
another painfully honest uh painfully
honest viewer wrote it stays max says
hey guys just started watching your show
in it's pretty good hahaha pretty good
that's true I took this picture at the
USS Arizona Memorial with my iphone 4s
great picture amazing picture I just and
also just you know what you know
anything about this picture it's pretty
good it's yeah it's pretty good oh man
I've been there that place is emotional
it is very intense very when your state
you can feel the weight of how important
that area is when you are there it's
amazing and that's a girlfriend there I
said she hated it really like it was
boring i was like it nobody was gonna
tap-dance for you at a memorial yeah
it's not you're not gonna see a parade I
mean no but yeah at least I have you
ever get the chance you have an extra
day in Hawaii like God today but if
you're hours by the airport like if you
get if you maybe get flight gets later
maybe have a couple hours to kill before
you got to check into the hotel go there
it's super worth it yeah it's messed up
really really nice um and it's I mean
it's really beautiful memorial and max
did a very nice job a pretty good job of
depicting that so thank you max ok
pretty good max we appreciate pretty
good photography I for our pretty good
show you will be minus C buddies let's
say see Lizzie see a solid see alright
guys if you want to send in your phone

cnet com you can also find us on social
media tomorrow daily on some of your
favorite social media sites but really

really think we're pretty good make sure
to follow us on twitter i'm at kill
alone again i'm at ashleys together
