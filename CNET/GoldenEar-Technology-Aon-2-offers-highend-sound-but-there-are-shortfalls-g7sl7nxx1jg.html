but unfortunately it doesn't look like
much it's kind of a minimalist black box
and while it seems you can remove the
cover pretty much card the speaker is
covered by a grill sock which protects a
folded ribbon tweeter and a six-inch
mid-range the speaker is a closed box
and instead of a traditional port the
golden air features opposing 6.5 inch
passive bass woofers but what you're
really paying for is performance not
looks or features the a on Tuesday the
skill is transparency put on an
orchestral recording and the speakers
completely disappear they are incredibly
detailed and have a wide open soundstage
if you like jazz or acoustic music of
any kind these are well worth a listen
what they really can't do though is rock
and roll they can make decent bass but
they kind of start falling apart with a
strong beat sadly these aren't the all
rounders you may have been looking for
while the a on Tues outperform our
favorite pioneer SP EBS 73 speakers in
terms of details the pioneers are still
our favorites for this kind of month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
