almost anyone can use it more and more
of these gorgeous photos are popping up
online
they usually have a surreal look to them
with high contrast saturated colors and
a lifted effect these photos look like a
lot of effort but they're actually
pretty easy to achieve I'm Sharon Vaknin
frisina and today I'll show you how to
take stunning HDR photos on your iPhone
or Android first the basics HDR or high
dynamic range photos are simply the
product of three different photos
combined one photo is taken out a dark
exposure another add irregular exposure
and the third is taken at a high
exposure capturing the most light when
these three photos are combined you
create a photo that looks much closer to
what the human eye sees the difference
is absolutely amazing blame the monkey
calm has a bunch of examples of
before-and-after HDR photos here's one
of the mountains in meteora greece
before and after as you can see the
difference in clarity and depth is huge
so now how can you do this let me show
you on the iPhone it's simple because
HDR is built into the camera on the
iPhone 4 and 4s launch the camera tap
options and turn HDR on now you can set
up your shot focus and hit the shutter
button when you do it's crucial you hold
your phone steady because your iPhone is
actually taking 3 photos in a row so if
you move you could end up with a blurry
photo my favorite way to keep it steady
is to use my iPhone headphones as a
shutter release just plug them in set up
your shot and click the volume up
control to activate the shutter your
iPhone will save the HDR photo to your
photo album along with the same photo at
a regular exposure so as you can see the
HDR version just pops more than the
regular photo now if you want to be able
to tweak the HDR effect after you take a
picture or you have an older iPhone
without the HDR option
you'll need an app called Pro HDR it's 2
bucks and comes highly recommended by
our CNET reviewers to use it launch the
app and set up your shot then hold
really still and tap the screen the app
will analyze the shot capture a few
photos and combine the images to create
your HDR photo now you can use the
settings below to tweak things like
brightness contrast and saturation to
exaggerate or tone down that HDR effect
when you're done hit save and you'll
find your photo in your album if you've
got an Android phone there's no built-in
HDR option like the iPhone but Pro HDR
is available in the Play Store for 2
bucks and works the same way just
remember to set the focus first and hold
really still while the app captures the
photos to get the best HDR results you
can experiment with different settings
and shot composition nighttime shots can
be more dramatic than daytime and
landscapes tend to work better than
portraits at least in my opinion and if
you're feeling extra fancy try combining
an HDR photo with an Instagram filter
for a really unique effect now I want
you to take some awesome HDR photos and
send them to me on Twitter for more tips
