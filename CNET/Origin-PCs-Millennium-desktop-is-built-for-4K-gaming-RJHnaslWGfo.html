very latest in CPU and GPU hardware I'm
Dan Ackerman this is the origin PC
millennium now this is a bill to order
gaming desktop PC that a company named
Origin PC makes and you can configure
this in a lot of different ways starting
from about $1500 up to $6,000 and north
and the reason we're primarily
interested in looking at this particular
model is because it's our first chance
to see a couple of very important new
pieces of hardware one is Intel's
Haswell II processor that's a super
high-end Core i7 processor that's really
intended for these gaming systems and
that just was announced back at the end
of August and also Nvidia is latest
desktop graphics card we have the
highest end one in here that's the
nvidia geforce gtx 980 and we have not
just one not two we have three of these
cards all strung together so if you put
that together with the new intel x99
chipset you've pretty much got every
bleeding-edge gaming pc piece of
hardware in one big box so what would
you do with a very high-end gaming
desktop like this there's only so far
you can push games on 1920 by 1080
monitors we hook this up to a 4k TV and
this is a 4k gaming that's really the
next horizon for gaming and this is one
of the few systems that can actually
handle that we played a whole bunch of
games cranked up to 4k cranking the
detail levels the game scale from medium
high to very high not quite ultra
because you're pushing four times in
pixels and really the first time we're
able to get a very satisfying 4k gaming
experience it really miles beyond
anything you can do with a current gen
game console or a gaming laptop or even
most other gaming desktops now here's
the bad news
this configuration cost $6,000 the
better news is if you really want all
this next gen stuff yeah you can you
could dial down the CPU a little bit and
still keep it as well and just get one
of these cards
tell me about $2,800 in the same
millennium case from Origin PC and they
do a very nice job making a very
adjustable case you can set it up with
the window on this side you can invert
it some windows on this side you can
actually rotate the whole motherboard 90
degrees you know the cards pointing down
from the top that actually gives you
some bit
heat management and of course you want
to hook this up as we do here with a
liquid cooling system if you're the kind
of person who's in the market for eight
six thousand dollar gaming desktop
you probably already know kind of what
you're looking for what kind of hardware
and how you want it set it up but it's
very nice to have that flexibility in a
case that's a little bit different from
a lot of the off-the-shelf cases that
you see a lot of even high-end gaming
desktops built into I obviously get
plenty of ports and connections on the
back especially if you have three video
cards in there in the front they've got
this window that opens up and you've got
five hot swappable hard drive trays in
here so that's really cool if you want
to move a lot of data around or just
access data very quickly and put in a
new drive and upgrade it I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the origin PC
