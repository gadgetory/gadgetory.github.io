triumphant to claim its place as a
rightful leader of the high-definition
future in other big news this week the
Navy planned to shoot down an errant spy
satellite that was hurtling toward Earth
carrying a toxic payload of hydrazine
fuel in navy simulations the missile
would be launched from a ship intercept
and destroy the satellite and the debris
field which is presumably filled with
smaller bits of toxic hydrazine fuel
would burn up before entering Earth's
atmosphere the Navy estimates it has a
better than eighty percent chance of
hitting the satellite before it crashes
to earth and reeks unknown havoc as we
went to press it was unknown whether the
Navy's attempt to shoot down the
satellite was successful if not and this
