cnet.com today I'm taking a first look
at the epson workforce 645 multifunction
printer so for a hundred and fifty bucks
the 645 is a capable performer that's
where small offices thanks to its
do-it-all features it's an all-in-one
which means you get a printers scanner
and a fax machine along with a copier
with a control panel in the front that
omits the complications of a touchscreen
in lieu of real buttons despite all
those features inside Epson manages to
keep its footprint relatively manageable
all of the trades do close from the 30
sheet document feeder on top that's for
hands-free scanning all the way down to
the 250 sheet paper input tray on the
bottom now the only part of the printer
that gets bulky is the rear mounted auto
duplexer but that's a worthwhile
sacrifice for a tool that automatically
will flip over your sheets for economic
double-sided printing looking back to
the control panel on the front you get a
host of buttons for one touch copy
settings as well as a list of speed dial
buttons for the fax machine you'll also
notice a media card reader on the
left-hand side that supports compact
flash cards XD and SD cards from your
digital cameras as well as he picked
bridge USB port for saving and printing
pictures directly off a thumb drive so
you can connect the printer to a
computer using one of two ways a
hardwired USB connection or using the
built-in 802 11 BG wireless print server
it's really easy to connect and it only
took me about two minutes to input my
network information and I was up and
printing without cords there's also an
Ethernet port on the back if you want
multiple people to use it in an office
if this printer is just for you though
Wi-Fi really is the best way for
connectivity because it lets you use
Epsons free mobile printing suite those
apps let you output photos taken on
smartphones directly to the printer
Neptune also recently launched
compatibility with its connect email
print apps those letting you send jobs
directly to the printers email address
anyone can use that ID to print through
the cloud and I should also mention that
the 645 works with Google Cloud Print
and Apple air print you can read all the
details including speed and quality
performance scores in our full review on
cnet.com but that's gonna do it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the epson workforce 645
multifunction printer thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
