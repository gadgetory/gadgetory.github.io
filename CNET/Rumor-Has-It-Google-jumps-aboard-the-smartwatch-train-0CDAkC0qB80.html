week's guest host and welcome to rumor
has it the show where we round up the
week's biggest tech rumors and vote on
the ones that sound legit and the ones
that sound like it's probably a no-go
and remember that you can vote on all of
the rumors too so keep your eye out for
the pole in the interactive player if
you're watching on CNN first up my
favorite kind of rumor next gen consoles
according to leaked Microsoft documents
on the site VG leaks the next Xbox will
only offer hard drive based gameplay
back you won't be able to play a game
from the optical drive which will also
be blu-ray the doc goes on to say that
it'll be big enough quote to hold a
large number of games don't panic though
because it also says that you'll be able
to play the game wallets downloading
downloading games could mean faster load
times too but as noted by the verge this
leaked document is from last year so
keep in mind that Microsoft could have
made a gajillion changes since then a
gajillion yes more or less that's a
ballpark figure okay gotcha our next
rumor is from the people over at droid
life who says that Google play's UI is
getting a bunch of new design tweaks
these include larger thumbnail and icon
images a leaner and more streamline
layout and my personal favorite some new
menu typefaces you're seriously excited
about that aren't you I just I have a
lot of time on my hands don't judge me
well whatever you're excited about from
what we can tell from the alleged
preview the stores new look appears to
be tidier right and small things like
that users also installed window that
pops up right after you start download
an app has seemed to disappear in
general though everything looks to be
about the same so you're not going to
wake up one day and you see that your
google play pulled a facebook on you and
timeline dress next up TechCrunch is
reporting that amazon has a $99 kindle
fire on the horizon citing nobody
TechCrunch just heard that the 7-inch
device is on the production line with
plans to ship sometime this year
reportedly the new device would use a TI
chip and offer a 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution just like the current kindle
HD 7-inch tablet amazon recently dropped
the prices
the 8.9 inch kindle fire this is a
techcrunch to believe that much cheaper
7-inch kindle fires are on its way
that's a really big leap that a hundred
dollar price difference is huge
especially when Amazon already loses
money on each of its one hundred ninety
nine dollar kindle fires so I don't
really think that this rumor is true at
all ever and hey neither does Amazon
apparently it totally refuted a claim
and basically called TechCrunch a silly
goose then we're all in agreement next a
rumor from the Financial Times says that
Google may be developing a SmartWatch I
have a jawbone up that I'm obsessed with
for no reason at all so I'm sure when
all of these smartwatches come out I'll
buy each one and like wear them on my
arms like their sleeves right because
that won't look nerdy whatsoever keep in
mind smartwatches are nothing new
Samsung has been making them for years
sony LG and motorola have some and apple
is rumored on this show even to be
working on that right lee named i watch
so that i do that google is throwing its
head in the ring may not sound so
far-fetched especially now that we've
reached a point in tech that we can cram
all of these software features into a
tiny amount of space true and i think
that walking around with this chunk of
tech on your wrist doesn't look as
unseemly or douche-baggy as say Google
glasses what do you guys think will
Google jump onto the SmartWatch
bandwagon do you care do you think it'll
be called the G time don't forget to
vote and leave us a comment and we'll
check in with the cnet Council the cnet
Council is composed of five editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the council's
verdict is a unanimous yes every one of
the editors we asked think that Google
is coming out with its own SmartWatch
that's our show everybody please share
your rumors that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and
tweet us and thanks tool in this week's
guest host tune in next week for more
tech rumors
