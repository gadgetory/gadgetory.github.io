I actually own I get to play with a lot
of tech toys but I don't like spending
money these are the gadgets I'm glad to
have bought and would probably buy again
and number 5 my Roku now I've got an
older Roku Roku 3 actually it's still
really reliable and has tons of apps so
I can access Netflix Hulu HBO now pretty
much whatever I like my Roku so much I
want to getting a Roku TV as well and
number four the controversial Apple iPad
I own the original iPad air it's got a
great screen and is really responsive
the iPad has a huge advantage over
Android tablets as the iPad has a lot of
tablet specific apps available it is
really a great device suite all kinds of
stuff including comics which I read and
number three the Amazon echo I've got
both an Amazon echo and a Google home in
my tiny apartment the Amazon echo is
currently the better of the two it is an
excellent smart home hub and generally
does a great job listening to commands
the Amazon echo skill set is huge and
will probably keep growing I sometimes
forget that it's a speaker 2 and number
2 is my Google pixel I actually
pre-ordered the Google pixel after I
watched Google introduce the phone the
pixel is very fast the fingerprint
sensor works as well as my old iPhone 6
I'm also a big fan of Google assistance
which is baked into the pixel launcher
and at number one my favorites gadget
the Harmony remote I probably bought at
least five different harmony remotes
over the years if you've never heard of
them harmony remotes are the best
universal remotes you'll find they
arrange everything into activities so
one button press will turn on your TV
and your other components plus set your
receiver to the right input oh by the
way harmony works with the Amazon echo
the integration is not as simple as it
could be but it's a start and those are
my current favorite gadgets at least I
think so
let me know if I'm wrong I'm a daya's on
Twitter and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
