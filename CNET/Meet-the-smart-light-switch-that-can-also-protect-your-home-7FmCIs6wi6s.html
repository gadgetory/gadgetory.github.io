smart home products in the past but this
comfy switch with camera is actually
kind of cool so the basic gist is that
it can control two different light
switches so the top panel will control
one light and the bottom will control
another it also has a built in 1080p 130
degree field of view camera which is
really unique for a light switch but
pretty cool I mean you can install it
pretty much anywhere in your house where
you have an existing one or two gang
lights which and then if it's installed
in an optimal spot to check out for
intruders or someone else that you don't
want in your house it can be a security
device as well it picks up on motion
sound it has an if channel and it does
all of that really well the only thing I
experienced that wasn't awesome was a
couple of phantom motion alerts but at
250 bucks
it's definitely expensive so if you're
just looking for a security camera just
spend 200 bucks on an S cam or some
other live-streaming camera but if you
are looking for a light switch I'd
actually take a look at dealings comfy
switch with camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
