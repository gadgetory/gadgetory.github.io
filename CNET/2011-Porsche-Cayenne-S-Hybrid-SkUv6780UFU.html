stands for piggy
where does hybrid fit in there well I
guess we'll find out as we drive to 2011
Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid and check the
ten the Cayenne is the cash cow at
Porsche outselling its second bestseller
the Panamera by double that means volume
and that means important regulatory
gains can be had by offering your volume
leader as a hybrid you see you didn't
need to ask for this car for it to be
made now inside a Cayenne hybrid looks
just like inside of a Cayenne non-hybrid
in fact I'm not even a detail the cabin
tech and such go see our video on the
2011 Cayenne S the non hybrid it's the
same load of tech optional and standard
you can find that it's C net TV just
type in 2011 Cayenne when you get there
now Porsche has now gone to an 8-speed
automatic on their Cayennes it comes all
the way back in your normal fashion goes
over to the side for a gait forward for
an upshift back for a down you've also
got these metallized paddle thingies on
the wheel here on the screen this will
show your hybrid energy flow so what
combination of power is going to the
wheels and what's your battery state now
down here behind our traditional
suspension settings which again a
Cayenne S would have without a hybrid is
the e power button when you press E
power it puts the car in a mode to bias
toward running on electric and of course
deplete the battery more so you can
drive this guy for a few miles depending
on how you get into it as an electric
vehicle you see here on the main
tachometer right in front of your
classic Porsche stuff the big gauges the
tach you've got something new here a
ready range
this car has auto start/stop not just
when you're stopped at a light but also
when you're driving and don't need
motive powers you can go down the
highway in this guy and the tach will
rather unsettlingly drop down to dead
that's because it's freewheeling the
motor there's a clutch that will let the
engine get disconnected and then turn
itself off
now when you move a Cayenne around as a
hybrid you change a lot of things not
just slap an electric motor on there if
I lift this cover off you can see we've
got a blower here there's the tail tail
pulley going into that housing
supercharger on the top into this
relatively small 3 liter v6 as opposed
to the standard Cayennes big bore v8 now
all in this guy develops 380 horsepower
428 foot-pounds of torque
big numbers from a fairly small engine
gets this guy zero to 60 in 6.1 seconds
this is no lightweight vehicle while
delivering 2024 mpg through that one
choice only 8-speed Tiptronic automatic
but note this 47 of those horsepower and
221 foot-pounds of that torque come from
the electric motor which is down the
stream a little bit and there's a clutch
between this engine and the electric
motor and transmission that allow it to
be pretty much divorced from the
drivetrain when that's the greenest way
to run let the vehicle totally freewheel
without any drag losses off the engine
and do start/stop in a very ambitious
way that's part of the formula to get
pretty good mpg considering now
interestingly Porsche did not put a
hybrid badge on the back of the car
that's where most people see what's in
front of them anyway I'm kind of
surprised by that just those small ones
up on the side but there's other stuff
in the back of this car that does tell
you it's a hybrid back here in the cargo
bay load flat floor pick this guy up and
well well well look at that that is not
a spare tire folks that's one big ol
honkin nickel metal hydride battery as
it says right there now because that's
there the spare tire isn't there isn't
one in this car pretty sure a Cayenne S
says either a mini spare or full sized
right there instead you get this little
concession for the modern world this
little tool kit with a little ranch and
stuff like that but the real giveaway is
this Porsche rind infliction diction
middle other words tire goop when you
get a flat tire
you're ingloriously hunkered down on the
side of the road squirting this stuff in
there hoping it holds no spare you've
also got a little very cool little
porsche air pump right here to put the
air back in once the goop's in there
that's a big difference from a standard
Cayenne s now because they got all this
stuff back here the battery
the sealant the spare pump and all that
you have a little less cargo space 3.2
cubic feet less cargo space in the back
of a hybrid it's not obvious but it's
subtle that's kind of the size of one
small to medium suitcase that you're not
going to fit in here
okay underway the Cayenne is shall we
say complicated think about it now
you've got a v6 engine which is
underpowered for this car in its
displacement but then you've got a
supercharger that takes it well into the
healthy range but the supercharger can
be in boost or not depending where you
are the accelerator curve that all goes
to an electric motor which can be in or
out
there's brake regeneration when you get
on the brakes depending on how hard you
get on them you've got a clutch that can
separate the engine from the rest of the
drivetrain depending whether you're
freewheeling and the whole thing will
auto start-stop whether you come to a
stop or sometimes when you're driving it
high speeds and all of that equation
gets pumped out through an 8-speed
automatic that does a bit of thinking
now if that doesn't sound complicated to
you you don't know what complicated is
and this car does drive complicatedly
it's transitions and its overall
everyday driving are just kind of bulky
and clunky and back and forth not
egregiously so you know it's an
expensive car but it's just doing too
much transitioning on the open road when
you're really getting into it that's
fine it doesn't have those issues but
around town every day commute I found it
to be kind of a tiring mess of
sensations and transitions that I got
tired of time for the bottom line let's
put the cayenne s up against the Cayenne
S Hybrid average mpg 18 for the S 21 for
the hybrid so you pick up three miles
per gallon average zero to sixty five
point six versus six point one the
hybrids half a second slower curve
weight the hybrids 385 pounds heavier
cargo space the hybrid holds 3.2 cubic
feet less greenhouse gases here's a
surprise the hybrids a little dirtier
spare tire well no and the price you're
paying four thousand dollars more for a
Cayenne S hybrid so if you drive 15,000
miles a year and pay 450 a gallon for
gas you can earn back the hybrid premium
in
seven and a half years so as you can
tell I've got my doubts whether a
Cayenne Hybrid makes sense in your life
or mine but for the manufacturer Porsche
it definitely does because of the
increasingly tight standards for
emission and fuel economy in the
European market and in the US they need
vehicles like this in their mix because
these guys sell hand over fist to make
them a little bit more efficient helps
their average numbers to get to what the
government requires and that frees up
Porsche to sell more sports cars that do
what they do unabashedly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
