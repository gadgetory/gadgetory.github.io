Vegas
I'm Donnell Bell he's Paul Sloane I'm
gonna talk for you
sheesh our tip cane and we're kicking
off the day here with your inside scoop
from the biggest trade show in the world
right now this is a press conference
underway here in the South Hall with the
makers of the Pebble watch a Kickstarter
project so later in the day the folks
from Pebble will be here but let's see
what if we can listen to what they're
saying right now it's made of
polycarbonate so it's strong and there's
a polycarbonate lens on top protecting
the display we've put a hard coat on top
of this polycarbonate lens an anti
scratch an anti scratch coat the strap
is a standard 22 millimeter watch strap
we designed a custom strap that fits
really great all right when you're
apologizing that'd be the color does
seem to be off in the stream I don't
think that's on our end here so he looks
like he's from Avatar but that's it's a
feature there as well you can do that
just with a standard a standard band
what makes it a great sports watch is
that it's actually five atoms it's it's
water-resistant to 5 atmospheres now we
mentioned this during our Kickstarter
project but we never really explained or
when we announced it during our
Kickstarter project we didn't really get
into the details so we're proud to say
that through the design process we've
been able to maintain a 5 atmosphere
rating for pebble this means that it's
perfect for going for a run in the rain
or swimming or going sailing or you know
even doing the dishes if if you got to
do that the pebble it it it really is
kind of cool because it means that you
don't have to take off your watch when
you're doing you know running around
doing the everyday life I leave my wash
on quite a long time
another thing that we have announced is
the announced yet is the magnetic
charging cable in order to make the
watch waterproof or water-resistant we
had to come up with an innovative method
for charging the watch a lot of other
sports and smartwatches
have very clunky Docs or cradles that
involve a large a large piece of plastic
that you have to carry around to to
charge your watch we've designed
something a little different it's a tiny
USB cable with a with a custom head on
the end that snaps onto your pebble just
like that it means that we don't have
any gaping holes in the side of the
watch for a charge port and it means
that we can we can still maintain our
water-resistant rating so this is the
this is the cable
as we announced during our Kickstarter
project it's a we've made a we made a
very colorful watch as you might as you
might know we had a color option as one
of the reward types on our Kickstarter
project and that involved a vote where I
think we had over 16,000 people vote for
which color they wanted we we ended up
getting so many votes that we decided to
add two extra colors on top of the
original red white and black we've added
orange and gray to the to the pebble
color gamut we spent a lot of time
working on the colors because we knew
that all right we're gonna bring it back
here we've got the the people from
pebble coming here at 11 o'clock it
sounds like we're gonna be hearing a lot
of the same things at 11:00 that we're
hearing right now but we'll be able to
actually show you closer what he's
talking about
that's some pretty cool though kind of
like a magnetic MagSafe charging cable
for your watch of the future yeah I mean
the hype and excitement around this
project was just like nothing we've ever
ever seen so they gotta deliver some
pretty neat stuff yeah I hope so we'll
be back with them at 11 o'clock but
there's a lot of news to catch up with
that we've been seeing over the the past
day so let's catch up with some of it
here one of the things we talked a lot
about 4k yesterday when in terms of
televisions we did see yesterday Scott
signs showed us a 4k tablet seems a
little ridiculous because we were
talking I said about how 4k doesn't
really make sense on screens that are
smaller than maybe you know 80 inches
but here we're looking at a 4k tablet
with a 20 inch display 20 inch IPS LED
backlit LCD and this is being shown to
us from Panasonic so what do you guys
think is this the future of of tablets
about 20 inch tablets and tablets that
are 4k listen to the Panasonic talking
about that it sure seemed like Panasonic
trying to show the competition they can
up things but it's hard to imagine right
where's the content gonna come from
I mean it's 20 inches it's will look
nicer then they say then the Mac you
know Retina display but where's the
content it's the same problem
we're lacking apps that would be
optimized for 4k we're lacking yeah
apparently it takes a while for photos
to load onto the tablet to really make
all those pixels sing and it's also it's
dead it's still 20 inch tablet I mean
board games would look amazing on this
has they also made I think it was 23
inches it's you know massive and that's
what they're you know it's kind of a
their position is almost like an
all-in-one desktop that you can like lay
flat and play like air hockey and
various other games on so we've seen a
few others that are about this size at
the show I think once you get once
you've gotten past Retina right what
your eyes be ability to perceive pixels
a doubling mat is not going to make that
argument you keep hearing against 4k is
that the eyes can't really tell the
difference I mean I walked around and
looked at a lot of the 4k television
side-by-side and they make them look
great and you get really close and it
looks great but it's pretty hard to it's
pretty hard to decipher I love this idea
though that 4k is kind of on this
tipping point of if consumers do get
excited about it we're gonna see 4k
everything there's gonna be 4k toasters
just anything's gonna have 4k slapped
onto it but if they don't get excited
about it then it's gonna be a retreat to
some other feature right and what will
it cost I don't know I mean it's tile
it'll probably be like $10,000 and if it
ever hits the market speaking of
features sure you got to talk with
Samsung yesterday about this idea of
maybe feature fatigue in their their
televisions yeah I mean it kind of goes
across all of Samsung's products
honestly you know they've always been
known for cramming a lot of features
into products which allows you to kind
of do whatever you want with it but the
problem is most people just bull stream
Netflix
you know they'll have you know 3,000
apps or whatever Samsung is up to now
but they do very few of those do they
have maybe like the data and statistics
on how many people actually use their
features I honestly have no idea it's
more anecdotal I think you know that I
mean and you know for myself you know
with like a Smart TV
I am basically going and watching either
like Netflix or Amazon Prime or you know
whatever service is on there
necessarily taking advantage of
everything I mean and you see it in
their phones as well they you know
basically across their entire product
line I mean their refrigerators are you
know tricked out with all of these
amazing things you can do with them it's
just a matter of if you really need to
it seems like a trend or an idea that's
at odds with everything CES is about
though of simplifying their products
instead of yeah I mean and that is
actually one of their big focuses for
this year is trying to make everything
simpler so they're hiring a lot of
people out in the valley and in their
other design centers to work on the user
interface interface and make it easier
you know they launch some features here
that do that they're with their Smart TV
they have a new interface that you know
that's a little simpler so it's easier
to access things they're gonna be
launching this video they call it a
video discovery tool they don't have it
named right now but basically from one
app or one screen you'll be able to
search all of your video streaming
services and live TV and they're also
gonna put it on their mobile devices so
you'll be in this app and you'll be like
oh I want to watch modern family where
is it playing so it'll show you if it's
on live TV or it'll show you you know if
it's on maybe on Netflix Amazon and you
know blockbuster or whatever and you can
just go straight to it and you know
watch it on this TV with the with the
tablet you'll be able to watch it on
your tablet or it'll even act as a
remote you can't watch the live TV on
the tablet unless you're streaming from
the TV because I feel like it's
something that you know not to bring up
Apple at it and not Apple show but I
feel like it's something that that
company has kind of baked into their
whole philosophy for making products and
so you expect it from them I was gonna
ask is whether you think they're doing
this in and in anticipation of whatever
Apple TV might or might not come at me
potentially and I think they're actually
probably hiring people from Apple you
know they said that they're you know
hiring a lot of people with expertise in
this area you know right from rivals on
your resume exactly yeah yeah I mean
that is you know has been a trademark of
Apple but I but you know for Samsung
people want a lot of those features you
know with with Android you want to be
able to take your gadget and make it
yours you know you don't want to you
know
kind of been a criticism or I get you
know the people who like Android that's
what they really like about it right you
know so for Samsung it's kind of this
fine line that they kind of have to deal
with where they do want to make it
easier they do want people to know how
to use the different features but they
don't want to limit anyway if you put
simple to use as a sticker on a box for
an Android phone no one would buy it
yeah or there's a contingent who would
buy it but the standard Android audience
I think would yeah all right well we'll
see if maybe CES 2014 is billed as the
the simpler future but right now it
seems like it's the 4k future it's also
apparently the future for autonomous
vehicles we're seeing we're seeing - Wow
my computer's showing me things I don't
want to see but we're seeing two car
manufacturers talking about autonomous
vehicles we're seeing many of them from
yesterday though that we wanted to talk
about here you know the days all blur
together
howdy showed us a self-driving vehicle
that I feel like the big takeaway on
this one is that they've been able to
shrunk down shrunk down drink down the
the laser array that would help you help
the car be able to see where it's going
so instead of this giant Tesla coil
looking thing on the top of your car
which is what the Google car has which
makes it really fun to drive you I think
they've shrunk it down to a smaller kind
of kit like looking array that maybe
goes into the the first automaker to get
a license to test these in Nevada of
course Google has a license but it's not
technically an automaker so they were
very careful in their language but it's
sort of a big deal so if you want to get
hit by an autonomous car
here's your lawsuit ready yeah Nevada is
the place to make that happen all right
Lexus was also showing off Lexus however
made a big point of saying it's not an
autonomous car there was a lot of press
that came up in it in advance of the
show last week saying that they would
Lexus was going to come out in Toyota
we're coming out with these self-driving
cars and they had their press conference
to say here's our car of the few
but it's not self-driving right we still
very much believe in humans but we're
putting all these lasers and sensors and
we're gonna it's all about safety safety
safety there might be some concern you
know remember Toyota had that whole
accelerating brake issue a few years
back I think they want to be very
careful to say no but you know the car
will drive itself you still matter yes
part of the court there too but it's
definitely you know this is definitely a
theme going on the more tech you can
pile into these cars to you know into
cars in general to make them park to
make them sense out oncoming objects to
make them see things at night to make
them break when you don't need them you
know what you do if you if you're not
breaking fast enough all these things
are sort of getting worked into the
dynamic so it's interesting yeah I'm all
for it I feel like the time I'm the most
in a rage in a car is when I'm stuck in
traffic and it sounds like that's the
problem that they're solving first is
that kind of stop and go driving make
sure you just don't hit the car in front
of you as you're just inching forward
I'm for it I hope I hope this arrives
soon although I hope the money for me in
my life to buy a self-driving car and a
4k TV we also we didn't mention
yesterday Nvidia is big reveal of their
handheld gaming platform and you had
some time to talk with yeah yeah I met
with their CEO Jenson Wang yesterday he
showed me the device it's clearly a
product that he wanted to make for
himself you know sell to the public yeah
I mean it's I'm not a gamer but if I was
I'm pretty sure I'd be you know ready to
preorder this tomorrow that as excited
as everyone is for kind of a novel new
device because it's a handheld kind of
Xbox look at it feels like a controller
I can controller and then the screen
like opens up out of it yeah I mean you
know it's not a big screen you know it
is you know it's it's a relatively small
screen Android device it's an Android
it's poor yeah but it's it's not
something where you would buy it as like
a if you're a gamer would be like your
phone or your tablet it really is
strictly made
that's like a wireless gaming yeah I
mean it's a wireless gaming device but
you can also access your
you can watch videos you can you can use
it at your email on that touch screen
with a big controller I'm not but but
you can't that thing is you can like if
you wanted to you don't have to take you
know if you're a gamer you don't you
wouldn't have to take your iPad along
with you as well to just you know be
able to access an app or you know
whatever you want but he's serious about
making this is not just I mean it's
coming out he said he's coming out any
games right it plugs into your Wi-Fi
yeah you can stream from your yeah I
mean they're trying to make it so you
can game wherever you are you know you
can stream from your PC you know there's
the various gaming platforms you'll be
able to use with it you can also like
stream from the device you know to the
TV you know he's really serious about
you know cloud gaming like letting
people access their games wherever they
are you know of course you know the the
device they showed is just a prototype
it wasn't you know it's not they saw
some work to do but you know they say
second quarter so I think it's
interesting I mean it's it's this whole
vertical ization trend right in which
they're making their full device just
like Microsoft starts making their own
devices and doing the whole thing and
it's sort of the Apple model again of
make of making everything from soups to
nuts and and hence sort of maybe
potentially getting in a way of
competitors yeah I mean and you know
that was a point I talked about him with
you know talked about uh if you know the
PC guys you know they're traditional
partners if this is gonna anchor them
and he said oh no you know we're not
gonna make a smart phone we're not gonna
make a tablet you know we are out there
to make this one specific device because
we think we have something to offer here
and for Nvidia yeah for now
I mean it you know and for it videos
yeah ya know exactly I mean for NVIDIA
gamers are there you know yeah their
core you know those are the guys who are
gonna buy their really high-end graphics
and you know what it comes down to four
Nvidia is the more people that use this
the more people buy their chips you know
the more people who use the cloud gaming
the more people are gonna buy you know
they have this new server rack that's
you know specifically for like optimized
for gaming so one caveat I think I did
hear about for streaming your pcs games
to the controller is that it needs to be
from a computer that was using Nvidia
graphics card
I'm sure and that soft way and it still
be over like a local network - it
wouldn't be like you would be playing
your PC's games from work desk yeah I
mean but you know who know who knows
what's possible in the future you know
they're working on you know he said
they're talking to talking to cable
companies telcos everybody you know
cable companies are looking at you know
using their kind of like cloud gaming
server system to allow people to have
like an extra channel on their cable box
it's gaming so then you pay like eight
or nine dollars a month or something and
you have a gaming channel where it's
your games and you can access games and
it's on your TV you don't need a console
Microsoft has probably the best set of
assets already to take this thing on and
make it in the by because they already
have Xbox they have their their windows
8 tie-in for that and that also has a
mobile platform and make tablets now I
always have Windows I they have all the
different streaming partners for that
content and honestly that the Nvidia
controller looks a lot like old it's fun
to see companies taking chances and
bringing stuff out that's probably why
this is getting so much attention to is
that is something different it's not a
fourth is the other thing you know
everybody thought oh great well you know
talk about the mobile chip at the show
you know maybe some other surprises but
nobody was really quite expecting
something like this some other
unexpected things that we saw let's see
Heather sell this was an interesting one
this is a a rechargeable battery with a
Bluetooth chip built inside of it - and
that seems like an odd pairing of things
but the way that it works is that it
applies your batteries so if you wanted
to have put batteries in something and
be able to control it turning on and off
with your phone or your tablet this
would this would do that and they in the
article here mentions the idea of like
killing off your kids annoying toys if
they're your Furby yeah so that you'd
have a dedicated Furby turn off app but
also it could it could tell you when
your batteries are running low and your
smoke detector maybe so that your app
your phone would notify you that you
need to change I I've lost enthusiasm of
the story as I'm talking about I
realized that I don't want that this is
one of these things that you know we've
got a lot of comments on this piece a
lot of people saying exactly this this
is just like a solution in search of a
problem but I don't know you know one
commenter said well if you leave your
bike in your garage and you're light on
your bike is still on it'll tell you
when you get upstairs I guess I mean
you'd have to think that this would have
to be integrated in everything then and
what are the odds of that like how many
manufacturers are gonna put this in
every single product they introduce all
right guys thank you both for talking
with me today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
