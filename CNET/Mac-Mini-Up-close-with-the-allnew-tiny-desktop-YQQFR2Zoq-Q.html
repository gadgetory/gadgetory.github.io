million podcasts I'm talking about Apple
Mac Mini this small Mac desktop been
around for a long time and it was always
the least expensive way to get into
either an OS 10 or later Mac OS
environment
it started at $500 and people hooked it
up and used it for video production for
music and audio production they use it
as a as a home server it could really
fit anywhere and you didn't have a
screen with it you brought your own
keyboard and mouse it was a real small
plug-and-play unobtrusive Mac computer
really unlike anything else in line but
it's also been sitting around unchanged
since 2014 which was the last time I
reviewed a Mac Mini and here we are at
long last year 2018 with a brand new Mac
Mini even though it looks the same I
feel like they ought to call it the Mac
Mini Pro because it's clearly been
redesigned in order to appeal to all the
pro and semi-pro users who use these for
podcasts audio recordings or other
creative jobs like that you can even see
right here we've got this new Mac Mini
hooked up to a music creation station so
that gives you a good idea of how people
use these devices now what they've done
is they've upgraded the processor inside
to an eighth gen along with the other
new mat you get either quad 4 or 6 core
processors here you can also get up to
64 gigs of ram and up to a 2 terabyte
solid-state hard drive and that's all
very impressive stuff that you need you
probably won't have to hook up an
external hard drive to store your
content at least not as much as you
would with the older man
but I think more important is pretty
much all of the other Macs have USBC
board and that's pretty much it if you
want to keep some old-school ports and
connections on your Mac this and the
iMac are pretty much your only choices
you have got some USB C / thunderbolt
ports on the back of this but you've
also got a real-life Ethernet port note
doc will required you've also got two
USB 8 ports that's the old traditional
style USB and of course you have got an
HDMI port which is something that
everyone finds very useful but you're
not going to find out any new MacBook
MacBook Air or macbook pro and that
means you can use this as your content
creation station a lot more easily than
you could one of those other models
where you'd have to hook up a bunch of
dongles and stuff now the old Mac Mini
started at $4.99 great entry price as
with the MacBook Air this one is a
little bit more expensive the starting
price jumps up to $7.99
and that gets you a core i3 H gent Intel
processor and if you want to move up to
a core i5 or beyond well that's
obviously going to cost more however
this still is the least expensive way to
get mac OS now in a computer in your
house it is in a desktop form not at
laptop form which is different than what
most people have for their Mac
experience but this guy has a ton of
fans and they might even like the new
space grey color as opposed to the more
traditional silver color it was before
otherwise looks pretty much the same on
the outside understand there's no
fingerprint reader on it but you do get
that t2 security chip so that's pretty
much across the board in almost all of
the new Macs and this guy I believe you
can order it starting today and it
should be available maybe by next week
that is Apple's new Mac Mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
