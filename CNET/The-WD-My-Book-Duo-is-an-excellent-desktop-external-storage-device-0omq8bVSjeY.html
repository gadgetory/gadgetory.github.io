my book dual extra hard drive format WT
you know this is a thing that connects
to computer and add more story to it up
to 12 ter by in this case but my book
here can add a lot more than just
storage and that's because on the back
here it has two extra USB 3.0 ports you
can use these port to host any USB
devices such as printer phones or purple
drives like this one I have right here
or even another my book dual unit now
this is first time I've seen that you
can actually daisy chain USB drives
now the my book dual here has two
internal hard drives on the inside so
let's see what they are
it's actually very easy to get to the
drive on the inside thank to this lid on
top here that pops up when I press this
button just like that here you go - WD
red drives actually can remove or
replace this drive without using any
extra tools except for my hands which by
the way are the best tool possibly
better than yours these two drives here
can be configured in red 0 or red one
using the WB drive utility software here
red 0 for best performance and maximum
capacity why red one is to protect data
in case one of the drives fails the my
book dual also include w smart wear and
w security for backup and encryption
purposes this actually also very helpful
application there's another very cool
thing about the drive here it shared the
same power status with the host computer
when the computer is up the dry turns
itself off and by cohn when the computer
boots up and now it go to sleep mode to
the my book dual is not the fast ever
seen but among the fastest on the market
with the red 0 it resistor the sustain
will will copy speed up some 120
megabytes per second for writing and
some 210 megabyte per second for reading
it was slower in red one but was still
very fast obviously you need to use USB
3.0 to have that kind of speed so how
much does it cost
that's what the good news is the my book
duo here is available in four six eight
and 12 terabyte with the price starting
from just $280 in the US or 250 pounds
in the UK that's a very good deal for a
hardware red/system
now from all the driver check out my
full review at CENTCOM you know it's an
excellent external storage device the
only question is what do you have to
fill up in storage space because
personally I don't need it I keep most
of my data right here let's be booking
out just fine
but that's only because I'm dumb no and
this has been the first look at the my
book door from WD by the way is
dangerous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
