buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week on location
the gadget of the week is championship
sprint this is part of the history of
video games Museum here at e3 2006 this
is really more my speed when it comes to
gaming all you do is go around a little
track and pick up golden wrenches and
try not to get picked up by a little
race track tornado that happens all the
time right it's no Grand Theft Auto I
admit but then again I never was much
for killing cops and now for the news so
as you can see I've just returned from
e3 the giant games and entertainment
show held each year in Los Angeles and
this was the first year that we saw new
restrictions on the use of so-called
booth babes the Entertainment Software
Association prohibited sexually explicit
clothing nudity partial nudity and
bathing suit bottoms on the other hand a
giant video screen showing an alien
scorpion jumping on a guy's back driving
a stake through the back of his head and
blowing his face off while blood
spatters onto the barrel of your still
smoking machine gun that's totally fine
yeah in other news the city of New York
will be expanding free Wi-Fi into
Central Park now you can get outside
enjoy the sunshine fire up your laptop
and surf the internet at gunpoint no
just kidding there were fewer than a
hundred crimes in Central Park in 2005
of course that was before they turned it
into an all you can steal laptop and PDA
buffet the three largest phone companies
in the u.s. say they absolutely did not
turn over any customer phone records to
the NSA in related news Skype is
offering free outgoing internet calls to
the US and Canada through the rest of
the year they can't tap the internet can
they speaking of skypes free phone calls
the company says the move is just a
promotional event but industry analysts
say they're doing it because of
competition from the big three I am
clients but I don't think that's really
why I mean it's true I forgot to call my
mom on Mother's Day but that doesn't
mean he had to go reorganize the
economics of the world
telecommunications industry cheese and
finally in other business news
the battle over tiered internet
proposals and net neutrality is really
heating up and it's gotten really
political and
there's a rally this week in favor of
protecting the Internet's open
democratic architecture and Mobe is one
of the scheduled speakers man Mobe
seriously nobody's gonna go for net
neutrality now I'm Molly wood and this
has been the buzz report thanks for
watching
