Brian song here and welcome to the Apple
buy for everything good and bad inside
the world of Apple Apple's latest
earnings were announced this week and
we'll get to that but let's start off
with you guessed it the latest iPhone
rumors Evan blast has been active on his
EV Leakes Twitter account and says the
next iPhones retail release will be
Friday September the 16th just a week
and a half earlier than last year's 6s
release you then followed that up with a
confirmation that pre-orders will take
place on Friday September the 9th now
typically an iPhone announcement happens
the same week as pre-orders and with
Monday September the 5th be Labor Day
we're looking at Tuesday September the
6th as the next Apple Keynote we're
still not expecting much of a
significant design change except for the
loss of a headphone jack and the removal
of antenna lines you can even take a
sneak peek from Vietnamese website tint
8 with what's believed to be the first
look at the Lightning 2 headphone jack
dongle and it looks exactly what we'd
expect it to look like but you all know
the 10th anniversary iPhone is really
the one to get everyone keeps on
referring to this year's iPhone as the
iPhone 7 but maybe not anymore website
at full page de reports that Apple has
already produced packaging with the
iPhone 6s a name on them but there's
been no photo evidence to support it yet
but really the iPhone 6s E or the iPhone
6c hmm oh wait the iPhone 6 e no no no
no the iPhone 6 say I see that's genius
if that's what they call it I'm buying
one for sure the iPhone
sex-ay alright Apple announced they sold
their one billionth iPhone this week one
billion nine years in that's just
straight-up impressive compare that to
McDonald's who open their first
restaurant in 1940 and sold their one
billionth burger 23 years later in 1963
thanks Wikipedia now Congrats to Apple
but it's not all that great after Apple
reported their earnings for the third
fiscal quarter or second calendar
quarter of 2016 it was better than
analysts expected but it still wasn't
that pretty overall revenue dropped to
fifteen percent to forty two point four
from forty-nine point six billion in
last year's quarter across the board
iPhones were dropped to forty point four
million compared to forty seven point
five Mac sales were down four point two
five million from four point eight and
iPad sales keep declining from nine
point nine five compared to ten point
nine last year but you know me I still
love my iPad pro now Tim Cook said he's
very optimistic about iPhone sales this
fall and part of that is just based on
the massive install base that continues
to grow and he's probably right but one
thing he can't deny the latest IDC
research data revealed samsung has
shipped nearly twice as many smartphones
as Apple this quarter was 77 million
units compared to Apple's 40.4 Samsung
was also the most popular smartphone in
the quarter with a twenty two point four
percent market share nearly doubling
Apple's eleven point eight percent
that's just a beat down now the latest
iPhone 10th anniversary rumor comes to
us from digit Times claiming Apple is
working on an iPhone with iris scanning
capabilities and could debut in 2018 say
what that's two years after Samsung is
expected to release the note 7 with iris
scanning tech next week
so basically apples giving us OLED
screens two plus years later and is
working on iris scanning two years later
as well
I know apples not always the first to
market but two years later with two
different signature tech features I am
sorry
that's a bad apple
that one really hurt now apples plans
for their electric car called project
Titan hasn't gone as smoothly as they
had hoped for and in a move to save the
fledgling project Cupertino has brought
former senior vice president of hardware
engineering Bob Mansfield out of
retirement to oversee the development of
the car according to The Wall Street
Journal Mansfield has remained with the
company as a special project advisor but
during his time at Apple and he was
responsible for leading the hardware
teams behind the MacBook Air the new
iMac and the iPad now a separate report
from the information reports the target
introduction for the Apple car has now
been moved out a year to 2021 alright
let's do an Apple bite giveaway my
friends from canoe have a lot of cool
products but check out their latest
product the air view now the air views
curved mount can attach to the neck of a
car seat it can rotate and supports most
phones and tablets even as large as the
iPad pro and you know I love that so
it's perfect for a road trip and can
even act as a stand on a table so I'm
giving three of these away to you all
and all you have to do is tell me what
was my pick up line from last week's
show simple enough and we'll announce
the winners next week all right that's
gonna do it for this show you can always
