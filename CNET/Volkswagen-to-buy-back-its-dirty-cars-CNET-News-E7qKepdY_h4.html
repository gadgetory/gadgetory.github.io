cars details of its diesel gate
settlement with us regulators have
finally been made public and it's
looking to be one for the history books
the German car manufacturer will have to
pay up to 10 billion dollars to the
owners of the half-million diesel cars
affected by the issue 2.7 billion for
environmental cleanup and 2 billion to
promote zero emission vehicles for years
Volkswagen had knowingly been selling
diesel cars with fuel emissions way
beyond the legal limits in the US by
installing software that basically
cheated the emissions testing the
company only came clean after it was hit
with accusations from the Environmental
Protection Agency back in September so
if you bought a VW or Audi diesel
between 2009 and 2016 you may be
eligible for a restitution payment of
five to ten thousand dollars and a new
car well sort of Volkswagen will buy
back the car for what it was worth
before the scandal-hit or repair it to
make it compliant with us laws and
extend the warranty buybacks and repairs
could begin as early as this fall if and
when the settlement is approved but VW
will still face a long road to recovery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
