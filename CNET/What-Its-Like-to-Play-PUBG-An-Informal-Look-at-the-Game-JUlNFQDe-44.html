and I'm going to show you what it's like
to play battlegrounds this is a game
where 100 people are para dropped onto
an island where they have to fight to
the death scavenging for weapons along
the way and it's also the freakiest most
stressful game I think I've ever played
right now we're loading into the arena
this is a kind of Lobby waiting area
where you can test that mighty weapon
this lobby area where you can test out a
few weapons while you're waiting for the
game begin looks like you've got about
30 seconds before things happen exciting
all these other people it's game that
causes you to constantly make decisions
about where you're going to go what
you're going to do what trade-offs
you're going to make whether to hide and
fight whether to run the first decision
Iveta makes we're doing
airplane will take you across section of
the Cylons you get to choose when to
bail out
go into a hot zone like the military
base which has lots of excellent weapons
you're probably going to be fighting a
lot of other people I like to go
somewhere a little bit more remote some
are a little bit off the beaten path
away from the airplane where I can get
some weapons to start with but also stay
out of the way of other folks they don't
immediately get mowed down let's give
that a try you guys decide how quickly
you want to land you go straight down
you'll land quicker than other folks
might be able to get weapons sooner if
you pitch the camera up you can land a
little bit further away you can also see
where other folks are landing and try to
avoid that looks like I'm coming right
up on somebody else if I go down here so
I'm going to get into a fight right away
death in this game comes very swiftly if
I make any wrong moves it's going to be
the end of me and it looks like I'm
Aneta folks to contend with right away
I'd say so they probably know I'm here
nothing I can do about that the best I
can do is to get into a building right
away find a weapon and hope they run
away instead of coming after me looks
like I will be first to this building
they're going to weigh in on that side I
get in quickly I might be able to find a
decent weapon some ammunition load it up
and get going it also close the door
here
hi here we go that's what I'm talking
about
I've got a decent weapon already I
should probably go after them take out
some my competition
I'm using as well just tap in that as
quickly as I can to pick this stuff up
okay let's see what I can see okay so
now that I'm in a building I'm gonna be
very careful anytime I move my footsteps
can be heard around here it's pretty
loud even outside they can probably hear
me a bit it might have the same thought
that might be coming in after me shit
here's somebody come on in ready for you
they might go to the windows Shea's
gonna go to Windows nope he's mine
moments like this pretty tense I shot
him but that means the other guy member
there were two guys earlier I think I've
really heard me - do I risk it I'm gonna
risk it here goes nothing still early in
the game if I die it's okay he didn't
have jack shit okay they loaded my other
weapon now that I know I took in one guy
this stills well loaded up I got lots of
him I'm lucky that all three of his
weapons he's the same 9-millimeter ammo
I'm pretty good shape okay go for heard
shots to the southeast okay
noise is so important in this game the
fact that folks are shooting causing a
distraction means that I can probably
afford to walk around here a little bit
more and loot a little bit more without
worrying about my footsteps getting
heard because they're going to focus on
the other guy who's shooting guess
different pistol and like I want a
different pistol if you want this five 5
six am about in case I find a rifle
later that's the standard round for NATO
assault rifles come in handy go bandages
just take a look outside don't see
anything so far pool there's a some kind
of bullet loops or something out there
how do I get there ah here we go the
door every time you open a door makes a
lot of noise to this buddies coming
they're right outside my building
so good impose I think I think they're
beneath me they'll come up soon now
who tends okay so now the airplanes
overhead making a lot of noise I can't
hear anybody else approach if they could
sneak up on me while I'm looting this
guy's items just wait a little bit wait
a little bit okay now I can hear anybody
sneaking up on me
the sight lines are good the only people
who could see me or to that window okay
you know police vest backpack helmet
this is good stuff and a rifle this is
what I need for ranged engagements even
had a compensator I can add to the edge
of the rifle to reduce the recoil bit
I've got 90 rounds for my rifle let me
take the better SMG and some
nine-millimeter ammo for it it's not
much at police that's pretty much used
up okay I'm in decent shape so I whip in
Auto just in case did I reload I didn't
reload okay let's see what the zone
looks like on my map get it away from
sight line of the window okay I'm inside
the white zone for now I'm safe but I
probably want to get closer to the
center I know the towns are going to be
hot zones school is usually very popular
but I could probably sneak out through
these buildings up to this hill and Asit
this is my next marker okay here goes
got the rifle out for range Oh some
shots in the distance
nobody on the hill at least I don't
think so hard to see them in the grass
here goes nothing if you hold down the
alt button you can look around behind
you sometimes watch your back
how I saw somebody shit okay swear every
Bush every blade of grass that was
closer definitely there we go up that
way south of me
somebody's shooting your rifle you can
tell shot sent a little bit different
sounds like I don't know you know what
kinda ammo that sounds like all I know
is I don't want to be anywhere near that
because I don't have any scopes on my
weapons there's no way I'm going to be
able to take care of anybody at range as
I crest the hill I'm going to prone in
case of somebody with a scope in those
buildings
this would be bad tend to get shot by
them everything just turned red on the
map oh crap I'm in a bombing zone I need
to get to cover fast
it's going to be all kinds of bombs
falling in this area real soon and I do
not want to be outside for that okay I'm
gonna put away my weapon so I can run
faster it's a risk there's somebody in
there I'm going to get mowed down but I
got to take it I gotta take it do not
want to be outside and get hit by a bomb
okay switch to the SMG it's good for
club tight corners inside check this out
okay
no nothing in here the doors open that's
always the question when the game starts
the doors are always start closed so the
doors open you know somebody's been
there maybe they took some items left
maybe you're still there waiting for you
you don't know
maybe they set a trap even if you see a
lot of items usually items on the inside
mean that you're okay but they could
have just left them there to bait you
both of the doors are closed though and
there's good items on the ground I see a
rifle over there it's pretty likely no
place you
it doesn't mean somebody's going to come
out and sneak up on me now red dot sight
flash hider is good stuff the flash
hider is NJ red dot slide on the rifle
so I can see a little bit further with
it I got a better idea where my shots of
land okay here goes one five five six
amo I'm 16 it's got a bit better range
than my 416 but I don't know if it's
worth it 416 you can get a bunch of
better attachments would rather 416 with
like a vertical foregrip and stuff like
that always want to look around all the
angles never know somebody's dating
can't get more camo shotgun Shogun on me
a gas can if I ever get a vehicle I'd be
nice and shotgun could take a shotgun
instead of the SMG
it's better for close-quarters
just terrible like with shotguns to keep
you guessing J okay so I can take around
its window without being seen too much
see if anybody's coming am i doing on
zone I'm fairly near the center I could
risk it I could leave try to find more
loot or I could stay here hope they come
to me it's a risk either way what is
that still get my head taken off if they
see me through this window looks like it
says somebody's head right there god I
hope not
one of the safest things I can do is go
prone next to the window they can't see
me out the window hold then hold the
spin around anybody comes to the
building I'll hear their footsteps they
can't tell them in here
really wish I had some more attachments
for the rifle scope or something
okay I waited out
okay so the blue zone is the Zap field
that damage is everybody outside of it
so there's always an incentive to get
into the circle the circle with noise
here sometimes it'll center somewhere
else on military base I've even seen it
overlap the two islands like this it's
an incentive to herd the players
together to get them to kill one another
it can get pretty small by the end of
the game okay the new zone is still here
I'm still in it I'm still relatively
near the center of it I don't really see
a reason to move yet did I hear somebody
you know I should risk I should get
least go to the red buildings if there's
any good loot there just as safe as this
one whoops
it's a vehicle oh boy
okay so the vehicle makes a lot of noise
gotta stay quiet he's in here with me he
doesn't know I'm here
I don't know where he is except that
he's in the building
shit plane is going to be here we'll be
able to hear it moving
crap
shitty leave you still here where the
heck is he he's so close to me boy
I don't dare move you'll hear my
footsteps come on come on you know you
want to come here you know you want to
okay
he got one shot off anybody's nearby can
hear me can't actually bandage he didn't
take off more than Sony for a percent of
my health so anybody else's just him he
had rifles on him okay let me take some
of that stuff angled for grip quick-draw
mag a vest more armor than mine first
aid kits excellent lots of ammo and he
had a bolt-action rifle okay you know he
didn't have a scope for the bolt-action
rifle but I'm still going to take it the
range could come in handy
okay I don't need the nine-millimeter
ammo anymore but I can put this
quick-draw mag and angled for grip on my
416 now I'm in good shape
and I've got so much ammo for it we'll
need to worry about ammo again this game
done pretty well okay backpack he's got
a little two backpack which can hold
more stuff in my little one that's good
okay let's let everything out looks like
we're in a bombing zone again
plenty plenty of I guess I'll switch the
red dot over here I need to snipe be
great exceptionally good if I had a
scope so we heard him running around he
probably went in the other building over
here did you go to the fire buildings
over this way I don't know I don't think
I heard him that close say still inside
the zone it's a bombing area right now I
really want to go outside maybe get hit
close the door
no his motorcycles there that's right it
came in on a motorcycle so I could take
that feel it up with my gas can
yeah kinda want to get in that red
building
I think I'm gonna do it make a run for
it
close that door so nobody knows I was
there okay
okay I hope nobody's in here already
let's clear through the windows let's
the other door opened
historian sides closed that's a good
sign
usually people remember to close outside
doors but they won't remember to close
inside doors the pan okay pan literally
covers your ass it's not why it exists a
little up in a bit it's nice that it can
do that so give a little damage checkin
up the stairs
no but a pistol somebody left a pistol
so and the internal doors are still
closed very unlikely they're in here
with me still have to stop them from
killing me before okay Vantage's
no scopes or anything okay oops your
vehicle sound got smaller
please going to come soon still in it
but might Center closer outside okay so
knowing what I know keep watching those
buildings from here makes a lot of sound
vehicle coming
or is it going
there is Christian the hell where's it
going with it
don't see him I can hear them at 165
degrees or so that we are it's going up
that way looks like it's not going to
stick around just as well still can't
use a bandage Hammond and it's like an
energy drink or something I could top-up
that last little bit of health but
failing that do you have the bolt-action
rifle just don't have a scope on it you
can change your zeroing distance so that
your sights line up with something
further away super important if you're
sniping unfortunately now the scope I
don't know how far away they are we have
any idea through even there that
distance really not worth it so I'm
going to close internal door wait did I
open didn't I open this door why is it
closed to somebody in here shit now I'm
just just forgot to check it click draw
a mag for a pistol or 5 5 6 a.m. I don't
really need sure why not oh shit
took vehicle real close at the dune
buggy
real close you stopped
oK we've got 24 people left alive
I really shouldn't be here by the
windows is the worst place to be this is
a pretty decent place to be
okay what's the circle closes connect
zone I'm not too proud to move I could
sneak up on that guy but no idea which
building is in now it's such a risk okay
we know there's a motorcycle under dune
buggy between the two buildings see the
news on going to center near s does okay
they're going to come to me still a big
section of town now and I have to run
across this field the zone centers here
next time I have to run across the field
that's going to be deaf
then again the vehicles are still here
get to the vehicles senders here I'm
going to run this way across the field
again there's no there's no good way out
of this another vehicle coming okay get
ready
the other guy's going to hear me if I
shoot whoever comes in here shit he's
the second door to forget about that
they stopped they definitely stop maybe
they went to the fire building it's my
building and mrs. other one I don't know
which one they went to shoot shoot shoot
shoot shoot shoot I heard something
definitely heard something
and okay put the gunshot so give it the
footsteps nearby 20 people left 20
people left you can do this
keep it calm I got a say in situations
like this gets so tense that I got to
pull my finger off the trigger for a
little bit off the mouse button because
I've accidentally pressed it just like
freaking out press the trigger button
everybody here is wearing me they know
where I am they come get me do not want
that to happen
I'm caring time IMO I don't need imagine
carrying 380 bullets they weigh a bit
you know sounds shrinking still
centering in my area what's going to
happen
I guess people in these other buildings
are camped at just like me they know
these are good places to wait in hiding
and lure people to their deaths
it's not the most exciting camping like
this but still pretty dang stressful ok
here more vehicles closing zones nearly
here let's see where it shrinks to I'm
still in the zone I'm one of one two
three four five six buildings in the
zone not counting a couple outhouses the
folks here are going to move on this
position you're totally going to come
from me any moment once I reveal my
position by shooting at them somebody
else is probably in the company of these
folks oh boy I've got a minute 38 to
move them whoever moves first such a
disadvantage I can't even walk split
steps I mean they'll hear that if
they're next to my building through this
close yeah it's not too realistic I
understand to have be able to hear
somebody in a building that's not right
next years but okay here more vehicles
turn around now
gotta stay still one minute let's focus
or can start moving here they come
far side back to this side
shit a totally list
it's running his ass away nothing ails
them in here
surprised the crap out of me I know is
there wasn't a queue to run across like
that I got to watch out there isn't some
of the camped up in the hill sniping me
please getting pretty close
chef's kind of move no longer in the
zone one minute till it moves I got to
be ready I wish it somebody's trying to
shoot me you see that they try to snipe
me from way the heck out there got to
get moving
that's somebody I can't tell that's
somebody can't tell sure wish I had a
scope I could get to the grass and crawl
I should probably do that
scrawling it's hard for people to see me
unless they're elevated both me on a
hill or something please moving you
might catch me before I get there
it does it's going to hurt a lot awful
lot probably won't make it oh shit
they thought me well made it to the top
ten that more or less is how you play
player unknowns battle grams there are
some variants on the fame could have
dropped into a hot zone right away that
will live out for better loot could have
stayed the edges of the map and found a
vehicle and drove it in the center could
have stayed on the fringes and try to
run away from the wall but that's how I
typically play thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
