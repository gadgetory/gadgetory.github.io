upgrade for 2013 we're talking a new
skyactiv engine that's more efficient a
new visual upgrade and a bunch of
interior upgrades that made it a much
better car
now the mazdaspeed3 the performance
version here is pretty much unchanged
for a 2013 model year with one exception
it's got a new tech package that pretty
much modernizes what's arguably the best
hot hatch that you could buy in America
- one Google with cnet.com let's take a
look at the 2013 month of speed 3 check
the tech now where the standard Mazda 3
is available as sedan the mazdaspeed3 is
only available as a hatchback now you
can tell it from a standard hatch by its
more agressive spoiler it's bigger 18
inch wheels with they're much more
aggressive brakes our models also
equipped with the adaptive front
lighting system it's a high-intensity
discharge lighting system that steers a
little bit when you turn your steering
wheel so you kind of see around turns
when you drive at night
alright from the driver's seat of the
new mazdaspeed3 we can see one really
big change right away and that's this
new touchscreen navigation system that's
powered by TomTom now we're the previous
mazdaspeed3 and mazda3 units new stuff
hide their navigation up in this little
tiny three and a half inch screen now
you've got a really big touchscreen that
gives you a lot of real estate for sort
of fooling around with hitting buttons
and also viewing the map
you've got am/fm with HD radio decoding
you've got your Sirius XM satellite
radio bluetooth for hands-free calling
and audio streaming now if you've got a
bluetooth paired smartphone Android or
iOS and it's running Pandora you can
actually reach up right here and hit one
button and actually have your phone
launched the Pandora app automatically
switch over into a accessory mode
that'll lock you out of your phone and
transfer all of those Pandora controls
right over here into the mazdaspeed3
dashboard you get all of your audio
information about what's playing
who's playing get all your stations
right here so you can browse through
those now let's get over to the nav
because it's interesting it's basically
what they've done is taken a TomTom
navigation unit boiled it down to just
its data put it on an SD card somewhere
in this dashboard and then giving you
the readout here so the interface is
exactly what you would see on a modern
TomTom navigation device you've got your
map here you could tap anywhere and
bring up the familiar TomTom menu where
you can search for destinations get
traffic and whatnot it's all here now we
expect that navigation system these two
displays up here on the eyebrow still
remain the same one of them pretty much
only displays your climate control
information and the other one is pretty
much relegated to just showing your
instantaneous fuel economy and range and
miles you've also got brand new in the
month of three a blind spot information
system you hit a button on the dashboard
and whenever something's in your blind
spot you get a little light in the wing
mirror there is no backup camera
standard on this vehicle and I don't
even know if you can get one as an
option probably needs one
lift the hood of the muffin feet three
and the first thing you'll be greeted
with is this top mount intercooler now
the purpose of this thing is to cool the
intake charge coming in from that hot
turbocharger and it's fed cool air by
this actual functional hood scoop on the
hood now underneath this you'll find the
2.3 liter turbocharged engine that's
gonna output 263 horsepower and 280
pound-feet of torque
now all of that's going to the front
wheels by way of a six-speed manual
transmission that's a lot of torque so
you want to want to make sure that steer
will point it nice and straight before
you drop the hammer or torque steer it's
gonna be a bit of a problem fuel economy
is rated at 1825 but let's be honest
I'll be lucky if I can get 10 pretty
good sound for what you know basically a
turbocharged four-cylinder it's really
easy to for these engines they end up
sounding like weed whackers or
lawnmowers or something like that this
is actually got a pretty good sound
because Mazda spent some time tuning the
exhaust powers good to you know complain
the first time I got an opportunity to
drive this car was a couple of years ago
and it was at night and in the rain and
280 pound-feet of torque at night in the
rain in the front-wheel drive car as you
can imagine is kind of scary
on dry roads it's actually not that bad
and that's helped partially by the fact
that Mazda engineers have limited the
total torque output in first and second
gear so that you get less torque steer I
know a lot of people are probably also
turning their nose up at the fact that
this is a front-wheel drive car but
before you go get your torches and
pitchforks and start talking about
front-wheel drive MADD rules right good
there are a lot of really good front
wheel drive cars out there this is
arguably one of the best ones that you
can buy the suspension tune is firm but
not punishing you definitely want to
avoid potholes and any sort of like
great drainage grates on the side of the
road though because it is a bit of a
rough ride but it's not punishing you
don't really have to dodge joint
in the roads and it's firm so that you
get a lot of good feedback through the
steering wheel and through the seat of
your pants
other than that at high wave speed you
don't really get a ton of road noise you
do have wider tires firmer suspension on
this vehicle you would have in your
standard last of three so there is a bit
of road noise but it's not so much that
you can't really hear the Bose audio
system that we've got on this vehicle
now that booth audio system sounds
pretty good but I had to double check
that it was actually premium audio
because it doesn't sound premium good
it's just alright expecting your twenty
thirteen miles of speed three couldn't
be easier it bases at twenty four
thousand two hundred bucks and there's
really only one option you want
that's the all-encompassing tech package
just gonna add the navigation the blind
spot monitoring the adaptive front
lighting all of that for two thousand
four hundred and eighty five dollars
adding a couple of small dealer
installed options and our destination
charge to reach our s tested price of
twenty seven thousand nine hundred and
fifty five bucks that's probably the
sweet spot for the Mother's Day three
you really can't get a better deal for a
high performance hot hatchback this side
of a Subaru WRX or a Mitsubishi rally
