that Google issues it's everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
let's get to it in the g men and women
are aiming directly at apple music with
the announcement that they'll be adding
a free tier to its google music play
service now it will be an ad-supported
radio option with stations curated by
people so it's basically their answer to
iTunes radio to be clear this does not
give you the ability to create your own
custom playlists and listen to them for
free you'll still need to pay the 999
monthly fee to do that now the
ad-supported radio is launching in the
US it's available right now on the web
and rolling out to android and iOS
devices soon now that's not the only
thing Google is up to this week the
Google X team likes to just surprised us
with one of their top secret projects
they've been working on over the past
couple years and this time it's a health
tracking wristband that can monitor
heart rate heart rhythm skin temperature
and environmental conditions like light
exposure and noise levels now sure
there's plenty of smartwatches out there
but Google's life sciences team hopes
for this device to be eventually
prescribed to patients or used in
clinical trials with the medical grade
information it can collect google says
it's still in a very experimental phase
alright sticking with wearables and
android continues to pump out new bells
and whistles for its users this time
it's 17 new watch faces from brands like
Rubik's Cube Angry Birds and my niece's
favorite but one that I would never care
about it all because it's you know it's
too cutesy hello kitty now these are all
available to download for free through
the google play store google also
recently announced a new effort to use
the resources and technologies for what
they're calling news lab it combines
things like YouTube videos maps data
Image Search and pulls from google
trends which has been revamped and the
new version was built specifically with
journalists in mind it's an effort to
really collaborate with journalists
using google tools data and programs we
all see how storytelling is constantly
innovating thanks to tech and this is
their way of being part of it at Google
i/o one of the big reveals was project
jump and the big G's commitment to bring
in virtual reality to the mainstream by
making it cheaper to produce content
in it on YouTube the company now has a
sign up if you're a creator who wants to
be a part of this movement it requires
you to fill out a long form and tell
them how you currently use media and I'm
just crossing my fingers that maybe they
let someone who produces video content
and allows them to get on board and try
this out also Android TV isn't dead yes
it's taken time to start rolling out new
TV sets but Sony just announced their
new 4k android TV based x 900 CCTVs with
55 and 65-inch configurations that start
at twenty-five hundred dollars and if
you've ever lost your cool or started
writing out something really emotional
that you wish you never sent and then
you wish you could take it back but now
it's too late when you told her and you
can't take it back and things won't be
the same well I haven't but gmail is
finally making the undo send feature
standard on gmail and it allows you to
cancel the sending of an email within a
specific number of seconds after it's
sent now if you don't see it just go to
the settings page within Gmail go to the
general tab and then enable undo send
and you can choose how many seconds you
have to cancel it as well thank you
google alright guys the gala that's
going to do it for this we show you can
always email us at google issues at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time for
some more of that Google issues Google
