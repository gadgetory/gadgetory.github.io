something that is really a look at
what's next
it recognizes you Firefly can recognize
art you're gonna connect smartphones and
tablets to everyday objects even things
that don't have any computing or
connectivity capabilities themselves
barcodes QR codes short links even URLs
themselves are all in some ways crutches
for computing devices that have cameras
yet don't know what they're looking at
enter image recognition we haven't just
recognized the episode we've recognized
the scene if you point the camera at a
package of soap well you can get a link
to buy that soap on Amazon place ernie
into a room and ernie comes to life tag
the dog's eyes and nose and then the
photos analyzed and uploaded if someone
finds your dog face recognition software
will match it to the picture on file it
responds to your gestures and it listens
to your voice now image recognition is
of course a close cousin of facial
recognition which most of us got very
familiar with right after 9/11 when
certain major sporting events began
using cameras to see who's coming in and
figure out their identities but image
recognition more broadly doesn't just
focus on faces it'll look at just about
any object released in the future
especially objects in the retail
environment and bring you information or
abilities to act on that product but
humans have been incredibly good at
doing image recognition and pattern
recognition for millennia so why are we
teaching dumb devices to do something
that we do supremely well well because
the gadget will bring some additional
technologies to the table that we don't
have first of all they have access to
more information than you could ever
stick in your head a larger database if
you will of possible matches for what
they're looking at more than you could
ever memorize or whatever want to next
up is discrimination a tool that
machines can use very well they can tell
- very similar things apart in a way
that humans often can't if you hear a
song on the radio and you want to tell
me about it so maybe I can identify it
for you what do you
hum a few bars that's not gonna help me
a lot but a machine can very readily
check its database of very similar
sounding songs and find the right one
then there's automation we've talked a
lot on this show about how we're
starting to use cameras on devices to
map the interior world airports stadiums
malls what-have-you to do that with
actual human eyes making notes into a
database that's too tedious impractical
to have devices do it in an automated
way is actually quite possible now how
do those attributes add up into
functions that you'll care about as a
user especially in the retail space
first of all is product information QR
codes shelf tags quickie little URLs any
of those things try to get us closer to
product information but they still stand
between us and that information if
you've got a device that can look
natively at the product and inform you
about it the way that our eyes want to
do you're getting much closer then there
are hard to search or fuzzy search items
try googling a shirt you saw someone
wear that you'd like to buy one of I'll
wait then there's identification and
personalization but this is of the user
it's kind of the reverse of looking at
the product it's now a device looking at
the user of the product or the service
to allow them to log in to personalize
or even to limit what they're able to
access now where image recognition
technology makes it into your hands will
be interesting the obvious and current
darling is in our Mobile's in phones and
tablets because they're always with us
they're typically always connected and
they have very good cameras of course
next up look for it propagating in smart
glasses those that have cameras of
course have most of the attributes of a
mobile device but they also have this
sort of innate gaze match they're
pointed where we're pointed they're very
sort of intuitive that way and finally
there will be a class of fixed image
recognition cameras many of these will
be doing the reverse piece identifying
the consumer who's regarding the product
that could be something like a Kinect
technology it could be brick streams
live device or it could be cameras
already mounted in stores for security
taking on a new role of also figuring
out who is doing what
now image recognition is still at a
nascent phase certainly for consumer use
we've got a lot more misses than hits in
my experience however it's got a huge
wide lane of
potential to make a lot of product
interactions a lot less friction film
and that gives it a pretty good chance
at being a next big thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
