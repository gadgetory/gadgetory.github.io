overhaul in iOS 10 and while it has a
lot of great new features you'll
probably need a guide to find them all
so let's get started with your basic
text if you type the magic word you'll
notice it automatically brings up the
emoji translation in the autocomplete
bar or pull up the translation once
you're done by selecting the emoji icon
and now let's add some punch to it press
and hold or 3d touch the arrow in your
chat window to pull up a list of effects
press it once to preview and press again
to send or toggle on the screen tab to
add an animated background to your chat
screen if that still doesn't get the
message across you can do the same thing
with photos as long as you load them in
your chat bubble before you send or if
your penmanship is on point turn your
phone on landscape mode and send a
handwritten note by clicking on the curl
on the lower right now click on the
arrow next to your message bubble for a
new set of options press on the photo
icon and you'll notice it's changed a
bit from the last version take a quick
snap without leaving the app slide right
to access recent photos or left to go to
your library remember that digital touch
option on the Apple watch that let you
send your heartbeat that's what this
icon does press on the hand icons on the
right for a full list of effects and
then send a tap kiss or heart beat to
your boo press a circle to change colors
or the camera icon to overlay on a photo
moving on to the apps icon here's where
you'll find all sorts of cool stickers
and gifts scroll down to see all the
options from that particular set or
swipe right to see another collection
one more time to access images and gifts
using the search bar to find the most
appropriate and then one more time to
share the song you're listening to and
we're just getting started click on the
four dots on the bottom to view your
full selection and download more from
the mini app store that's now baked into
messages in iOS 10 you can purchase more
sticker packs or download other familiar
apps like Square cash detects money to
friends and lastly the most practical
new feature is the embedded link you'll
now see a thumbnail preview anytime you
send or receive a link directly on your
chat window if it's a video you can even
play it without having to leave the app
and that doesn't even cover all of it so

the complete guide to iOS 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
