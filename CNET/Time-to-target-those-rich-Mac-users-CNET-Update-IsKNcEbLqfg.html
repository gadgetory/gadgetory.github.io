casts targeting rich mac users via their
facebook email addresses I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNN update as you
may already know Google's got this super
secret lair the X laboratory where
employees push the limits of Technology
the X labs produced the self-driving car
and those augmented reality google
glasses well these mad scientists just
may have activated Skynet that's right
google engineers strung 16,000 computer
processors together and set the network
free on the internet on its own the
system taught itself how to recognize
cats the scientists never told the
system what a cat was it just saw so
many YouTube videos it could tell which
ones were cat videos and yes that's how
it starts today it can hunt down cats
tomorrow mankind mac users tend to spend
more on things because well they buy max
so travel website orbits took advantage
of that little factoid and began
showcasing more expensive hotel room
choices to mac users than it was showing
to Windows users and orbitz admitted
this to the Wall Street Journal saying
it was just something they were testing
out since they saw mac users paying
about thirty dollars more night for
hotel rooms now if you sort your search
by price everyone sees the same thing
it's all fair and square it's just one
more factor that online marketers can
use now to target customers these days
Facebook has finally put a woman on its
board of directors and surprise surprise
it's Sheryl Sandberg Facebook's chief
operating officer and Zuckerberg
right-hand woman most people online have
been asking wait she wasn't on the board
already the announcement comes after
months of public criticism of Facebook's
all white male board and now that
Facebook is public there was pressure to
make a change Sandberg has long been a
vocal advocate of empowering women in
technology and in the workplace but
that's not the only news out of Facebook
the network quietly changed the email
address displayed on your profile to be
the Facebook email address and if you
haven't made a custom facebook username
your email is just a ridiculous string
of numbers at facebook.com/ now you can
change it by going to the About section
of your profile facebook made this
sneaky change so more people can you
their inbox messaging system and you
know help the company grow the makers of
the video game mass effect have released
a new extended ending after fans
complained about how the epic trilogy
ended you can download the new endings
on your console today but judging from
the comments folks are just still not
satisfied that is your tech news update
for today be sure to come back tomorrow
for coverage of Google's IO developers
conference we'll hear more about new
google products like a new 7-inch tablet
