editor at CENTCOM I'm here to pick today
you take a first look at the Samsung
array this is a new phone for Sprint
it's also out for boost for Sprint that
that prices will require to your
contracts well boost his contract free
now you're probably look at this phone
you're saying gosh this thing looks
really old it looks like I just dug it
out of a drawer for maybe 2005 and yeah
it does look a little old it's a very
tried-and-true design it's very familiar
but it's a slider phone it's a feature
device made for texting so really
there's not much you can do to really
mix that up that design up so I think
it's perfectly straightforward easy to
use maybe a little boring but certainly
it's very user friendly from the front
it's a candy bar design the display
takes almost about 2/3 of the front
space it is a pretty low resolution is
colorful it's bright but you can see
distinct lines between the different
color shades so don't expect a lot of
fancy graphics but you really wouldn't
anyway because this phone doesn't have a
lot of apps or any games you should not
use it for those things down below is
the navigation controls these are well
designed there's a square toggle with a
central ok button they are silver
they're little reflective so they stand
out from the black keypad below they're
also 2 soft keys there's a dedicated
speakerphone key a back key and the
talking and power buttons and down below
is the alpha numeric keypad
that's caught in black of course I found
this to be a little squash together also
doesn't like that they were the keypad
buttons were perfectly flat with the
surface of the phone the other controls
are raised which is nice so if you can
use them by feel and there's some
definition here on the top there's a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and on the
bottom there's the microUSB port which
is also used for the charger on the left
there's a volume rocker it's easy to
find when you're on a call over here you
have the micro SD card slot that fits
cards up to 32 gig and the camera
shutter now if you want to open the
phone just slide it up like this and you
can see that the screen rotates 90
degrees automatically there's no need to
change it or do anything like that phone
doesn't have an accelerometer so if you
tip it the screen isn't gonna change but
it's only when you open and close the
phone down below are two soft keys those
are you only used when the phone is open
and they correspond to the commands
right above I do like the keyboard is
pretty roomy it's pretty spacious the
keys are slightly slightly raised above
the surface of the phone which is nice
there are four rows of keys so that
means a letter share space with numbers
and punctuation and symbols
it's not a big deal personally I'd like
five rows of keys but if you're gonna go
for a compact phone you sort of need to
live with four there Christy can switch
back and forth between the different
functions of the key using either the
shift or the function key nice spacebar
in the middle it's pretty wide it's
quite where it should be and there's a
dedicated comm key which is nice there
are arrow buttons over here and there's
a dedicated atcase you don't have to go
in and use the shift when you're typing
out emails now this phone really is
built for communication the menu system
is pretty simple it's just it's the
icons in the front then is you get
internal menus that's all list based
does have a two megapixel camera you can
see here on the back photo quality isn't
very good video quality isn't good at
all so it's really not worth taking
photos unless you just need something on
the fly and then again don't count on
anything spectacular there is a
bare-bones music player
there's Bluetooth is a web browser so if
you're used to using a smartphone you're
not going to get those full HTML pages
or even the mobile pages these are going
to be web pages which means that they
are even some more stripped down so just
lines of text maybe the occasional photo
no graphics it's a little clunky to use
because you're moving the cursor around
with this with this navigation keys
there's no touchscreen so I really don't
think web browsing is worth it on the
phone it's also a 3G video so but even
on those simple pages they do take a few
seconds to download good thing though is
texting is very easy using that keyboard
call quality is good it is a phone that
excels at communication just what a
phone should do just don't count on it
for really anything else if you want to
keep in touch the Samsung array is not a
bad guy I'm Ken Sherman and this is the
Samsung array it's available for Sprint
and this mobile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
