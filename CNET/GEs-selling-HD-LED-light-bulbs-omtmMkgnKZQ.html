HD light LED light bulbs now that might
sound a bit confusing what does an HD
light bulb it's just their way of saying
these bulbs are gonna make the colors in
your home look better the relaxed LED
here has kind of a low candle light
color temperature that daylight tinted
bulb here's the Refresh LED that's more
designed to help you focus and stay
alert during the day and then here
you've got the reveal LED on the table
beside it that's more designed for the
bright whites I just mentioned and if
you take a look at this appetizing bowl
of M&amp;amp;Ms from our light bulb test you can
see that the colors do in fact pop a
little bit they look nice there
especially with this shot this is the
reveal led from the HD light lineup it's
a bulb that blocks out some of the
yellow light to make the whites look
especially clean and you can see the
white of that bowl looks very nice
exhibiting my problem with the reveal
bulb even though I think it's probably
the best bulb of the three is that it
isn't putting out enough brightness it's
only putting out about 554 lumens those
554 lumens aren't enough for it to call
itself a 60 watt replacement you really
want 800 lumens or more these bulbs do
it the reveal bulb doesn't but it still
calls itself a 60 watt replacement
they're in the box I call foul over that
I don't like that GE it's not gonna be a
hundred lumens don't call it a 60 watt
replacement my other problem with these
bulbs is that they didn't do very well
in my dimming test
none of them dimmed any lower than 10%
and all of them gave off a little bit of
flicker as I dim them up and down on all
of the switches that's not uncommon with
LEDs but they were a little worse than
average if I were picking out bulbs T's
in my home and I had dimmer switches
installed in my walls I probably go with
something else the relaxed LED here
sells eight dollars for a 2-pack nine
dollars for a 2-pack of the daylight
Refresh LEDs and ten dollars for a
2-pack of the reveal LED that's a very
good price for a dimmable bulb it has
uptick in color quality I just wish they
dimmed a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
