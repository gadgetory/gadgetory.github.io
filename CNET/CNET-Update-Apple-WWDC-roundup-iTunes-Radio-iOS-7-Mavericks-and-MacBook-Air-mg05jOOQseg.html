sounds I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update at the worldwide
developers conference Apple unveiled its
streaming music service called iTunes
radio there's also a new mobile
operating system design and updated
macbook air laptops but let's start with
iTunes radio this is very similar to
pandora and the fact that it's free with
advertisements there are hundreds of
stations already created but you can
make your own based on artists or songs
that you like an apple of course makes
it easy to buy the songs you've streamed
iTunes radio will be ad free if you pay
$25 a year for itunes match which is the
service that stores all the music you
own in the cloud this iTunes radio will
come with itunes on macs and pc on Apple
TV and yes the new and improved iOS 7
the new operating system for iPhones and
iPads will look completely different
when it's released this fall we haven't
seen a lot of changes in iOS design but
now graphics look very plain and simple
not so bubbly and no more background
textures that imitate real things like
wood or paper and there are gestures
that are just like webos and blackberry
on the left side of the screen you drag
your finger to reveal the last thing you
were doing to multitask faster and you
can scroll through app screens like
cards there's a new pull up menu from
the bottom called control center that
quickly changes settings music and other
options a feature called airdrop will
make it easier to share items with
others nearby and don't forget about
Siri now Siri can be a man if you want
and he or she can understand new
commands like increase brightness or
play my last voicemail apple also
updated the mac OS 10 with a version
called Mavericks you can have iOS mobile
notifications and messages appear on
your Mac and the calendar can integrate
with Apple maps so you can see how long
it will take to get to your next
appointment Safari on the Mac and iOS 7
also got a few upgrades there are new
MacBook Airs that use the new 4th
generation Intel chips that will give
the laptops forty percent faster
graphics and
battery life the 13-inch model starts at
eleven hundred dollars apple also teased
that it's working on a new mac pro
desktop with this new cylinder shape but
no word yet on price or availability and
at the same time Apple was sharing all
this news microsoft announced that the
xbox one will launch in november for
five hundred dollars in the US there's
also a new redesigned model of the xbox
360 available now and the next cnet
update i'll bring you more highlights
from the e3 videogame conference but in
the meantime you can find the latest at
cnet com from our studios in New York
