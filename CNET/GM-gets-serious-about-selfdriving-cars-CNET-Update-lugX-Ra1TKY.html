self-driving cars i'm dan graziano
fillion for Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the big automakers have
had some serious competition coming out
of Silicon Valley and it's not just the
googles and the Tesla's of the world
it's smaller companies like Cruz
automation a start-up that's been
developing self driving technology for
the past three years the company offers
an aftermarket kit that allows owners of
certain types of cars to add
self-driving features for use on the
highway it's similar to that of a Tesla
Model S and you know what they say if
you can't beat them well you might as
well buy them GM on friday announced it
has acquired cruise automation but it's
not interested in selling those
aftermarket kits rather GM is going to
use the startups technology to jump
starts own efforts to bring self-driving
features to upcoming vehicles in other
news Amazon's Alexa voice assistant has
learned yet another skill banking that's
right if you're an Amazon echo or fire
TV user you can now sync your capital
one account with the Alexa app you can
then have Alexa your account balance
tell you when your next credit card
payment is due and even authorized her
to go ahead and make a payment it's all
done through voice command now there is
an option to enable four-digit passcode
which Alexa will ask you any time you
try to access your account but if
someone was to overhear this passcode
well they too could access your account
so it's not exactly foolproof but then
again voice commands aren't perfect and
earlier this month a few unlucky NPR
listeners found that out firsthand the
NPR show listen up rent a segment on the
echo and accidentally activate devices
in the homes of a few listeners by
saying the trigger word Alexa one
listener said that his echo resetted
thermostat 270 degrees while another
simply explained that his device start
going crazy some voice assistants like
Apple Siri and Google now let you train
your device to only recognize your voice
amazon has previously said that it is
aware of the issue but we have yet to
see a fix so until then you may just
have to strategically place your echo
away from the TV and the radio
that's it for this tech news update for
everything else head over to cnet com
