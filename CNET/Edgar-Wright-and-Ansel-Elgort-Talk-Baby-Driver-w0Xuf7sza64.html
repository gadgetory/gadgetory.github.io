you're the best in the business
I made this music video in like 15 years
ago now 2002 I used the idea which was
like a getaway driver like timing out
the heists to music but then I was
really annoyed at myself that I had used
it on this music video because I thought
I know I've like squandered the idea but
it actually ended up being a help to
getting the movie made
Edgar finally said hey do you know any
songs really well by heart like every
guitar like every drum fill and every
lure when I was a kid one of my like my
godmother filled my iPod with thousands
and thousands of songs and one of my
favorite songs she put on there was easy
by the Commodores and I all of a sudden
remember that and remembered that of
course I know that song really well and
it still is my karaoke song actually
make the one and the only bats the
Barbra Streisand thing came about
because I was doing research on tinnitus
because answers character has tinnitus
and I read it said famous people with
tinnitus and one was Barbra Streisand
one of the characters in the in the film
a second's alice is talking about that
and says all you know who has tinnitus
Barbra Streisand and Jamie Foxx replies
as the character bats he goes do I look
like I know everything about Barbra
Streisand
now the irony is Jamie Foxx is friends
with Barbra Streisand do you think
she'll be okay with you saying that line
and then Jamie Foxx I kid you not said
that he goes Gina Barbara and I was like
I don't know hahaha
and then he just said Barbara's gangster
you basically you pulled it you pull the
e brake and you get your basically
you're getting your wheel lockup and
that's when you can side the car around
so usually you're at like 30 miles an
hour and or you can be going as fast you
want but you slow down a little bit to
30 by using the brake then you get real
rear wheel lockup and then it's just a
little input with the wheel if you yank
the wheel your car is going to spin out
absolutely out of control but the whole
point of it is it's a little bit of out
of control nough so that you can pull
push the car to 90 degrees by just a
little soft input and then a counter
steer and then you can steer out of it
how will help driving cars change car
chase movies would you do one I think
that'd be more boring I think it's gonna
be dope
I can't wait for self-driving cars I
can't wait to get an uber and not have
to deal with some human being I still
use the iPod I met so many from half of
the other day and I told them I still
use the iPod Classic he goes but you
have Apple music on your phone I said
yeah yes but you still use the iPod I
said yeah I just I just prefer the iPod
I did like just having like a hard drive
of like stuff I realized sort of like
streaming is sometimes very convenient
but when it's not convenient it's so
irritating yeah man are we ever gonna
see your script will you post it No why
not well why bother how many people here
would read it it was posted no time No
would you consider directing a Star Wars
movie um I guess so yeah I am
oh yeah I have something I have some
crazy by kartell you know I really can't
you see it Christmas
