to a contributor today I want to talk
about how to download and navigate your
twitter archive a few weeks ago Twitter
finally announced that we would have
access to our past tweets and that it
would take a few weeks to a few months
to roll out to all of its users well one
of my accounts has access to this map so
I wanted to take a moment to show you
how to download and navigate and what
all you can do with your twitter archive
once you have it in your possession
alright so what you'll need to do is log
into your Twitter account in the top
right corner click on the gear icon and
select settings scroll to the bottom
you'll see a new your twitter archive
section click on request your archive
and then you'll have to wait for an
email to show up once the email finally
does arrive you click on the go now
button it'll redirect you to Twitter's
website you'll log in click the download
button it downloads a zip file that you
could then unpackage and inside you'll
find these contents you can view the
readme.txt file to learn how to use it
in other ways but now double-click the
index.html file to continue once you do
that this is an offline twitter archive
all your tweets from tweet one to tweet
50,000 if you have that many you can
scroll through month by month you can
also jump through year in a month and
see how active you were at a certain
period of time or if you want to search
for specific tweet you can even do that
by scrolling to the top and typing in
the search box for a keyword so as you
just saw downloading and navigating your
twitter archive is actually really easy
you just have to have some patience to
get there and wait for it to be enabled
on your particular account if you log in
and scroll down to the bottom and you do
not see that your twitter archive
section i mean your account doesn't
currently have
available and you'll have to keep
checking back once again mr. Jason
