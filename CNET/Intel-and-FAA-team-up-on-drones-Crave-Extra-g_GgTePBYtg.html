semiconductors and micro processors
which are in millions of computers and
gadgets around the world but as many of
you may already know they also work
closely with cutting-edge fashion
designers cloud computing networks pod
computing and robotics one of Intel's
most recent ventures is in synchronized
UAV performances Intel was recently
granted a section 333 exemption from the
FAA in the United States to fly multiple
drones at once over Palm Springs
California this is the first time
permission for a UAV event like this has
been granted on US soil Intel released a
video on May 3rd of a beautifully
choreographed airshow being conducted by
100 UAVs equipped with bright LEDs they
are calling the drone 100 the publicity
stunt was a collaboration between Intel
ascending technologies who built the
drones and ARS electronica future lab
who have been producing synchronized UAV
shows for a few years now in Austria
last year Intel and ARS electronica
future lab broke the Guinness Book of
World Records for flying 100 drones
simultaneously the drone 100 team uses
custom software that is able to track
and control all 100 drones in the air
which they refer to as SPAC souls or
space pixels creating different shapes
and colors in the sky which make for a
pretty cool looking light show
intel says the software can possibly
support up to 1,000 drones
simultaneously Intel plans on using this
tech they refer to as a 3d masterpiece
of art and airborne technology over
large stadiums and events where there is
a large population
in related news this morning may the 4th
be with you FAA Administrator Michael
Huerta announced that Intel CEO Brian
krzanich will leave the drone advisory
council for the FAA
Roseanna CH said in a statement this
morning a positive regulatory
environment can be a great enabler for
drone innovation safety and industry
expansion
I am honored to assist decision-makers
in prioritizing and addressing issues
facing the integration of unmanned
aerial systems into national airspace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
