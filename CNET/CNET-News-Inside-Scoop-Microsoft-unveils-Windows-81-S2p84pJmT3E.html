Sumi das we are at bill 2013 this is the
developer conference for Microsoft
joining me is Josh Lowensohn senior
writer for Cena Josh thanks for being
with us my pleasure okay so we've just
emerged from the keynote on day one yes
almost two hours Steve Ballmer was there
that's notable um not a lot of news
though coming out of this keena really
this was the first sort of preview that
we've been able to get at windows 8.1
right yeah and you know if you're not
familiar with Windows 8.1 it's not a
complete rethink of window i stayed not
an overhaul by anyway and I mean that's
what the point one means it's basically
taking some of the feedback they got
from the first windows a release and
really kind of changing things around
one of those big changes is kind of
making the software more useful for
desktop users that means hooting people
right to the home screen and adding the
Start menu back hey so dark button they
got a lot of cheers when they announced
that they did and it's kind of weird
because when windows a first came out it
was this thing where they they changed
everything they changed the design they
change how you use all these features
and I think they thought it was the way
it was gonna be and I think they got
some feedback from developers are like
this is a little crazy at least from
users to to radical Club absolutely ok
so the start button is back any other
tweaks that you found notable uh you
know that they've really put being more
in the front seat yeah that was an
integral part of this keynote they were
kept on talking about Bing absolutely
and now it's kind of integrated so you
can search the web you can also search
your file all that stuff is really kind
of populated I also pulled SkyDrive and
people can now add more bing features to
their apps they said that they can do
that before but they've kind of made
some changes where you can pull things
like 3d maps
and wikipedia articles all sorts of
things from their search index the
demoed voice search they kind of have
this thing where where Apple thinks
about Syria's their own little voice
assistant they kind of pitched this
thing more where the utility was inside
the app so it didn't really matter what
you're in you could tweet things to be
more kind of conversational and useful
any parts of the keynote would surprise
you they gave me some really expensive
hardware so he did it they gave
developers an acer iconia tablet which
was you know got a lot of shares tablet
yeah people were not we're not expecting
it's very new device and then later on
it kind of brought back out a surface
pro and everyone's like okay whatever
service pro it's old news and they're
like everybody gets one he's totally
Oprah moment for a moment you get a
surface um is this something that
they've done in the past or they kind of
taking a page out of the Google's book
because they tend to give away a lot of
hardware their developer conferences I
would say two devices is definitely a
lot especially when you think of some of
the convergence possibly I mean both
these are really kind of tablets and
touch advices that work with keyboards
so it's kind of surprising they would
just kind of push both those things
instead of giving like a phone and maybe
a tablet or something that's what Google
tends to do but I think they really want
developers to like have as much windows
8 Action as they can to really tweak the
wraps so I think doubling down and
giving them two is kind of like
not-so-subtly I'm like get working on
apps right they want to see more ass
obviously App Store all right okay Josh
thanks so much I'm pleasure for inside
scoop I'm Sumi das thanks for watching
