we saw at CES 2019 let me tell you
something Mean Gene it was super hard
making this list only 5 and ranking them
super difficult let's get to it
at number 5 is the LG rollable OLED
television we saw this device last year
but the weirdest part is it's actually
going on sale later this year LG says
it's rolled up the device 50 thousand
times without breaking the price is
still unknown but I bet it's going to be
pricey at number four is the bread but
now this thing is designed for grocery
stores and retailers those places can
then use the machine to make lots and
lots of red it's fully automated and
handles all the mixing and baking oh did
I mention that when the bread is ready
that customers can purchase the bread
from the machine it could cost around
$100,000 over a five-year lease at
number three is the Mata smart diaper
sensor it's a Bluetooth device that you
attach to a diaper that can let you know
when your baby's gone number one or two
for real that's what it does when your
baby does have a movement you'll get a
notification it definitely seems like a
very strange idea most parents know
there's a certain smell involved for
some diaper stuff but if your kids in a
car seat or a stroller the Monnett
sensor could be of use at number two is
the Bell Nexus hybrid electric air taxi
all those words together put a big smile
on my face because that's crazy
this was just a concept for now so we
didn't get to see it fly the rotors tilt
when tilted down it'll be used to get
this thing off the ground once that
happens the fans will tilt for forward
flight Bell has built tilting rotors
before for the v-22 Osprey military
craft before we get to number one I want
to talk about my personal favorite thing
I saw at CES 2019 and that is Bob the
dishwasher
it's a tiny dishwasher that doesn't need
to be hooked up to a water supply you
actually can just dump in three litres
of water using the jug it seems perfect
for apartments and for small families
I'm a big fan of Bob the dishwasher
and the number one weirdest thing at CES
2019 has to be the Hyundai elevates
walking car concept it's meant as a
rescue vehicle in bad terrain the legs
have five points of articulation each
each wheel can move or be stopped
independently at first it looks a bit
creepy but the elevat-- is really
awesome handling awful road conditions
could become incredibly useful for fire
and rescue agencies all that being said
dang that's weird that does it for us
there were so many cool things strange
things awesome things at CES 2019
