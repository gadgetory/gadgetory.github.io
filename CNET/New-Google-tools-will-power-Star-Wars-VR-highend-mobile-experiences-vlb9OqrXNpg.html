call Sarah after the great French
painter with this tool you can take a
high-fidelity scene like a one from PC
game and run it in mobile VR in real
time how does this work as a developer
you define a volume within which you
want the user to move around and you
your scene it takes thousands of images
from different parts of this defined
volume and then it automatically
generates an entirely new 3d scene that
looks identical to the original but is
dramatically simplified what have you
take a scene so complex that can
possibly run in real time even on the
most powerful PC like something from a
movie one of the goals is to bring you
inside of Star Wars let's see what
they've been able to do with serum let's
roll the video
eylem xlab's mission is really to create
immersive premium story based
entertainment experiences and our goal
is for people to step inside the worlds
of our stories and in this case into the
world of Star Wars when there are events
locations characters something that has
to be fabricated they turn to visual
effects to create that imagery the depth
of the world that we would like you to
step into is as thoughtful and creative
and exacting as anything we might put in
our films this new technology from
Google is enabling us to do something
we've been trying to find for a while
we'd take high-quality cinematic renders
and we can turn them into something
that's real-time consumable when XF was
approached by Google they said that they
could take our ILM renders and make them
run in real-time on the beyond phone
turns out it's true you can have very
dense complied scenes with very
sophisticated shading that traditionally
can't run in real time on an engine when
I see people in our demo looking at the
moment going on their hands and knees
down to expect the curvature of every
Bend twist
I really think we're on to something
that potentially opens the door to you
know cinematic realism in VR so LM acts
lab brought this cinema quality world of
raw Guan on to our mobile VR headset I
mean this scene is around 50 million
triangles and three gigabytes of
textures normal each frame here takes an
hour to render offline on a
high-performance machine however after
processing with sera it now takes 13
milliseconds per frame on a mobile GPU</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
