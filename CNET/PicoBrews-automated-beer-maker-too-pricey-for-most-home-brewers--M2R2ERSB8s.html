today to do sort of AB hands-on first
look at the picot bruise I'm addict
automated home beer-making machine
this system will sell for about $2,000
when it hits retail it was 1800 if you
got in on a Kickstarter the idea behind
this is that it's supposed to make
anybody be able to get a recipe online
loaded on the cymatic and then automate
the home brew making process the system
is connected to the Internet and it will
go up to your profile on the Pico brew
website where you've assigned recipes
that you want to make there's a whole
library of recipes on Pico brew you can
also make your own and the Machine will
automate the whole process as far as
heating up the grain boiling through the
hops and then once you're the chill
process it's pretty much the same as
when you make beer at home you set the
beer side that let it ferment for two
weeks or so then you can kick or bottle
it however you prefer so today we're
making a Chipotle Porter at least that's
what we're hoping to do so we have six
different kinds of grains mixed up in
this pot right here we're gonna take
those grains and dump them here in the
main chamber and we're gonna add the
hops so to start with that we're gonna
measure it out real quick put one set in
one chamber another set in the other
chamber and then load those in in the
back of the hopper now we're all set
with our ingredients we're gonna load
the whole hopper into the cymatic I
already have water in the keg it'll go
over to the menu I'll select the recipe
for my profile
hit brew and we'll see you in a couple
weeks to see how this turns out now we
have some other plans for how we're
gonna test out the system we have one of
the local Brewers here in Louisville
Kentucky from against the grain they're
gonna help us test this thing out for
myself I have basically no experienced
homebrew so I'm coming at this from as a
total rook II and hopefully at the end
of all this we'll have a pretty good
idea of how well does I'm addict can
meet the needs of any different level of
home brewers
all right so we're here with the very
first beer from the Pico brews I'm
addict it is ready to tap it's been
carbonating here for about the last week
so I'm gonna show off the co2 disconnect
this hose got my tap hose here see how
it goes that's gonna be pretty foaming
so again this is the picot Pale Ale this
is a very first beer I made with the
cymatic definitely some user error
involved along the way but overall it
seems like a relatively respectable Pale
Ale
so last week we tried out our pale ale
this week we've made a new beer this is
a Chipotle Porter just about to take
this one off the gas as well so we're
this one who wanted to be kind of bitter
yet happy the idea for this one is
because it's a darker beer we wanted to
be a little bit of a richer flavor and
that's sort of the test for the Pico
brew with this one all right here we go
good beer definitely like this better
than that one very full flavor all right
so we've got one more beer to go and
after that we'll have a full review
all right so this is the last test for
our picot bruise I'm at upper view or
here at the against the grain brewery
here in Louisville we've got a bottle of
their Citra ass down beer right here
they also have it on tap and here's the
growler to the stuff we made back in our
lab Adam Watson the brewer here did make
this stuff onto
ondas I'm addict so the whole idea is
just to kind of see how well each of
these translates and we're gonna do a
blind taste test we've got four
panelists and four drinkers behind us
so I'm gonna set this up and we'll see
what they think
alright coming at you get everybody put
on blindfolds wait everybody tastes one
beer at the same time and they were able
to tell with 100% accuracy what beer
came from what brewing process all right
which number was the stuff we brought
this is a keg stuff we made of the Pico
brew very different very different the
big flavor difference is very very
strong diacetyl presence which to be
fair to the system is largely a product
of fermentation rather than the actual
work production process Adam uses a term
buttery and that's a thing that would
apply to this one yeah and I guess we're
being accurate the the Pico brew thing
isn't a beer making machine it's a work
making machine then once you have word
the yeast make beer so there's only some
things we like about the Pico brews I'm
addict quite a bit the fact that it
gives you a running long at the
temperature throughout your brew process
gives you some good data in fact that
you can share recipes and kind of like
store your recipe online download it to
the system all that is pretty useful and
it does kind of simplify the process of
dumping in grain putting in hops getting
it in the right time and temperature
overall though it is certainly not an
automatic beer machine something at the
fermentation process right you still
have to cool your wort coming out of the
brewer so there's certainly a lot of
hands-on involved here still whether
that makes the $2,000 I'm addict worth
it if it's not gonna quite automate the
whole process for you that's sort of
between you and your passion for making
beer in your wallet but overall this
thing pretty much does what it says it's
gonna do there's still a lot left for
you to do though if you want to make
beer with this thing at home so I'm rich
Brown we're here at the against the
grain production facility here in
Louisville Kentucky like to thank the
guys here at against the grain for
helping us out with all this this has
been our review of the picot brews I'm
addict beer making machine
