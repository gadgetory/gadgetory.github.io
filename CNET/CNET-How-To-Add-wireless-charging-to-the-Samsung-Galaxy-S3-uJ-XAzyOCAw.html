the market but it's still not on some of
the most popular phones like the Samsung
Galaxy s3 but with a little bit of
hacking I was able to take the parts
from the old retired palm pixi wireless
charging kit and make it work with the
Samsung Galaxy s3 what's great about the
palm pixi case is that when attached to
the phone all you have to do is place it
on the touchstone and it'll start
charging the phone so what we're going
to do is take those wireless charging
parts out of this case put them in the
s3 so when we're done you'll be able to
put this phone on the touchstone and the
phone will charge here's what you'll
need to get started you'll need the palm
touchstone charger the palm pixi
wireless charging case some copper tape
scotch tape sticky notes and some sort
of flat tool to pry off the parts from
the case so the first thing we have to
do is remove the parts from this pixi
case and to do that we'll remove the
black lining you should be able to do
that with your finger all right set that
aside you might want it later and as you
can see all of those wireless charging
components are exposed before you remove
anything though grab a small piece of
paper and plot where the components are
to make a little template including the
little metal disks you'll refer to it
again in a bit grab a small knife and
carefully remove the circuit board
then the silver adhesive and finally the
copper coil these are the parts that
allow your phone's battery to receive a
wireless charge finally remove the metal
disks it might take a little extra
muscle for this part at this point I've
torn apart the palm pixi case which is
now even more useless than it already
was and now my task is to take these
components and put them in the backplate
of my samsung galaxy s3 so let's do it
grab the coil and place it upside down
onto the inside of the back plate so
that the black part of the circuit board
is facing down make sure the whole thing
is positioned about 1/2 inch from the
bottom edge of the cover now bend the
l-shaped circuit board up this puts it
in a position that allows it to make
contact with your phone's battery
replace the metallic adhesive over the
coil using tape if it doesn't adhere
anymore
then using the template you made in the
first step place the metal disk so that
they're positioned around that coil
these will keep your phone attached to
the touchstone once everything is
positioned tape it down with some scotch
tape the final step is to bridge these
parts in your back plate with your
phone's battery that's where the copper
tape comes in you'll need four strips
for this last step on this circuit board
you'll see two power terminals take one
piece of tape and fold over one end then
take that end and place it directly over
one of the power terminals hold it in
place and stick the tape down so that it
reaches the end of the back plate go
ahead and rip off any excess tape if you
need to then repeat the same process for
the second terminal now on your phone
take another piece of tape fold over one
end and place it over the battery
terminal using a pen to shove it in to
make sure there's good contact with the
terminal then go ahead and stick it down
onto the back of your phone
go ahead and repeat the same process for
the second terminal alright we've done
all of the heavy lifting and now's the
moment to see if this thing actually
works so to do that I'm going to place
the backplate on the touchstone and I'll
grab this digital multimeter and place
it on the power terminals here and what
I should get is at least a 5.5 reading
and we know it works because I'm getting
5.6 so now we verified that this setup
is sound let's put this together and see
that the whole contraption works if you
want to at this point you can put this
black lining back on your backplate or
use some sort of other cover to clean
this look up but I'm going to leave it
the way it is so I'll assemble these two
and actually the wireless charging parts
are so thin that your backplate should
be able to close as usual
alright now is the moment of truth let's
see if this works and it does because
I'm getting an actual notification
letting me know that wireless charging
is enabled because that software is
actually built into the phone even
though Samsung never released a solution
of its own but now your DIY wireless
charging hack is working and even though
it won't charge as fast as if you were
plugged into the wall what you lose in
speed you do gain in convenience and
awesomeness if you have any questions
along the way hit me up on Twitter and
check out my blog with the step-by-step
instructions and photos on how to
complete this project and thank you to
the XDA Developers forums for this hack
