punch in what you want a tableside
touchscreen it'll even tell you how long
you'll be waiting for that drink or dish
and when it arrives it's also cool food
is sent to your table using a rail
system still real cooks in the kitchen
hopefully not too many as well to shoot
time for the beta and today one of my
favorite sites has added a great new
feature fair cast made a name for itself
by letting you know how likely an
airfare price would go up or down now
they're applying that same logic to
hotel rooms that means you can finally
get a room and sleep easy knowing you're
not getting ripped off a color-coded key
tells you if a price is not a deal
average ordeal Deal or No Deal
interesting fair cast uses historical
pricing data to figure this stuff out
it's the end of the road for the time of
day according to the LA Times AT&amp;amp;T
disconnecting the information service
our elders relied on to keep them on
schedule good morning at the tone
pacific daylight time will be 92 and 30
seconds before cell phones computers and
other things that kept time there was
the dear old automated voice dial a
number wait for the tone and you could
set your watch so precisely now with too
many other ways to figure out the
current time the automated service
getting the axe in September and for old
times sake if you want to hear it one
last time here's the number to dial
finally my new excuse to get a ps3 sing
star a mix of American Idol and karaoke

installment hits stores in November with
a few upgrades there's a variety of
music tracks and videos featuring
today's hottest artists like the killers

Grammy worthy performances through a new
eye toy camera it's sort of like guitar
