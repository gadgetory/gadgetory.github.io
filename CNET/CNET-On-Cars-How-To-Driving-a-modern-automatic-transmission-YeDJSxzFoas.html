industry a selector lever and dial
replaced the standard gearshift control
and here is just how simple driving can
be with the marvelous new Mirko Matic
Drive now used to be the driving an
automatic was pretty brain-dead simple
pull it out of park roll past reverse
and neutral and stick it and drive and
then push the pedal on the right when
you desire a burst of speed for passing
you just press the accelerator to the
floor but the high-tech automatics today
have a lot more nuance than that the
shifters you find on the actual lever or
on the paddles are not literally
connecting you with the gears but they
are connecting you with the software
that runs the transmission you can get
in there and just about call all the
shots as if it was a manual except the
actual guts of the transmission remains
different than a manual now we're in a
Mazda 3 which is pretty classic is
today's high-tech automatics go
you've got your drive mode over here
manual position shifted there nothing
too uncommon about that and you've got
paddles on the wheel you can invoke a
shift with these paddles wall in drives
and it's a temporary shift so let's say
I want a downshift now down to third or
second gear the RPMs go up and then
after about five six seconds it goes
back into drive mode and drops down the
RPM shifting up a gear if I move the
lever here I can also put it into a
manual or a sport mode now my shifts
done either with the paddles or through
this lever are sticky the car will hold
the shift that I select all the way to
red line and all the way down to engine
lugs
let's say I want to pull a lot of down
shifts here I could run this thing way
up there I am first gear 5000 rpm it'll
hold that right to redline
it's totally in my control and same
thing can be done over here it's the
lever it just replicates what the
paddles are able to do now in this car
as you can see I've got a paddle over
here on the right for up shift there's
another one over here on the left that's
for downshift not every car does it that
way some cars like Porsches for example
come to mind they are bilateral there is
a shifter on each side of the wheel that
will do up or down shift depending which
way you push it this is a little more
common though
so what's the best way to use this
technology well several ways first well
get an immediate burst of better
acceleration when the car is geared for
at the time snap it down a couple gears
momentarily for five or six seconds
it'll hold and then let the car go back
in the drive for best fuel economy
another way you're going up for a nice
drive on a nice country windy road snap
it over into manual or sport mode and
choose your position either lever or
paddles to get fully engaged in the
drivetrain that's one of the nice
benefits here here's another one you've
got really challenging conditions gravel
mud snow and for whatever reason you
think the car is not handling it well
sometimes it's really nice to have a
more granular gear typically a lower
gear to modulate your power on uneven
surfaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
