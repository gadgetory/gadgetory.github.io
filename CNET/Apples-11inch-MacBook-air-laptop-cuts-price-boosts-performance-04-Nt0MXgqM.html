better and a little bit less expensive
time Dan Akron and this is the 2014
edition of Apple's 11 inch MacBook Air
now of course this looks and feels a lot
like the last several generations of
MacBook Air and frankly not a lot has
changed since the last time we reviewed
this in the summer of 2013 now in April
of this year 2014 when Apple did was
they said we're gonna take the Core i5
CPU in this 11 inch base model and we're
gonna kick it up one tiny notch to the
next level up and more importantly we're
gonna take the price the base price from
$9.99 down to $8.99 that's actually a
pretty big cut when you consider this is
a very popular laptop that still is
sitting that thousand dollar mark where
most 11 inch laptops are less expensive
than that so you get performance that's
pretty darn close to what you get in the
larger 13 inch version of the MacBook
Air and this new version with a slightly
slightly slightly faster CPU was
slightly faster in all our tests we also
got some additional battery life out of
him compared to the 2013 version and
that could because you know more recent
Intel Core i5 chips could have some
small tweaks make them a little bit more
efficient and the more recent versions
of OS 10 Apple's operating system could
have some tweaks that also make it a
little bit more efficient either way if
you have last year's model you're not
even gonna notice any difference with
this one but if you've been holding off
on the fact that it's a tiny tiny tiny
bit better and $100 less certainly makes
it easier to move into a macbook I'm Dan
Akron and that is the 2014 version of
Apple's 11 inch MacBook Air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
