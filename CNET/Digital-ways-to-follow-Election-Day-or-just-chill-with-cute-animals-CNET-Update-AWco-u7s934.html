outlets don't report on numbers so early
because you only get a good picture of

believe that if you report on how one
candidate is doing well early in the
morning it could discourage people from
going out later and skew the outcome but
hey if you want to go on a roller
coaster ride of raw numbers and see the
game as it unfolds that's now you're
