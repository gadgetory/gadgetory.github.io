the 404 on Sina to be I am Jeff Bakalar
and this is the show where we're going
one on one with James Gunn writer
director producer extraordinaire James
Gunn in the studio without an applause
for teams thank you thank you for the
applause very kind of you know we try
and bring it to you thanks for being
what kind of name is Bakalar it's an
American what kind of name is good
guns American is Irish it is American
because there was McGill gun oh you're a
strange thing about my name and this is
absolutely true you know what my name
means my my people on Twitter always
writing me saying my last name is gun -
are you Scottish I'm not almost all guns
are Scottish I'm Irish my family's name
was McGill gun and that name means sons
to the servant to the god of the dead
that's what my name means so my name is
the luckiest guy is god of the dead
that's pretty rad yeah and so it was
sort of you know I you know I know it
works for me my brother's last name is
gun - it might like my brother rides a
journey to the center of the years - I
don't see where it fits in with my
career it's worked pretty well I think
so it's a perfect fit but I don't know
what kind of last name Bakalar is I mean
I think it's like Turkish I know a girl
named back Lord yeah I do yeah yeah how
do you spell it
bak ala okay yeah yeah it's someone - mm
not all right with it but it's it's okay
I'm totally in Chile it's a beer in the
in the Czech Republic it's a beer yeah
yeah I didn't I have no idea no relation
whatsoever I don't know but I'm psyched
we got to talk about our last day that's
amazing I had no idea god of the Dead
god of the day it works out yeah I know
we found out when we were in Ireland
with my family and my mother was
horrified she was horrified she screamed
in shock and she didn't scream but she
was she was like she tried shooing into
sort of denial she does this thing that
my mother does where she just sort of
goes into like this sort of shock my
mom's my stuff she's my stuff learned a
lot already tell you more I play
everything you wanted every time I go on
the radio it ends up being like that
it's a therapy session yeah well
seriously we really appreciate you
coming out here
where we have a lot to talk about we're
very excited because your first foray
into the world of gaming yes
professionally at least yes is with the
new game from grasshopper manufacturer
lollipop chainsaw right rich is a very
big deal there's a huge cult following
behind these types of games from that
developer from guys like suda51
now you are getting the chance to work
with these guys how did this happen how
did you get involved in about two years
ago Sudha Sudha fifty ones great you
know game developer he did games like No
More Heroes and he's uh he's just a cult
game guy and he came to me along with
Warner Brothers who's putting out this
game and they said hey you know we have
this idea for a game we want to see if
you're interested I don't even know what
they meant or what they wanted me to do
sign this non-disclosure agreement all
this stuff and when didn't saw this
little bit of footage of this like you
know sexy high school cheerleader
chopping up zombies with a chainsaw and
having them explode into like these gory
glittery rainbow hearts which was
fantastic I flipped it I mean I truly
flipped for the footage and I thought it
was so aesthetically interesting right
you know I mean we you know we get
compared to other you know stories and
games and everything since since this
game has been announced as the trailers
of coming out but aesthetically to me
there's never been anything like it
and I was fascinating but I said I'd
listen what do you want me to do I'll do
whatever you want me to do and they said
we want you to help us to write the
story we've got part of the idea down
but we need it to you know be further
crafted and we want you to you know come
up with the characters and write the
characters and so I did that and I just
became involved and like I do with most
things I become involved with I I'm
crazy I go all the way so I was
basically hired to write the cutscenes
and oversee writers to write the rest of
the dialogue and stuff like that but
instead I just did everything myself
because I became attached to the
characters I really loved them and I
just wrote the whole thing and then I
went and I hired all the actors to play
the different characters in the game and
I directed them and the voice-over
sessions it was my first experience
doing that and it was it was great it
was a great experience so I'm happy that
sounds amazing so so you
you're obviously very well-versed in the
world of film and writing for film and
directing for film how does that
translate over because I would imagine
there's a lot of similarities but at the
same time it's probably sort of a
different day well it's all experience
just I mean just technically it's a very
different thing write a screenplay it's
you know 90 to 120 page thin little
screenplay you have to keep everything
contained everything is about making
sure every single scene leads to the
next day and it's all very constricted
writing a video game you write on Excel
sheets or at least we did with this game
and if the script is like you know this
sure so it's like this big huge just
thousands and thousands of lines of
dialogue and you know you'll have a
scene in which a girl is you know say
you know the Juliet Starling our hero
will stave a girl from a zombie or she
won't and so we'll have to write 30
lines of dialogues if she stays the girl
in 30 lines of dialogue if she doesn't
save the girls either running away or
she's complaining that she's dying so
it's like nothing gets left on the
cutting-room nothing is left on I mean
and I found that to be a remarkably like
freeing creative experience because you
do you know when you're in this industry
for a long time and especially you have
the spotlight on you you you get at
times sort of you know wound up and you
see you maybe overthink things a little
you um perfectionist and especially with
a movie when you make a movie once every
two years or every three years even it's
it's it becomes such a big deal but with
this it was just like I just had to
write and write and write and I'd sit
there and write for 12 hours and just
turn it all in that's the game you do I
mean because you have to write so much
yeah and and a lot of it is just it's
such throwaway stuff I mean a guy will
play the get the game ten times and
maybe not get some of the funniest jokes
so I think that's one of the cool things
about it yeah what do you think about
that I mean I you know I've always sort
of thought about oh you know oh man I've
sort of you know followed this certain
flow chart in the game and I've seen
pretty much everything there's to see
but you know I'm not gonna see maybe you
know if I got killed here or something
like that yeah
does that do you sort of favor one way
or well well with lollipop chainsaw it's
not like Mass Effect right
it's not a RPG sure it's a it's a
basically a linear fighting game right
but within that linear fighting game so
like the cutscenes are basically if you
can get to the next level your
experience is gonna be the same as
everybody else's and by the cutscenes I
mean you know that I don't know how to
play game sure the next action - yeah
yeah yeah the little mini movies right
in between the playing give you a break
for your thumbs of course yeah and so
but within the actual gameplay there's a
lot of different little things you can
do and that does change from experience
experience from game to game and I think
it's cool that everybody has their own
experience and and also it's cool
because if you replay the game a lot
you're gonna find new stuff in there
that you didn't find the first time
sweet all right let's uh let's take a
look at lollipop change so we have a
trailer that sort of features all of the
bosses in the game right and doing the
score for the the bosses is Jimmy from
Mindless Self Indulgence right yeah
Jimmy ern who's one of my best friends
in the world he's my buddy and I have a
weird story about that if I can we can
tell us yeah
Josie the master of funk the queen of
psychedelia into the world
the buses of zombie rock
they'll make your ears bleed
listen lady why don't you try using some
deodorant because honestly alright okay
that's pretty awesome the first time
I've ever seen that trailer which I
didn't know came out my musics great
yeah it's yeah that's that musics all by
Jimmy Aaron Jimmy Aaron's the lead
singer of MSI is one of my best buddies
we hang out all the time and a weird
thing about that is so we came in and
and we did the game and and Zed the punk
rock guy at the beginning he's played by
by Jimmy he's like the punk rock zombie
sure and we had a the game was being
developed and being designed and we were
designing this this punk rock zombie and
I was writing all the dialogue for him
and Scott wore the guy who sort of runs
things over at Warner Brothers one of
the guys or he ran this game yeah I'm at
the ademma couple great guys yeah okay
so I'm writing to him and I'm in Peter
Weiss the head of Warner Brothers and
I'm writing all these ideas for
different actors that could play the
different role sure different roles and
for for Zed I said hey this is a weird
idea he's not an actor but he's a really
close friend of mine he's a rock star
and I think he'd be great for the role
his name is Jimmy urine he plays an MSI
and Scott sort of freaked out because
he's like oh my god I'm a huge MSI fan
but he said even weirder than this when
they were designing the initial design
for Zed
Suda came back with this punk-rock
zombie design and scott said to them it
looks it doesn't quite look like an
American punk rocker enough okay and
then he sent a bunch of design of old
photos of Jimmy over - Sudha her who
then redesigned the character around
Jimmy urine Assam so the character is
based on Jimmy in part and then he ends
up playing the role because he's my
friend but no other reason so it's one
of those strange synchronicity
situations where we were meant to work
together stars lined up at all like that
that's that's so cool I didn't even I I
knew the the sort of intimate detail
that it was you know was all coming
together with but I didn't know it was
based off of Jimmy yeah no I mean it's
amazing that's really and so it's like
the other guys you saw in there Vicki
the Viking isn't laid by my buddy
Michael Rooker known for Henry portrait
of a serial killer and cliffhanger and
Days of Thunder and and my movies
slither and and
super and the the girl the hippie zombie
is played by Shawnee Smith who's now on
anger management Charlie Sheen and was
in all the Saw movies and did she did
the show scream queens with me on vh1
right on and then yeah we got a bunch of
people in there Linda Cardellini from ER
and scooby-doo Michael Rosenbaum from
Smallville hmm is another one of my best
buddies and he plays he plays the
disembodied head the voice of the
boyfriend the boyfriend and he's a star
I mean he and he you know he and Juliet
they're in the entire game together and
he's Michael's on Tara Strong plays
Juliet she's the two of them together
are amazing they're like an Abbott and
Costello that want to have sex but can't
because one of them doesn't have a penis
and that's what's so cool about they
they are these games that come out of a
grasshopper they're they're sort of off
the beaten path I think you know in our
culture maybe they don't get enough sort
of attention yeah I thought that
happened with Shadows of the Damned in
in lollipop chainsaw what do you sort of
see you know something here that's maybe
more accessible I know obviously the the
cast and crew it's it's a it's a casting
crew that maybe our culture is more
familiar with how does that play into
the whole sort of package well I think
that's one of the reasons why I came
along was to try to I don't want to say
westernized things but but there it but
but keep what is essential about the
grasshopper games about Sudha's games
while adding another element to that not
subtracting from anything but adding a
more you know a merit or Western sense
of sugar and and also trying to make the
story a bit more of a three-act story
than because Japanese people tell these
stories that are very poetic and maybe
one of the problems is I love Japanese
like cinema I love Asian cinema and it
is it has a very different way of moving
from scene to scene it they have a
different way of storytelling especially
Japanese people right now yeah and and
so it was trying to take that stuff and
maybe make it a little you know bring
that into our hemisphere a little bit
more
sure and so so maybe I helped it that I
think I think I helped what I do think
the game is really funny I don't think
there's any game that's ever been as
funny as right because it is funny from
start to finish and that's a tough thing
to do especially in games yeah but for
whatever reason I don't know if it's
just the aesthetic of the medium
whatever it is comedy does just one of
those things it's just tough to come
across yeah and from what I've seen in
in lollipop it works yeah I think
sometimes you know people need to learn
that it's a game you know so if you're
trying to be funny by like having a
bunch of stuff in there that isn't part
of the gameplay then gamers aren't gonna
like it to it he's just
first and foremost the games got to work
as a game and that Sue's job I mean the
machinery of the game has to work that
has to be fun that has to be great but
if while you're doing that there's just
all these little funny and entertaining
bits then that's awesome but if it's
stuff that takes away from the gameplay
which is what in the past a lot of games
that have tried to be funny do sure then
that's a mistake because that actually
that makes the game not as good right
you might as well write a movie then
gamers can see through that they get up
right away and they just you know they
they toss it out I got a chance to sit
down a little with suda51 and we talked
a little about the the divide in culture
and what's popular in in Japan yeah
popular here for whatever reason
shooters are just not really clicking
there they're not as successful as they
are here yeah or more of a gun culture
anyway I mean we love guns in the United
States we do we love shooting even when
we're anti-gun we still love guns we
still you know you can go you know a you
know you know boycott the NRA all day
long and then you're gonna go home and
play doom or you know halo and and be
shooting people all night long so it's
just if we love guns ribs bread into us
yeah it's you know and and I sort of was
looking to him for sort of an answer for
that I don't know why I thought he was
the go-to guy I'd be like why is this
happening why are we so effed up listen
I mean I love sudha you know he's a
great guy but as soon as ethereal man
that dudes Andy Warhol yeah he's like
he's not gonna give you a straight
answer on that his brain were straight
answer
alone it's not gonna be able to give you
here I am with my pet I'm like oh and
I'm listening I'm like wow we went off
the path real quick with that but that
was cool those my medium he's a really
interesting because it cool guy he's a
very nice person yes and he's great he's
you know he's very zen yeah as you
noticed it you know in grasshopper in
Japan you everything you know you take
off your shoes and everything's really
quiet and mellow yeah what was that
experience like I mean did you get to
work with him a lot were you know I
didn't I worked with you know I worked
with Sudha a fair amount and then I you
know it's like everybody kind of does
their own piece you know it was a very
interesting experience there was a
learning curve we had a lot of meetings
where it was me and the two Warner
Brothers guys around a table and then a
bunch of Japanese of people like 12
Japanese people around another table
yeah and then videoconferencing okay on
this large huge video screen sure both
large and huge at the same time and we
uh so we did that all the time and and
it really it was a learning curve like
at the beginning it's just it's just you
know because not only is the way they
tell a story different but the way they
interact in business is very different
so that was difficult frankly but after
a while we got into a groove and I found
also that one of the things was once we
started to hang out in person once they
started coming over here and we were
hanging out and we were working together
on stuff then it became a lot easier
because then we kind of got that I think
that you know we all we all want the
game to be great of course and once you
learn that that everyone wants the game
to be great and that nobody really had
an ego stake in anything all that we
care about is that the game works right
so there's nobody fighting for their own
way just because they're fighting for
their own way we're all fighting for
what we believe in because we went the
game to work right and once that sort of
clicked then it was magic and it was I
have to say in a lot of ways it was the
best working experience of my adult life
because I didn't have it was not
difficult right you know like sometimes
making a movie is sure and it wasn't
there weren't that the battles were at
the beginning and once we learned to get
through them they were done and the
people at Warner Brothers are the best
people in the world and I mean just
really they're they're great and and
I've never had a corporate entity like
that who would push me so far they
understood from the beginning that we
were making a very extreme game and if
you're going to make this game that's
extreme then you have to kind of go with
it and let it be that if we start
pulling back on things then it's gonna
be like a milky version of extreme and
then it's not gonna be extreme and then
there's gonna be nothing to set it apart
so they've sort of understood that they
then sort of understood that they did
understand it from the beginning and
really just I never had to struggle with
them at all yeah and and they worked
really well in bringing me in the
Japanese guys together in helping us to
work and Scott wor who you met was great
at facilitating and you know he would
travel over to Japan and sit with the
sound engineers like throughout the
whole cutting process because again it's
like everything that we recorded is very
specifically you know it's comedy yeah
so there's a rhythm to it and not all
you know dead guy who's Japanese sound
engineer isn't gonna necessarily
understand how they got together yeah
and so he just he would sit there with
them throughout every single cut and and
everybody really put their hearts and
souls into it and it's a very
interesting game because it is it's
nasty it's dirty it's sexy it's it's
it's raunchy it's a very violent but
there's a real sweetness to it and I
think that is what sort of brought me
and suited together I think that is if
you look back on everything both of us
have ever done it truly is a combination
of something really profane and really
sweet at the same time and both of us
are attracted to that so and best of all
I mean you know like we said there there
are too many games in certain genres
yeah this is definitely a change of pace
yeah a breath of fresh air and it sounds
like you've had the the working
environment that would facilitate
exactly what you guys want to do and you
know what else but good can come out
yeah and it's been going I mean I think
pre-sales are amazing you know people
seem to like it we've got you know you
cannot go to any sort of convention
without having twelve Juliet's darling
cosplayers already out there and you
know we do them games to come out for
two months yeah that's so cool oh it
isn't two months anymore is it no it's
like a mono Wow
yeah it's almost no day here yeah so
yeah speaking of your career I mean
you've been involved in a lot of pretty
extreme stuff we've got slither real
quick the cult classic Romeo and Juliet
super which was more recent and then the
the remake of Dawn of the Dead so you
had your zombie sort of credentials yeah
I've been around Dom bees quite a bit
what do you what do you mean and
obviously lollipop chainsaw deals with
with that genre as well why do you think
zombies with stand the test of time why
do you think zombies are you know I
think like the basic apocalyptic zombie
narrative yeah is it works extremely
well in human beings because it's a
combination of most every fear that a
human has sure it's a fear it's it's
it's evolutionary it's our fear of
disease mmm it's our fear of our loved
ones becoming something else in turning
against us so it gets into like a
paranoid fear right it's our fear of
losing everything
it's our fear of being eaten by prey
yeah you don't get more primal than that
and then in addition to those fears
there's also a wish fantasy fulfillment
there's the ability to kill without
moral problems whatsoever
there's a world in which it all belongs
to you and everybody that you hated are
the daily mundane things of life are
gone right and so I think that the basic
zombie like Dawn of the Dead are Walking
Dead are these types of narratives they
fulfill all those different wishes and
fears simultaneously so that it works
extremely well on the human psyche for
sure I think it's just that you know
it's just like all bets are off
you know and it's I can destroy anything
I can do whatever I want whatever it's
all that's all for me you know and like
some genres come and go I think we're
about looking at my watch we're done
with the vampire thing Yeah right that's
sort of over yeah come and go but
zombies I mean for well it's you know
it's it's it's cyclical
I mean zombies really until Dawn of the
Dead there was never truly you could say
resident evil I guess but there was
never really a big-budget zombie movie
until and I don't mean zombie dawn that
that wasn't a huge budget right but it
was a bigger budget zombie movie I mean
they're just zombies are pretty new in
the landscape I mean until
then zombies were a very very
underground thing all those Romero
zombie films were very low-budget my
fault g zom b films are very low-budget
so zombies were pretty much an
underground thing until you know you
could say Resident Evil Dawn of the Dead
you know 28 days later those kind of
made zombies more in the forefront and
then of course Kirkman's comic book and
now though at the peak is Walking Dead
and in some ways I think that zombies
are kind of you know lollipop chainsaw
is its own thing but in some ways
zombies are sort of done frankly you
think so yeah because I think the
talking I mean The Walking Dead but I
did the show which I did but yeah though
the Walking Dead is it's hard to you
know you really need a new twist on
zombies after your TV right I mean it's
on TV every week they're focusing on
things other than zombies running up
again I like my throne and I'm not
saying I don't like Walking Dead I do
like Walking Dead
but I'm saying outside of Walking Dead
to have other zombie narratives right
now you have to think of a way to do it
that's pretty unique sure I think what's
interesting is the variations I mean
when you look at something like 28 days
later where the zombies are running yeah
you know like that was sort of it you're
gonna get some hate mail from people
that say that they are not zombies in 28
days later I think there's no real rule
yeah yeah listen everybody says you know
zombies are you know whatever they say
about them but you go back to the
original zombies to like white zombie
yeah and they're exactly the same
they're they're exactly the same as the
zombies in 28 days later so you don't
need the zombie it's just a word and
there's no zombie handbook yeah you know
there is actually the right he's great
that books amazing yeah but he doesn't
mean it's real and now movie is coming
at the follow the world yeah yeah it'll
be interesting to see that could that
could really that's gonna be like the
huge budget zone yeah so we'll see how
it works yeah it's definitely
interesting speaking of storytelling you
know this is your first sort of leap
into the the video game world do you
think that games are really the future
of storytelling no I
I 100% I don't I think that's half of
the future storytelling I think that
human beings have a very deep need to
kick back relax and and take in and not
do anything
that's what movies are that's what
television is it is that experience sure
the other need is to interact and play
that's what video games are the
storytelling in a way is a break from
the player it's a way to enhance the
play those are two different experiences
and we need them both and people need
them both in general so I do think
obviously you know there's more play
there's less play there's more watching
there's less watching but they're two
different things you know when you hear
people all the time saying yeah I want
to want to fuse those two I want to
create and like right you're
misunderstanding the nature of the human
being sure there is no fusing of those
two people want to watch or they want to
play and they're two different different
experiences so well I mean so you're
saying you don't think well obviously
your involvement with lollipop changes
you can play yes you can play and be a
part of a story in which you're playing
that story sure but you know you don't
want to you know you it's like the
people that try to create something that
is is you're a part of the story again
the function is still play its role
playing absolutely it's play absolutely
you know it's not kicking back and relax
and watching a story right they're two
different things so we talked a little
bit you you yourself are a big gamer
yeah what uh what do you been playing
lately what or what is your what is your
favorite sort of game not you I am what
are you into it I am into a lot of
different things but my basic games I
play RPG and stealth games so I love
like my favorite game of all time is
Knights of the Old Republic uh-huh I
love the you know Mass Effect games I
think they're amazing I love the
Splinter Cell Games and the Hitman games
and more stealth games like that
I love Skyrim Red Dead Redemption red
love I love the you know the you know
Grand Theft Auto game so I play a lot of
games you don't I don't really I just
listed off like a lot of games that I
play but what I do is I'm when I game I
game like I don't do anything else so I
will turn eight and yeah I will take a
couple breaks a year where if
few days I will play a game I will play
it through to the end and I'll never
pick it up again and and I do that a few
times a year but I don't I I don't play
games like every night sure you know I
did it with Skyrim for a long Skyrim
does something to you yeah I don't know
what it is but as you know I love Skyrim
but I also found that Skyrim wasn't as
addictive to me as say Mass Effect where
I feel like I have to finish the game or
Road em swear I felt like I had to
finish the game Skyrim I was somehow
able to like you know live my life come
home and play Skyrim for 3 or 4 hours I
was able to turn it off yeah this is a
big thing a lot of games I can't seem
you know it's like you know I'm like ok
one more hour one everything every game
absolutely and that's more hours 5
o'clock and you're like what happened I
wake up at 9 it's like time travel is
why do you think that was would scare me
because I because I sort of know where
you're coming from with Mass Effect
I was start to finish it was was like
two three days and I was done yeah I
think I think because Skyrim was so
enormous yeah and it just wasn't it was
a great game and I'm not saying this in
a negative way but it wasn't quite as
intense as as Mass Effect for sure Mass
Effect is a more of an intense story and
we feel like you have to finish that
story and be a part of that absolutely
