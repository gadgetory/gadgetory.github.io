going to take a look at the August smart
lock this is a highly-anticipated lock
for a couple of reasons
one it's designed by yves behar so he's
sort of a well-known designer people are
pretty excited by that it's also a
pretty effective smart lock works with
your iOS or Android device as long as it
has bluetooth it's not that different
from other smart locks we've seen but
what we like about this one is that it's
really easy to install you can actually
attach it onto any existing deadbolt it
also has some effective geofencing
features which is a kind of simple way
to tell the lock what to do
automatically depending on your
proximity you can talk to your phone and
see if you're close enough it'll unlock
automatically or as soon as you walk
away you can set it to auto lock Auto
unlock feature for example it has 100
yard range so when you go away from your
house and come back within that within
100 yards it will Auto unlock that's a
pretty broad range though it might be
nicer if it was just say 10 yards or 15
yards auguste says they're going to work
on that but they need the larger data
set from real people using these locks
to kind of see what people's preferences
are and just general behavior the device
so like I said the lock is designed to
work with your existing deadbolt set up
so as long as your hardware sets flush
with your door you remove the standard
thumb-turn add-on a plate that kind of
depends on what lock you have installed
there's a couple different options in
the box for August you screw in the
backplate into the existing key way in
the front and then you attach the August
lock to this plate and anyone with basic
mechanical competence should be able to
install this lock
getting installed on your phone is also
pretty easy you simply download the
August app turn on Bluetooth and the
tool will find each other as long as you
install the batteries in the lock itself
the basic function of the lock is that
not only will it work as a standard lock
but you can also use your phone to open
and close it you can hit this sub button
here and over Bluetooth it will unlock
and lock the door now the Bluetooth
connection is pretty responsive it's not
instantaneous as soon as you fire up the
app takes a minute to kind of find
itself but it works pretty fast and a
bad as fast as it would take to take
your keys out you can also assign access
to different people whether they have a
smart phone and have down
the August app the data tracking in the
app so you can see who comes and goes
and when and because it's only bluetooth
it doesn't talk to the internet at large
so you can't really control it remotely
but it does work with a couple hubs that
will eventually give you that capability
so there's a logitech smart home hub and
it works with smart things also it also
will eventually have homekit support for
apple iOS so the home kit functions
aren't turned on yet we're pretty much
expecting that that will mean Siri
functionality and potentially
interaction with other devices we'll see
what happens as soon as Apple kind of
flips a switch on home cave which we
hope will happen later this quarter so
of the smart locks we've seen so far oh
it's probably one of our favorites it
works really well it's easy to install
and because you add it to an existing
lock nobody on the outside can tell what
you have on the inside so it's discreet
it looks good and it's easy to use it
will cost you 250 bucks though so you
really kind of have to want to buy into
the smart home in order to buy this
thing so thanks for watching be sure to
