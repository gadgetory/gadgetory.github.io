London with samsung's new flagship phone
the samsung galaxy s3 comes in white and
blue let's take a look let's start with
this biggest feature the 4.8 inch screen
this is half an inch bigger than the
screen on its predecessor the s2 the
resolution is 1280 by 720 and it looks
really bright colorful and the fonts are
really really crisp it's running Android
Ice Cream Sandwich which as usual has
been heavily customized with Samsung's
touch with interface now one of the
things Samsung is pushing here is the
camera the rear one is 8 megapixels and
it's super quick to take a picture
samsung says the camera will
automatically tag your friends and share
the photo with them providing have the
picture stored with their contact
details although this feature wasn't
finished on the sample I saw what was
working was the burst mode which lets
you take up to 20 photos in one go and
something called select best shot which
takes 8 photos and recommends the best
one else where you can record 1080p
videos and take still pictures
simultaneously or they're only at six
megapixels here at the front is a two
megapixel camera which works with
something called smart stay to keep the
screen from dimming while you're looking
at the phone inside is Samsung's own
quad-core chip running at one point 4
gigahertz samsung says this uses a lot
less power than the dual-core processor
in the s2 now combine that with the
high-capacity battery and that means the
s3 will last longer away from the mains
than the s2 or so samsung says anyway
there's no final figure for battery life
yet but I'm told to expect roughly 13
hours the s3 feels really good in the
hand nice and light and it's just 8.6
millimeters thick there's a physical
home button on the front and a couple of
touch sensitive keys they're a little
too close to the edge of my liking as I
kept hitting them by mistake but I think
you'll get used to it other cool
features include a video player that you
can move around the screen so you can
browse the internet or text without
breaking off from the video you're
watching and something called s voice
which is basically samsung's version of
Apple's Siri so you can say what's the
weather like today and the phone will go
away and find out with s beam you can
share files over Wi-Fi with another
galaxy by tapping the phones together
and you get a free 50 gigabyte Dropbox
account with every s3 which impress me
it will come in 16 32 and see
the four gig versions and there's also a
micro SD slot for a further 64 gig of
memory if you need it but the best thing
of all for me is the removable battery
so if it dies you can replace it with a
new one unlike many other high-end
phones at the moment the HSPA version of
the s3 is going to be available in
europe first towards the end of May then
in the other countries that use a gsm
standard afterwards an LTE version for
America will follow but not until
December sorry folks overall my first
impressions have really really positive
but make sure you come out to seen it in
a few weeks for a full review so that's
the samsung galaxy s3 i'm jason Jenkees
foreseen it see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
