com and there are so many things here at
comic-con so I just want to bring it
trim it down to distill it to my top
five favorite things that we've seen
here and at number five we start off
with big statues and no one does a big
or better than Optimus Prime when we say
these statues are big we mean big at
number for illegal uses of spandex now
we've seen plenty of men in tights and
you could see every bold and bump you
can imagine we're here with a family of
spandex you know I guys can't help but
stare looking at other guys it's bad
it's kind of one of the things are you
kind of have to stop and look are you
comfortable with that it's all relative
you know I have to every once awhile I
hate to say it but I look around and if
I'm looking a little bit better in
spandex been somebody else then then I'm
okay
just works your advantage so I mean
girls you get a really good look at your
physique in your butt right yeah you
know my fiance kind of had a problem
with the data actually I really don't
have that much of a butt with this if I
had like a I have like a tighter way to
inward kind of nice otherwise sorry to
spank you number three we're talking
shopping now where else will you find
grown men buying toys that remain in
their packages and wait in line for
hours only here at comic-con and
honestly I wish I could wait in line fit
them now the fact that these are limited
is that what makes you wait in line to
get them um that's obviously what's
creating a line but honestly I'd be
getting some of these if they weren't
limited but it definitely adds some is
likely to be able to them in which i
love how long did you have to wait in
line we actually got our tickets
yesterday for two o'clock and we came
this morning so yeah that long are these
to resell or these for your own personal
collection personal oh my keep on the
package open one up and one just in case
are we tracking anything right now oh
good lord it's bad it's really it's
pretty bad here gamma God a numero dos
we've got geek cry now for us geeks and
nerds are like nothing feels more like
home the comic-con and nothing says geek
Pride more than Star Wars on a car let
me ask me to do this they said oh we
judge to draw live on a car Star Wars I
said I could do this job without
reference I can just sit here just dry
nothing I've been doing ever sitting
here for two days three days now and
just drawing Star Wars things I'm having
the greatest time now you sure it's a
lot of work but it's cool man come on
it's Star Wars why do we do it it's
because of love for something that we
grew up with I mean I think I said when
you can identify with something that
kind of shaped your life for a very long
time it's not for showing off it's just
a matter
this is what I'm passionate about this
is what I like and this is what I'm
about what it comes right down to it
it's just bringing a thrill and creating
memories for people at 10 comic-con as
well
at number one girls now I've been a
whole lot of conventions CES III but the
girls don't do the things the girls do
here they talk to you they want to be
your friend your close friend in I love
every second of it you know the guys can
look at you like pieces of meat is there
more to you than just that you know what
it really hasn't been bad we haven't had
any bad comments or anything else like
that listen here comes on I think Eddie
and elsewhere so why would you stop and
talk to someone like me cuz you add this
top five things to see here at comic-con
2011 I'm Brian Champa cnet com hey I
think I'm just gonna stay here all day
