blackberry playbook gets the hands-on
treatment see how it holds up against
the iPad 2 in our speed test
Marshall headphones that are major cool
and back up your Android phone before
it's too late it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good in what
has really been a two horse race between
iOS and Android
sorry windows a new contender in the
tablet battle emerged this week with the
release of rims BlackBerry PlayBook
billed as the future of the BlackBerry
platform itself the PlayBook is designed
with business users in mind and here is
Donald Bell with his first look hey i'm
donald bell and today we're taking a
first look at the blackberry playbook
from rama
this is a 7-inch tablet priced at $499
for a 16 gigabyte version $599 for 32
gigabytes and $6.99 for 64 gigabytes
this version here only connects to the
internet over Wi-Fi or a tethered
connection to your smartphone but a 4G
model is coming out later this year the
screen quality is nice there's a pair of
stereo speakers on the sides here a 3
megapixel camera up top and a 5
megapixel camera on the back that can
also record video at 1080p
on the bottom you get connections for an
optional charging dock a microUSB port
for charging and syncing and an HDMI
port that can also crank out smooth
1080p video the top of the PlayBook is a
sour note for me there's a headphone
jack and a pair of stereo mics that's
fine but the power button if you can see
it is this little teeny tiny thing made
for baby fingers it's also the button
you'll need to use for waking the screen
out of sleep mode so you'll have to
contend with it every day we thought a
case might help but for us it actually
made the situation worse as for the tiny
volume and play/pause controls next to
it they do work but I'm not sure why
they're even up here or why dedicated
play/pause button is even necessary if
you can get past the tedious little
button the real centerpiece of this
whole thing is the OS this is a brand
new piece of software built by RIM from
the ground up it's fast it's fluid it
can multitask and juggle apps like a
maniac and if Apple and Google aren't
scared yet they probably should be May
favorite part of the whole system is the
web browser which fully supports Adobe
Flash and presents webpages just as they
would look on your desktop that means
flash video flash games and for better
for worse flash ads but as great as it
is the browser is trapped inside a
tablet that is half the size of the iPad
not to mention the 10-inch honeycomb
tablets that are due out this year some
may find the small size an advantage but
when it comes to full scale webpages and
document editing those tasks really
deserve a larger screen so that's the
BlackBerry PlayBook from rim a powerful
tablet at a good price and one of the
best 7-inch tablets we've seen even
though I wish it were bigger for
cnet.com I'm Donald
so it's not as pretty or as big as the
iPad 2 but how does the PlayBook stack
up in terms of performance
Eric Franklin put them side-by-side in a
good old fashioned speed test to find
out hey guys we're gonna see that labs
here today another week another a tablet
to test it seems you've seen our
previous speed tests well you know what
to expect if not it's pretty
self-explanatory this week is the iPad 2
versus the rim blackberry playbook now
we have some web speed tests to get to
so let us begin first web speed test is
giant bomb calm let's go they're going
an iPad 2 is ahead okay now the rim is
done and there you are
next up cbsnews.com and they're off and
running and CBS news on the i cartoons
holding holding they're both holding up
CBS news on the iPad 2 is done and now
the RAM Dekker is done as well now we're
going to this little-known site you may
have heard of its called cnet.com
okay so yet calm on the iPad - is coming
in and it's done and the rim is lagging
behind a couple seconds and it's done
now - all right there is cnet.com and
there it is both the iPad 2 and the
PlayBook are fast as you can see the
iPad 2 is a little bit faster
however the PlayBook has full flash
support so that may have adversely
affected its performance check out my
full blog as I'll have more detail
results these rolls results for the
Motorola Xoom
until next time personally I don't mind
waiting a couple extra seconds for a
page to load if it means that the page
is gonna look right yay flash but I also
wouldn't mind watching my flash video on
a bigger screen a couple of weeks ago we
showed you how to take advantage of
Amazon's new cloud drive and cloud
player services on your Android phone
well sharon's back again this week and
as you're about to see the cloud drive
still isn't really that helpful if you
have an iPhone but there are some
alternatives out there that you should
check out storing and streaming music
from the cloud is a nice alternative to
storing it locally on your phone or
computer it gives you more storage space
on your devices and allows you to access
your music from anywhere but when Amazon
launched its cloud drive and cloud
player it gave I Oh s users no love I'm
Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com with a guide
for iOS users who want to stream music
from the cloud
when Amazon's Cloud Drive and player
were first announced we quickly figured
out that even though there isn't a
dedicated app for iOS you can still
stream music to your iPhone iPod or iPad
it's sort of clumsy but here's how it
works
head to amazon.com / cloud player you'll
be warned that your browser is not
supported but you already knew that hit
continue and you'll see the cloud player
dashboard
- play a song tap it and hit the blue
arrow on the right you'll see a
drop-down menu select download and
safari will open the song with QuickTime
the first time you do this Amazon will
ask you to get the mp3 download err
your song will start playing and will
play in the background if you exit
Safari which is fine but as you can see
you can't skip songs save them or do any
of the cool things that the Amazon mp3
app for Android can personally I would
skip this option it's too sloppy and I
can't find any practical use for this
method instead I use sugar sync a
similar service which is actually iOS
compatible like Amazon Sugar Singh gives
you five gigabytes of storage for free
but the best part is that for every
friend who signs up for sugar sing
through a referral you made you get 500
megabytes of extra storage to keep
forever and there is no maximum right
now the promotion is only offered until
May 31st 2011 so now's the time to start
spamming your friends to set up the
cloud go to sugar Singh Kham and hit try
sugarsync free you'll see several
pricing options for now let's get the
five free gigabytes of storage by
scrolling down and hitting sign up next
to the fine print
after that follow the sign up and
download instructions and get sugar sync
on your computer once it's there open
the sugar sync file manager to add music
to your cloud hit add sync folder and
select all the folders you want to sync
if you have iTunes you can choose to
sync your entire iTunes library if it
fits now download the sugar sync app on
your iOS device once you're signed in
open the icon for your computer you'll
see all the files you backed up to your
cloud to stream your music just open a
folder in top
if you're on a slow connection it'll
take some time to buffer sugarsync
supports multitasking so music will play
even when you exit from this player
window you can skip songs within the
folder so if you want to be able to skip
through all of your music make sure to
put all your files into one folder
unlike the Amazon mp3 app there's no
support for playlist creation or
shuffling but according to sugarsync
these features should be coming soon
remember you need to be connected to the
Internet to stream music from your cloud
but if you know you'll be offline cache
songs by tapping the arrow next to a
file and selecting sync to iPhone
SugarSync is my chosen alternative to
Amazon Cloud Player
but Dropbox can offer you a similar deal
the difference is that you only get two
gigabytes free and the app won't let you
skip songs in other words it's pointless
for media streaming but if you're stuck
on Dropbox you can download a $2.00 app
called Boxey tunes it lets you skip
songs create playlists and cache your
library at this point SugarSync and
dropbox are probably your best bet for
streaming music from the cloud
but since the Amazon mp3 app would
directly compete with iTunes and the
fact that Apple is rumored to be
developing its own cloud service it
might be a while before we see an Amazon
Cloud players show up in the App Store
if you have anyhow your request of your
own email them to how to at Cena comm
for C net I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see
you on the interwebs
and of course once you finally get your
cloud situation figured out you don't
want to listen to all that music on
crummy headphones do you assuming that
you don't I suggest you at least
consider this new pair from Marshall the
guys that make the amps
if you're a musician that already owns
martial gear well now you can add these
headphones to your collection I'm Justin
you with cnet.com this is your first
look at the marshal major headphones the
majors are the company's first over ear
a headphone and they definitely live up
to the company's strong legacy with a
familiar shape and excellent acoustics
to match its line of amps they feature a
closed back on ear design that does well
at eliminating ambient noise around you
so you can focus on your music instead
of that conversation going on next to
you along the same lines the sealed
design actually helps keep others from
hearing what you're listening to as well
aesthetically it's easy to tell who
makes the headphones they're clearly
branded on both ear cups and the
interior even features Jim Marshalls own
signature Marshall adds even more
distinction with a headband line with
Marshalls own tolex flexible vinyl
fabric that's been historically used to
cover Fender guitar amps and guitar
cases since the 1960s other small
details of note include a swiveling wire
cage for transport tough rubber
throughout for durability and a straight
wire that also features a coiled portion
for extra slack sonically speaking the
majors actually do sound great across
all genres of music they reproduced all
of our test tracks with accuracy and a
spatial sound that gives the audible
illusion that the music is playing
outside of your head instead of just
between your ears so whether you're
married to the Marshall brand or you're
just shopping for a new pair of passive
noise-isolating headphones you certainly
will not be disappointed with this
purchase you can read all the details in
our full review on cnn.com but that's
gonna do it for me I'm Justin you these
are the Marshall major headphones and
that sounds good to me now I know
headphones are basically just little
speakers you wear on your ears but I'm
not sure they need to look like little
speakers that you wear on your ears
although if Justin says they sound good
I would at least be willing to give them
a try and while I find out if those
little Marshall amps go to 11 let's take
a break we'll be right back for more
tech review right after this
you
welcome back to the CNET tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at C net TV
continuing on in the good one of the
cardinal rules of computing is backup
backup and backup your backups
well that motto is just as true when it
comes to your phone iPhone users have it
easy because iTunes can backup your
phone every time you plug it into sync
but for all of us Android folks it's not
that cut and dry so that's why we have
Sharon Backman to show us how I'm Sharon
Vaknin for cnet.com here to show you how
to backup your Android phone backing up
is simple but many people only realize
they should when it's too late it only
takes a second for your phone to get
stolen lost or dunked in coffee so
here's my advice to keep your data safe
even if you end up phoneless if you have
a rooted device go download titanium or
an Android and you're set but if you
don't know what I'm talking about or
you'd like to backup your device before
rooting your phone here are some easy
solutions Android users have any number
of options to choose from so where do
you start
consider the most important things that
you want to keep safe for most of you
it'll be apps contacts SMS and photos
luckily Google takes care of some of
these things and more go to settings
privacy and make sure that backup my
settings and automatic restore are
checked off go back to the settings menu
and select account and sync and open
your Gmail account check off everything
and your calendar Gmail and contacts
will be backed up to Google servers now
if you ever lose your phone and purchase
a new Android all you have to do is sign
into your Gmail account and your
applications contacts email calendar and
system settings will be restored text
messages get handled a little
differently to back up your text
conversations download an app called SMS
backup plus it'll automatically backup
SMS MMS and call logs to your gmail
account as threaded messages download
the app connect it to your Google
count and choose backup to start syncing
your text messages will show up under a
new label in your gmail account and your
SMS will continue to backup in the
background for some reason Google hasn't
configured automatic photo syncing yet
so here are some other options if you
use a cloud service like Flickr Picasa
or photo bucket there are third-party
apps that will help you backup your
photos wirelessly photo bucket Mobile is
neat because there's an option to auto
upload all of your mobile photos the way
i fi does flickr companion and picasa
tool are also free apps that will let
you upload your photos to their server
but they're not automatic if you don't
want to deal with all of those apps and
all you want to do is store those photos
on your computer use the good old drag
and drop method plug your phone into
your computer put it in disk drive mode
and open the drive it should appear in
my computer on Windows or on your Mac
desktop open it
find the DCIM folder and drag and drop
all the photos you want saved onto your
hard drive the only problem with this
method is that it's not automated so
remember to do this at least once a week
now if you want the peace of mind
knowing that somebody else is taking
good care of your data there is an app
for that
my backup Pro is the best and least
expensive app that I found that will
back up everything to their online
servers or your SD card for five bucks
my backup will store photos call logs
apps and text messages and more it also
gives you the option to schedule backups
and if you get a new Android or your
current Android is somehow wiped just
reinstall my backup and hit restore just
realize that some apps and settings
might not transfer because of software
or hardware compatibility these are my
favorite ways to backup my Android phone
but there are many other options if you
have a preferred way let me know on
Twitter or email your suggestions
questions and ideas at how-to at
cnet.com for CNET I'm Sharon Vaknin and
I'll see you on the interwebs
I have to say the fact that you can do
all that without ever having to plug
your phone into a computer so much
better than iTunes for many
photographers half the fun of taking
pictures is tweaking all the settings
and adding effects afterwards to create
fun artistic photos and while there are
hundreds of photo editing apps in the
iTunes App Store FX photo studio is by
far one of our favorites here's Jason
Parker to tell you why you should tap
that up welcome to tap that app I'm
Jason Parker and this is the show where
we cover the hottest apps in the mobile
space anyone who spent any time browsing
the iTunes App Store knows there's no
shortage of CAM related apps but one of
our favorite photo effects apps received
a price drop recently and offers so much
after numerous updates that it's almost
silly not to get it it's called FX photo
studio and like many other apps lets you
quickly edit images right on your iPhone
you get the standard set of basic image
editing controls including gamma
cropping and rotation tools all these
are controlled using on-screen sliders
and other simple touch controls so it's
easy to get the exact look you want or
FX photo studio truly shines is the
amount you can do with your photos by
selecting from an enormous amount of
effects as of today FX photo studio
includes 187 high-quality effects you
can add to your images start by either
taking a picture with your iPhone camera
or picking one from your photo library
from there the app defaults to showing
you its entire list of 187 effects with
previews so you know what you're getting
well so many effects it can be a bit
overwhelming but fortunately you can
also view effects by category making it
easy to figure out what you want you can
get the retro look by selecting vintage
for example which gives you selections
like old photo burnt paper or old film
frame each of the effect types can be
saved for later by touching the star at
the upper right adding it to your
favorites list you also have the ability
to layer your image with multiple
effects for a custom look you can save
as a preset to use later simply add an
effect to your image then select another
effect to layer on top when you're
finished
turn to the effect selection screen and
hit the preset button at the bottom you
can then save the preset and give it a
name that you'll remember later now you
only need to go to the preset screen to
add those same effects to other images
when you're done you can share the
images via Facebook Twitter Flickr
tumblr or just send directly through
email FX photo studio is not a new
iPhone app but over the course of time
and numerous updates has become one of
the best in the iTunes App Store anyone
who likes adding effects to images or
just wants to experiment with their
iPhone camera should definitely tap this
app FX photo studio is only $0.99 at the
iTunes App Store for a limited time so
make sure to grab it before the price
goes back up again that's it for today's
show but if you have any suggestions
send them to tap that app at cnet.com
I'm Jason Parker thanks for watching I
bet that would be even more fun on the
iPads big screen a $0.99 for all that
what is you alright I've put it off for
as long as I can but it's time to check
out the bad my favorite part of this
next video is the fact that Scott Stein
makes so little effort to conceal his
lack of enthusiasm for this toshiba
satellite laptop and i don't think it's
because he has to review yet another
laptop but the fact that he has to
review this one again
hi I'm Scott Steiner associate editor at
cnet.com and this is the toshiba
satellite a 6 6 5 s 51 76 now if I sound
a little bit less than enthusiastic
about that long series of numbers at the
end of this satellite that's because
we've seen this satellite before we
reviewed satellite a 665 laptops these
big 15.6 inch models last year and
what's new now well new processors the
new Intel Core i3 is in here which uses
that new Sandy Bridge architecture that
we've talked about which gives you some
better performance and some better
graphics despite not having any
dedicated graphics inside on the other
hand yeah I mean it costs $7.99 which is
right in that range of laptops it's got
a blu-ray drive which is nice it's got a
screen that's not as nice it's at 13 6 6
by 768 resolution not bad but it's not
as crisp or as bright as we've seen on
other blu-ray laptops the speakers are
pretty great Harman Kardon speakers and
we've liked those on all of those upper
range satellite laptops they really do
boom but not quite as much as we saw on
say the Dell XPS 15 which had fantastic
speakers so if you like the idea of
multimedia on your laptop that could be
a plus it's got into a wireless display
and it's got your farms you're giving by
a hard drive your 4 gigs of ram overall
though it's clunky it's big the battery
life is good but not great and you're
sort of left in that middle ground
honestly you could do better let me give
you some advice look at this one but
maybe look at some other laptops - I'm
Scott Stein and this is the toshiba
satellite a6 65s 51 76
now the Toshiba does have a few things
going for it but my guess is that if you
end up buying it you'll be just as
ambivalent about it as Scott was all
right let's go ahead and check out this
week's bottom line other than the iMac
all-in-one desktop PCs don't get a ton
of respect these days but HP TouchSmart
has intrigued us with previous models
and HP might finally have cracked the
nut hi I'm rich Brown senior editor for
cnet.com then we're gonna take a look at
the editors choice winning HP TouchSmart
610 Q so this is a high end all one from
HP and it's got a touchscreen but also
have some pretty cool features that
we've never seen in a touch-based on one
for one of the best things about this
system is its case it's a brand new
design from HP and it comes with a new
feature that lets you tilt the system
down so it becomes sort of a touch
console and it's actually not unlike
using an iPad now of course this is
still Windows 7 so not every application
on here is optimized for touch but there
certainly some that are opening up
Kindle PC for example using the system
in this tilted console mode is really
quite natural and of course HP also
includes a suite of touch based software
some of its good some of it you can kind
of forget about but overall it's a
pretty well designed interface in
addition to the tilting screen HP has
also gone above and beyond whether it's
HDMI inputs in the system now we like
HDMI inputs and all in ones because it
lets you connect to a game console or a
cable box directly to the system then
you can swap the video signal out so
this is basically like a smaller TV now
HP's done here is that it's not only
added two HDMI inputs so that means you
don't need an HDMI hub is soon it also
has this HP picture and picture software
so what the picture-in-picture software
does is it gives you a handy software
control to kick you out to the various
HDMI inputs but it also gives you handy
display brightness contrast and other
controls and a handy touch-based
interface so in addition all those
features there's also one of the fastest
armed ones we've tested it beats out
every windows-based online in its price
range and it comes behind Apple's 1999
iMac on only two of our tests now the
reason for that speed is a fast 2.93 guy
it's Intel Core i7 CPU that makes a
system fast enough to handle any
day-to-day productivity or even consumer
level digital media editing we expect
gamers will also appreciate the 2
gigabyte AMD Radeon HD 5570 graphics
card that's a pretty solid mid-range
card and will play pretty much anything
out there at full 1920 by 1080
resolution and with basic image quality
for other highlights of the system you
get a blu-ray DVD combo drive as well as
a pair of USB 3 ports among the various
inputs on the system so for its price
its performance and the various
innovations around this case this is
easily one of our favorite on ones so
I'm rich brown and this is the editors
choice winning HP TouchSmart 6/10 Q the
bottom-line this week that's a hell of a
biggy reader seriously though the
TouchSmart has been all about potential
for a long time and it's nice to see it
finally be all that it can be and speedy
to boot look out iMac alright folks
that's our show we'll be back next week
with a brand spanking new CNET tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at Cena
tv.com
I'll see you next time and thank you for
