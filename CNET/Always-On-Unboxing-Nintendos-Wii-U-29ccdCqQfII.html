inside this big box i have a wii u we
actually had to get our reviews team in
new york to overnight us one of the
three that they got because i could not
buy this thing anywhere let's check it
out okay it's pretty heavy oh we you ok
so the set does come with the actual
console and then of course the big
headline the game controller the big
difference between the deluxe and the
basic models is fifty dollars for one
but mainly console storage the deluxe
has 32 gigs of on-board storage whereas
the basic only has eight and then you
get a couple of stands for your consoles
and things like that so tidy your
overall I gotta say 450 bucks probably
worth the upgrade get this out of here
good job packing it back up guys to
thoroughly liters nope ok so the first
thing I'm gonna get out here is the
gamepad controller you get like your own
little tablet it's already been well
loved by the guys to New York see and
then the actual consoles here pretty
small and tidy up to say not a bad
addition to your home theater cabinet
they're definitely well some of the
super slim models now of this
PlayStation so for small but it's a good
size there we go let's see what we have
in the box now the guys in New York did
warn me that there is one cable missing
from this box the hdmi cable that's a
pretty important one but it is good to
know that the wii u ships with an hdmi
cable which it should because that is
one in addition to the gamepad one of
the big headlines about the wii u is
that the we finally gets HD catches up
with the xbox 360 and the playstation
okay so inside the box we have our power
cable here
nice good sized brick and then of course
the motion sensor bar that goes on top
of your TV or somewhere else so that it
can seem moving around and then it looks
like it comes with a couple of games
maybe just one Nintendo land to get you
used to using the controller with things
and that is pretty much it for the box
alright let's find out some of the specs
let's start with the actual console
Nintendo's not saying much about what
processor is powering the wii u so we'll
move straight to connectivity we know
there are four USB 2.0 ports two in the
front and two in the back it has
component video output and also
composite s-video and one hdmi output it
has built-in Wi-Fi and there's an SD
card slot on the front for loading and
media now let's move on to the gamepad
controller this has a six point two inch
16 by nine touchscreen display the
resolution is not great this is
definitely not meant to be a media
viewing tablet 854 x 480 pixels the pad
itself weighs about a pound and it is
10.2 inches wide it has a front facing
camera a headphone jack an IR port for
controlling the TVs and the cable boxes
and the wii and it even has an NFC chip
although I don't know what you do with
it at this stage of the game there's no
question that Nintendo Wii U is an
innovative game system I like the idea
of integrating some sort of a tablet a
little bit of second screen action
happening here in terms of the units I
don't know why you wouldn't spend the 50
bucks and get the deluxe model so that
you have just a few more accessories and
of course more storage now that said our
reviews have found that the gamepad is
clunky it's a little bit hard to use and
it's a little confusing to figure out
why you'd want to Plus even though this
finally lets the we catch up to the Xbox
in terms of all those media streaming
connections Nintendo's TV e streaming
system didn't ship at launch and in fact
was delayed until after people had
already bought the unit my initial sense
is that this console is a little bit of
a mess
I might hold off to see whether some of
those features start to roll in once
they do it's probably a pretty good by
Nintendo has great brand affinity so
it's not like people aren't going to buy
it it's great for the kids three hundred
dollars for the basic model or 350 for
the one you probably want to buy if you
do want to buy it make sure you read our
full cnet review first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
