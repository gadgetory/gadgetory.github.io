show you actually I don't know what I'm
showing you but it's right here it's
called the G colleague from g technology
so let's find out what it is well if you
look it looked like a purple drive and
it is actually a purple drive but take a
close look over here you can see that it
has a USB 2.0 port now a few years ago
that's no big deal actually it's great
but now most if not all of the purple
dried would come with USB 3.0 which is
10 times faster and over here in CA y 5
label yes this one has a built-in Wi-Fi
network that allows for up to 5 iPads or
mobile devices to connect to it and
stream data store on its storage now
that's great but it has no batteries
which means you have to plug this into
the power source at oldham to use it not
so much for a mobile device and over
here in CA network port this is a
gigabit network port and you can plug
this divided into an existing network to
share the internet with the devices
connected to is to Wi-Fi network on top
of that you can also stream is content
to the rest of the network like an ass
server the problem is the device has
only 500 gigabyte for the ipass that is
plenty but for the rest of the network
that's not so much on top of that this
network port here only run as a 100
megabit per second when the Wi-Fi
network is turned on now in that case is
that so much of an S server now the G
connect can work as a portable drive or
in a server or a wireless store expander
at 8am when used as a purple drive it is
best power and it comes with these USB
cable right here is a y-shape allowing
you to use two ports from the computer
that's good thing in case one poor does
not provide a nap juice in my testing
actually only one port is needed now
when working as an a server or a
wireless tour expander it require ASAP
red power adapter right here which is
very similar to that of an iPad and in
fact you can use iPad with it there's
another cable right here that connect
the USB port of the power adapter to the
power port of the device now the whole
thing about the bus power and USB to
power power is kind of confusing now I
suspect that the best you for the g
connect is to use it with the ipad
sharing the data store on it in that
case you actually can drag and drop your
entire itune content on the drive right
here and carry it with you if I hotel
room plug it in and use it now the G
connect mobile apps currently only
available to the iOS devices actually
worked really well in my testing you can
just run it and then good Prowse music
photo and video and playback from the
ipad from up to 100 feet away this is me
skiing I am a professional obviously if
you don't notice and this is me and my
ex-girlfriend process memory I bring
with me everywhere I go so there you go
the G connect here make a great almost
device is almost a great purple drive
almost an a server and finally you'd
make a appt solutely great expanded for
the ipad if it had a built-in battery
which it doesn't and the question is how
much that is almost if I cost not almost
good deal i'm telling you i had an eight
dollars is too much for what it can
actually do form automation take out the
food vs capcom once again my name is
domo and this has been the first look at
the G correct from g technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
