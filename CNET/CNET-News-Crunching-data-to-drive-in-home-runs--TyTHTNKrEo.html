pitching clutch hitting and a high-tech
tool to help beat their opponents this
would be the lineup of the last team we
play the little things matter the team
that does the little things the most
each and every day is probably gonna
play the Opposition throughout the
season the A's first base and outfield
coach ty Waller developed a
sophisticated player database using
FileMaker software he's able to take
hundreds of Statistics every day and
easily organize them to help the A's
form a game plan ok six bucks against
left-handers six bucks against
right-handers Wohlers program keeps
track of everything from how a batter
hits against a certain picture to his
speed to where he tends to hit the ball
the information helps Waller position
the A's outfielders he also records the
stats of more than 2,000 pitchers so he
can advise base runners their times at
first base if they slide step their
moves times a second and various looks
for Waller going digital has replaced
tedious hand written reports when we
first started doing these reports we
used to get a binder I don't know how
thick you know how big of a suitcase we
would have to you have to carry all
those things now it's all in this little
box are the phone are the iPad before
every series Waller uses the data to
strategize with other coaches what
approach do you want to try to take with
this guy are you gonna pitch him one way
early in a different way late I mainly
he's looking to pull the baseball we're
gonna try and keep it away from after
tae generates the reports he posts them
here in the dugout so even the players
can get on the same page Waller has no
formal tech training but taught himself
about programming he's been building out
the database since 2007 constantly
improving it I'm an old school guy with
a new school spin on a team with one of
the best records in baseball boys in
Oakland I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS
