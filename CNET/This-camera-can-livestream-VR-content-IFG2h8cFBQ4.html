virtual reality content and 360-degree
camera content is the time it takes from
capturing to stitching and then
distribution that is where the live
planet system wants to come in and make
everything much much more simple this is
a prototype camera right now as you can
see the real version is actually going
to be quite a little bit smaller and
much more compact it is an entire live
virtual reality system so you can see
everything happening live around you
streamed either to a computer through
the cloud in a virtual reality headset
so how this works there are sixteen
lenses we have synchronized sensors
sitting behind them all the processing
and the encoding and the stitching
itself is done in camera there is an
internal 512 gigabytes storage system
that is used for recording video or you
can actually stream it live up to the
cloud now what the cloud does is then
take care of all of that distribution
problem for you so it sends it out to
whatever platform you like at launch
when it launches in the fourth quarter
of 2016
you're going to be able to send it out
to platforms like Facebook 360 YouTube
360 the oculus rift the HTC vive and the
Samsung gear VR and it's not going to be
cheap however it is going to cost around
$10,000 when it's released at the end of
this year although there is a pre-order
system available and it's going to be
around five thousand dollars definitely
targeted towards news makers documentary
filmmakers rather than the everyday
consumer but you get to see yourself and
watch everything in live virtual reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
