of totally wireless earphones what makes
them special
well not their price they're $200 but
they are lightweight sports friendly and
have something apples and air pods don't
have active noise cancellation that's
right this model is part of sony's new
1000x line which includes over the year
and neck band style models all of which
feature Sony's noise cancellation as
well as the ability to customize the
sound via Sony's headphone connect app
like a lot of these types of headphones
a battery life isn't great at three
hours but the earphones come with a
battery case that gives you an
additional two charges for a total of
nine hours
I thought these earphones were
comfortable to wear and fit securely in
my ears with the included fins but it is
important to get a tight seal or you'll
lose some bass and could be disappointed
with the sound quality aside from the
active noise cancellation I'm not sure
if Sony's done all that much from a
design and performance standpoint to
distinguish the WUF 1000x from a growing
number of competitors in a totally
wireless headphone arena but it's good
to see Sony in the game check out our
full review on CNET comm in the coming
weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
