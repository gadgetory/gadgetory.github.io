system in Rwanda more than a year ago
now we've been designing our next
generation system from the ground up
incorporating all that experience of
that first operation and so we
redesigned pretty much everything about
the plane and our ground systems to
support scaled operations so instead of
being able to do 50 fly today we want to
be able to do 500 fly today from a
single distribution center we pulled the
blood or the medical product for that
order put it in a package put that
package into a zip and launch that zip
the aircraft weighs 20 kilograms about
4045 pounds could be spinning motors and
long chains of any 138 it has about 10
foot wingspan 3 meters and it can carry
about 3 pounds 1.75 kilograms the plane
is measuring actively the wind speed and
the direction and so if the winds
blowing in a particular direction it's
going to compensate and drop that
package so it lands on the ground right
where you want it we can hit an area
about the size of two parking spots it
looks like a kind of like a cake box
with a paper parachute on top a
fixed-wing aircraft can fly dramatically
farther than something like a quadcopter
and that's really important for what we
do it can fly faster it can fly through
heavier weather and the approaches to
things like safety are also much easier
on our aircraft for example we have
multiple motors right the plane if
either one of those stops working the
plane flies just fine
we're in Rwanda today and we're
expanding to cover the other half of
Rwanda as we speak and next is Tanzania
from there we are really focused on
solving this problem access to medical
products at a global scale there's
access to medical product problems in
the US and in developing world
and we really want to solve all of those
problems everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
