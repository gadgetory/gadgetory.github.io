times when I forgo taking out my iPhone
and filming video and instead I take out
my iPhone and wait for the perfect
snapshot the reason is when I'm
recording video I don't want to miss out
on that perfect photo well in the iPhone
5 you can now do both
I'm Jayson Cipriani a scene at how to
contributor and I want to take a look at
how to take a photo while recording
video on the iPhone 5 this feature is
exclusive to the new iPhone or the
iPhone 5 and you can't get it on the 4s
or the four and it's built into the
native camera app in iOS 6 so how it
works is I have the camera app pulled up
now familiar layout
we're gonna go to switch over to video
mode and you'll see all the normal
buttons you could turn the flash on or
off switch to the front camera back
camera switch back to the camera look at
your camera roll and then of course your
record button so I'm going to tap on the
record button and you'll see all those
buttons disappear and a new one added in
the top right corner and that's going to
be a camera icon so it's filming right
now as you can see the red lights blink
in the indicator here for the time is
going up and I tap on the camera icon it
snaps a picture now one thing to keep in
mind when you snap a picture while
recording video is that any photos you
take while recording are actually taken
in a 16 by 9 aspect ratio so the actual
photo size is 1920 by 1080 I believe and
they're not gonna be the full size
photos that you would normally give when
you're in the camera side of the camera
app on the i-5 but they are some photos
that you can take and use to share and
you do not miss out on that perfect
Kodak moment once again this was Jason
Cipriani a CNET how to contributor and
that was how to take a photo while
filming video on the iPhone 5 make sure
