phone use it to pay anywhere maybe just
like Apple pay well that's android peg
and that's gonna be available this
summer now Google's already had google
wallet so what's the difference between
that and this new payment system this
enables tokenization a tokenization is
the idea that you're not going to use
your actual credit card number for the
transaction have a virtualized credit
card number that's already available in
technologies like samsung pay and Apple
pay it's going to be in this too and it
will work at contactless payment
terminals will also launch automatically
as opposed to having to launch an app so
that's new it will work with fingerprint
sensor technology but in Android M in
the summer until then it will work with
Android KitKat and higher you have to
use a password so use Android pay it's
pretty simple you just tap right here
and and lo and behold it goes through
we're also work with loyalty programs so
that's supported with coca-cola it may
be supported with other loyalty programs
that's something we haven't heard about
in other tokenized payment systems yet
android pay will also work with an app
so you could use it to order food order
a car service and that little android
pay button pops up and you can use it to
buy things with the same Android egg
handle so that's Android pay keep an eye
out for it when it debuts later this
summer just keep in mind to use
contactless payment you're going to need
a phone with NFC I'm here google i/o
