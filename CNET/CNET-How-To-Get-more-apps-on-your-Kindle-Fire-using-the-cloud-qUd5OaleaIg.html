on the Amazon Appstore for your Kindle
Fire tablet here's a little scheme I
stumbled upon a while back I'm Maya's
actor and today I'm going to show you
how to sideload an app to a Kindle Fire
without a computer to do this you're
gonna need your fire and another Android
device it could be your phone or another
tablet we've got one handy you'll also
need to have a Dropbox account set up on
both the fire and the non fire device
install ES File Explorer on your
non-fire device you'll need to install
apk extractor apk extractor will let you
take apps you have on your device and
export them an apk is an Android
application package file that would mean
if you can install an app on this device
you should be able to export it and
bring it over to your fire now I wanted
to bring the Logitech Harmony app to the
Kindle Fire so we can use it as my
remote my home theater and it's not
available on the Amazon App Store so
it's the perfect candidate for this open
up apk extractor and find the app you
want to export
there's the Harmony app select it and
you'll see the app quickly exports to
the apk extractor folder now that the
apk is on your phone now what open up ES
File Explorer and connect your Dropbox
account by clicking network then cloud
then select Dropbox now press back a few
times on your phone to find the APK it's
in the folder marked APK extractor open
that up and you'll see the app long
press the file and you'll see a new menu
on the bottom of the screen copy the APK
now go back to your dropbox and paste
the file where you want i'm going to
paste this into my apps folder you're
done with your phone so let's move on to
your Kindle on your Kindle Fire you'll
go into your settings click applications
allow apps from unknown sources by
hitting the toggle button this will
allow you to install the apk you
exported open up ES File Explorer and
connect it to your Dropbox the same way
you did on your other device navigate to
the harmony apk and open the file your
Kindle will ask you if you want to
install this application so
click install and there we have the app
running on a Kindle Fire that's just one
way you can sideload apps that the
Kindle Fire there's lots of different
methods out there for more tips and
