series made from flowers and jellyfish
also a really really freaking creepy CG
animation and forget BR how about a
crazy projected holo-pyramid video game
console saying so confused tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens on the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily I'm Ashley
scattered Jamie's always kale anonymous
you're watching the best geek talk show
in the known universe um you know it's
our 200th episode we made it okay yeah I
knew it was our 200 episode and but I
realized it really really really really
really late like right before I walked
in the door so at the last minute I got
you I got you something you got me gift
yeah I got you something forget me I got
you this the gift of Snickers it's it's
a Snickers bar from the vending machine
out in the lobby but there's a then I
use tape to make a little bow oh it's
adorable God 200th episode I thought
long about the you know what I also
thought really long and hard about this
and I got you something too and it just
it skittles from the vending machine ah
 I'll trade you let's talk about it
after the show yeah I got skills so
anyway 200th episode 200 no it's not
that many episodes Sunday yeah anyway ok
cool so enough enough with our stupid
candy joke take the headlights
all right i'll trade you it's killed
i'll trade you you don't know anything
about me I got it because it was
symbolic of the rainbow of magic that
you bring to the show every day do you
think I'm gay no I mean I'm not but I do
think that I see so many different
facets of kill anonymous that it would
it's like a rainbow of personalities you
didn't say no not anyone i don't know
it's our first story creepy cg let's
let's take a look let's just get right
into it USC researchers are hoping to
fix the issue of uncanny valley and one
of the problems is is that you know
facial skin doesn't really move the way
that our facial skin moves but they're
trying to fix that with what they are
calling dynamic micro geometry we're
going to get a little technical here
guys so here's a current you excited
about this this is okay you're gonna
freak out when you see the actual video
so um one of the things that happens
when we have cg faces is this so Logan
let's take my take my camera so when the
face stretches it your pores and stuff
squish along with it okay and like when
you wrinkle your nose and stuff like
your skin squishes and stretches and you
get these little tiny wrinkles and pores
change shape so sometimes they might
look round and sometimes they might have
vertical ridges and things like that so
they have decided that they are going to
find a way to sort of show those really
tiny micro imperfections and things like
pores in the face in CG rendering so
that's what they're doing they're doing
the scan they are doing something a deep
scan that gets really really really
tight on the skin okay so they these are
dynamic displacement maps so they they
have texture map this so notice how it
changes like you can see it goes
vertical and then it squishes into a
different shape right and it looks like
skin that's a recorded skin patch
sequence so they've made it like skin
now using this scan they make this
special texture map that we were just
looking at they add it as a layer to a
render it's like three layers in a
render for CG
and the map will help adjust CG skin by
considering how the little tiny small
details from that texture map change
when the face is manipulated a whether
through a motion or through other means
getting punched things like that so they
showed this as a full render they also
show this as a real-time technique
meaning that things like virtual
assistants could utilize this technology
with the right video cards so producer
Logan do we have the video of the ball
stretching and then the really scary
face because I think that's like the
best part the best way to sort of show
exactly what this kind of technology is
so on the right you have static micro
geometry you can see it doesn't really
look like the balls being torqued but
when you look at the one on the left it
looks like it's being torqued right so
now same thing this is actual rendered
this rendered skin they're moving it
around and manipulating it looks real
yeah looks really real okay are you
ready for the face the face is the
scariest because there's no eyes in it
that's a CG rendered face which is
pretty impressive and there you there
are little tiny wrinkles pores and you
can see where see that's where the
tension is and that's where the texture
map changes to help give a more
realistic look so that's what they're
doing at USC that's what the researchers
are doing I know it's like really
complicated as a lot of algorithms
involved the way they're scanning stuff
but yeah you see all those little tiny
wrinkles they change as the face changes
its shape so this is with the action the
new layer dynamic micro geometry that's
what the new layer so you can see all
those little little little little tiny
pores and little imperfections in the
skin pretty impressive that's incredible
pretty impressive also super creepy
using a face without any eyes guys and I
think they should call up Disney
research and get those cgi's that we
talked about a couple months ago have
ship them over in a file just get it
email them over guys I get it the eyes
are their own hurdle right coming and
making it that look of course scary I
didn't want to distract but apparently
it just sucks you right in any way
exactly so yeah super creepy but also
pretty amazing the things that they're
doing over there
and like I said they have they did it in
pre-rendered stuff and they also did
live like renderings so this is
something that can be used both in
pre-rendered things like movies
cinematics things with that but also
live stuff like virtual assistant
technology so really cool really really
cool very cool yeah tell me so check
this out all right about a there's all
this VR and AR stuff happening
everywhere that's true but nobody's
paying attention to holographic deck
technology that's because what except
for Sherlock so basically this is a
Kickstarter that don't bring up Stu soon
okay um so this is basically a
Kickstarter for a holographic deck kind
of like gaming experience system that
isn't just like a one sided projection
it's a projection you can look at from
any single place you want to be around
this thing is so cool-looking so it's
basically a glass pyramid it happens for
for projectors projecting light on in
different directions on different walls
they're in it's just a kickstart they
want to make the amazing they didn't
really like gone into like the games and
stuff but basically through the video
you can see the stuff that they're
trying to do that looks so fun yeah
there's there you saw that they had a
fireplace looks like you can like watch
a cartoon the 3d cartoon you can play
games on it it's basically just like a
fun entertainment system so it what have
you want on one of these well first of
all again I said it was a Kickstarter to
stop being a jerk and listen so it's a
Kickstarter right now but it's a if you
want to get it it's about 450 for the
home edition okay and then there's a pro
edition now the pro edition is larger
and has speakers on board and has a
sensor to dim the display and I home
additions for chumps so there you go uh
so proud so I'm sorry it was a
difference between 450 and 5 30 for the
pro edition oh that's not bad at all I
mean I was expecting this to be like a
thousand dollars at least yeah it's
actually not that bad but I mean it was
see what they're gonna do with it they
want to they want to have unity 5 an
unreal work on this thing oh my god you
create some really impressive visuals we
know that like for instance batman
arkham knight since that's on my mind
yeah is created unreal so you could
that sort of essentially that level of
uh visuals I could even imagine people
cool so cause everyone's thinking in the
world of augmented reality adding things
and then you're thinking of VR out you
know in getting immersed but what have
you had your own small contained world
it'd be interesting to see what they
could accomplish oh man that is amazing
it's a holiday Hollis yeah i was about
to get that Hollis I'm gonna look it up
on Kickstarter and spent a couple a
couple of monies drops in 1024 50 so
it's about the same price as your xbox
one but then this one doesn't play halo
but it's a giant glass pyramid that
shows you holograms 3d hologram show off
you get this I want that just said I
don't even know what I do that I love
that picture I love you happy excited
family pictures it's game night oh yeah
you put of course you'd buy this you
know for your kids to play with in their
little house 10 in the 90s in the arcade
and let's see if if anybody remembers
this there was an arcade game I remember
I know exactly what I was there a Cade
game it cost like a dollar and back then
it was a lot of expensive yeah and it
was basically a quick time event type
thing and you were like a cowboy no you
you time-traveled but are you looking at
up so you can find it I know exactly
what it is and it was like was this big
giant display and then it like
projecting in a small area but uh do you
think it did you find it yeah it's
called time traveler is an FM BFMV game
oh um and yeah I was your time traveler
this is the machine right here it's
piano hold on I got it it's like you
know cuz oh my god you're so confounded
oh my God look at this thing so
basically that that would be projected
in front of you as you can see it's it's
still only two dimensions but they and
they layer the dimensions so that it
looks 3d okay can we also just get a
sequel to it can we go to reboot going
can we get a reboot for this game this
thing was ridiculous I was personally
looking to get burned up we got burned
up by a pterodactyl my mama gave five
dollars and I'd go in there and I'd
spend it all in like two minutes oh my
gosh to go and you died so fast if i
recall correctly you died like it was so
easy to die there's not it's not so
there you go not good the future is now
finally here but in 90
we're bringing it back you show them the
size of the console it was humongous
lodo the best yeah we're going to really
slow it down I'll throw up a picture and
post it will show you the size of it
okay lastly we got to talk about this
necklace I'll make it quick just because
just because I can and actually it's
pretty simple so there are there's this
team of MIT grads who started this
company called nervous system which is
actually a really awesome website where
you can buy 3d printed stuff like house
stuff and jewelry and everything and
they developed this series of algorithms
based on how flowers bloom to grow in 3d
modeling software their own jewelry like
so they said oh we really love how flat
these specific flowers bloom and we also
really love jellyfish arms so we want to
sort of make jewelry based on the
movements of that so they created an
algorithm and they created jewelry and
so what they did was they let the
software grow itself like so like they
said okay just do it and it's called
flora form which is what you're seeing
right now and they were like I said
inspired by jellyfish arms and flowers
there are three different types of
design they have one inspired by
jellyfish arms one inspired by flowers
and the one inspired by both so they
integrated both into into a 3d print so
yeah this is how like this is how they
end up in a in an actual like modeling
software they let it kind of grow itself
which is kind of cool and then and then
print them out there's 24 pieces you can
buy they range anywhere from I think
like $35 to 375 dollars some of them are
made of like silver like solid silver
you can get like shapes like pendants
and big necklaces and stuff but it's a
pretty cool line of jewelry and I
actually was thinking I might buy one
like I kind of want to maybe get like
one of the lesser expensive pieces and
see how how it is that's that's really
cool but it's pretty rad and I just I
really like the sort of use of you know
3d printing algorithm technology and
also nature like throwing that all kind
of in together and making these like
beautiful pieces of jewelry that people
can enjoy um which is just so cool so
there that's that's how it works very
cool that's ami yeah nervous system is
the website if you want to go check out
there it's very creepy jewelry's I'm
gonna drop this I've almost dropped this
like so many times a day and you in the
lad 02 I know foreshadowing I'm with a
beautiful pieces of your through on her
like this one day it's just gonna fall
down alright guys we're gonna take a
quick break we will be right back with a
very special segment kale got to go to a
very awesome place and check out why we
did snatchin at the beginning of the
episode we really cool thing I got to go
to a really cool place and now you're
finding out about it late you're
probably over my candy popcorn in the
kitchen get out of there okay now you're
back and on that do this I'll not know
we're taking a break we'll be right back
welcome back to the show everybody we've
returned and as we mentioned with a very
special segment kale got to do something
honestly pretty cool I do i do you want
intro it or do you want me to no I got
it all right uh so our friends at CBS
CBS is our parent company our friends at
CBS have a show coming out this week I
think tomorrow called zoo and there was
actually a lot of the jim henson
Creature Shop was involved in making
some of the some of the animatronic
remains for the animals in that show and
so I got invited to go to the Henson
Creature Shop here new work out like
three four times a week oh hey guys it's
kale from tomorrow daily and today we
are at the Henson Creature Shop look
we've all secretly wanted to come here
and today we're going to check out a
really cool puppet it was inspired by
the show zoo which is coming out soon on
CBS but we're also going to look at well
pretty much everything I'm super excited
and I really want to hang out with this
baby right here it's just uh baby so
this is John Criswell thank you for
showing us a little bit around today I
mean what's your official title here I'm
the animatronics supervisor so I take
care of all of the workings and goings
underneath that we have assume
animatronics form sooo right the
upcoming TV show right okay so let's
let's tackle this thing I mean it's not
as easy as going down to your local
costume shop and popping on a gorilla
costume anymore people have to be
convinced performer that we're using
they study you know guerilla movement
obviously we have I think it's a really
impressive thing here which is the the
animatronic head you said that this
wasn't heavy ya know this is under 4
pounds it's got about 12 motors in it so
this is wireless you're not you're not
actually hooked up per se right to it
no it is it is all wireless all right
let's see let's see mad so this would be
his that's probably is that's that's my
dream man okay what about is there a
happy you got a happy gorilla oh yay
imma lottery he's kind of space
abilities he's not happy about that
lottery win no that's right you can get
the big one oh you found a banana mmm
hey baby how are you doing now this is
another one of those cheats because we
go from these arms which are longer than
human arms to these short arms with the
performer inside am i able to try one of
these on lastly you alright so this is
what it's like to have hair yah hurts
yeah I have very uncaring woman arms so
maybe we should have spent the whole
suit on you Luke atender you know
actually Harry you can have my cell
phone real quick I want to see what it
look like if I was texting with gorilla
hands twitter update checking out the
Hanson studio no big deal right now you
want to get it off but no I'm gonna hang
out with like something out um let me
come around cuz I'll grab the other ones
the under suit and you get get bottoms
ok that's the butt alright yet and just
like on the head in the hands you have a
whole suit of fur and if you look in
there you can see how we've kind of
ventilated it it's a favorite one though
yeah you're gonna take that home just
try me you know I pulled you over sir
you have a gorilla arm
alright John well thank you so much for
showing us around you're welcome alright
have fun with that hand I will all right
dominant I'm actually gonna wander
around is that cool like yeah ok cool
he's dude yeah help yourself good please
anyway ok that looked amazing something
I've always wanted to do like I said at
the beginning of the piece the people
that are really nice very interesting I
went in-depth talking to them about like
some of their past history they worked
on the show dinosaurs you remember that
was on ABC there's a lot of history
throughout their you're just gonna have
to like pause and see if you can see
stuff in the background that's that's
kind of the way I made the piece when I
was like producer Logan we're gonna have
to make sure at there's stuff in the
background all the time so so there you
go so if you want to catch do it's going
to be on tomorrow so that's tuesday at
nine Eastern if you're CBL on CBS so
there you go is really cool so thanks so
thanks to yeah thanks to CBS and also to
the Henson creature shop for letting us
visit cuz that was pretty rad just fun
monkeying around with them yet monkeying
around I see what you did there okay I
didn't because a gorilla is not a monkey
alright fair enough let's talk about
user feedback it seems so upset okay so
fair warning guys like we had to kind of
do some schedule shifting so we didn't
have time to get your user feedback on
last week's show which will read
tomorrow but I wanted to talk about two
emails that we got about remember the
algae furniture from last week oh yeah
weird algae furniture that you eat and
you said you'd be totally into it will
get guess who agrees with you pin our
good buddy no pin agrees with you the
house says hello ashlyn kill yes refresh
raw algae a slimy putra green and just
not appetizing however raw beet is slimy
pinkish pus yellow and just not
appetizing yet most of us find prepared
meat to be very palatable yeah put that
deep fry that sludge and you'll be good
to go yeah well he mentions he also
mentions that once you process algae
into bleached white powder you can
actually put it into pretty much
anything veggie burgers milk algae dairy
free ice cream
I'm when you're taking away like all of
the new trick you you're making it
unhealthy again you're on your boobs
what he pees on anything and it's gonna
taste great that's what I would eat it
if I'd had some cheese melted cheese
algae please they'll need a B yeah so he
said that it would be a great idea it's
missing only one thing an appliance for
processing that that green goop into a
process powder that you could then make
other things with which i think is a
good idea i remember that creepy
crawlers thing yes so what if we just
did that you put it in the shape of
different things so like you're like
easy bake oven but like with kids and
stuff like i like that so much edge eat
algae dads well gummy worms your dad and
her mom watching like a dude algae eat
it if it's in the shape of a gummy bear
i would eat it and then also dave abston
wrote in to us and send in some art he
sent in a robot a while ago but he said
hi kids been trying to do more drawing
in my spare time haha here's a couple of
robot scale might like if anyone wants
to start a Kickstarter to build these
just cut me in where's the picture yeah
they are yeah baby yeah robot bartender
oh my God look at the robot cat I love
Rob okay just sleeps Robo meow hey
sleeps and now he's a fantastic great
job Dave yeah super fun so um Dave
abston if you want to go check out his
way to that robot has alcohol my god has
lots of wine per second that's my kind
of robot yeah that's a robot I want to
be friends with get a glass of wine
hanging out chitchat watching veep you
know how it is wait i thought the robot
watch beep with you yeah robots gonna
watch beep with me i'll be great wasn't
that your yes my into it still into it
still watching still catching out again
another through line for Ashley I know
it's terrible um okay we have one last
piece user feedback and it's always our
phone target for the day
Matt road in took this picture with his
iphone 5s so nice here's my photo I took
with my trusty iphone 5s this is
captured in my backyard a couple of
weeks ago anyways I hope you like it uh
is your backyard a magical fairy garden
mat because that's what it looks like to
me all those kinds of flowers only show
up in like secret fairy gardens right
what kind of phone was it iphone 5s it's
great picture so sharp always really
good in broad daylight though um and it
looks like it's a little shaded there so
that's like perfect photo taking
conditions um yeah really good picture
Matt thanks oh thanks for making us all
look bad appreciate that if you guys
want to send in your photogra feet
tomorrow Tina's calm show ideas 2 story
ideas and if you want to find us online
work tomorrow d li but mainly on twitter
and if you got your own twitter and
that's what she said it wasn't it that's
what she said joke but you let into it
ok fair enough ah lowing up at kalyan
onimous is my accountant ash at Ashley's
gala if you want to follow her crazy
antics well I'm gonna make you an
official trade here take the snickers
yes I bought myself my own gift and I
bought myself my own skittles and I'll
not know we will be back tomorrow with a
brand-new docket of weird wonderful
science facts in science fiction but
until that big Inhumans will see you
guys next time fine
sir
