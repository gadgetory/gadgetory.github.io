welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
now apple's latest ipad and imac
announcements from it's Cupertino
headquarters our solid upgrades to the
product lineup in I'm sure there will be
plenty of you making some upgrades so
let's get to it now first up the iPads
and the ipad air 2 specifically was
really one of the highlights of the
event Apple is thin it to win it and
brings its slimmest ipad ever it's so
slim that you could stack two of these
things on top of each other and it would
still be thinner than the original iPad
thinning it finally brings touch ID a
custom a 8x processor an m8 motion
coprocessor which seems a little odd
since I won't be running around with my
iPad anytime soon and an anti-reflective
coating now I'm honestly a little torn
about this next feature but the ipad air
2 gets an improved 8 megapixel camera ah
you know they're only encouraging people
to continue to take even more pictures
with their ipads like this guy adding
panorama mode a burst mode time lapse
and slow motion so you all get ready to
see even more people like this and more
of these mirror iPad selfies thanks
Apple now if you really want to be
innovative listen remove the camera so I
can actually see the concert I paid to
go see now that's thinspiration alright
the ipad air 2 starts at four
ninety-nine and brings improvements
across the board but apples biggest
challenge is getting people to buy one
after recent reports show fifty percent
of iPad users are still on their first
or second gen ipad and we know people
really don't upgrade them nearly as
often as they upgrade a smartphone now
the biggest iPad disappointment well
it's the iPad Mini 3 which gets touch ID
but it keeps the same camera the same
screen and even the same a7 processor
but it comes in gold now the mini three
starts at 399 but it was truly the most
disappointing announcement now
pre-orders start on the 17 for iPads and
star
shipping on the 24 all right on to the
max and the imac with its 27 inch retina
5k display with clearly the other
highlight with the highest resolution
screen we've seen from Apple four times
the pixels a quad-core intel core
processor up to 4 gigahertz an advanced
fusion drive and five millimeters at its
thinnest point that's inspiring the imac
looks gorgeous but starting at 24 99 and
the declining interest in desktops
versus laptops doesn't make this a
must-have anymore but a great
improvement now the retina imac is ready
to ship in one two three days and let's
not forget about the Mac Mini 2 years
waiting for an update and it now gets
updated Intel Core dual-core processors
Thunderbolt 2 and USB 3 and starts at
four ninety-nine a solid update but
again nothing flashy here all right on
the software side OS 10 go 70 is
available to download now for the price
of free and I think you're all gonna
really love it it doesn't take away any
features but brings a real cleaner and
refined look and feel while adding some
nice stuff like continuity improve
notifications and search oh and one
thing that trashcan dough and iOS 8.1
free update arrives Monday in time for
the official Rella of Apple pay on that
Monday so get on it so you can use your
phone like your wallet now i'm debating
between going to jamba juice first or
getting a juicy big mac with those
mickeyd fries and chicken nuggets and a
mcflurry but i need to be careful
because it all goes to my butt alright
so there you have it like i said really
a solid update across the board from
apple for ipads and macs now there's
nothing that really stands out as a must
buy for me right now but there's lots of
great stuff if you're in the market to
upgrade and just think in 2015 we have
let's see the rumored ipad pro macbook
air with retina display a new apple TV
and yeah that Apple watch are all
awaiting us next year and yes I chose
not to throw any bad apples this week
because a lot of you guys get your
feelings hurt when I do so I decided to
be nice today alright that's going to do
it for this week's show you can email me
at the apple byte at cnet com or tweet
me at brian Tong i'll be going on
vacation next week but don't worry stick
because uh we have a little something
some before you lined up next time and
apple just for future reference after
watching this keynote leave the skits to
us alright thanks so much for watching
it will catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
