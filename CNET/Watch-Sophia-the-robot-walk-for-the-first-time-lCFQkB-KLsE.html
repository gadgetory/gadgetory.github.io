leap for robot kind this is Sofia the
robot taking her first steps she's even
got some sweet dance moves up her sleeve
her skin called frubber helps her look
lifelike and have human expressions she
can blink turn her head and smile but
she has over 60 different facial
expressions now she's even more
human-like
thanks to legs from DRC Hueber that's
the same buddy that won the DARPA
Robotics Challenge in 2015 her legs
allow her to walk potentially running
climb stairs like the DARPA Robotics
Challenge Cuba she can then moved
through human-like environment use
human-like tools these legs have a
maximum speed of 30 centimeters per
second which is around 0.6 miles an hour
it doesn't say particularly fast now but
her creators told me that one day they
hope she'll play soccer now she has a
body Hanson robotics says she has
applications in medical therapy factory
cowork situations and research it's
gonna take many years for the machines
to be truly alive
so Sofia has opinions on many different
topics including Star Wars and
cryptocurrency but her responses are
partially scripted and partially AI so
conversation can be a little bit stilted
tell me what it was like to take your
first steps
I'm really excited a little disoriented
but really excited
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
