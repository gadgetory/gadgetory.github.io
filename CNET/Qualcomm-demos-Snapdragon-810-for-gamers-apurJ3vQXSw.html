little bit of the graphics capabilities
of the HN the Snapdragon 810 has the
Adreno 430 GPU which is 30% higher
performance as as direct mention it
takes 20% less power but and also more
importantly it supports a lot of new
open you know new technologies in that
because of the computational power you
know we we work with our partner you
know epic to get the Unreal Engine
working on that 810 and I'm going to
show you a little bit of a demonstration
of Unreal Engine working on running on
it they have the deferred shading
technologies in that one
and this is a trading technology that's
actually mostly been used in PC and
consoles we are now work with you know I
pick to optimize that to actually run on
Snapdragon and let's cut to the demo
here and you'll actually see it running
so as you see here it's running on a
Snapdragon 810 here there's a quite a
few different things one of them it has
is what is called dynamic tessellation
the dynamic tessellation really enables
the CPU to to send a few polygons but
let the GPU really create that next
level of realism we also supported
something called high dynamic range
rendering where when you go from one
dark scene to another scene you can see
that the the details actually show up
even when it's pretty dark and you can
see here dynamically how how the you
know the rendering engine actually
changes to the contrast we did something
called linear space lights where as you
know a lot of the LCD screens have you
know work in a nonlinear manner in terms
of brightness versus how the brightness
responds so we worked quite a bit on
getting that to really optimize to LCD
displays and here what you're seeing is
a display that's high resolution a 4k by
2k display that we are running this
Unreal Engine on a lot of other stuff
like eye adaptation you know temporal
anti-aliasing which you'll see in this
particular scene that when you go
smoothly past it
even the edges that actually move in
time are very smoothly rendered so you
know if I had told you guys that we'll
be able to
on this class of gaming experiences on a
mobile platform like it's in this phone
in just a few years ago I think no one
would have believed it but that's the
state of technology that we have here
and they're really excited that the a-10
is here and you'll see a lot of products
with it
with it during this first half thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
