refinements including this gorgeous rose
gold finish we've added Matt chamfered
edges and an inset stainless steel Apple
logo just like the iphone 6s but it's on
the inside where the iphone SE really
shines it's got advanced technologies
that make this the most powerful 4-inch
phone ever so at the heart of the iphone
SE of course is our chips are amazing
Apple a 9 ship with its embedded m9
motion coprocessor and of course people
love taking photos with their iphones
more than any other phone or camera so
we wanted to give it our most advanced
camera system so we've given it our
incredible 12 megapixel iSight camera
with focus pixels and true tone flash it
can even capture 4k video and just like
the iphone success you can edit up to
two simultaneous streams of 4k video
with iMovie right on the iPhone se an
entirely new iPad pro based around a 9.7
inch retina display and it weighs less
than 1 pound we call it a true tone
display a true tone display measures the
color temperature of ambient light and
adjust this display to match it has two
new for channel ambient light sensors
that measure both brightness in color
temperature and it adds some new
innovations as well as improvements to a
wide range of apps I'd like to share
some of the highlights with you let's
start with night shift so studies have
shown that exposure to blue light in the
evening can actually make it harder for
you to fall asleep at night so night
ship automatically shifts the colors of
the display to the warmer end of the
spectrum which may help you sleep better
at night so how does that work well when
it's enabled night shift uses your iOS
devices clock as well as its geolocation
to know when it's sunset in your
location and then it automatically
shifts the color of that display to the
warmer end of the spectrum which reduces
the blue light which may help you sleep
better our new woven nylon band
our new woven nylon band features a
unique four layer construction it comes
in a variety of vibrant colors we think
it's going to be incredibly popular at
the heart of the Apple TV experience is
Siri with Siri you can just ask for
something great to watch like show me
movies with Kevin Hart and there it is
pick your favorite in looking for a
movie or TV show series searches the
popular app so you don't have to we've
added some great content app for Siri to
surge we've got more coming and we'll
keep adding more over time now we've got
some other great features coming to
apple TV like folders now you can
organize your apps on your home screen
just like you want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
