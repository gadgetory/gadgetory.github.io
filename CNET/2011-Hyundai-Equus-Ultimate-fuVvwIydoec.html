it's badge is a bird maybe that's
Hyundai's way of flipping the bird at
the horse's ass who drives this car and
then still buys an s-class let's drive
the 2011 Hyundai Equus and check the
tech Honda and Toyota launched new
divisions and new brands when they went
upscale Hyundai chooses not to bill the
Equus says Hyundai virtually nowhere and
wears mostly unique badging as if they
know they should have launched a new
brain but at the end of the day the
company seems to think it stands for one
thing value from the accent to the
Sonata to this guy now walking around
this car I see just about every other
car in the world reflected in it up here
in the front I'm getting a lexus LS
smashed up with Altima in I hate
polished wheels they have never looked
worse than on this car overall though
the lines are kind of massive and
impressive and take it back here and
then there's this little kick up that
reminds me of a Dodge Charger rather
unpleasantly and the taillights keep
flicking me back and forth between BMW
7-series and Infiniti M overall though
the package is one of stately big
presence which is what you've got to do
in a car that aims at this audience now
what you're going to see in this car
over and over is Hyundai is playing the
greatest hits of car tech they're not
going to the far edge with anything you
can get more cutting-edge kind of out
there kind of unproven technology in
their pricey or competitors but the core
stuff is all here at a shockingly low
price first of all navigation on that
big 8 inch screen that is standard the
map is good it's not the best in the
business I'm not going to get a bunch of
satellite video views on it but I do
have live traffic I've got a very clear
looking screen it's not touch use a
controller down here same thing goes for
telephony I've got Bluetooth phone on
this guy I've got phonebook connectivity
but I don't have a 2 DP bluetooth
streaming I don't have a hard drive I
can rip music to but I've got a six-disc
C
changer that also plays DVD again
standard I've got 7.1 surround in this
vehicle but not a lot of fancy
processing beyond that I've got 17
speakers around the cabin but no audio
options whatsoever so they're saving
cost again by having a single audio
system on this car no complicated line
changes that they've got to make our
dual vendors that they've got to stock
parts from in here stock again USB
auxiliary and iPod connector depending
on this little proprietary cable you
might use on the radio side I've got
am/fm and HD radio plus XM radio again
that's all standard on both trim levels
of this car now the stuff you wouldn't
expect to get standard I've got a
forward-looking anti-collision system on
this car that's I believe optional on
all their competitors
I have adaptive cruise control and I've
got lane departure warning this button
right back here standard on both trim
levels very few cars offer that I've got
a camera that looks in the back that has
two different views looking out or
looking down now because our cars got
the ultimate package there are a few
options on this guy first of all this
button here for the forward-looking
camera it gives you a wide-angle view
out the front at low speeds only you
can't sit here and stare at this thing
and drive by it it goes off at like I
don't know five miles an hour
but it lets you nibble into a parking
space forward the same way the reverse
camera lets you do it backwards and the
rest of the goodies are in the back now
if you've ever wanted to ride in a
Maybach but came to your senses and
realize you'll never have a Maybach this
is the nearest thing to it we have the
ultimate package as I mentioned so back
here is this crazy kind of first-class
airline seat deal I've got this console
here and if I push let's see this button
it moves the front seat forward all the
way let's hope no one's in it folds it
forward all the way and then it starts
to push my seat like this you know I'm
going forward and I'm reclining and I'm
also going to get my footrest to go up
the problem is unless you're about five
feet tall ow ow god this is like one of
those secret prisons at the CIA runs in
Romania this is actually a torture
chamber so it helps to be small if
you're going to do the recliner thing or
to be a pig and put your shoes on the
seat in front of you but if you do that
I'll shoot you Oh check this out in the
car
so I've got a wireless controller for
the massage functions on this guy yeah
no kidding the sensor for it is up there
on the back of the front seat the one
I'm using as an ottoman mode one and two
upper back and lower force speed in call
versus out call oh wait that's vibration
versus vibration speed kind of the same
thing oh and by the way also in this
center console is a refrigerator with
two little can holders in it and yes it
gets quite cold in there and finally
you've got your 8 inch LCD here that
pops up in the console and you have a
full array of all your media there and
your climate controls can all show up on
the display this is a nice way to ride
and again we're nowhere near a hundred
thousand dollars in this car ok in the
engine bay some pretty non hyundai stuff
you don't think of these guys doing big
v8s that's a big v8 4.6 liter v8 385
horsepower but just 333 foot-pounds of
torque that's a little on the light side
we'll get to that when we get on the
road in a minute 0-60 happens in 6.7
seconds which is fine sprightly but not
really fast MPG is 16 city 24 highway
and all the power goes through one
direction and one gearbox rear wheel
drive only no all-wheel drive available
and it's a 6-speed automatic which is
relatively shall we say basic by today's
standards but it does the job ok and
it's a ZF gearbox from Germany and they
tell you that in every piece of
marketing materials they got
so the real question no one that matters
is does this car stack up as a real
high-end luxury sedan or is it just kind
of putting the trappings together well
first thing you notice is its bank vault
quiet almost too quiet I was surprised
how much tire noise I picked up all the
time except on the perfect surfaces out
there which there are very few in
California you do want the sport button
down to get the best response otherwise
it's a little bit sluggish that's that
low torque number I mentioned you need
to ring the most out of it I found
shifting it wasn't very interesting I
don't know not the kind of car I want a
shift to be honest a couple things also
we're a little bit off the the steering
tries too hard to stay on center that
makes big broad sweeping roads kind of
tedious but I'll say this I never missed
the other one or two gears this
transmission could have a lot of folks
will turn their nose up at a six-speed
but I don't know seemed fine to me I
didn't find the car was making huge
leaps between cogs that made the things
seem like it was in elegant and the most
important thing is the car feels like it
has presence when you're driving it it
feels it feels heavy without feeling
ponderous there's a big difference
luxury tends to equate with a car that
feels like it's got a lot of placed
presence in this car does that well
without being a chore to drive oh did I
remind you this is the car that comes
with an iPad and on it is the Equus app
which includes the owner's manual fully
electronic and interactive a quick
reference guide Thank You dealer locator
service scheduler you can build in price
a necklace in case you want to buy
another one I guess or look at the
Hyundai Gallery just in case you want to
love their cars so much all this an
effort to differentiate this guy from
the other high-dollar German and
Japanese luxo barges oh it really
differentiates it is the price the basic
and it's not basic at all Equus is going
to be fifty eight nine your only option
is sixty-five hundred bucks for the
ultimate package that gets you all the
bells and whistles in the backseat plus
the forward-looking camera and the power
trunk lid you can load this guy to the
gills and it makes the other guys look
like what are they thinking at their
price
