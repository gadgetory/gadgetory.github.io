also a Verizon exclusive but there's
another phone just like it that's out
there with t-mobile
I'm Scott Stein and I'm talking about
the Sony Xperia z3 V that's a mouthful
to pronounce and there's another phone
out there that's pretty much just like
it the Sony Xperia z3 you've been
following these phones internationally
you know about this this has been out
for a while and it's finally out in the
US with t-mobile now both of these
phones under the hood are pretty much
the same they both have 5.2 inch
displays 1080p really nice looking
screens not quad HD which is even higher
resolution but you're not going to
notice the difference for movies in
everyday use and it has a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor which is fast
but there are faster ones out there like
the Snapdragon 805 that's in the Google
Nexus 6 the Xperia z3 v also has three
gigs of ram and it has 32 gigabytes of
storage you can expand that up to 128
gigs with a microSD card it has a twenty
point seven megapixel camera the same as
the z3 and that sounds great actually to
use all of its special photo processing
modes it's a little down at 8 megapixels
but it can shoot 4k video which is
fantastic and these can be submerged 1.5
meters for 30 minutes not saltwater
though the only other difference between
these phones is really in terms of how
they charge this uses qi wireless
charging so you can put it on a mat this
one doesn't this has a slightly larger
battery capacity but it actually
performed a little worse on our battery
test than this but you're looking at
about 11 hours so it's enough for a full
day of use and then some this is a
Verizon exclusive so if you're shopping
for a z3 you want that this is your
option it's $1.99 under contract they're
really pretty much the same phone so
know that you're getting a fantastic
SPECT phone here that's a little bit
uglier if you're going with the verizon
model but hey if you're stuck on
contract that may be your only option
and they mentioned the one best feature
of this that's yet to come which is that
both of these can stream PlayStation 4
games that feature will be unlocked soon
and it works a lot like you would get on
your PlayStation Vita there's even a
bracket that will hold these in with
your DualShock 4 controller a nice perk
the Sony Xperia z3 V is a really good
Verizon phone but don't forget there are
other great Android phones out there and
the Droid turbo
just launched as well so the weather
this is as good as all the rest remains
to be seen
I'm Scott's time with a look at the Sony
Xperia z3 V Verizon exclusive in the US</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
