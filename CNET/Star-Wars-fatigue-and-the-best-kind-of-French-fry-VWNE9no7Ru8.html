tech mine was my Apple - the Sega IR

had like phonebook memos you could play
games on it and I did none of that on it
I don't even know where it went where is
the worst place you would go if it meant
you didn't have to go to the beach
Mordor are you going to get a Nintendo
lab oh for your kid and is it really
going to be for your kid my almost three
year old is probably still too young for
it it doesn't really look like something
I would personally enjoy but I think
it's a good idea I'm gonna check it out
when it comes out hey Jeff wondering if
you could tell me your favorite Bruce
Willis Chris Tucker movie it's the fifth
element at Sur 5,000 if you could have a
podcast with anyone who would it be with
what would you talk about I would go and
get Carl Sagan back from the dead and I
would have a podcast with him called
Daniel Jones asks what's the worst video
game you've ever played a bunch but if
you come to mind Resident Evil 6
beef from a couple years ago that wasn't
very good and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5
they just recently did that if you
played it you know that is not a
skateboarding game that is a nightmare
who's the best live band you've ever
seen against me what is your advice for
someone who needs to buy a new gaming PC
sooner than later
my current rig is over six years old
just wait every asshole on the planet
has bought a GPU so they can mind
Bitcoin and now they're all finding out
that it's going
completely worthless endeavor graphic
cards are gonna be cheap in like six to
12 months so just wait is it okay if
your son hates hockey but love surfing
of course it's okay I don't understand
how he would just pick up surfing but if
he did that would be totally cool of
course are you afraid of self-driving
cars should I be afraid no I'm not
afraid of self-driving cars I'm afraid
of human idiots that get bored on
Instagram while they're driving a
freaking vehicle that can murder people
I'm afraid of those idiots not afraid of
a robot it's gonna pay attention to the
road and not fall asleep
fancy bird wants to know what's the best
Bon Jovi song it's wanted dead or alive
that's the best one everyone knows it at
luminous fire how important is it to
have an iPhone in commercial online
media can I get by with an Android phone
look who's doing it getting by with an
Android phone you're fine
Tim Kraus do you think we'll ever see a
4k resolution on sub 50 inch TVs yes and
they're already out there they're in
like the 40s though but you're right as
it gets smaller as the screen gets
smaller huge resolution doesn't really
make a lot of sense so yeah you're kind
of looking at a sweet spot above 50
inches for 4k resolution are you excited
for infinity war at PAB Haslip what
would it take for you to get into mobile
gaming and do you think big gaming
companies will ever release free-to-play
games I think they already do but at
this rate I'm personally probably never
going to get deep into mobile gaming
it's just not my bag I'm not into it
I need buttons which is why I really
like Nintendo switch that is my portable
console a trust Troxel what movie slash
show will you defend to the death in
spite of its flaws the Fifth Element
weekend at Bernie's Last Action Hero
Marco Sawyer what is the one piece of
tech you are most excited to get your
hands on this year does God of War count
because I really want to play that also
in all honesty the best tech that comes
out each year is stuff that we're not
anticipating so it's the stuff that
really pleasantly surprises us so I
can't answer your question at Brian L
Baxter outside of life events what would
you say has changed
most about yourself going from your 20s
to your 30s I absolutely take people's
feelings much more into consideration my
girlfriend and I are moving in together
for the first time into a new apartment
any advice yes give each other some
space it's okay if you don't hang out
24/7 and also always go to bed angry no
don't go to bed angry who would make you
starstruck and why I don't really get
that starstruck but it happened to me
twice once when I interviewed and met
Danny DeVito I just could not handle it
there was amazing footage of it where I
am sweating profusely it is a bad look
but it was he was just I loved him too
much I could not separate myself from it
and the second time it ever happened to
me I was in a restaurant and I looked
over to my left and who's there Michael
J Fox and I just couldn't handle the
fact that Marty McFly was sitting right
there with his wife having a beautiful
dinner I had to get up went to the
bathroom and I just looked at myself in
the mirror and I said you're not gonna
freak out that Michael J Fox is over
there you're not gonna freak out that
Michael J Fox is over there is the Vegas
golden nights being one of the best
teams good for hockey or any expansion
team in any sport for that matter it's
absolutely great for hockey you're
introducing a brand new market to the
best sport on earth so you're goddamn
right it's awesome go Knights go
hemispheres x-15 says and he's asked
this like three times we're sorry okay
we're sorry what's the best french fry
and why is it the crinkle fry it's not
the crinkle fry you know what else it's
not it's not the curly fry because
nobody wants that crap fry also it is
the steak fry the one that looks like a
snowboard that is the best french fry
