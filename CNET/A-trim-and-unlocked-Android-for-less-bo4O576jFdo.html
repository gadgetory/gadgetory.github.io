and right now we're taking a first look
at the blue life play unlocked
smartphone at 229 this device is very
affordable when stacked up against the
other unlocked handsets that you find on
the market for example sony cells has
xperia z flagship phone for a steep 570
dollars while Google Play editions for
the HTC One and Galaxy s4 run 599 and
six hundred and forty nine dollars
respectfully now that's a lot of money
the blue life play even costs seventy
dollars less than the venerable LG Nexus
4 so what does the blue life play bring
to the table first it comes equipped
with a large 4.7 inch 720p resolution
screen it's not as sharp as a displays
you'll find on the HTC One samsung
galaxy s4 or even LG Nexus 4 still it's
plenty bright and colorful the blue life
play also runs an almost stock version
of Android 4.2 jelly bean that means you
get many of the performance improvements
google has recently added to the OS
including the google now personal
assistant with it you can initiate voice
searches and command the phone to
perform various actions including
setting reminders in your calendar
google now will also automatically
present handy information in the form of
graphical cards based on your current
location time and your past search
history the blue life play also flaunts
a very slim and modern design its
chassis is just a hair thinner than the
galaxy s4 in fact the handset is
available in the striking electric blue
color you see here as well as purple
silver and yellow hues above the display
is a 2-megapixel front-facing camera and
below the screen are three capacitive
buttons for menu home and back the only
physical buttons on the phone or keys
for volume and power lining the devices
right side on the top edge are a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and micro USB
port on back is the 8 megapixel camera
and LED flash the back panel uses a soft
touch coating which makes the surface
easy to grip yet repels fingerprints and
smudges removing the back cover reveals
a removable battery microSD card slot
and not one but two sim card slots in
mini and standard size the blue life
plays camera has a lot of features in
extra shooting modes as well you will
find modes for HDR panorama lots of
color filters and admittedly goofy
frames to place around pictures
unfortunately the live play which
connects to GSM cellular networks
doesn't support 4G LTE for fast data
access I'm Brian Bennett for cnet.com

blue life play be sure to check back
