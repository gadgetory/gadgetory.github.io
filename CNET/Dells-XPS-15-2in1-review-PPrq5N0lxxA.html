overall excellent premium convertible
that is ready to help you create some
content play some games and enjoy some
media it is a convertible so you can use
it as a laptop of course but it's also a
tablet a big 15.6 inch pen enabled
tablet so you can write and draw on the
screen their support for tilt with Dells
new $99 premium active pen assuming your
software supports it at least the
beautiful 4k display and it's barely
there bezels is one of the best we've
seen
that's bright with very good color
performance out of the box it does suck
power though and we got just six hours
and 46 minutes in our tests inside is
the CPU GPU combo created by Intel and
rival AMD the pairing works well
offering up strong performance and is
enough to handle everything from office
work to content creation and even some
gaming if you don't mind dialing back
the settings expect to hear its fans
blowing when you're gaming though or
doing anything that needs to push its
processors it does get a little warm at
times but considering how thin it is it
is forgivable what you might not be able
to get past is the Maglev keyboard which
uses magnets to pop the keys back up
instead of rubber domes
it allowed Dell Dome make a thinner
keyboard and the keys have a satisfying
click enos to them but the keys are
nearly flush with the body and with very
little travel to the keys it's not
exactly comfortable for long typing
sessions
it's then this cost you legacy ports too
so you'll need to buy some adapters or
dock to handle peripherals since there's
nothing but USB C ports however at least
two of them are Thunderbolt 3 also
there's just a micro SD card slot so
anyone working with the full-size SD
card is out of luck so there are a
handful of drawbacks but there's much
more to like here if you've been looking
for a do-it-all slim sturdy two-in-one
with a big screen
