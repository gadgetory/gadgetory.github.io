welcome to the Apple by you know how we
do it it's all the good and bad inside
the world of Apple and I'm pretty sure
you're a little tired of hearing about
iphone news all the time I am too so
let's shift things over to the big cat
Snow Leopard now I got my hands on the
latest build and I have to say that on
first impressions this is definitely a
snappier OS even if it's an early build
so I'm going to bring in our special
correspondent to show off some of the
new features and a few things Apple
hasn't alright thanks Brian hey you guys
snow leopard will be available sometime
in September 2009 and the price to
upgrade just 29 bucks so we have a sneak
peek and let's just jump into this now
the first off the finder is a lot more
powerful with the ability to directly
preview files if you can see here I can
resize my file icons on the fly i also
have a PDF file and i can move page by
page without even opening it and for
movies i can play them directly from
their thumbnail as well and even well
I'm resizing the thumbnail now this is a
2 gigahertz core to do that I'm working
on so it just really shows you what snow
leopard can do even on an entry-level
macbook now if you're familiar with
expose they've now added a feature
called doc expose so what I do is if I
hold my bun on top of an app from the
doc all the specific windows for that
app will immediately snap to expose from
there I can now move around and press
the spacebar to preview individual items
as well now a lot of times we have so
much going on and a really cool feature
is the ability to find content and then
use doc expose to throw it into an
application so here i have an email and
i want to put a picture in it so I know
it's hanging out my desktop I'm gonna go
and find it then I'm gonna drag and hold
it on to the mail app you'll see doc
expose in action and I'll find that
email window that I want I'm gonna hold
the picture over it and then it brings
it to the front and now my picture is in
my email oh snaps just like that now
stacks has also been improved where you
can now navigate through a stack on your
dock and drill down into folders and the
files inside of those folders previously
once you open any
folder and stacks would throw it up into
the finder and the stacks interface
would go away quicktime is also seen a
major facelift going borderless it's
really clean and the controls fade out
as you're watching a video the big deal
here is the ability to trim your clip
directly in quick time and then
instantly upload it to youtube or mobile
me and if you want to send the video to
iTunes you have a choice to optimize it
for the iPhone Apple TV or computer if
the file has a high enough resolution to
support it you can also jump directly to
videos with chapter markers and this
isn't really a new feature but the new
select graphical interface to do it is
after you set your video to full screen
there's also a button that fills out
your video to the edges of the screen
and another little thing that I found in
the preferences is that you have more
control over specific settings in the
energy saver preferences now there's
obviously a lot more stuff I haven't
even found but overall this is a really
snappy OS from what I can tell so that's
a first look at some of the goodies on
Mac OS 10 snow leopard back to you in
the studio alright thanks Brian a great
job on that stuff and really dude you
need to stop dressing like me okay let's
get some of the news here reports from
Reuters say that 10 of the top mobile
phone manufacturers including Apple have
signed on to adopt the micro USB
connector standard for charging
smartphones in the European Union you're
all familiar with apple's proprietary
dock connector which is anything but
universal and they built an entire
cottage industry for it now Apple will
probably just add a mini USB next their
dock connector because with all the
accessories support that thing isn't
going anywhere anytime soon the rollout
is planned to begin next year and it's
only a matter of time until other
countries jump on board now I said I was
sick of it but I have to throw a little
iphone news in here apple has released
the iphone 3.1 software beta to
developers recently and yep you're
probably asking did a 30 just come out
but apple's not sleeping on this stuff
new features included allow people to
use the 3gs exclusive voice control
feature with bluetooth headsets now and
the ability to save an edited version of
a video clip as its own copy instead of
overriding the original file plus some
other graph
well tweaks and since we're on the
iphone 3gs you know what roll the
graphic is speaks for itself there are
reports on the internet that some owners
of white iphone 3gs is are finding that
the backs of their phones have been
changing pink or brown near the edges
after frequent use now I have a black
3gs but I found and plenty of other
users have found that the phone can run
very very hot compared to previous
models when it's being used heavily
Apple Insider reports that it's likely
due to a flawed battery cell but come on
now Apple let's get this power
management issue under control or at
least start advertising a new color
option like the iphone 3gs neapolitan
bottom line the iphone does run
significantly hotter at times when apple
doesn't comment and instead closes the
discussion thread on its form about the
issue come on now we have to throw the
bat after at chu alright guys that's
going to do it for this week's show send
me your email to the apple byte at cnet
com and i'll get to as many as i can i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching and come
back next week for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
