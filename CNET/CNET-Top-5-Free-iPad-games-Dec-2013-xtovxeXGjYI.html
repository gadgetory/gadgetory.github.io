thoroughly abused tool on a parent's
arsenal than an Apple iPad the digital
teeth that keeps your kid catatonic for
up to 10 hours at a time until Google
comes up with robots that can raise our
kids for us this is the next best thing
but iPad alone is not enough you also
need games but you can't afford games
because you just bought an ipad and
that's where I come in I'm Donald Bell
and today I'm counting down the five
most popular free games for the iPad
reported by itunes for the first week of
december starting off at number five
baby room makeover extreme edition what
better way to groom your child to be an
HDTV megastar while at the same time
giving them a sense of normalcy around
undocumented child labor but just to
warn you the baby's here really aren't
that extreme it's not a tattoo on the
bunch nor nose piercing on any of them
but I guess you get what you pay for at
number four candy crush saga you're
never too young to start your addiction
to candy or puzzle games so why not
check both those off the list at once to
be fair I've seen plenty of grown people
playing this game I mean I look at them
in pity but it's better than the disgust
I feel if they're playing baby room
makeover extreme edition coming in at
number three deer hunter 2014 and
remember the good old days of playing
duck hunt on the Nintendo this is just
like that well you get the shoot animals
in the face and watch their bloody
entrails drip out of their body oh boy
rated 12 plus for frequent and intense
realistic violence just be glad it
doesn't come in an extreme edition at
number two my talking tom you can think
of this as a modern-day Tamagotchi you
get to adopt a virtual baby cat and keep
them fed and happy and of course once
your child gets attached to their pet
they'll want to buy them all manner of
in-app add-ons with your credit card and
I imagine once your child grows bored
with their pet they can buy them a
virtual iPad and just go off and do
something else all right and now the
number one free iPad game for december
two thousand thirteen clumsiness
ja it's a proven fact that kids love
ninjas and it's pretty hard not to
identify with this adorable deadly
assassin in training the best part is
the graphics are so cool it kind of
looks like a Pixar movie that hasn't
been made yet and the best best part is
it's free so there you go five of the
most popular free iPad apps for this
month now for more top 5s head over to
top 5 cnet com I'm Donald Bell thanks
