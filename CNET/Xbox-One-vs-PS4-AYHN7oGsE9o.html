we're left with tons of new game
announcements some new hardware and a
few surprises but as it seems to be
every year a lot of III focused centers
on the battle between Microsoft and Sony
for console supremacy we couldn't wait
to hear just how both Sony and Microsoft
would pitch the world on their
forthcoming step-up consoles Microsoft
decided to show their hand dishing out
info about the Xbox one s and looking
ahead to project Scorpio would Microsoft
have kept quiet if these two new
consoles didn't leak out before e3 we're
not totally sure but at least the
company decided to come clean about its
upcoming consoles first is Xbox one s a
smaller all-white console with a
built-in power supply and support for
HDR and 4k video though not for 4k
gaming then there's project Scorpio
which the company claims will be the
most powerful console ever made but we
don't know much beyond that
Microsoft simply teased the notion that
it's coming soon likely next holiday
season in 2017 on the other hand Sony
kept completely quiet about neo that's
the upgrade of ps4 that the company has
already acknowledged but if the plan is
still to release new hardware this year
we'd imagine some kind of public
introduction between now and the fall
will happen of course Sony does have new
hardware in the form of PlayStation VR
that hits October 13th for $400 but it
would be nice to know if psvr
will be able to benefit from neo at all
so let's switch gears to what really
matters though and that is the games
most of Xbox significant exclusive games
are console exclusive meaning a lot of
them will also be playable on PC they
include Forza horizon 3 Gears of War 4
Halo Wars to recore sea of thieves state
of decay - and scalebound
on the other hand Sony actually made a
significant splash with a slew of new
exclusive ps4 titles among them were a
new God of War game a new
post-apocalyptic survival game called
days gone horizon zero dawn Detroit
become human a new spider-man game The
Last Guardian a new game from hadhe
Okajima called death stranding and even
a crash bandicoot remaster sure a lot of
those games don't even have solid dates
but the laundry list of titles certainly
cements the ps4 s already impressive
collection of titles and that's not even
counting VR sony teased a batman VR game
and announced that Resident Evil 7 would
be entirely playable on psvr
now to be fair we're still not
completely sold on the Playstations
headset but we'll know soon enough of
its worth a purchase come October so
with all that information who came out
of III in better shape we can't deny
that Sony definitely has Microsoft beat
when it comes to exclusive titles but
Microsoft has what feels like a more
lucid plan when it comes to their new
hardware roadmap even if it feels like
their console options are all of a
sudden a bit overwhelming Microsoft
doesn't necessarily have an answer to
PlayStation VR just yet though it's safe
to say that Project Scorpio will support
some kind of a R or VR solution whether
it's Microsoft's own hololens technology
oculus or even both we definitely think
waiting to see what becomes of Xbox 1's
Sony's neo and PlayStation VR is the
wise move that should give you a better
idea of which console to buy and what
the future might hold for each platform
either way it's tough to deny that the
rest of 2016 and Beyond is going to be
an exciting time for games it's amazing
what can just change in a year it
definitely feels like we're at the start
of a big shift in games and consoles and
we'll be here to guide you through
