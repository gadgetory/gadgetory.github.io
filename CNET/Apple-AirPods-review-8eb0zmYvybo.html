charging Wireless buds that come at
their own little dental floss light case
now there are a lot of earphones that do
this and are independently connected
that attach to your head a couple of
companies make them Apple's can be used
for music or phone calls and the
microphones actually sound really good
with built-in noise cancelling mics in
each and the air pods coolest trick is
that it Auto connects with iPhones iPads
Apple watch and Macs you need to have
apple's latest software iOS 10 or Mac OS
Sierra to use it pair once use it across
all your things and it switches as
devices are switched so the idea is keep
them in walk to your next device keep
going keep those air pods in your ears
they even start and stop automatically
now I would have liked a little bit of
remote built into them right now you can
only double tap to get Siri wireless
earbuds again they're not new and apples
while sounding good look completely
ridiculous if you can get over that you
might like them but what's most
interesting is the trip inside that new
w1 chip Apple's been talking about it
does all the handshaking via bluetooth
imagine that in a smart home gadget a
speaker a lamp a car from watches to
earphones to who knows what else
Apple's deep and wireless accessories
now you're not necessarily going to want
to buy air pods but you'll want devices
that seamlessly work just like it
