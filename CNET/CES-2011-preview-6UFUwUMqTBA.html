and we are looking ahead to the Consumer
Electronics Show 2011 our annual gadget
Super Bowl
I'm here with Lindsay Turrentine
executive editor at C net and Erica AG
senior writer for CNN news calm we're
gonna talk a little bit about some of
the trends that we're expecting from the
show this year now honestly ahead of it
it seems like there's really only the
one tablets tablets everywhere sir yep
yeah so what are you guys hearing I mean
are we gonna see non-stop Android
tablets is it gonna be all Windows Phone
7 Erica what have you what have you
heard so far
um I am expecting a lot of Android
tablets I mean there's a lot of people
that have been telegraphing it very
obviously manufacturers that are saying
no end of 2010 or 2011 so I think we can
accept this expect to see those I think
they're gonna be a lot of 7-inch tablets
maybe some that are a little bit smaller
but I'm thinking probably solidly in the
7-inch area and then what about those
Windows 7 tablets not Windows Phone 7
the Ballmer keynote is expected to
showcase a lot of those frankly we saw
some last year where have they been
they've been catching up for a while now
and we've seen big advances in the
Android side we're probably gonna see
Android with honeycomb the honeycomb
version which is optimized for those
tablets so we're really curious to see
what we get out of Windows because so
far we know nothing together more than a
little bit behind the curve it seems
like everyone is do you think we'll see
tablets like the PlayBook that are
primarily kind of aimed at the business
space trying to sidestep
the iPad or are we gonna finally see
some true iPad competition I think we're
gonna see all kinds of tablets anything
you can think of you'll probably see it
and then of course the big shadow thats
hanging over CES is the possibility of
the Verizon iPhone like let's you know
like what do you think are the odds here
let's let's go out on a limb play some
bets Lindsay what are the odds of the
Verizon iPhone being announced during
CES during CES I think slim to none I
think that there are good odds
I don't know 40% that it could be
announced
just before CES so could I pull the rug
out from underneath a lot of other
Android announced
well that and Verizon has a very
prominent slot in a keynote lineup at
the show so it would be interesting if
Apple chose maybe two days before three
days before to talk about the new iPhone
and maybe Verizon we talked about you
know 4G and you know how it would work
on that potentially we don't know but it
would definitely pull a rug out under
out from under you know poor CEO verizon
steel asunder a little bit but you know
who knows well an apples done that
before I mean didn't they announced the
iPad right during CES they have
certainly heard it was of the MacBook
original iPhone that's right that was
like we had mac world
I mean iMac world anymore you know at
the same time slots up right but we do
have a little bit of an Apple pavilion
so it's it would it would certainly be
set up for a bunch of accessories or who
knows what else well and we know that
Apple never lets carriers steal the
Thunder so Apple announcing the iPhone
right before the show would allow
Verizon to discuss its plan how generous
of them well speaking of phones that
sounds like smartphones are actually
gonna 44 really the kind of the first
time have a major presence at CES
usually they're a little bit of a
smaller category what are we expecting
there we're expecting some exciting
advances like dual-core Android phones
which we're fast and exciting probably a
lot of apps for the first time ever CES
has never been a software show and we're
hearing buzz about you know smaller apps
but still a lot of talk about apps at
the show and and and perhaps some
presentations and an exciting new set so
you know we're excited to see a
discussion of content that's it yes yeah
interesting and then of course TVs are
always huge front and center at CES are
they gonna be pushing 3d TV again this
year beating that drum I think they are
you know last year was when they kind of
they made like the big splash I think
we've seen from sales people aren't
super excited about having 3d at home I
mean in the theater is a different story
but at home sort of lukewarm about it
but I think we are gonna see more of
that now what they do in terms of you
know with glasses without glasses you
know what type of glasses that's gonna
be interesting to see you
which direction manufactures are right
yeah and then I have to say a
surprisingly big trend this year seems
to be connected cars I mean there's
always a car presence that's the es but
this year you have Ford and Audi both
keynoting what I mean
cars are the net you know the next place
for the Internet
it's huge well every year there's a car
tech pavilion and it's just getting
bigger and bigger every year and we
expect to see a lot of connected
connected stuff in the dashboard yeah
from many manufacturers it's pretty
crazy
cars are gonna be a little Internet
connected TVs on or Internet connected
devices on wheels that sounds super safe
hopefully there will also be
self-driving cars because we need them
thank you so much Lindsay and Eric I'll
see you at CES you can also look for
olive CNET's coverage at CES cnet.com
