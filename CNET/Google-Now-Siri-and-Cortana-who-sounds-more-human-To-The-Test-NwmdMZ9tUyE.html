recently updated the Google now voice
that sounds a little bit more human less
robotic but I kind of want to see is it
just as useful as before is it better
and how does that voice actually compare
to Siri and Cortana yeah what was the
latest giant score New York Giants lost
to Philadelphia Eagles 35 to 30 so she's
not exactly smart enough to tell the
difference between sports and now Siri
yeah they did and Cortana
also pulls up the New York Giants team
dad totally correct
all right well of the winner is
obviously series the only ones who got
the correct answer but she still sounds
a little bit robotic want to try this
what's your personality like nothing
free personality test probably needs one
I would rather talk about your calendar
and dinner plans
Touche presentation her voice she sounds
very human and Siri kind of had a little
bit of attitude okay let's see how their
personalities actually are sound good
tell me a joke no humor they're really
robotic I say it a lot better than
singer come on dude very good and she
also nailed that time oh I have an idea
go for it
sing me a song here you go just started
playing some music
what's she play ah the killers Joyride
by The Killers all right not bad
Ferriday I get you how sweet that was
very nice of Cortana her pitch wasn't
terrible honey for a robot
okay so Google most useful probably the
best information you're gonna get but
the personality is pretty well lacking
the voice does sound a little bit nicer
than the premium but Siri sounds pretty
much like I'd expect her to although
it's been a couple of years that she's
been around and I'd like to see a little
bit more of a human touch there the end
Cortana a decent mix of both does seem
to grab good information from the
internet and whatever she knows and also
likes to tell jokes that was an adorable
song and will seem to you that was
really cute so sweet why did the chicken
cross the road
roll in the mud and cross the road again
because he was a dirty double-crosser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
