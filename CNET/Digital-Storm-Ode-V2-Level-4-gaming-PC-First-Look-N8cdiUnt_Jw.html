going to talk about the digital storm
ode v2 level for this is a high end
gaming desktop that costs about
twenty-five hundred it's a
pre-configured system which means that
you can't customize the parts when you
go to buy it what you see is what you
get here but fortunately what you get is
a powerful gaming PC for its price the
white case has a nice look to it but
it's also the same case we saw from
digital storm and last year's owed a
blu-ray drive slides out here on the top
you'll see a speed control for the fan
along with a few USB 3.0 ports among
other ports the back of the case you'll
see digital storm has included almost
every modern port we expect in a
high-end gaming rig here's USB 3.0
e-sata and the digital audio output go
down to the video cards and you'll see
you'll get full-size hdmi and
displayport outs as well as a pair of
DVI ports on each card inside the case
digital storm has done a neat job with
the cables and cooling hardware the
suits motherboard also has a plating
covering the circuitry which looks clean
and keeps dust off for its components
you get a third generation ivybridge
core i7 3770k cpu along with eight gigs
of ram and a pair of high end geforce
gtx 670 graphic cards for storage
digital storm includes a 128 gigabyte
solid-state boot drive as well as a one
terabyte mechanical drive you might want
to flash your case for your expensive
gaming PC and you also might prefer to
customize the bill yourself but if
you're simply picking up a fast gaming
PC with no configuration fuss this is
the first desktop I'd recommend I'm
Joseph Kaminsky and this is the digital
storm OD two level 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
