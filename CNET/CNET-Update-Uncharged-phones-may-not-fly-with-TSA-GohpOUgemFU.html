your carry-ons charged up I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET updates if
you're on an international flight to the
United States make sure your cell phone
is charged up before going to the
airport the Transportation Security
Administration is taking extra measures
to scan for threats from overseas
passengers and there's a new rule if
you're on a u.s. bound direct flight you
may be asked to power on your cell phone
or your tablet or any electronic device
but if it has no battery or if it can't
turn on it won't be allowed on the plane
reports suggest that this increased
security is in response to information
that terrorists can turn smartphones
into undetectable bombs and I wouldn't
be surprised if it's even harder to find
an open power outlet now in an airport
in other news it seems like Apple is
gearing up to launch a SmartWatch very
soon
Apple hired a top sales executive from
Swiss luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer it's
expected that we'll see an iWatch or
whatever Apple's going to call it
sometime in the fall it'll be alongside
the new iPhone but this shows that Apple
thinks it'll need some help from the
Swiss to sell this thing there are
several challenges in convincing people
to buy a SmartWatch they aren't always
stylish because they are pretty large
the battery doesn't last more than a day
and they're pricey most of the Android
smart watches out there are $200 or more
it's just a really expensive accessory
that can do the same things a smartphone
can do Apple has been channeling some
wisdom from the luxury fashion world
last year the company hired the former
CEO of Yves Saint Laurent to work on
special projects and the head of UK's
Burberry group now oversees Apple's
retail operations as for other gadgets
you can soon by there's a report that a
mini version of the Microsoft Surface
tablet could soon launch maybe within
the next month or two the usually
reliable Twitter account of EV leaks
says that Microsoft is anticipating a
summer release and in the world of
virtual reality the oculus rift headset
isn't for sale to the public yet it's
expected to launch next year but
oculus announced that it will hold its
first Developers Conference to learn in
software makers to make virtual reality
programs the conference will be held in
September in Los Angeles now we've seen
the oculus in action at events like the
Consumer Electronics Show and III but it
needs more content and programs for
people to feel compelled to buy it now
in the meantime Sony is creating its own
virtual reality headset to compete which
is now called project Morpheus and it'll
work with a Playstation 4
