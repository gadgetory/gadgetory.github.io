gonna take an in-depth look at sony vaio
tap 20 all in one so this is Sony's
brand-new 20 inch on one desktop
designed pretty specifically for Windows
8 so this is a touchscreen PC and it's a
little bit smaller than some other own
ones you might have seen recently but
what's unique about this system is that
it has a battery built into it that
means you can take out the power cable
it still works
and you can even drop it down and carry
the system around from room to room in
your house so what that means is this
system is kind of the home lifestyle PC
that we've all sort of wanted but
nobody's really nailed yet it's small
enough that you can put it on any
countertop in the kitchen put it in a
den pretty much wherever you want to but
because it's portable you don't have to
put it anywhere permanently so it's
great if you want to say put up a recipe
if you want to just browse the news at
the kitchen table if you want to watch a
movie somewhere so the specs of this
computer just fast enough it comes with
a low-power core i5 CPU four gigs of RAM
a 750 gigabyte hard drive and an
integrated intel graphics
there's no optical drive and the 20 inch
screen only has a 16 by 900 resolution
screen so it's not a true HD screen and
in fact it doesn't even have an HDMI
input which would really make this
system useful to plug in a game console
or some other external video source for
its other ports it's not bad it has a
couple USB 3 ports and the SD card slot
as well as a couple analog audio jacks
so some Ethernet cable over here and of
course it does have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
it even has NFC although we found that
was kind of a mixed bag it wouldn't work
with devices from Sony or other vendors
so that's really more of a gimmicky
feature than anything else but if you
can live with web-based or local content
the system is really pretty versatile
little PC know it's tempting to look at
this as a 20 inch tablet and for sure
that idea seems kind of crazy you
certainly wouldn't want to take this on
the subway or on a plane you could try
it but it probably kind of awkward but
at just under 12 pounds the system is
light enough that any adult can move it
around from room to room up and down
stairs without too much trouble that
makes it a really pretty versatile home
PC so I'm rich Brown this has been a
spotlight on Sony Vaio tap 2001
