first look at the Nokia Asha 501 Nokia
Asha 501 is part of Nokia's budget range
of phones aimed at emerging markets like
India and Latin America it'll be
available in Europe but naki has said
that it definitely won't be shipping to
North America anytime soon if ever it
has a low resolution capacitive
touchscreen uses 2g data networks only
but it has a fun vibrant plastic design
and a super cheap price tag of 99
dollars if you spend time with any of
Nokia's recent phones the 501 will be
quite familiar it's got a one-piece
polycarbonate back that's very
reminiscent of the Lumia 520 the back
panel is made from one single sheet so
the only seam you'll find on a phone is
around the edge of the screen that help
makes it feel very solid and secure I
wasn't able to put it through CNET's
usual brutal set of stress tests but it
certainly felt like it could take a
knock or two it's available in a rainbow
of garish colors to suit your mood or
more likely your outfit it's comfortable
to hold as its three-inch screen doesn't
require you to stretch your palms out
the display has a 320 by 240 pixel
resolution which compared to the full HD
smartphones around is pretty poor you
really can't expect that sort of quality
for such a cut-down price though icons
and larger texts are all perfectly
readable it's not particularly bright
nor does it have great colors but again
it does the job adequately for the money
it runs on Nokia's own Asha software
rather than the swanky Windows Phone 8
software you'll find on the more premium
Lumia range it looks fairly simple and
has a couple of neat tricks up its
sleeve but it won't appeal to those of
you after a more refined feature-rich
smartphone experience unlock the phone
and you'll be taken to a grid of apps
similar to what you'd expect to see in
iOS swipe either side of the apps and
you'll see a scrolling activity log
displaying recent apps activities or
recently called contacts it's pretty
easy to operate so shouldn't scare off
the technophobes among you but it
doesn't have the sort of slick
multitasking features crucial to any
top-end smartphone doesn't have a
well-stocked App Store either although
some essentials like whatsapp Facebook
Twitter and plan
most zombies are available it's really
not going to be a huge issue that a lot
of data hungry apps aren't available as
the 501 only uses 2g networks you won't
be ultimate use of faster 3G data and
the lightning-fast 4G speeds will only
be a fevered dream for 501 owners
sending a quick tweet will just about be
doable but don't try and attach photos
or videos unless you want a long wait
nokia explained that 2g networks are
still the most used in countries like
India where the 501 is aimed so it's
perhaps not as big a deal as it first
seems storage comes in the form of a 4
gigabyte SD card which you can swap out
for a bigger one if you like it'll also
be available in either a single all dual
SIM version if you want to keep two SIM
cards onboard for easier data roaming
lucky you wouldn't say what processor is
onboard we know it's not going to be
anything impressive but it seemed just
about capable of providing fairly smooth
navigation through the azure software
with its low end specs cut down price
and only 2g connectivity the Nokia Asha
501 really isn't aimed at smartphone
purists instead it's aimed squarely at
emerging markets like India and Latin
America it's cheap price and sturdy
build quality might make it a reasonable
option to pick up as an emergency
festival phone though
