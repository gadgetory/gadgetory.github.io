US every year are rear-end collisions
and that probably shouldn't come as any
surprise because most of us handle a gap
to the car in front of us that we're
following and how we glanced at it with
a combination of past good luck and
wishful thinking
so let's apply a little science the
Transportation Research Center at Ohio
State did a study of 60 drivers over
6,500 miles highway and city to see how
they manage the car ahead first they
tended not to focus on how close that
vehicle is nor how fast they were
traveling they did tend to focus on the
rate of gap change when it's steady we
tend to get complacent and look
elsewhere as if the car ahead would
never break because it isn't now the
study found that glances away when we
are following a car directly in front of
us go anywhere from a tenth of a second
to about a full second which is
substantially shorter than when we're
driving and don't have a vehicle
directly in front of us and then it's
more like 1.62 to full seconds but that
behavior fails to take into account a
lot of things like what the driver in
front of us sees which we can't see and
also their braking behavior do they ride
the brakes do they moderate them nicely
do they stab on them only at the last
minute when they need to we get our
distance following cues and our prompts
to look ahead of the car in front of us
in three major categories
first there's geometry things like
intersections ahead great changes rail
crossings approaching those are all
fixed things we can see or that are
called out by graphical signage then
come othman ting cues here's where
you'll find brake lights considered
augmenting because information you get
from brake lights ahead will vary by how
the driver uses their brakes it's not
real rigid data finally there are
primary cues this is your own spacial
and depth perception of the car ahead
and that change in distance and speed so
two major takeaways first of all
remember that old one car lengths for
every 10 miles per hour of speed rule
you've been ignoring since the week you
got your license turns out it's pretty
good and secondly since a lot of us
don't take into account the gap to the
car in front of us nor the speed at
which we're following we need vehicle to
vehicle technology to get in there to
more elegantly moderate between vehicles
on the road right now we're really
putting the gap at a fixed level even
though the dynamics change a lot at
different speeds and different amounts
of space as we wait for b2b technology
to arrive a simpler somewhat cruder
technology is becoming more common today
and that is forward collision detection
and automatic collision avoidance
braking it's kind of a sledgehammer
approach that fixes the bad situations
we put cars into in follow distance
while we're mostly asleep at the switch
it pays to double check how you manage
the gap to the car ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
