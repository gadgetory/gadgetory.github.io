and what they do on this big ol cutaway
Ford Shelby motor you can see them
clearly the intake valves open to let
the air and gas into the cylinder the
exhaust valves open later to let the
burned air and gas out of the cylinder
that into the exhaust valves are
operated by camshafts you see these guys
up here they turn with the engine and
these off-center lobes that are mounted
on them push the valves open or not as
they turn around these are dual overhead
cams there's one cam four exhaust valves
a separate one for intake valves also
notice this engine has four valves per
cylinder like many do these days if
you've got more area to let the engine
breathe in and out but here's the
problem a strictly mechanical system
operates the same way at all rpms and
all engine loads that's not ideal for
mpg horsepower or emissions you want to
vary this behavior at different points
of the engines rev range that's why we
have variable valve timing and it
changes three parameters valve timing at
what points in the engines rotation do
the valves open and close valve duration
how long the valve stays open
once it is and valve lift how far a
valve moves off its seat when it opens
so varying all those valve events as
they're called allows this engine and
most importantly it's electronic control
unit can constantly make a call to get
the most power the best mpg and the
lowest emissions all at once now I could
do an hour on why that works but here
just a couple simple examples if you
leave this exhaust valve open longer on
one stroke you get all the exhaust blown
out of there that leaves a fully open
and clean cylinder to take in the
maximum gas and air on the next gulp and
that could give you more power on the
other hand if you close that exhaust
valve a little sooner you leave some
exhaust in here that fills part of the
cylinder and therefore you take in less
air and fuel the next time that kind of
creates a virtually smaller engine for a
moment that could give you better mpg
now the mechanisms that allow these
valves to change their behavior are
almost as numerous as there are
manufacturers of engines here just a few
examples first of all some cars have
multiple sets of lobes
they're camshafts and different lobes of
different shapes are used at different
points in the engines operation here's
another example
sometimes you will change the
relationship between the rotation of the
crank and the rotation of the camshaft
so they aren't always locked one-to-one
another technology is what's called an
eccentric cam drive so the engines
turning at a certain rpm but eccentric
drives here on the ends of the cams
allow them to accelerate and decelerate
their rotation that gives you a degree
of control as well now who invented all
this variable valve timing stuff
interestingly Fiat is often given credit
as having the first mainstream
production-ready system dating back to a
1969 patent application but today you
know it is MultiAir we saw it recently
in the new Jeep Cherokee now owned by
Fiat of course it's their version of
changing valve events using hydraulic
pressure out of the oil system the most
famous kind of valve timing yes valve
timing can be famous is Honda's VTEC the
source of one of the biggest memes ever
on the Internet
and just about every car maker has their
own brand of variable valve timing and
they push it hard which is weird
considering how few car buyers have any
idea what it is but now at least you've
got a pretty good idea of how this one
technology has dramatically improved how
engines raise mpg increase horsepower
and lower emissions it's one of the
great revolutions and engineering in
cars in the last few days</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
