heard this much hype out of Microsoft
since they came out with the Zune but
while they point the way forward for the
future of Windows there are plenty of
reasons to wait and see how this plays
out before making the switch so here are
the top 5 reasons not to upgrade to
Windows 8 starting off at number 5 the
Windows 8 app store there's just not a
lot of exciting software here yet cut
the rope is fun but what kind of world
are we living in when the Mac store has
more software than Windows at number 4
you don't have a touch screen now you
absolutely don't need a touch screen to
use Windows 8 but Microsoft did a lot of
work to make the interface touch screen
friendly you really want to experience
the future of Windows that future
includes a touch screen coming in at
number 3 Windows 7 Windows 7 is a great
stable OS and like every version of
Windows that Microsoft makes they
guarantee 10 years of support think
about it they're still supporting
Windows XP and when that support runs
out in 2020 assuming we haven't all been
killed off by an asteroid you can make
the jump to Windows 11 all right number
two the learning curve you spent your
whole life thinking about Windows as a
virtual desktop and now it's like an
abstract painting you may grow to love
it but it's gonna take some work on your
part to find your way around you also
have to say things like charms bar
seriously
charms bar it's awful now before we get
to number one let's talk about the
number one reason you should upgrade to
Windows 8 the price the upgrade is just
$40 Microsoft really really wants you to
try Windows 8 the whole company is
riding on this and if it works you may
never see an upgrade price this good
again that said the number one reason
why you shouldn't upgrade to Windows 8
because waiting will only help this time
next year Windows 8 will have less bugs
more software and cooler hardware
options for tablets and laptops and
all-in-one desktops the best Windows 8
computer probably hasn't been invented
yet so just cool your heels read our
