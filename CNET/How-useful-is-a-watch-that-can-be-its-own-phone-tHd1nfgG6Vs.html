was awesome but there's an even more
advanced version gear s2 3g that can act
as its own phone how does that work well
there's a micro sim inside and it
connects to Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T networks in
the US you need to set it up with your
phone plan then you make calls with the
speakerphone or connected Bluetooth
headset the microphone sounds as good as
a regular phone but like the Apple watch
it's a little hard to hear someone else
is really on hold speaker you can use
other apps using the 3G 4G cell
connection as long as you've set it up
for your data plan or you could use
Wi-Fi messages Yelp weather navigation
sports scores little bits of news or
even milk music streaming right on your
wrist there aren't that many apps but
there are enough and the s2 will get
samsung pay on all watches sometime this
year for wrist payments but you still
need to connect and pair with a Samsung
or Android phone first along with all
the apps before it works standalone
pretty confusing the setup honestly if
you don't want to use the phone features
this watch also does speaker phone calls
when paired with your phone a nice plus
over the previous s2 it also has its own
GPS for running or navigation the gear
s2 3g is a lot thicker than other
smartwatches but the battery life
weirdly lasts less it's about three and
a half to four hours of use or a day on
standby I ran out of juice most days by
dinnertime pricing is a bit of a mess on
this one depending on the carrier and
the contract it can range between 200 to
350 dollars and you'll have to pay extra
for data I don't think it's worth it but
yeah a full on its own SmartWatch does
exist just in case you were dreaming of
being that person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
