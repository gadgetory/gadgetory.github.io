you'd expect of a high-end flagship
phone let's start here with its
all-metal body with the attractive cool
blue finish and with the way of the
glass curves gently at the side of the
screen of course you also get a
fingerprint scanner mounted here on the
back the display well it's a 5.7 inch
ultra HD panel that's pin sharp and
extremely vivid diving deeper we're
treated to a super powerful octa-core
processor capable of handling all of
your everyday tasks and as a hearty 64
gigabytes of storage and yes you can
expand that with microSD cards
there's not one but two 12 megapixel
cameras on the back with one shooting
color and one in black and white both of
which can take some really great shots
the a megapixel camera on the front does
a superb job of capturing the urbanity
admittedly that large screen and four
thousand milliamp an hour battery does
make the phone rather a chunky chap lots
of sacrifice I don't mind making when it
results in a battery that won't conk out
in the middle of the day what you won't
find is any kind of waterproofing on the
honor eight pro which is something you
will find on Samsung's flagship Galaxy
s8 but with the price tag over 200
pounds less than Samsung's it might be
worth simply being more careful around
water honors handset might not have the
glitz and glamour of the Samsung name
but it's affordable price and long list
of elite features make it well worth a
look if you can't sum up the cost of a
latest galaxy
