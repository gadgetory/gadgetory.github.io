the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple plenty of
good stuff this week but let's start off
with iPads now French website console
Mac has found that Apple has registered
new tablets with the Eurasian Economic
Commission try saying that 10 times fast
and that suggests an iPad refresh is
coming soon with March being the likely
target in the past similar required
filings with the EEC have been submitted
for air pods iPads iPhones and Apple
watches all within one to two weeks
before they were released now two of the
model numbers a one eight ninety three
and a one nine five four don't
correspond with any current iPads the
best guess at the very least we'll see
the rumored refresh nine point seven
inch iPad the iPad Mini hasn't seen an
update for a few years and we've heard
plenty rumors about the all-new designed
iPad pro with face ID but that could be
held back even until WWDC in June either
way this is a strong indication
something is cooking real soon all right
let's play a little catch-up with some
home pod news that happened since last
week's show yes the home pod isn't the
only smart speaker that leaves marks on
some wood surfaces the son√≠s one has
shown it does the same thing as well and
this is not just a home pod thing now
leather accessory company pad and quill
jumped on this real fast and is offering
a leather coaster that's described as
state-of-the-art surface protection for
1995 now you can always take apples of
advice from their cleaning and taking
care of your home pod support page they
say if you're concerned about this we
recommend placing your home pod on a
different surface see people are telling
me you can just like rub some mayonnaise
on them and the Rings will go away like
does that really work but what if you're
a Miracle Whip kind of person does that
work too like these questions need
answers in the comments all right Fast
Company put out their list of the
world's most innovative companies for
2018 and who's at the top of that list
and number one drumroll please
it's Apple of course it's Apple now fast
company says they're earpods Apple watch
Series 3 air kid and iPhone 10 were the
reasons and they were praised for their
ambitious software and hardware projects
they also say artificial intelligence is
a point of advantage for Apple where
they have made major inroads despite
competition from Google and Amazon now
I'd like to celebrate their reasons but
I'm sorry are we talking about the same
company here like all the apple juice
drinkers you can at me but let's be real
they have the sales numbers no doubt but
their products are more like
evolutionary with one of Apple's
buggiest software years ever in 2017 so
much that they're prioritizing quality
and slowing down feature development and
AI is an advantage for them okay maybe
privacy is with that but have they even
used an AI other than Siri come on let's
be real that's a bad apple and we know
who's going to get the next big
exclusive interview with Apple Fast
Company now Netflix came in second
square in third and 10 cent and fourth
Instagram came in at 12 so I guess I
mean an innovative company also means
deliberately copying features from
another platform and taking their
audience
alright apple just released the third
beta for iOS eleven point three and TV
OS eleven point three for developers but
it's removed airplay to functionality
that was in the previous betas used to
be able to try it out by playing music
from an iPhone to two different rooms
with Apple TVs and it also allowed you
to add an Apple TV to the home kit setup
that's completely gone now we're not
sure when it's coming back it was buggy
and not fully functional but airplay to
is a big part of the home pod features
for stereo sound and multi-room audio
that's been delayed now you're probably
prompted to update to this iOS 11 point
two six this week it's the 11th official
update to iOS 11 this fixes the Telugu
bug that causes messages or other
messaging apps to crash because it was
unable to render a specific character
that one that looks like this in the
Indian language Telugu all right Mac
rumors reports WWDC 2018 we'll be
heading back to San Jose in June San
Jose's McHenry Convention Center is
already booked every week in the month
other conventions except for the first
week of June where WWDC would most
likely fall on June the 4th to the 8th
now WWDC attendees go through this
random lottery to get tickets and if
you're lucky enough to come back to San
Jose make sure you go to live victorious
for the orange sauce trust me on this
okay and this story is a real headline
Apple employees keep walking into the
glass walls of the new spaceship campus
see sometimes the jokes just write
themselves sure this spaceship is
perfect looking with its forty five-foot
tall curved glass panels but according
to Bloomberg employees with our heads
buried in their own iPhones are walking
directly into the glass panels ouch
some staff even started sticking post-it
notes on the doors as a visual cue but
they were removed because they detracted
from the building's design of course
they did and you know what that's a bad
apple thanks for that one Niko Garcia
you're awesome bro and you know what I
honestly don't know anyone who'd be
stupid enough to do that that's crazy
that dude looks just like me and before
we go the Apple byte is hooking you up
