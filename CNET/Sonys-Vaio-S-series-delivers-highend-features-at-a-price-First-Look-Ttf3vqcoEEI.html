a look at the newly updated Sony Vaio s
laptop this is the 15-inch s there's
also a 13 inch model and the SS stories
I tapes are second highest end laptop
line next to the BIOS II which is at
super thin 13 inch but if on a bigger
laptop this is pretty much where it tops
out and this certainly looks and feels
like a very high-end laptop it's got a
magnesium and aluminum chassis it's
relatively thin and light for 15-inch
laptop not quite ultra book level but
generally in the same ballpark and it
has pretty much all the high-end
features that you'd want from something
like this it's got an Intel Core i7
processor it's got a full 1080p display
here on the 15.5 inch screen it's got
discreet graphics it even has a blu-ray
playing drive which should cover all the
bases if you want a multimedia laptop
that's reasonably transportable and can
also play some games on a super gaming
machine but at least does you know a
good job at basic gaming you do get the
the basic Sony excellent keyboard they
really do a good job with that and
they're backlit keys which I always
appreciate the touchpad is of a slightly
unusual sort of elongated letterbox
style usually very good in this
particular case no matter how I set the
sensitivity settings it still felt a
little twitchy to me I didn't quite
catch the finger just right there is one
thing that struck me as a little odd
about this laptop all the ports and
connections are usually here on what you
call the left side in this particular
case they're actually all here on the
right side on the left side you've got
these slot-loading blu-ray drive and
also the audio jacks so that may take a
little getting used to if you're if
you're used to just kind of taking a USB
connection and just plugging it right in
there and there are two USB 3.0 Jack's
but don't forget that third USB to Jack
that is the only one you can use and
what we call kind of a sleep in charge
mode where you can plug it in and
recharge your iPhone or your mp3 player
even when the laptop is asleep or off
the only real knock I have against the
VAIO s is despite all the high-end
features that it has
it's $13.99 that's still pretty
expensive especially considering so many
other in mid size 14 and 15 inch laptops
including new ones from HP and Dell
look really nice or just about a center
light but cost a lot lot less either
Ackman and that is the sony vaio s
