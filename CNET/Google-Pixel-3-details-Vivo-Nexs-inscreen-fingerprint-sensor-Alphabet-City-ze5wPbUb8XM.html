show that covers stuff related to
alphabet Inc that's the company that
owns lots and lots of other companies
including Google I'm your guide Aya's
Akhtar on today's episode we're going to
talk about a geothermal heating and
cooling system a new Android phone with
an inch screen fingerprint sensor and
our top story details on the next pixel
first stop pixel parks the good people
at Bloomberg seem to have some
information about the new pixel phones
let's get the boring stuff
out of the way first there's going to be
two of them the XL and the regular model
they would be called the pixel three XL
and the pixel three and Verizon would be
the exclusive US wireless carrier onto
the more exciting stuff this is what the
pixel three XL will probably look like
you might be saying is that's just a
photoshopped pixel and you'd be right if
I had pictures of the actual pixel three
XL that would probably be in the
headline of this video right Bloomberg
says the XL model will have a nearly
edge-to-edge screen it'll have a chin
with a notch on the top then notch will
not be as wide as the one on the iPhone
10 but it'll be quote noticeably taller
the reason for the tall notch is to keep
stereo speakers on the front of the
phone like the previous XL inside that
notch will also be two cameras this kind
of lines up with an alleged leak of
pixel three screen protectors although I
don't know if that notch is much taller
than on the 10 what about the back and
I'll probably look like this now you're
thinking is that's just the back of the
pixel to excel and yeah it is bloomberg
says Google is sticking to a single
camera on the back for both the three
and the three XL one last interesting
point from the reports Google may be
talking to Foxconn to build the new
pixels previous pixels were built by HTC
and LG Foxconn is well known for putting
together i phones
next up the well travel to Android Evans
vevo is going to launch the next phone
it's going to be an all screen phone
without a notch so where's that front
facing camera gonna be we're kind of
expecting the next to be a version of a
concept we've seen from vivo before I'm
talking about the vivo apex which also
had an all screen design the
front-facing camera would pop up using a
motor
well vivo stick to that design for a
production phone that could be tricky
the apex also featured an area on the
screen where you could scan two finger
prints using an end screen fingerprint
sensor the promo image for the vivo NEX
definitely suggests an in screen
fingerprint sensor with a little blue
fingerprint on the bottom of the image
as for audio the apex did not have room
for speakers so it would vibrate the
screen to make it act like a speaker
we'll know more about the vivo next when
it's officially unveiled on the 12th of
June
next up dandelion drive dandelion
unveiled a new smart heating and air
conditioning system called dandelion air
it uses an energy from the ground to
regulate your home's temperature
wondering what dandelion is and how it's
related to alphabet let's check
dandelion was once a project of
alphabets X company in 2017 dandelion
was formed as an independent company
outside of alphabet X is an interesting
company in its own right it had a number
of companies graduate outside of it
including Valley and way mo barely and
way mo are still part of alphabet no
dandelion claims that it's dandelion air
system is four times more efficient than
any other furnace on the market the
company also says it's air is nearly
twice as efficient as typical air
conditioning systems the air can also go
online to get software updates and works
with a nest thermostat geothermal
heating and cooling systems have been
around for a while but the cost was a
problem the dandelion air costs around
twenty thousand dollars that's about
half of what a traditional geothermal
system will cost if you're a homeowner
and you're thinking oh this is gonna
wreck my yard isn't it dandelion says it
shouldn't the company claims it left a
typical suburban backyard relatively
undisturbed thanks to its special drills
if you're interested in getting one go
to dandelion energy calm to see if your
home qualifies dandelion is serving the
north east of the US for now last stop
