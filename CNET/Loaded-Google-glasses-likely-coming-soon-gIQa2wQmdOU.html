Roger carry on cnet com and it's time to
get loaded you could be wearing computer
vision glasses by the end of the year
reports the New York Times high-tech
glasses being made by google which have
been speculated about four weeks would
display a transparent computer screen on
the lenses it sounds like something out
of science fiction but new reports say
it can go on sale this year for
somewhere between 250 and six hundred
dollars the prototype looks similar to
oakley stump glasses and could tap into
Google's database to overlay map
directions or information on nearby
points of interest it's what's often
referred to as augmented reality
facebook is upgrading its advertising
offerings next week a leaked document
shows new ads will target the friends of
an advertiser's fans and it would let
anything post it on a page like a status
message event or photo to be turned into
an advertisement pay a little more and
that post can be targeted to anyone on
Facebook the new ads will also be larger
which supposedly will boost engagement
by forty percent twitter has brought
back features it recently removed in its
smartphone apps likely because they were
in high demand from fans the app update
for iphone and android users brings back
the swipe shortcut and a find friends
feature the iphone version also has
brought back the copy and paste function
as well as more sharing options the
hacker activist group Anonymous is
growing more powerful and may one day
attack our power grid according to the
director of the National Security Agency
The Wall Street Journal reports the
director has been urging for the u.s. to
keep a close eye on anonymous over the
next couple of years the group has been
known to hack information from
individuals and organizations all with
the goal of embarrassing them or
revealing what it believes are in
justices earlier this month the group
took credit for taking down the CIA's
website you likely know of the company
epson for its printers but now the
company has gotten into the personal
fitness industry it's created the latest
GPS watch for runners the GPS monitor
can track or runners distance pace and
speed and it also can be worn while
swimming
we'll be the first to get the watch
later this year scientists have found a
new way to look at a whole cell without
the mess of slicing it up and staining
it in a lab using soft x-ray tomography
researchers can take a photo of a cell
every 100 milliseconds once they have
about a hundred or 200 snapshots the
computer can build a 3d color-coded
model on the computer and it only takes
five minutes those are your headlines
