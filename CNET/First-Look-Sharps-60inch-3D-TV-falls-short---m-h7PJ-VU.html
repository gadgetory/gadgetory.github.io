CNET and I'm with the gigantic 60-inch
Sharp LC 60 le 745 you believe it or not
a larger version of this TV at 70 inches
that this review will apply to both
this is sharps mid-range LCD LED base TV
for a 2012 it actually is the least
expensive to include 3d compatibility it
also has a cooler Smart TV suite we'll
get to both of those in a little bit but
first let's take a look at the styling
of this TV it is sharp pardon the pun
the edges of this TV are actually sharp
enough to need these little rubber
bumpers along the edge that's because
the frame is actually made of metal most
TVs have a plastic frame so that's a
pretty cool and relatively subtle
step-up feature the stand is also
another step-up it actually has a swivel
on and on a 16 inch size not on a 70
however and the whole look is really
sleek and I really like that they
maximize the screen and minimize the
frame connectivity is pretty good around
back you've got 4 HDMI inputs 1 2 USB a
component video input and a PC input I
mention 3d on this set it actually
requires not included 3d glasses that
are the active variety the least
expensive are about 50 bucks so you're
going to need to spend that for each
member of the family that wants to watch
3d on this TV
there's also Vudu apps on this TV for
stuff like Facebook and Twitter despite
the fact this TV is really big when
looked at from the side it seems razor
thin it's only about 2 inches deep
that's thanks to its LED backlight in
addition the slightly better Smart TV
apps there is a new gallery mode that
has a full-screen version of those you
can also move those apps around we
really like the ability to program one
of the three remote keys to one of your
three favorite apps so it's a pretty
cool feature in terms of customization
speaking of customization there's a
plenty of ways to adjust the picture on
this TV there's a full CMS 10-point
grayscale in addition to 11 species of
smoothing all told these features don't
really work as well as we expected those
we just stuck with the basic 2-point
grayscale when we adjusted the TV and
our lab testing this TV didn't perform
quite as well as the less expensive
version which was surprising the black
levels on this set are a little bit
lighter so they don't have quite as much
impact when you're watching the picture
in a dark room the TV also has a little
bit worse uniformity so we saw some
slight blotches on the TV screen again
those kinds of things weren't as visible
on the less expensive version
and again with those advanced picture
controls not working as well as we
expected we weren't able to get color
quite as good as again on the less
expensive version so all told if you're
just looking for 2d picture quality we
do recommend the step-down le 640 U is a
pair to the 7:45
so while told if you're just considering
2d picture quality we definitely
recommend the step-down sharp le 640 you
over this 7:45 3d picture quality on
this TV is again not quite as good as
we'd like to see the main issue is
crosstalk which appears as ghostly
images around some of the on-screen 3d
objects that's again not quite as good
as we've seen on some of the better LCD
TVs this year that's a quick look at the
sharp LC le 745 u series I'm David Katz
