iPhone 10 our and your October event
preview let's get right to the core of
this week's Apple news and rumors
reviews are in for the iPhone 10 are and
I've been reading a lot of them so that
you don't have to now bottom line is
that this one seems to be the iPhone for
most people it has everything you need
on an iPhone and it's 250 dollars less
than the iPhone 10's if you are coming
from an iPhone 6 7 or 8 it is gonna seem
like a huge step forward now the biggest
difference on this phone or at least
what the reviews seem to say is the
screen LCD versus all at which we
already knew but for most people it's
not gonna make much of a difference
unless you're comparing them side by
side or if you're coming from an OLED
display whether that's an Android phone
or an iPhone 10 but you're probably not
going to switch from a 10 to a 10 aren't
anyway the other difference in screen is
that the bezels are thicker than on the
tennis and the tennis max but again if
you're coming from a 6 7 or 8 they're a
lot thinner because it's edge to edge so
it kind of doesn't matter now portrait
mode is going to be different on this
phone as well the 10s and the 10s max
use that second telephoto lens to create
this effect but the 10r does it with
software only now the good thing about
it is that you are gonna get a wider
angle portrait shot and it's also better
in low light now the bad news is that it
only works for humans so if you're
obsessed with your dog like I am
portrait Road is not going to work
it also doesn't work on any objects the
other thing to point out that may make a
difference is the fact that it has a
different type of glass on the back it
doesn't have that super durable glass on
both sides of the phone like the 10s so
it has an aluminum frame and not as
durable of a glass on the back meaning
it's probably going to break faster so
you're gonna want a case on this and of
course I'm gonna have to try this out so
stay tuned for our drop test to come
later on this week
I vote in our pre-orders kicked off just
after midnight on Friday October 19 I
know because I was up late ordering our
iPhone for our drop test and they're
arriving in stores on October 26th now
in the past these early presale numbers
have clued us in on how well the phone
is actually going to sell and within the
first 24 hours none of the models seem
to have delays later on though the
hundred and twenty-eight gigabyte
colored versions seem to have one to two
week delays especially for the t-mobile
carrier now does this mean that there's
less demand for the iPhone 10 are
probably not it all depends on how many
Apple has in stock in fact analysts
Mincha quo still maintains that this one
is gonna be the best seller in the long
run for Apple doing better than last
year's iPhone 8 and that's TVD of course
now remember Beauty gate it seems like
we're not quite done with this issue
quite yet this was the issue where users
were reporting a smoothing effect on
selfies taken from the front camera and
originally we thought that it was due to
the smart HDR which was kind of leveling
out the highlights and lowlights and
making skin appear more even now this
may still be the case but Apple is now
addressing it in the next I oh s 12.1
upgrade this according to a report
originally published in the verge does
this mean that Apple is finally
admitting that there was a problem in
the first place
but let's leave all that in the past and
take a look forward because that October
event is almost here and the next time I
see you guys we're gonna have a whole
new lineup of Apple products to discuss
now what are we expecting well first off
to new iPad pros rumors point at an
iPhone 10 like redesigned for the iPad
line with slimmer bezels and face ID but
no notch this time and it's not clear
whether or not it will have an OLED
display now the newest rumors are saying
that it's gonna have that liquid Retina
display like the 10r here you can see
this render in 95 Mac which shows an 11
inch display and a 12 point 9 inch
display they're not gonna have a
headphone jack but they are gonna have a
4k video output now Apple could be
getting rid of the Lightning port in the
new iPad pros replacing it for a USBC
charger this according to MIT Chico and
now Mac o takara as cited in Forbes now
based on the reports were also expecting
a cheaper MacBook in this case it could
be finally the sequel to the MacBook Air
which could be 13 inches or 12 inches
depending on what rumour you read it
will have slimmer bezels and a Retina
display and that touch ID support with a
USBC charger like the new MacBook Pros
and the price tag is still kind of up in
the air originally we thought it was
gonna cost 999 dollars like the previous
MacBook Air but now a new digit times
report says that it's gonna cost $1200
and the Mac Mini could finally get a
refresh as well with new storage options
and a better processor but this all is
going to raise the price as well and
it's probably gonna cost more than the
$500 set it costs right now other
products that could also make an
appearance at this event include imax
air pods with that wireless charging
case that we've been waiting for a
next-generation Apple pencil with less
light I'm a smaller cheaper home pod to
compete with the Google home Mini and
the Amazon echo dot and lastly the air
power of Matt it's been more than a year
now

Apple event day so join us 30 minutes
before the actual event so that's 9:30
