Apple byte home pod review we've had it
for about I would say like five or six
days straight and I really wanted to dig
into a lot of things that some people
aren't even talking about and again this
is the home pod it's apples $349 smart
speaker but they shouldn't even call it
that I really feel like they should just
call it the Apple music speaker and
we'll get into all that but this isn't
about bashing the home pod but really
finding out what the home pod can do
what it can't do and who's this really
for so let's start off with the sound
everyone is raving about the sound on
this thing and for its size it's a real
impressive like there's great mids and
there's deep lows that really stand out
it can kind of lose some of the highs
and some details and voices at least
when I heard it that's compared to some
other speakers that are out there but it
really comes down also to the genre of
music you listen to as well but for me I
liked it a lot like a whole lot also the
other thing that sticks out is the sound
is 360 degrees and it's a room filling
360 degrees sound there's other speakers
that have this big great sound but
they're only shooting that sound from
the front so if you walk to the side of
the speaker or behind them they're gonna
sound completely different but that's
not the case with the home pod the
engineering they did you know all these
years they spent to make this the best
speaker at this size really it's an
accomplishment and impressive and
honestly it better be for three hundred
and forty nine dollars so there's no
denying this home pod sounds amazing
but this is also really the most walled
off Apple product we've ever seen so
let's start off with Bluetooth there is
no bluetooth streaming at all
now that instantly eliminates every
Android phone and non-iphone user from
plane directly to the home pod from
their phone also if you don't own an
iPhone running iOS 11 you can't even set
up the home pod so some of you running
older iPhones I know some of you don't
want to update to iOS 11 and I don't
blame you
it won't even work for you and this is
when people say this isn't a product
made for non Apple users I think that's
a load of crap
like why not Apple allows the air pods
to work with Android even if they have
some the less functionality the Apple
music service works for just Android
users and this is a speaker with Apple
music like it only supports that service
natively so come on they could have done
something more it has Bluetooth
I point oh and completely blocking on
iPhone users that's a classic Apple dick
move to me and don't think for one
moment you know Apple was gonna include
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the
home pod either because guess what they
didn't all right you know you can stream
third-party apps from your phone like
Pandora Spotify and YouTube music over
airplay to the home pod that's if you
have an iPhone but Apple music is the
only service that you can control with
your voice on the home pod and at the
time of this review airplay - that's
still not ready which means the promise
of using two home pods for stereo sound
or even doing things like multi room
speaker support that's still not
available and there's another feature
where they're trailing the rest of the
industry okay so one of the kind of
weird things about this when you set up
the home pod you have to hold your phone
near it and it's supposed to pair
similar to how ear pods do by detecting
and using the w1 chip unfortunately that
process hasn't been easy sailing for
everyone some people got blank white
screens with a setup I had to reset my
phone even reset the home pod just to
make sure that prompt shows up so you
might find that a little difficult also
Android users with an Apple music
subscription now if you've invested in
this and you are an Android user you can
actually use the home pod but it still
needs an iPhone with iOS 11 you need to
know someone that has that to initially
set it up so once it's set up you can
change the account in the home pod
settings from an Apple ID to an Android
Apple music one you can go in there
change the credentials completely but at
first none of my personally created
playlist worked on it at all this is
from my Android phone and I would say
things it wouldn't pop up so what did I
do
I'm like okay let's reconnect the Apple
ID account there all the play-offs that
I have on my phone that I've saved in
the cloud worked perfectly I went back
to putting my android apple music
account and then it works so I just want
to let you know there might be some
difficulty doing that but bottom line it
does work for Android users Apple music
does actually work again the sound is
really apple's first priority they
clearly nailed it but let's talk about
this as a smart speaker now after using
it and putting it through everything I
possibly could
I'm gonna just say this right now it's
probably the dumbest speaker with an AI
that you can get and I don't say that
lightly it also lets break down some of
these reasons so you understand what I'm
trying to
now everyone knows it's ridiculously
behind Amazon echo and the Google home
but Siri on the home pod can't even do
the same things that Siri does on your
phone now we know this home pod does
messages notes and reminders you can add
a note by voice if you want to but the
home pod won't read your latest note
it'll actually prompt you to look at it
on your phone
hey Siri read my last note you'll need
to authenticate on iphone to continue
see that's kind of annoying we also know
the home pod doesn't support multiple
users and can't distinguish between
different voices like the competition
it's really made to support one person
right now and what do I mean by that
well you probably saw the option during
setup to turn on personal requests this
lets you use messages reminders and
notes with the home pod it also lets
anyone else in the room do that as well
now someone can send and hear your
messages add reminders and notes without
your knowledge whatsoever but if you
leave the home or if you're out of range
of your home pod and your phone leaves
with you messages notes and reminders
they don't work at all like the home pod
just becomes this thing for general
knowledge and music playing to Apple
music and it can't even do general
knowledge very well hey Siri tell me
about Bruce Lee Bruce Lee is a town in
West Baton Rouge Parish Louisiana you
know hey Siri stop no it's not he's not
so see check that out if your home
people can mess around with some of your
personal apps but when you're gone the
whole pod becomes really extremely
limited now speakerphone you would think
at least the home pod could be a great
speakerphone
but again it's not you'll still have to
make the call from your phone and then
change the audio output to the home pod
from your screen now you can't tell the
home pod something like this hey Siri
call Shawna
sorry about that
see that doesn't work as well now
another part of this equation the smart
speaker it's great in the kitchen right
you can listen to music and you're
cooking up a meal but still to this day
Siri doesn't support multiple timers if
you're cooking with something in the
oven or you got something else boiling
and other things just cooking you need
multiple timers like this is basic so
let's check this out hey Siri set a
timer for 10 minutes 10 minutes and
Counting okay let's do another one
hey Siri set a timer for 30 minutes
a timer is already running at nine
minutes and 53 seconds
would you like to replace it no okay it
can't do it all right so that's another
bummer and here's a fun fact for y'all
it's not all bad if you want to pack
this up and the cord is in the way if
you're really willing to pull really
hard you can just pop the power cable
out from the home pod so we'll the whole
pod get better yes it has really no
other choice - but right now who is this
for
well number one if you're the diehard
Apple user who's deep into this
ecosystem you have an apple music
subscription and you only really care
about listening to music and you don't
care about the smart home but hey say
you might want to dabble with some
lights and you're willing to spend 349
this is the product for you but the
priority above all things would be
listening to music number two let's say
if you're not completely married to the
Apple ecosystem you care about what the
best tech product is no matter what the
company is don't get a home pod number
three if you're someone who's
prioritizing the smart home the voice
assistant and you like the ability to
listen to music but it's just like kind
of an added benefit you're better off
looking at the echo or the Google home
or the Sonos one the home pilot 349 this
is not for you and number four if you're
an Android phone user even if you have
an Apple music subscription I'm gonna
help you out right now by giving you a
big Heil no to the home pot like this is
not for you so that's my Apple home pod
review this is just the start we'll see
how it evolves over time there you go
BT Z's Apple bite home pod take care
