Cena with the curvaceous and unlocked LG
G flex now as you can see the G flex
sports a vertically curved six inch
display the screen is indeed big but I'd
have to say the curve actually helps
make the size a bit more manageable it
does contour a little more comfortably
in your hand and against your face as
well because it had two 1280 by 720
pixel resolution the screen isn't as
crisp as LG's other high-end phones like
the g2 or the Nexus 5 which both have
1080p displays
however the arc in conjunction with the
sheer size of the handset makes gameplay
and media viewing and even just general
web browsing more immersive LG also says
the phone can withstand up to 88 pounds
of pressure in case you accidentally sit
or step on it and its rear body is
coated with a quote unquote self-healing
cover that's scratch resistant it's not
impenetrable obviously but I did find
that it does protect the handset from
day-to-day scratches and scuffs in
addition to a sizable three point 5
ampere hour battery that's also curved
the G flex is powered by a quad-core
Snapdragon 800 processor and an adrenal
330 GPU altogether the phone's
processing power is quite fast and my
experience has been altogether smooth
and reliable on the back here you'll
find a 13 megapixel camera that can
record 1080p HD video and you can also
have the option to record up to 60
frames per second for a fast-forward
sort of effect the camera also works in
conjunction with the rear power button
so when it lights up green you'll know
it's Auto face detection is focused and
you're ready to take that selfie on the
front you'll get a 2.1 megapixel camera
one new software goodie is a dual window
multitasking feature that lets you
easily display two apps side by side
there's also cue theatres where you can
launch your photos videos and YouTube
directly from the lock screen and their
swing lock screen which changes the
perspective of the lockscreen image
depending on how you hold the phone it's
similar to a parallax effect but it's a
bit choppy now the G flex is already
available in Korea and other parts of
Asia but there are rumors that the
device will head to the US on AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and t-mobile if you're really
itching to get it now however you can
by it online for oh just about 900 to
$1,000 unsubsidized no big deal
again I'm Lynn and you've been checking
out the LG G flex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
