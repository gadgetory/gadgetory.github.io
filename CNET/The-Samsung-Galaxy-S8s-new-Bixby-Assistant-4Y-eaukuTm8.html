just one digital helper for the Galaxy
s8 and s8 plus it's a it's actually more
like three you've got Bixby voice show
me
gallery photos from Melbourne which is
the closest thing to Apple Siri Google's
voice search and Amazon Alexa you can
trigger it by pressing and holding that
button below the volume rocker or you
can use a wakeboard
anyway this is where you ask the phone
to do things like change various phone
settings you can say turn on my mobile
hotspot or send this photo to Stephanie
but you can't ask it if you should wear
your galoshes or how to get wine stains
out of your couch so yeah that's pretty
limited for now
then there's Bixby home and this is more
like Google now with cards that share a
lot of information like yes the weather
and also news stories your step count
that sort of thing you can jump into the
settings to pick how much you want to
see and you can share items from here on
social networks or with friends you can
get here by swiping to the left of your
home screen
finally there's 6p vision this is
basically Samsung's version of Google
Goggles point the camera at an object
and let fix the visions so get in you
can learn more about wine including food
pairings search for a book and translate
more than 50 languages using Google
Translate there's a shopping tool in
here to some of our tests worked and
some did not
Samsung's still finalizing the software
so we've really got to cut it some slack
until Bixby's official launch and even
then Samsung will add more and more
features as time goes on so for now
we'll consider this a taste of what's to
come the big speed we've got our eye on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
