embarrassment to be honest that worst of
oxymorons a starter Mercedes but thanks
to a serious facelift it at least prints
real Benz now let's see if that's just a
look as we drive the 2012 mercedes-benz
SL k 350 and check the tech okay here in
the center this LCD display the command
interface and the Associated knob are
standard on this guy but this 5.8 inch
4:3 ratio screen looks a little cramped
even in a car that's a little cramped
and as many Mercedes as I've driven with
this interface and this logic of menus
it never gets intuitive to me this multi
ribbon thing needs a rethink I think
let's go to our audio sources you get
there without the radio button or the
disc button which brings up the ribbon
at the top you can poke around HD radio
and bluetooth streaming or standard but
USB and USB iPod and satellite radio are
part of a $2,600 package that includes
some other stuff you may not want and
navigation with its associated traffic
and weather are part of yet another
package for $2,100 that will also
include stuff I bet you don't care about
like a hard drive for ripping music -
that you'll seldom use and an SD card
slot that I suspect you'll never use now
of course the most important piece of
tech on this car is the twenty second
retractable power roof but within that
you got a couple choices we have the
standard $500 option for a shaded glass
panel but you can also do a $2,500
option for the magic sky glass which
would be tinted electrochromic Lee now
Mercedes is out early on giving you an
app to connect to your car works on the
iPhone right now it's called the embrace
app it allows you to send addresses to
the car locate the car a mile away
remote lock it or even let friends
easily send you their location for the
nav system to take you to them
now the 350 part of SLK 350 tells you
you've got a three and a half liter
engine v6 your only choice puts out 302
horsepower 273 foot-pounds of torque
which gets this 3,400 pound up to 60 in
about 5.6 seconds while delivering 2029
mpg and all that power goes out through
a similar one choice only gearbox a
7-speed automatic that has three modes
sport manual and economy as well as
paddle shifters and a little slap gain
on the stick let's see how it all works
now on the road here's the problem with
the SLK 350 ik and put it all into one
word for you when I first got in the car
and hadn't researched it yet I thought
it was a turbo 4 that's not a good thing
for a v6
there's prodigious power but it's very
peaky and surging it's kind of like a
two-position throttle you're either on
or you're off not cool not a car I want
to take on an interesting road the
7-speed automatic is a very smart
gearbox but it tends to be one of those
that seeks those overly tall gears all
the time which combined with the engines
pickiness is not fun it's really nice in
manual mode but if I wanted a car with a
manual gearbox I would have bought a car
with a manual gearbox and here's the one
that drives me nuts coming to a stop
right now and as I do sell and come to a
nice full complete legal stop the car is
going to put its brakes on in a hold
mode I'm off the pedal now we're not
going anywhere and it always does that
it's a small thing but it adds a little
bit of a delay every time you start from
a stop which in stop-and-go traffic
makes me nuts and I checked all the
settings I don't believe there's any way
to turn it off by default it always does
that okay here's my bottom line on the
SLK 350 major and successful redesign on
the front end is let down by a
dopey-looking
and small car rear end that peaky motor
is a pain in the ass to drive and you
got to listen to that farty exhaust
system the whole time to get it loaded
up with all the tech gear we want CNET
style you got to pick and choose from a
whole bunch of really expensive packages
and those are on top of an already kind
of i popping $55,000 base price this car
is answering a question that nobody
asked honestly its twice as much money
but just wait till you can afford a real
SL
