dies in the middle of the day but this
new Lenovo s 860 smartphone wants that
never to happen because it has an
absolutely massive battery so let's
start by talking about that enormous
power reserve this phone has a four
thousand milliamp hour battery lenovo
says that that will get you 24 straight
hours of 3G talktime or 40 days of
standby those are impressive battery
life claims especially because this
phone has quite a lot of powerful
hardware going on it's got a 5.3 inch
display that has eight 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution and it also has a 1.3
gigahertz quad-core processor there's
some pretty standard camera tech going
on here this is an 8 megapixel camera on
the back and if I spin it so it's facing
forward this one on the front is 1.6
megapixel it's running Android 4.2 which
isn't the very latest version but if
those battery life claims are really
true then we might not mind too much we
won't know for sure though until we get
it in for a review and we can put it
through our full battery of exhaustive
tests in fact this thing has so much
batteries that Lenovo thinks you'll be
able to use it to charge your other
gadgets if you plug this connector into
the bottom you can see that you can
charge any other device over USB it's
going to cost three hundred and forty
nine dollars when it comes out in June
