of a mouthful of the name but it is a
smartphone Kimble I've been using it
with the iPhone 10 this is what I love
about it and what I don't love about it
that much so I want to start off talking
about the price this is a hundred and
thirty dollars and it's producing really
cinematic quality results that to me is
like a game-changer a lot of the other
gimbals I've used to being pretty
expensive including the first generation
of the DJI Osmo so I really like the
price point on this one but that being
said it has been built to a price point
because it doesn't feel necessarily as
refined as the previous version but a
little bit more plasticy but overall
it's very functional like all of the
buttons and controls are in a really
good place i all positioned really
nicely and inside the handle here this
battery is absolutely massive like I
don't think I've needed to charge this
more than about three or four times in
the past like two months I'd say because
it's just lasts and lasts it reaches
great so I think they say it's about 15
hours and I've definitely found that to
be true I also love how there is a USB a
on the back here and you can actually
use that to charge like any other device
that you have that being said I wish
that this port on the side where you
actually charge the entire device was
USB see it's actually just micro USB and
so just because everyone's moving
towards USB see and I just feel like I
have more of those cables around I just
wish it was USB C but of course it was
built to a price point also at the
bottom
yeh look at this tripod mount I can
actually put it on a tripod if I want to
do any kind of selfies or anything like
that that is such a big deal for me I
want to talk about the stabilization now
cuz obviously that's the big feature and
that's the thing that you probably want
to know about so this has produced some
really amazing results for me like I
haven't
as impressed with the stabiliser as I
have been with this particular one
before just because it just seems to
kind of get it right all the time which
I love so I've been using it between the
DJI Go app which is actually the one
that you're supposed to use it with and
also the actual iPhone camera app as
well just the default camera app now the
reason why I've been using it with the
camera app the default one rather than
the DJI app is just because some of the
time I want to record in 4k 60 frames a
second and the DJI Go app cannot do that
right now I bet you like as soon as I
make this video there will be an update
to the app and they'll be like oh hey 4k
60 frames a second great amazing but
please do that like sooner rather than
later that would be lovely
so that's why I generally end up using
the iPhone camera app as well and one of
the downsides I know a lot of people
have been talking about the fact that
obviously if you're using with an iPhone
or a camera or a phone camera that has
internal optical image stabilization
also the stabilization from the gimbal
and it can kind of like counteract each
other and produce kind of like that
jelly-like effect I haven't encountered
that as much as some other people but it
is still present I actually found that
if I use the default camera app rather
than the DJI app it was a little bit
better overall so that's also another
reason why I use the default camera app
- okay so it sounds like I really like
it huh
I really do but there are some big
downsides some of them are particular to
my situation but I still want to run
them through with you just because I
think you might have the same issues
that I do with this thing big problem
number one for me is that I want to
record good quality audio with an
external mic rather than the internal
mic and I don't know if you can see this
configuration but that that is where the
Lightning port is and that is where the
end bracket is I cannot plug in an
external mic there right like it's just
not possible but here's a little hack I
actually worked out kind of how to do it
but it's a little bit janky it only
works about maybe 80% of the time which
is actually good enough for me but I'm
gonna show you Justin
case run into the same problem and you
kind of want to do something with an
external mic so here we go I'm gonna
take it off the mount so this only is
going to work if you're using this
selfie camera it's not going to work if
you're going to use the back camera
which is really unfortunate so I'm gonna
put the phone in backwards so we have
the Lightning port visible up here I
found this microphone this is I believe
a shure microphone with a lightning
adapter plug it in like so turn it on
hard for the best hope that it balances
correctly that's going to be a
difficulty if you have a mic that's
particularly heavy it's just not going
to want to do it okay so as you can see
it's balancing okay and so I've been
using this configuration if I want to
record something like me talking to
camera so that works the problem is the
microphone doesn't really communicate
very well with the DJI app and sometimes
it doesn't work so well either in the
default camera app that's a microphone
problem though because I've been reading
a bunch of things about it apparently it
just needs an update from Apple to kind
of get that compatibility 100% because
sometimes the audio drops out but for
what I needed it for I did a bunch of
testing before I recorded each clip and
it worked okay but still like please DJI
for the next version please please
please let me have some way of plugging
in an external microphone some sort of
accessory shoe just like make it easy
for me because this is a weird kind of
workaround it just it feels bizarre I
know it feels like it's not balanced
correctly as well so please please
please fix it I really want you two guys
to fix it because I want to use it like
be able to use that back camera as well
but it's not all bad with the DJI app
thankfully there are a couple of really
fun features that I loved using
including the motion time lapse and
hyperlapse mode so I did a walk up and
down the beach watching the sunset it
created this really cool cinematic clip
I know if I just did it using another
app without the stabilizer it was going
to look really shaky it wouldn't have
been very smooth or consistent so I
really appreciated that function and an
app that was a lot of fun and just
overall it makes me really just want to
shoot video which is a great thing the
fact that it is so cheap
means that I don't really mind if I do
maybe you know accidentally drop it
because I'm very clumsy I don't I
haven't haven't trust me I haven't
dropped it but I'm just saying if I did
it probably wouldn't be that huge of a
deal okay so in app then one other thing
that I wanted to mention that I wish
would be changed would be the ability to
use that 2 X optical zoom on the iPhone
10 or any other phone that has two
cameras with optical zoom because at the
moment you can obviously use the digital
zoom there is that zoom rocker there
that moves in and out but unfortunately
it's only using digital zoom and if I
have the optical zoom like I'm gonna
want to use that there's no reason to
use digital zoom really like it doesn't
look very good I just want to be able to
use that extra bit of optical length if
I can so that's why again I shoot with
the default camera so those are my
thoughts on the DJI Osmo mobile to let
me know what you think if you have also
been using it for about the same amount
of time I would love to hear your
comments to maybe you have a fix for
that external microphone issue there's
another way to do it it's not going to
be external audio guys because I'm not
gonna run external audio and sync it
with this I'm sorry I'm just not but if
you have a solution I'd love to hear it
just let me know your thoughts in
general about this or stabilisers find
me in the comments or you can find me on
twitter as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
