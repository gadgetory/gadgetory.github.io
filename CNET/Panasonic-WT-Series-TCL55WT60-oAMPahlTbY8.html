2013 taking a look at Panasonic's
flagship LED televisions this is the WT
60 series okay so this television comes
in two sizes you can have it in either
47 inches or if that's not quite big
enough it comes in a 55 inch model as
well let's take a look at the design for
a moment because I really really love
this slim metallic bezel and I'm
particularly enamored I have to say with
this glass effect stand it it gives the
TV a kind of floating effect that I
think is quite attractive something else
to keep an eye on up here while we're
speaking about design is this camera
this is a webcam that pops up so that
you can do Skype chats and stuff using
your TV and it should pop up
automatically which is good news saves
you a few seconds of precious effort in
terms of display technology we've got
local dimming kicking off in here we've
also got Panasonic's clear panel Pro
text now it has to be said that previous
versions were a little bit dodgy when it
came to black levels so it remains to be
seen whether these new versions can
impress us and win our hearts back
elsewhere you get all the modern
comforts of a swanky Internet connected
television so you get VIERA Connect
which is Panasonic's smart TV system
that will give you web browsing apps
we've already mentioned Skype you also
get voice interaction so you can bark
orders or your television if it's not
doing what you think it should and you
get swipe and share which means you can
theme video photos things like that from
your smartphone onto your television so
an early thumbs up from me on the design
let's hope that the picture quality can
measure up there's no word on pricing
but it'll be out around springtime so we
don't have very long to wait I'm the
Westway for CNET and this is the
Panasonic W T 60 LED series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
