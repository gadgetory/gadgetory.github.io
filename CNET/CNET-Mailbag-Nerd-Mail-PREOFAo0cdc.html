to the cnet mailbag the show where we
read your feedback answer your questions
and open all your sketchy snail mail
actually I got a lot of good snail mail
this week and none of it was sketchy
like this wonderful card from Meggie who
just wrote to say thank you to me for
being an incredible role model Meggie
this was the nicest letter and thank you
very much for sending it also thanks to
dave was sent a self-addressed stamped
envelope so that he could get a sticker
but also included two stamps in case
someone else forgot their postage Dave
you get an extra sticker an FYI everyone
we are now out of stickers so don't send
me your emails or stamps I'll let you
know when I get more or when you can buy
them in the meantime they have trickled
out into the world here's an example of
one in the wild all right now for some
kudos for jason howell our podcast
producer here at seen it Jim rights hey
Jason just got a look at the new podcast
central page and it looks much better
than before not as cluttered download
speeds have improved which I got to say
was far more important thanks know
you've been taking a lot of crap because
of slow downloads and other technical
issues that you've had no control over
so you should also get the much deserved
compliments when you fix the problems
Jim you are so right about that and yes
Sean echoes all our feelings when he
says I just want to say I love the new
podcast central thank you smiley face
the redesign is finally live and you can
actually find things and see things on
the page and it looks so beautiful Jason
deserves a major fruit basket for
pushing that sucker through okay and now
for a little geek mail aankhen Ireland
had a little note on her quick tip about
killing stubborn processes on the Mac he
says you're teaching people how to use
Linux through under the guise of
Macintosh hilarious I remember being
taught the same thing when I ran into
problems on my first dubu to box next
teach them how to add a uuid to fstab so
the drive will remount after a crash LOL
and fred hag writes about the same tip
tech pronunciation is usually pretty
good on cnet TV IE i rarely notice
mistakes however there have been three
to five problems in the last
weeks what finally took me to the point
of providing feedback was Wilson tangs
stop stubborn programs on a Mac quick
tip he pronounced pseudo as pseudo
similar to the martial art of judo
rather than sudu pronunciation mistakes
like this focus the audience attention
on the fact that the personalities are
not knowledgeable and simply reading
copy I am sure there is not much time to
check such things but there should be
some mechanism for this I'm actually
Fred hag as we all know pseudo stands
for super user do and so I can totally
understand why you would have to
pronounce it soo do and in fact it is
officially pronounced soo do but
wikipedia notes that it is commonly also
pronounced pseudo and in fact there is a
raging debate in the open source
community about the proper pronunciation
as evidenced by multiple heated forum
threads but thank you for noticing and
before we go one final bit of crazy mail
for Wilson dear Wilson tang I think your
name rhymes with Bureau Wang Scarlett
O'Hara I mean that's true it does rhyme
with that so okay that's it for this
week send me your questions and comments
email me at mailbag at cnet com or send
your snail mail 2 235 second street san
francisco california 94 105 thank you
for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
