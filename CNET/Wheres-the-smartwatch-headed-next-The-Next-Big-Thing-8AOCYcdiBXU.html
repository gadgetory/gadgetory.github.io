know what time it is
I'm Brian Cooley from CNET always in
search of the next big thing to many
market watchers the SmartWatch sector is
still running about five minutes slow if
you know what I mean
we've had four major tech events CES
Mobile World Congress an Apple event and
Facebook f8 and none of them moved the
ball forward for the SmartWatch Apple
introduced some new watchbands
Fitbit brought out basically a Fitbit
with some very basic notifications and
pebble they'd off a quarter of their
staff the most encouraging headline for
the SmartWatch market so far has been
that smartwatches now just eclipsed the
sales of Swiss made watches by about a
million units that's a little bit like
saying though that you sell more cars
than bugatti swiss watches are a tiny
sliver of the 1.2 billion unit overall
watch market which smartwatches have
what maybe four percent of now still
many analysts guessed that the
SmartWatch market will move from 30
million units sold in 2015 to about 50
million sold in 2016
not quite the magic doubling figure that
many look for to see a red-hot market
but substantial it could be early days
for the SmartWatch in its trio phase if
you will before the iPhone arrived to
really throw gas on the fire or we could
be at the beginning of an early sunset
to be honest among the trends to look
for are perhaps the idea of a slightly
simpler mission for the SmartWatch that
is then going to continue to focus on
being a high-fashion timepiece that's a
way to speak to a very large market that
is already in place also the cost of
admission to be in the smartphone market
now clearly includes elaborate health
fitness and wellness sensors on its
underside Dick Tracy might be
disappointed by all this but sometimes a
little less a little leaner tech is the
path to market adoption
