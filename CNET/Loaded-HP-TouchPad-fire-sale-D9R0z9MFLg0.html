inventory fire sale touch pads began
liquidating at retailers around the
country for just ninety nine dollars for
the 16 gigabyte version and a hundred
and forty nine dollars for the 32

supplies have run out and HP may not
have endeared itself to retailers who
are trying to sell touch pads against
five hundred dollar android tablets when

stole much of the keynotes Thunder by
leaking screenshots and videos of the

Apple about a civil case skype has
announced it has acquired it group me
