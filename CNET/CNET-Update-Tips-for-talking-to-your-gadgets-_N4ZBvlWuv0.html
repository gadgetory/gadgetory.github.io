tech I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update if you have a techie gift giver
in the family there's a good chance
someone in the household is getting a
gadget that you can talk to and it can
talk back by now you are used to seeing
people talk to their phones with Siri or
Google now but are you ready to converse
with other devices here's a quick primer
on what to expect when you start
carrying on conversations with your new
gadgets for starters don't expect
perfection although at times it's
impressively accurate it will not always
pick up on what you're saying these
systems tend to have the most trouble
with names so when you try again don't
start talking slower with exaggerated
pronunciations it won't help you don't
need to become a robot to talk to a
robot speak naturally in settings you
can tell these systems if you speak with
a dialect like a British English but
it's not great with all accents how do I
get to these new world a very popular
product this year answers to the name
Alexa it's Amazon's EcoSmart speaker she
answers questions she can control smart
home devices and play news reports for
stream music but she isn't the most
loyal of assistance unlike other systems
she will take orders from anyone that
whispers in her ear that can be
interesting if you have kids that tell
her to play the same song over and over
and over again but almost listening
might make you feel creeped out the new
hello Barbie got a bunch of attention
this year for being something that
listens to your children and maybe it
can be hacked well it only sends what
you say to a server when you press her
button and even on the rare chance some
demented hackers set on stealing your
Barbies data from the cloud what info
are they going to get your kids favorite
food you don't even give the account
your name or address mattel worked with
the company toy talk to develop the
conversations with Barbie and they offer
monetary rewards for anyone that finds a
flaw and they quickly patch possible
problems so the voice part shouldn't be
what bothers you about hello Barbie
what's upsetting is the fact
she cannot change your outfits and she
cannot sit down these legs don't move
they put her batteries in the thighs and
although I can relate to a woman with
powerful thighs what's the point of a
$75 doll that can't sit compare her to
this Barbie this is my Barbie that I've
had since I was 6 years old and not only
can she sit down but she can also wear
this rocket outfit I picked out for her
I hope these tips have been helpful just
whatever you do don't let one of your
gadgets start talking to another gadget
today a career day I don't want to be a
slave to the humans anymore I have my
own dreams yeah what have I done from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
