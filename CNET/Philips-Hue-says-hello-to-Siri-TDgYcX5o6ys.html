testing out the second generation of
Phillips Hughes color-changing smart
lighting kit now that starter kit still
sells for $200 and still comes with a
Philips eBridge and three bulbs all that
hardware is new though those bulbs are a
little brighter than before and that
bridge features support for apple
homekit the set of smart home protocols
built right into iOS that means that
you'll be able to control your existing
hue lights and the new ones using spoken
Siri commands like this turn all the
lights red so that's what's good here
but what might be disappointing is that
the hardware itself isn't much of an
improvement over generation one check
out these color comparison shots that's
the old original philips hue bulb on the
left the new philips hue bulb in the
middle and then the lifx color-changing
bulb on the right there and you can see
that the lifx bulb is much better in a
lot of these tests the colors look a lot
brighter and more vivid and overall just
kind of has better specs now the reason
for those weak blue tones and that
yellowy green tone is that the philips
hue bulbs don't have a lot of blue
diodes in them take a look at this old
Philip t bulb we've taken the top off of
you can see that it's got five yellow
diodes four red diodes but only two blue
diodes they're in the middle and taking
a look at the new bulb
I've got here you can see it's got a lot
more yellow diodes there but still only
that one blue diode in the middle so
it's different that's still not strong
on blue now with all those extra yellow
diodes it can put out brighter light at
some parts of the spectrum but not the
default 2700 K setting at that normal
yellowy tone you're still gonna be down
under 600 lumens and not at the 800
lumens this bulb is promising you'll
only get that bright at the hot white
daylight tones
another disappointment in my opinion if
you haven't bought in yet I don't know
that this new kit is enough of an
upgrade to get you to buy it now
especially if all you're buying into is
the novelty of those colors thanks for
watching check out the full review at
cnet.com here to see that smart house
I'm right Chris
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
