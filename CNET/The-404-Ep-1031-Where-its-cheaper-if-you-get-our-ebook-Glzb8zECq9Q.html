tuned into the 44 show on Sina TV I'm
Jeff Bakalar and I'm Justin you and this
is the show where it's cheaper if you
get our ebook it is cheaper we'll talk
all about that in a little bit but first
allow us to introduce our guest in the
studio today mr. Scott Steiner just
scored touchdowns and referred like
expression how are you man I'm great
it's been a really really long time
since you've been on I yeah it's been
like least six months I yeah but welcome
back we're going to have you here what's
going on in your life how's how's it
going here at seen it oh good well we
say goodbye to labs cast so I'm like a
unless your podcast is this type of guy
all right well hopefully we can help you
fill the void here today yeah so Scott's
gonna be on we got a lot to talk about
there's a lot going on that we can
discuss that Scott has written about
recently things he could lend his a fine
expert opinion on which is why we bring
him on the show cuz he's such an expert
you are no oh no gonna it all fall apart
is all special now um so yeah the show
title sort of leads into what we want to
get going on today this is a big news
making headlines Apple got sued by the
who they got sued by I think five yes of
the major publishers so this is a big
deal because everyone's up in arms
saying hey you know why are you price
gouging on ebooks and I've heard a lot
of people sort of giving mixed messages
some people say hey ebook should be a
you know a fraction of the price right
because they cost nothing to manufacture
right but I feel like people don't
realize and our buddy Nathan on cnet
wrote this up yesterday right if you
don't realize like the main cost of a
book is not printing on paper right
there's a lot of other production costs
and time and effort that goes into the
process aside from making and
manufacturing a book right absolutely
so ya going no sigh I mean I've never
published a book although right and to
at some point of course we all do
Richard's looks coming on next week got
that working on so when switch cameras
by Richard Peterson pitch for
unpublished book go place a pre-order
for it now right on even though there
isn't one the other thing is that i
think the real trade-off comes from yeah
everybody's getting kind including Apple
and Amazon breaking cuts that hadn't
been taken before right so people have
to adjust for that but I think I keep
thinking about one of our colleagues
here at seen it david carr knowing i'll
speak on his behalf but i know he was
experimenting with witty publishing and
stuff like that and i think it's like
apps i mean at some point where do you
price that book or that app that if you
can sell it for maybe a couple of bucks
right that you could sell so many more
copies and you're making more money in
the long run sure then if you were
selling and turning people off and being
able to climb the charts and get sort of
noticed i think that's uh that's the key
because then you then it's not about how
much money costs about how much money
you can pull in right cuz i just things
like ten dollars plus just turns
everyone off i think there is a sweet
spot for for e-books i think what a lot
of people are confused / upset about is
the fact that some kindle books cost
more than the actual softcover the
paperback yes which is ridiculous and
that to me should just not be the case
because of the reasons we just explained
how it does now there are production
costs and and obviously printing on
paper isn't the main crux of the actual
production of a book right but at the
same time it's like okay but when it
comes to comparing both at you know
products don't tell me that the digital
version is pricier than the thing I'm
actually holding in my hands that just
doesn't make sense now it's and it
always has to adjust for that they
should always shows be at least at least
a dollar cheaper yeah make it a dollar
cheaper it's just it seems crazy and
there should be some discount me for a
lot of lot of the hottest books now it
seems like there's practically no
discount right yeah especially if you're
buying any place that's offering you
some sort of hardcover discount when you
buy it for sure at that store for sure
it's good it's ridiculous you should
check out the link in our show notes
today is a really interesting read about
this i was watching CNN this morning and
there's this guy who was just like
giving misinformation
he was literally just like I forget what
his name was but it was pissing me off
he was saying like he's like it's crazy
d book should be 99 cents all of them
and the woman interviewing him was not
taking into consideration like up yeah I
think it's still a big you know cost in
making a book think about they gotta pay
the author they gotta pay editors I got
there's a whole office of Africa office
building a people working on a book and
this guy's like it should be free I'm an
idiot if you like thanks for setting the
record straight they moved on there's
the truth yeah what about things like uh
what was that I author uh I bought it it
was iBooks Author talking about yep
earlier this year what about that though
I mean those authors should be able to
charge whatever they want through you
can if you do if you publish your own
break in Smash words yeah you could take
a you know and then up and then Apple or
Amazon just takes a cut but they're
talking about big-name publisher like if
you self-publish and you self-edit you
do all the work yourself you can make it
ten cents it's fine right you know
anyway uh it's what possibly Tosh for
books then I don't know man or an e-book
is you you know like a 99-cent model
person is the itunes but i notice people
are willing to pay i think with the
amazon with the kindle first introduced
ten bucks for a new book i think that's
fair because um first of all if it's a
really popular book everyone's going to
want to get on board i think if you go
into specialty books that's where i
think you almost could earn the right to
charge more yeah like what what you mean
a big psychology research like a text
books or anything yeah or like a whole
book full of like case studies and some
sort of a you know thing almost feels
academic and you can charge maybe 18
bucks because how many people are going
to buy that but right but i think like
anything that's a that's a main release
fiction like the sort of thing you want
to put on a front shelf and get
attention should be 10 bucks and then
back catalog stuff has to be less yeah
yeah it just has to be you have to drop
the price at some point as you go in
other printings yeah the version of what
we other printing of course that's the
gravy and it's like why would you keep
charging um like this weird back
catalogue book would be there or
sometimes twelve or fourteen dollars
yeah I don't get it I don't get it
either um so basically uh so what do we
know what happened with the lawsuit is
there any sort of like resolution with
this whole thing I thought they said
that it wasn't going to proceed any
further that that was the last thing I
read amazon promise
that they're going to drop prices on
their books yes what there was a story
this morning right I don't let's let
them fight at it you know I mean let
them start trying to compete with each
other well as prices go down yes Amazon
wants to undercut maybe that's how they
got to the ten dollar price in the
beginning was right where I'm they were
subsidizing part of the price to be lost
leader uh-huh and and then I think there
was this whole um you know there a lot
of publishing backlash because they said
no the price all has to be right as you
know we want consistency on the product
I think Amazon's gonna go back to you
know gang prices down to that ten dollar
which havior kennel owner that's great
awesome I don't know i mean if amazon is
is paying that the rest of that that I
don't see how that hurts if they want to
be a lost everyone take the loss
themselves for sure I don't know but it
will create a sense of perception that
you'd say I'm okay with that where's my
ten dollar notebook where's my ten
dollar minus book my nut book alright my
I books we're gonna move along um I want
to play this video that leads into a
story have you heard about this guy Kane
and his cardboard arcade where is key
this is a big deal yes made me cry cry
yes here's those very hard where I know
dating I I did weep all right let's uh I
believe her name is Hannah let's listen
to her video voice mijnheer high 40 for
this is england from hannah and and you
guys were asking on a previous show for
more videos so I thought I'd oblige yeah
I wanted to talk about a viral internet
video something called and Caine's
Arcade I don't know whether you've
talked about it yet or not I'm a few
episodes behind and it was just really
awesome and it kind of linked in with
Jeff and you went to the arcade thing
and I thought this was really cool and
the little boy in it came he's I cannot
say enough about how creative and
inventive he is my wish I had this sort
of like little kids ability to problem
solve it's amazing um anyway yeah love
the show I so thanks for the video
voicemail Hannah like we said
ninety-five percent success rate hey
keep sending them in so this is a really
heart-warming touching story
where this guy came monroy he's a 9 year
old who is obsessed with the whole like
carnevale arcade sort of uh scene that
sort of atmosphere and he took it upon
himself to basically turn his dad's is
like a repair shop they used auto part
yeah east LA and easily him converted a
section of it if not the whole freaking
thing yeah into his own cardboard arcade
really cool it is really cool and it's
very cute um is he being exploited by
the internet a little bit not be there
just look it's great it's it's a
bringing attention to and I appreciate
that and I am so so the story is that
you know this kid pretty much built an
entire arcade with all kinds of like
chucky cheese style carnival games right
he had like a crane game you had like
bowling bowling yet he had a version of
skee-ball and like prizes that you could
can that you can cash in your yet tokens
for your he goes underneath and feeds
the tickets through the slide yes I said
he goes into the box he crawls internet
and their calculators taped on regulate
like they would sell I think they say
who's clever they so like this was like
a dollar per play yeah yeah my past but
that's where my dollars yes like I'm you
paid one dollar yeah you can get two
plays out of any arcade machine but if
you pay two dollars you get a fun pass
which equals 5 500 deal in a sense is
this not just like a Wes Anderson movie
personified as little joy like you was
like did was entering have a dream and
you were created you know in your bed
you're totally right it's so true it's a
DIY you know very uh oh great you know
elaborate details of their proneural
care for sure yeah so they organized a
flash mob for this kid on back in LA
reddit and Facebook right because a lot
of people were passing by his dead shop
ready to be in East LA not a lot of foot
traffic there yeah so they organized
like it looked like maybe a hundred
fifty two hundred and around the block
is kind of crazy so so is there video
that there's a video so what's on Cena
he was probably really excited right I
wasn't it awesome for him his dad took
him out you know with the idea that when
he came back he knew that they were
organizes flash my surprise right and we
comes around the corner he almost seems
kind of like all right this is what I
intended or he was like oh it's gonna be
a busy one today you know he quietly
smiling and everyone's got signs and
they're high-fiving him I thought almost
went a little too far kind of felt like
I wanted the in-between yeah just like
20 interested people this becomes like
you know all the hipster party where
everybody like and that's what I mean
when I say he got a little excited cuz a
little bit you know the hipster scene
was like oh what a great way to show off
my cinematography I want to see the seat
orly everybody smells be part of this
exam on experience yeah but I do want to
go I hope it gets put on the map of all
the weird la things ya better worth
looking at like weird la the museum of
jurassic technology like now you love
that stuff i love it for sure no
watching video of him right now he's
insanely cute and he so what I admire
about him is that he's so dedicated to
the cause and he so he takes it so
seriously and it's just like of course
this is what I'm doing I'm making my own
cardboard arcade what are you doing you
know I have I'm nine and I have a full
working arcade what are you doing and
it's just really cute i love it it's
great story what's gonna happen tomorrow
though when no one shows up to his
arcade I don't know it's gonna be the
one to say it right like you're right
there should be another more depressing
movie about him it's not depressing
about the press well like that's the
problem flash mobs and things like that
is they just like run the gamut the
secondary rough it's gonna be a good
it's gonna be a good business yes I give
up girl so it's cruel but funny yes I
think that there with all this coverage
that's that's happening now the third
the second wave i think that people but
it could be like one person one day to
write people think belgium it doesn't it
will have some sort of touristy feel and
who knows if that'll plateau or trail
off or whatever it is but the kid got is
15 minutes and that's all a
nine-year-old can ask for right this is
already more than I would have ever
hoped for he's got his own shirt you
know who get sponsored by some elected
quite a lot this race talking about the
prizes he gives out yeah all the gamers
and he doesn't he afford real prizes so
he gives away his old toys right as
prizes yeah I mean maybe though you know
what the best thing to come out of this
yeah uh Hollywood will like buy his
story was Anderson you know was and
westerns it'll direct and somehow he'll
save the town right you know it's got
like that be kind rewind sort of thing
going on with it lute Olson can play his
father yeah yeah that's what will happen
and Alec Baldwin will narrate and you
guys have any kind of entrepreneurial
companies when you were little did you
guys sell things like a lemonade stand
on so cliche yeah anything like that um
no not really I don't that's a good
question I unfortunately know about you
Skye you uh down like you you had some
sort of repair shop I did it really was
interesting the idea of like carnival
and mechanical stuff but I did try to
build a time machine uh you know with a
friend right I remember reading Omni ok
ya zina we were convinced this would
work but it was like everything is
cardboard about it started with a
cardboard box yeah and tin cans yeah the
amazing thing is that at the age of six
um I really believe this is gonna work
yeah and that's it no I'm kid I said we
SAT for a little bit yeah and you're
like we're not going anywhere yeah and
then we just kind of like so wasn't
rayon tripping or in charge it's a cute
story for sure we bad if I did it now
when I know yes then people be looking
at you it's it reminds me of that scene
in Napoleon Dynamite music have you ever
thought about time drivers like yes only
every day of my life you know did not
get you some well it just buys one on
the freaking internet it's so funny
let's take a break when we come back
more 404 with Scott Stein and we're
going to talk about Hollywood speaking
of them running out of ideas has
Hollywood lost its way I think we have a
bunch of people in here who would love
to speak on that topic so stick around
there's a lot more for for coming your
way right after this we'll see you after
the break this is the 404
effers the show where we all sing songs
Hey look at the 44 sorry that video was
so jump that's fine so tell us tell us
more about this video so this is a watch
called pebble yeah Scott I put this in
the right now because I know that you're
big fan of watches you think you're big
watch key to our in the Nano yes sir you
where the Nano I don't use it for music
I'm embarrassed to say that on camera um
this is an ipod nano using a hex vision
watch band and I i like it because i
think it's a really cool-looking digital
watch and you know you can press the
that's cool it's like an e-ink style
looking display i really like that yeah
and it was like 18 different watch faces
that are built in eighteen yeah that's
pretty cool wish they would sell others
but I like it for that and the fact that
the watch band actually looks nice and
it looks like a real watch it doesn't
look like you're wearing an Anna right
which is I hated those big lego-style
yeah bands and you don't use it for
music no although I should but doesn't
make any sense but uh no I just I like
cool digital watches and it's the it's a
cooler one than ones I've seen I don't
run I've even looked on on watch these
mode stuff and I don't know I the Tokyo
flash stuff to me too complicated too
over the top right it's like oh cool
there's a literally an hour glass on my
watch yeah I want something cool and
like diesel does up and then there are
too many dials and like steampunk
leather things they stick on area so I
just like the minimalism but I do wish
that it were what water resistant and
didn't have the 30 pin so i like the
idea of these other watch accessories
I'm keeping an eye on them I'm curious
to see what emerges it seems like there
are a lot of them lately yeah this this
pebble um you know they're on
Kickstarter now they've raised almost a
million bucks crazy they were they met
their goal of a hundred thousand dollars
in two hours which is crazy i started
the kickstarter yeah they had a good
idea you're gonna get money yeah you
know isn't i think it well who's gonna
be the first person to just gain
kickstarter and just have like a great
fake video and like look what we're able
to do in a lab and they'll just have
like a hoverboard right I'm machine and
we just need fifty thousand dollars and
they raised it and then it says here
take the money and run yeah I will tell
you I'm gonna rob Kickstarter blind
that's what you're gonna do
do that how to do it oh man we shouldn't
talk about this um so but it seems
really cool it seems like there's really
like a lot of potential for people just
to completely customize their own watch
yeah and that to me is something that
I've thought about for a while having
the ability to make my watch look
exactly the way I want to yeah this is
cool because I feel like most watches
really try hard to have you don't have
like a high res display this is a really
simple idea on a SmartWatch yeah it
connects to your Android or iPhone you
only see a lot of watches i connect your
iPhone raise that is ok but this is
Bluetooth and you can do all the stuff
that you know that you just mentioned on
your nano pretty awesome play your music
check your email whatever and it's email
ok so you can see it on you know pretty
much any surface and sunlight whatever
man they've had 24 people give a
thousand bucks they've had four people
give 12 Wow no one's pretty cool too i
would wear this why would not about my
specialist now it looks like it'll have
internet connectivity yeah well it
connects through bluetooth so it can
read anything on your phone like that
weather thing that seems really cool the
way I mean yeah that's what I wish the
Nano had right now the ability to
basically connect with your iphone and i
can write so I just got the music but I
can't you check whether we're basic
messages it's pretty cool we'll link to
it in the show notes today I want to
talk about this article i read this is
going back a couple months from short of
the week have you ever been to that site
it's a really cool site no school um
it's titled has Hollywood lost its way
yes and a big I guess reason that this
was written was because when the when
the author of the article looked back at
the top 10 grossing films of 2011 it
found out that believe it or not eight
of the ten or sequels okay and the other
two were adaptations there hasn't been
more than half original films in the top
10 grossing in the US since 1981 when
out of the 10 top grossing films they
are seven of them were original it's
what's funny too is out of those eight
original films that
in 1981 several of them have their own
sequels that exist today right Arthur
was recreated exactly there's another
Superman there's been three other
Superman's I didn't realize Time Bandits
was in the top 10 grossing films of 19
isn't that awesome amazing awesome too
so it's basically every 10 years from
1980 12 2011 yeah in 1991 there was only
one so in just ten years it went from
seven to one back up to two in 2001 but
I'm sorry pearl harbor is not original
even you know what I mean yeah like get
out of here right ah and monsters inc
fine 2011 not one original title broke
through the top ten and now the two
adaptations were Thor and Captain
America which are you know connected to
the to the Marvel canon exactly like
sequels in some weird way even more
shocking the only original story in the
top 15 films of 2011 clocked in at
number 14 that's bridesmaids yeah and
that was the only original one to break
the top 15 Wow franchises from 2001 that
were still being supported 10 years
later last year in 2011 right Harry
Potter one right in 2001 to harry potter
eight and twenty eleven number ten and
two thousand one was Planet of the Apes
number nine and twenty eleven Rise of
the Planet of the Apes number 14 in 2001
the best and the furious and number six
and twenty eleven yeah best 5c I don't
know what we were arguing earlier that
it's an issue of waning creativity that
it is what short of the week is I think
it might actually have something to do
with lowered box office numbers right
maybe it's it I'm not gonna buy this
Hollywood not want to take a gamble I
understand and they and every day they
are direct n is gonna sell really well
shrek 10 is gonna do gangbusters yeah i
think it's that I think it's multiplexes
to in terms of where you get to see
these movies you have 10 screens and
then five get taken over for a weekend
right to show the hottest movie because
again they want the biggest return for
sure and and so yeah you end up with
movies getting flash mobbing themselves
into screens and then disappearing in
two weeks and then you know like I tried
to look around New York City New
york city and i have a week where my
family's away and i have money to burn i
wanna go see a movie I've passed as but
I passed on seeing a movie because
nothing is nothing i mean i think me an
old man there's nothing it's a terrible
selection movies yeah if you like a
total failure in that sense of Hollywood
right now how how did they not succeed
in getting me to go to a movie other
than hunger games but the thing is is
that there are original ideas out there
it does it does seem that the current
trend is obviously adapting a book or
adapting a comic and that but they've
been adapting book since the dawn of
cinema okay so that's nothing new and
I'm okay with them doing that Hunger
Games is an example that's fine but I
just AM worried about where the focus is
shifting and it seemed that I don't know
when you had your little miss sunshine's
and you're Napoleon Dynamite's and that
sort of thing it did seem like that
indie scene even though the latter the
former little miss sunshine was not an
independent film I mean it just wasn't
right um it was treated like that and
there were sort of this like branding
that they were able to do to some films
that would give it that indie feel like
we're not gonna release this in thirty
five hundred theaters just 2,500 you
know and you gonna have to drive an
extra mile to see this one yeah but did
feel like original films work on the
rise and they were gonna get their time
and I don't know it just stopped it
comes and goes I mean maybe to an 2011
is also a bit of an off year to compare
because you have like inception before
that okay so you should have in it you
know he's been making pretty independent
films although they're big budget films
what a loopers coming out which is that
directory and John send it to brick okay
um and then I think of duncan jones who
did he did uh moon and he also did one
was awesome juicy moon gem is great and
then there the jake gyllenhaal movie
which was about where we kept going into
the same period of time was a bit like
other movies cheering crash i forget the
name source code source code yeah i was
a little let down that but i thought
again a little bit of its out there um I
gotta be honest with you guys when you
talk about how much Hollywood has sucked
lately and how there are no movies out I
disagree with you well you also have a
really bad taste no I've seen a lot
of awesome movie 90 drive for example
okay that's an original story they're
yellin kaalia the Lars von Trier movie i
watch that only it was amazed amazed
great really really what is a call i
write exam in first class that might be
a sequel that doesn't really really good
sure i don't know i mean if you look at
you know it's easy to pick out hunger
games would be like that movie sucked no
I didn't see homie no I heard it I heard
it was good I didn't like it yeah but
it's a timing availability and
distribution too i think it was back to
that it again in the city here um you
know where were these us be your
fingertips i'd say an amazing number of
these movies get put into the indian
movie houses for everyone's you don't
think like david cronenberg's uh movie
dangerous method then I last church I
liked a lot through David Cronenberg is
pretty well known quantity for sure he
pretty much got marginalized for a lot
of it we didn't blow anything up in it
right yeah he's a blow-up Freud next day
but that's the thing in that's that's
what I'm more worried about cuz like I
said there are great ideas out there
there have to be you know there are
still smart people around is there more
that you want to see that hasn't been
made yet it no I don't know I just like
seeing something original okay you know
I like seeing something that oh I never
thought of that cool let's go see that
now let's go check that out you want it
you want your mind blown I do I want my
mama flo's on the reg however that for
sure when the matrix first came out
right away my mind I want that feeling
and I just haven't been able to get that
feeling I thought inception was gonna do
that for me and it didn't yet it get
halfway it gave it left me hangin it
gave me I was blue balled from inception
okay that's that's the analogy i'm gonna
use cuz that's really how I felt um but
yeah I just and I don't like I said the
originality is there it's just the
studio's decision to deliberately you
know thwart that which I'm a little I
guess bitter over I feel the same way
with Hollywood to some degree about
video games was funny like last night
but going over to like see stuff it with
sony and like not to me anything
particular but like Santa Monica Studios
which is their independent game group
they are the ones who made journey and
it was made all those other like games i
know that game company did journey
I mean sorry I didn't make journey but I
mean they are but said Monica Studios is
the organization that has curated sure
that game company curated pixel drunk
and a lot of these things that you think
of as the cool indie stuff that
sometimes has been discouraged right
question at Sony right on the
PlayStation group and I think I think
thank goodness there they exist thank
God they exist but I worry about that in
games about the fugly the courage to go
forward oh yeah it's a problem in every
media it's it you say like it's over
music apologies it's everywhere
everywhere yeah is absolutely everywhere
and luckily we have Justin to fix the
problem I'll watch all the crappy movies
you will single-handedly you you will
raise the box office thank you my god my
guess is finally that I think that a lot
of that any stuff is being not
marginalized but it's being shunted off
like in games it's an ipad apps there's
some interesting things going on not all
of it but people can find other like
flash games ways that they can do stuff
cheaply and so I don't they skip the
circuit books they might say welcome to
self-publish if I want to be really
independent movies they might go to
youtube or vimeo or they might make
their own projects that they put online
yeah if they really care about it and
say you know what so that might be part
of it that it's almost providing this
outlet for the for the truly independent
yeah that it's no longer going up the
chain i don't know i think what it boils
down to you know I complain a lot about
popular music I think it's crap but at
the end of the day there still is really
good music out there yeah and to say
that like oh this generation just sucks
it's kind of cheap to just say that
you're just getting older and that's
that's how we look at it because you
were only exposed to the real big
blockbuster sort of stuff what that
feeling that you had when you were 16 17
you felt passion like when you saw the
matrix and something even though
measures more blockbuster maybe the
blockbuster stuff is not as good as the
blockbuster stuff 20 years ago I think
that's true but there is still quality
stuff out there and you have to do your
due diligence like you did when you were
younger and get in touch with that sort
of subculture it's still out there
there's still good art there's still
good music there's still good books
there's still good comics they're still
good movie you just gotta search well
that's not as easy it's not just one
place where you're finding music raise
any more right so many different
locations online and just like
dig your right and just like 15 years
ago the majority that's the thing that
is popular with everybody is probably
not good right right when it comes down
to it and you have better taste in that
and you gotta do your due diligence and
find it yourself yeah even with the AU
you know when the internet was starting
to really become a means of distribution
for music stuff like that it was easier
to find I think better music was it not
well there's so much more music now do
the thing because independent people are
publishing so now that the internet has
sort of had its fair share of of you
know underground sort of stuff now you
gotta do it again with the inner you
gotta find it on the underground circuit
on the internet just like you did in
real life 20 years ago yeah there it is
you gotta call of the storage to get to
the goal you gotta do that you gotta do
that mention I was a good year though we
also fight club we did at Fight Club and
I would not as big as a box office
success as you would imagine nope which
is unfortunate chatroom saying you guys
really need a way to have live Collins
will guess what one day that will happen
but it's not today not today we
announced believe it or not during our
team today we're going to and you know
what look I'm all kidding aside we could
do that we could do it we just don't
trust you guys right i just want to give
up his phone number you know we could do
we could maybe ask people to give us
their number and then we'll call them
back blocking our number I don't know
she like a pre-call work we try out the
call first like a test skinny right and
we'll see how it works and then moving
on from there well that's why we have
calls from the public you know we need
to be able to screen you people we can't
trust you because of all the crappy
votes could we get a lot of really bad
voicemails I feel like we did well we
you know we get alone listening to them
we did all of them are playable on the
air we did why we're a little nervous
about speaking what you want to do that
now okay you're okay all right too much
of Justin chagrin will still do calls in
the public time to show the love
Oh for scenic a lot of people calling in
about the best buy conversation was the
last time you were the best by Scott I
was it against your will it's a really
you want the really depressing answer I
had a family death recently and my mom
and I decided to go there because she
wanted to buy the muppets for my like a
depressing story she wanted by the
Muppets for like my my younger niece and
nephew yeah so we went in there and it
was a sad experience we bought it and it
all felt like Best Buy wasn't there for
us and it felt kind of like sterile and
then we just came up all right well
that's super depressing thank you wait
did I you know the issue that you
couldn't find any of the blue shirts to
tell you where you find the movie I
didn't want to even engage them yeah I
just felt like I didn't wanna boxes I
didn't want to begin that process it
didn't seem friendly it's almost like I
wanted to be a ghost I just wanted to go
into press Maya that's the thing is I
find when I walk in there I almost don't
want to begin the exchange oh it's the
war anyone yeah and the best is how
blatantly obvious now look and we had
some calls from people who are reporting
in from around the country saying it's
not all bad Manhattan does not have the
best sort of employees no you know I
mean they're living in Manhattan they're
working at a Best Buy how can that be
number one and it's not it's not fair as
they're not getting paid enough I don't
think it's fair for you to say that
people just doing what working at the
size of Manhattan sketchily one actually
I'm happy I've met a lot of them they
are a lot of diplomatic okay that's not
a gross right there is one great Best
Buy story I've one very quick before we
memorable experience of the holidays I
was trying to buy Joanna wanted this
Christmas movie I don't member what it
was it was like the classic old black my
christening I went to bestbuy I you know
I thought was me a horrible exchange at
the with the employee there he said oh I
don't know where it is not in the
section I looked all over the place I
was lost he walked away I said well he's
given up on me I was I was like kind of
depressing this stupid he came back
about five minutes later had gone
through every single stacks and found
the one remaining copy that's really
nice there we go that was a great one I
almost tipped the guy that was at
Columbus Circle yeah I was like I was
like you know what you're pretty amazing
yes where's your manager let me talk to
him because you deserve something yeah
and angina was really happy to get it
real
want to see that's really a story like
that that is a great as a heartwarming
it's helping very rare though in this in
this world it's just true even when I go
back home to Jersey to where my parents
are at NAT best buy the difference
between that Best Buy and the one here
yeah it's it's it's night and day only
going to best buy's when needed find a
public restroom right like when I'm
really desperate for a public respects
what styles for starbucks or best buds
would ya best buy bathroom yeah and I
know where they are yeah where would you
even go what do you mean the bottom of
the let's get to the voicemails about
best buy hey guys welcome chef call it
about your that's my question I actually
will never step foot inside of the best
buy in the stores are terrible employees
are rude and obnoxious the thing that
got me to this point over Christmas five
I made an order I received an email I
pick up in source saying that my order
was there was all paid for ready to go I
got there to find out that they sold my
order to somebody else part of it and
then when I asked for a refund because I
thought I just ordered online I was told
no I couldn't have a refund because i
purchased it online that I had it all
online customer service yeah there's
just way too much of a disconnect
between the online and offline
experience what I think is a big problem
with that store and by the way will be
sponsored by them next week yes um but I
thinks a big problem with that with that
experience is just everyone is dodging
you there's no one its it appears is the
ones that I've been to recently and I've
been to a best buy a couple times in
last two months they it's like they're
of deliberately avoiding even making eye
contact with you they don't even want to
then you to know that they work here
that seems to happen a lot in your life
no it's best buy employees that I've
dealt with this is worried about
multiple retailers maybe they're afraid
of you I don't know way forget that's
why knows who I am
nobody knows who I am yeah buddy okay
you don't agree got it it's maybe I look
angry maybe it's the red beard I don't
know but they jelly and everybody maybe
it's the lasers coming out of my pupils
I have no idea could be I'm just sorry
it's just it's just like that like let's
listen to a best buy employee for this
is danny from Des Moines Iowa and I were
just calling to voice my opinion about
the whole dust by thing I personally
will work at Best Buy and I'm not trying
to defend my job at all well I do know
how they're quite a few problems that
best buy the first thing is there's what
kind of a lack of incentives for
employees like when I first started I
had a lot of encouragement for my
managers to sell all these services and
all the like extra accessories and the
like hot spots and stuff like that and
like now after I've worked there for six
months it's like there's no motivation
so is that what it is like these guys
they start working it's like hey do you
know like I always wonder where are the
man and where is the manager of this
place and it is he content with what's
happening on the floor the
misinformation that's being spewed out
and the lack of customer service and all
that stuff and he's just like okay team
good job we suck yeah I don't get it
really demotivating its but I mean I
don't know what it is maybe it's the
fact that they're closing stores left
and right I need to have a best buy
Hunger Games the way that each district
sends one employee yeah their best buy
to fight everyone else yeah we bigger
this is the answer this is the answer we
also had someone call up from Southern
California said that his best buy
experience is fantastic so your mileage
may vary is the moral of this story will
get off the best buy rant now and we'll
hop into something we're talking about
yesterday he heard about the story about
Twitter freaked out when they found out
that the Titanic disaster actually
happened you hear about this you know
about this people the people on Twitter
went nuts when they found out that
Titanic actually was a real thing so
this guy has a comment on that hey for
for this is tim
for video store clerk I would call him
real quick to say a couple things first
up Jeff no no no people don't know about
that I tenant we do need in society how
else are strippers getting bored also I
was going to say something about the
multiple purple thing it does apply to
both sexes top listen without a top full
frontal mean you see genitalia on men or
women yes okay gender term look up a
definite let me add yes I'll tell you I
that I I was going to call it a night
talk to uh Chris my work the Nerdist if
you get a chance he is just on an
interview with Morgan Morgan Spurlock so
you might be able to contact get the
content from them so right now matt
morgan if you want to hook you up on the
contact alright so let's work backwards
that's a thought well okay Titanic
that's fine that's that's a mean joke I
think and we also got a lot of emails
from people getting mad at you for
getting mad at people that didn't know
what tight end oh no I'm well within my
right here damn idiot if you don't know
about that that's something you learn in
like you just not like I don't know you
know why because I don't know why I know
that that's because you were taught in
school for no reason wasn't movie was
the moment begin by saying this is based
on you're saying we're like James
Cameron shape done in the fall he know
he think he knew that it was something
you would know exactly like a movie
about World War two exactly and that we
landed on the moon based on a novel by
yeah there's a lot of things that
happened that you just know you just
find out because you live your life I
know and you know and you my attention
okay my argument is that there are more
important historical subjects teaching
no I do not disagree okay maybe just
learn that in school it shows how
popular Titanic is that it started to
overwhelm people's knowledge of the
actual event and that's the thing though
the fact that it was this blockbuster
moose Gary yeah and that it was such a
popular thing however many years ago
that came out us and for you to still
not know after that okay but you water
so many people that were born after I
don't years after them if you're coming
if you're under the only channel if
you're under the age of ten that is fine
aren't your older enough if you're old
enough to operate a Twitter account and
you don't know that I'm sorry should be
put in jail aren't they curious why
James Cameron keeps going down under the
ocean right he's delusional
what do you think it believes it's down
there he's down there he's seen it we've
seen photos yeah it's down there how
would they not that's the part I don't
get yeah pretty obvious that he's been
in the ocean a lot you know like I
wanted should we read that email the guy
was like so mad Oh feels like you're an
asshole everyone knows Titanic was a
hoax just like the lemon land that room
just like the movie was a Disney hugs
what a Disney who is a Disney ride that
became it's based on the Pirates of the
Caribbean pirates full frontal we're
arguing about that yesterday full
frontal does not only apply GL I'm gonna
say anecdotally it does because there
are so many more instances of male full
frontal and movies throughout the
history of seven can you name one movie
that showed female full frontal I'm
boots not blind I can name 10 I cuz
they're all because i have a mall very
cute up in my brain I think that's
because intimate with a guy you need to
get down to the lower package to be
something that you wouldn't see on a
basketball court yeah whereas like with
uh with uh with women just the existence
of the top is already enough in a movie
to go who like uh like what's-her-name
best times ridgemont high oh sure that's
the moment so it's like a lot of times
you don't need to continue right movie
might say okay we've done our
titillation as anywhere rejecting me to
say that at all I understand it's the
only I think the big point is that its
cultural and it's just like a cultural
phenomena he's so mad that is it today
I'm really mad that I said that though
it's but it's the right word it just so
has its upon the unintentional pun or
you think um you know I think it's just
it's cultural we're just conditioned to
become so man sorry not even made a joke
about it in the simpsons movie member
that in the beginning where they was
about shows don't write but they didn't
so we're pro dong yeah we're trying to
say spread the wealth finally you the
whole chris hardwick situation which we
people a lot of people want
chrishardwick on our program and i
definitely want him to we've been in
touch with his people a bunch arm and
you know it's tough he's out west he's
