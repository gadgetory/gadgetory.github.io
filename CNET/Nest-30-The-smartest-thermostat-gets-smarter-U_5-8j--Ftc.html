until the nest came along
it gave us a sleek design programming
you can actually understand and features
that could really save you money nest
3.0 is finally here and at 249 is still
pretty pricey so here's what's new it
starts out with a slimmer design it's
not a lot thinner but just enough to
make you feel like your current version
is totally outdated the display is the
biggest improvement since it's now 40%
bigger and it's also sharper at 229
pixels per inch translation it's like
going from an iPhone 5 to 9 6 plus a
better screen also gives way to a new
feature called Farsight with the old
nest you had to be within 3 feet to see
the screen but this feature will let you
see the temperature or a clock from
across the room depending on what your
preferences are if you have a forced air
system it can help prevent damage nest
will look out for unusual patterns to
make sure your system doesn't overheat
and if it detects anything weird you'll
get a notification so is the nest 3.0
worth the upgrade or buying for the
first time basically what you're getting
is a fresh design and that Farsight
feature so if those aren't must-haves
for you your best bet is to wait until
nests 2.0 goes on sale for $1.99 and
stay tuned while we row test this new
device and give you an in-depth review
you can check back for updates on SEANET
