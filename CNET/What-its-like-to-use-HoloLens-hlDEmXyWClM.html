friends Nate Ralph of cnet reviews and
Nick statt of cnet news and we're here
to talk about hololens not too many
people have been able to have their
hands on hollow lens for Microsoft boat
we've really been able to be lucky
enough to experience it can you kind of
tell us what are some of those
experiences that you guys had from the
first gen to know what they're currently
showing off well the first time it was
like tethered to the wall is where they
was drawing power from we're wearing
like all the minutes all the hardware
that was miniaturized in the helmet we
were wearing it like around our neck
like a favor like Jimmy Fox basic and it
was definitely not the sleek cool helmet
that they were showing us on stage yeah
and I guess like the biggest difference
from what we saw back in January was
that these were no longer super
controlled demos back then Microsoft had
you in special rooms that were mapped to
do very special things because they
couldn't really have the hololens go
free roaming around the room this time
around you had the full head set it was
fully enclosed and you could you know
project their Holograms wherever you
felt like it I thought that was a much
better demonstration and much better
approach because I mean while the
candles were cool and I will talk about
playing Minecraft all day I all day but
while those were cool like actually
seeing how the machine works in learning
more about its limitation because I mean
the demo that we walked through was like
sort of a developer's boot camp it was
if we saw the process of taking like a
normal application and turning it into a
college application like for example we
saw its Holland's use a spatial mapping
to like like Nick said map the room
around us we flip that to wireframe mode
and we could see you know exactly the
Palawan see so like you look at a table
and you see like the wireframe message
that it's made up of it so when you're
creating objects you could see them like
interacting with the surfaces that you
were just laughing that was probably
coolest was the wireframe because it was
you know I was reminded of like neo in
the matrix like suddenly you're seeing
code everywhere because it was literally
turning any object you can see because
it's got to connect basically built into
the front of it cameras motion sensors
the whole deal it was turning chairs
tables people computer screens into
wireframe objects I just wanted to see
how real you know were the demos that
they were showing us that are really
nicely rendered they have really nice
graphics ours was a little more raw but
they were showing off the tech like
could it actually work in the way
they're showing us and to me know that
answer was yes I that I definitely
thought that was the coolest part about
scene where they're at and is this a
platform that they can actually build on
it's still unclear kind of how they want
you to use this thing like is this
something that's going to need to be
near computer at all times is it really
going to run windows with a start menu
can you just like put it on and you know
and bam you're good to go what is kind
of your kind of your first raw overall
take away from how it's progressed it's
come a long way one of the first things
I know is the first time they tried was
the gesture tap because you raised your
hand in the new sort of tap down like
that it and on the very first prototype
I remember being kind of a forced
gesture and I had to keep it like pretty
close like in a specific area yeah and
then this time around I was just kind of
like like low closer to my waist and
like off to the side and we're still
picking up the gesture at this point it
feels like the hardware is getting there
it's getting really close to being done
and the issue right now isn't the
hardware so much is what are we actually
gonna do with this thing well what do we
really know and what don't we know I
mean there's a lot of things but we
don't really know all that much which is
kind of problematic we don't know
pricing we don't know availability we
don't know we don't even know what the
targeting of it targeted available is we
don't know crucial things like battery
life which is going to be important if
we're going to be I mean it's a machine
that's like it's powering so much and
it's all contained it's not paired with
the phone is that paired with a PC it's
not like connecting to like a console or
anything it's just on its own so how
long's Vatican last we have no idea lots
of crucial info that Microsoft isn't
really making available and yeah look
great I mean are there any things that
we kind of do no we yeah we know right
now that it's going to be a little bit
expensive they haven't given us a price
like Nate said but somebody at
Microsoft's has been quoted as saying
it's going to be considerably more
expensive than the xbox one I think the
most telling thing about the entire
presentation was that in January
Microsoft did this big demo with it and
it was completely unclear whether this
was real like they could have been on
stage looking at nothing walking around
with this headset I didn't do with a
single real thing because from what we
saw in the back rooms and the prototypes
was that it wasn't ready
to have the full version now looking
like what it did we now know it actually
works and that's a big I guess it's a
big step for it especially for
developers thanks for hanging out with
us and we just want to let you guys know
obviously stay tuned and locked for all
the future hololens coverage these guys
going to be doing it cnet com as a place
to go and we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
