Sumi das and joining me is Casey Newton
senior writer for seen it Casey thanks
for being with us thanks for having me
so I got a great gift an early gift for
the holidays in my inbox yesterday an
announcement from google saying that
their app for iOS was now available in
the app store was this expected well
there were rumors that Google was
working on a version of google maps for
iphone people said it was going to come
before the end of the year we didn't
know exactly when and then lately
yesterday afternoon we started to hear
it's coming tonight it's coming tonight
and sure enough around nine p.m. pacific
time the app was in the App Store and it
was safe to leave the house once again
you wouldn't get lost I could rely on
your Maps app now there was talk of
perhaps Apple throwing up some hurdles
and maybe not allowing it in the app
store was that just a rumor it was you
know that some people are convinced that
Apple and Google are such fierce
competitors that they would never do
anything that would provide any
conceivable advantage to the other but
you know the fact of the matter is Apple
does have guidelines for getting in the
App Store which are relatively
straightforward right and as long as
Google followed those guidelines there
was no reason to expect that they would
ever be kept out of the App Store and in
fact it looks like they were able to get
into the app store without too much
trouble and already within a few hours
Apple is recommending it as an
alternative to their much mocked apps or
Maps offering which makes sense because
when Tim Cook issued that apology that
famous apology for the Apple maps app
they also he also recommended some
alternatives that's right one of the
alternatives that he recommended was the
mobile web version of google maps which
was one more reason why i thought
absolutely Apple is going to let it
Google Maps app into the store yeah we
talked about this before we started
rolling but you know we've got this
two-party system in in the US and we
don't need to have just a one party tech
giant it definitely both of ya it
benefits all of us when there are many
companies working on the same thing we
see more innovations more features it
really makes things like better for all
those yeah the more companies that are
giving us options the better
okay so let's talk about the app itself
I mistakenly was assuming that it would
look like the app that I used to know
that's right it doesn't know and I think
that a lot of people will be surprised
when they download the new google maps
the maps app that we'd all been using in
previous versions of iOS was actually
designed by Apple which some people
don't know the data was all coming from
google apps but it was Apple itself that
it designed the way that it looked this
gave Google an opportunity a chance to
design from the ground up what a Maps
app should look like and so the user
interface is very spare you open it up
you basically see a map and a search bar
and you just kind of go from there but
an early test I found it pretty
intuitive it's nice and clean though I
do like that and the voice navigation
feature is something that we didn't have
in the previous Google Maps version that
to apples credit was a feature that i
did--like in their version of the maps
out yeah they did a really nice version
of that was job with that when they when
they built their own Maps app the good
news for people who want to use google
maps again is that Google is now giving
away the same free turn-by-turn voice
navigation inside the iOS version of
their app that they've been doing an
Android for a couple of years now okay
one minor difference which you mentioned
to me which is is that you will not see
google maps on the lock screen so if
you're but if you've gotten used to
driving around town just being able to
hit that home button when you're using
Apple maps to see roughly where you are
with the Google Maps app for iOS you
will actually have to open it up open up
the phone while you're in traffic and
you know minor difference but could
cause some headaches a little bit of an
inconvenience all right Casey happy
mapping to you thanks for being with us
