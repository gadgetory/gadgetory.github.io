here with a free app for iphone with
twitter music you can discover new music
through artists and songs trending on
twitter check out the acts your favorite
artists follow and listen to and
purchase music straight from the app
discovery is the key word here because
you won't be able to search for specific
songs like other services this app is
just about what's being mentioned on
twitter get to the main navigation of
the app with a button at the top where
you'll find selections for popular
emerging suggested and what's now
playing popular shows you what's
currently trending emerging shows
up-and-coming acts suggested shows you
artists you might like based on your
tweets and follows and now playing shows
you the songs people you follow I've
mentioned recently you can also swipe
left or right from any of these lists to
quickly navigate to the others when you
touch popular you can swipe to see the
hottest music trending on Twitter or
touch an artist to bring up more options
from here you can play a 30-second clip
of the song powered by itunes add the
artists to people you follow with a
button in the upper right or touch their
twitter name at the bottom to bring up
all the other artists who follow them
you also can touch the itunes button if
you want to buy the song or album right
away when a song is playing touch the
spinning record at the bottom to bring
up a slide up window with a nice
turntable animation where you can skip
to different parts of the song by
touching the edges of the turntable you
can swipe left to bring up the next song
in the list or to the right to see the
ones before it you also have touched
pause and play controls along with a
volume slider at the bottom in the upper
right you can spread the word about an
artist to people who follow you on
twitter with a premade tweet that's
ready to share you can listen to
full-length songs too but you'll need to
have either an RDO unlimited
subscription or Spotify Premium both of
which costs you to 999 a month I don't
really think it's worth it to sign up
for either of these services just for
Twitter music but if you're already a
subscriber listening to full songs is a
nice bonus Twitter music is free at the
iTunes App Store and definitely worth
checking out if you're on the hunt for
new music i'm jason parker for cnet and
this was a first look at twitter music
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
