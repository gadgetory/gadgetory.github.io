is a new Internet TV service that gives
you live TV just like competitors play
station view and sling TV the difference
DirecTV now is run by the satellite
company but you don't need a satellite
to use it just an internet connection
and of course one of the supported
devices right now DirecTV now works with
Amazon fire TV Apple TV iPhone iPad
chromecast and cast enable devices so
there's plenty of device support out
there right now DirecTV now is 35 bucks
a month to start and that includes a
hundred channel package the catch that's
a limited time offer so if you sign up
you can get that 100 channel package for
a 35 bucks but it might expire in the
future DirecTV has not told us exactly
when that would happen as long as you
keep the packaging however you will get
that 35 dollar price again with a
hundred channels now the number of
channels out there is pretty extensive
it's a lot like Play Station view and a
lot like your cable subscription the one
exception right now is CBS you cannot
get CBS or Showtime on this service so
you're gonna have to get your CBS shows
via another service if you want to get
this system the other disadvantage
compared to competitor play station view
is that there's no DVR service so you
can't pause live TV you can't make
recordings you can't do any leather
stuff but otherwise it's a very similar
to your current cable TV package you can
use a grid guide to choose from
different channels you can also favorite
different channels on that grid you can
also search for shows in the app that
the search is not yet integrated into
Siri or the Amazon fire TV voice search
DirecTV now also offers two simultaneous
streams so you can watch two different
shows at the same time on the same
account once you got past the $35 a
month introductory offer there's four
different tiers starting at $35 a month
all the way up to $70 a month for 120
channels DirecTV says it has regional
sports networks and a lot of other
broadcasts and other supported channels
but again no CBS or Showtime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
