Gauntlet from the inventor Avengers
movie infinity war coming out now bumped
up to April 27th crap this is awesome
all right so I'm gonna what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna crack into this box very
carefully because I want to preserve the
packaging so later I can resell it on
eBay for twice the value alright we're
gonna open this up and just see what we
can get inside here you guys don't see
what I'm seeing right now

okay
look at this thing look at this thing
how do I get this off I should be very
gentle with this alright look at this
beast right here this stands 19.5 inches
tall I'm getting giddy right here you
can see the design here it's beautiful
you have all the gems one of the keys of
this is that you have to add three
Triple A batteries so I'm gonna
improvise and kind of figure out how to
do this it appears I need a screwdriver
does anyone have a screwdriver oh right
here the magic of video all right so I'm
not normally a lefty but I'm gonna
unscrew this panel here like if you
could smell this right you know that
that smell of like fresh plastic kind of
like a new Mac smell or like your fresh
car smell like like mmm smells good
smells good all right listen let's get
this give me just bear with me and my
screw driving capabilities all right so
I'm gonna unscrew that and we have right
here you can see triple double A
batteries keep on sayin triple a double
a boom boom all my childhood fantasies
are gonna be complete in a second all
right I'm gonna put this panel back on
there
screw it on oh yeah nice and tight nice
and tight okay come on come on let's
play with this thing okay
well let's put this panel back in place
and you may or may not be able to see
this but inside this gauntlet I'm gonna
show it to you will have to get a little
better light in here but there's
actually a grip for my hand and then if
you feel around here there's actual
rings that control the different fingers
what are you are you listening to that
wait what just happened okay this is
awesome
I just turned on the Infinity ah how do
i how do i flex my hands out now oh okay
so you put your hand here and I like
squeezing them down here and there's
actually there's a there's a release
right here so it appears that if I put
this release down
it locks the fingers down and then when
I when I come back up so you can do some
creative things like
we're gonna blur that out right now you
can't see this right if indeed gauntlets
this I know you jelly right now alright
also some cool details here that you may
not notice not only is it a nineteen
point five inch replica if you look at
this the actual infinity stones are
shaped differently from each other so
you obviously have the mine stone its
envisions head over here we have the
time stones the eye of agamotto that is
in the possession of Doctor Strange we
have the power stone that the Nova Corps
is holding on to after Gardens the
galaxy a volume one then we have the
space stone where it appears that Loki
has recovered it from a thor ragnarok
and it's in his possession hold on a
site let me turn this back on oh yeah
also um this is the reality stone this
was in the possession of the collector
and then this guy here this is a big
deal this is the soul stone we haven't
seen it yet but um I just wanted to show

finger has a loop this is so awesome I'm
