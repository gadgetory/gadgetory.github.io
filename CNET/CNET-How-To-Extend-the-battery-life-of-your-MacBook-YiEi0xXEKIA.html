software have helped battery life on
Apple's MacBooks to improve with each
new model year while things have gotten
better battery life isn't perfect i'm
dan Graziano and it's days how-to I'm
going to share with you a few ways to
extend the battery life on your MacBook
Air and MacBook Pro before we get
started you will first want to determine
the health of your battery the easiest
way to do this is to hold down the
option key and click the battery icon in
the top menu bar you are looking for a
condition of normal rather than a
replace soon warning if this is the case
you will need to replace the battery
this can be performed at your own risk
or you can bring your Mac in for service
to get it done professionally the next
thing you will want to do is enable the
battery percentage indicator click on
the battery icon in the menu bar and
select the show percentage option while
this won't actually increase your
battery life it will make it a lot
easier to monitor if you haven't
upgraded OS X 10.9 Mavericks you should
really think about doing so the
operating system is much more efficient
than earlier versions and can really
boost your battery life to ensure you're
on the latest version of OS X click on
the Apple icon at the top left hand side
of the screen and select software update
the screen on your macbook is bright and
vibrant this is great for when you're
connected to a power source but it takes
up a lot of energy when you're not I
recommend dimming the brightness down
below 1/2 or to a suitable level for
your eyes to do this press the f1 button
on the keyboard or if that doesn't work
press the f1 + FN button together
you should also disable the MacBooks
auto brightness feature this can be done
by going to System Preferences selecting
display and unchecking the box all of
apples aluminum MacBooks include a
backlit keyboard and as is the case with
the display the stronger the backlight
the more energy it's using to disable it
press and hold the f5 key or the FN + f5
key you can then use f6 key or the FN +
f6 key together to turn the backlight
back on I bet you aren't carrying around
a bluetooth mouse or speaker which means
there is no point
to have bluetooth-enabled with nothing
to connect to you're just letting it
drain your battery the easiest way to
disable bluetooth is by clicking the
icon in the top menu bar as is the case
with bluetooth if you aren't actively
using a USB connected device such as a
flash drive you should unplug it to
prevent battery drain to conserve
battery you should also try to avoid
charging your smartphone or tablet via
the MacBooks USB port and last but not
least don't forget to quit out of any
apps that you are no longer using this
can be done by clicking on the command +
Q key while the program is open or
clicking on the name of the program in
the top menu bar and selecting quit if
an app is frozen and click on the Apple
icon in the menu bar select force quit
and click on the program that won't
close for more tips like these be sure

questions or comments I'm Dan graziano
