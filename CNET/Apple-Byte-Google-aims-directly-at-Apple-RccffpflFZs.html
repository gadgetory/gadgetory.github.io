to the Apple by for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple it's been
a pretty quiet week on the Apple front
but there's been a lot more happening
outside the world of Apple now Google
i/o 2013 kicked off in San Francisco
focusing on a lot of new development
tools and services that are directly
competing with Apple Google isn't
exclusive to their own hardware and they
showcase their new app called hangouts
which is a cross-platform messaging
service that can be used with iOS and
Android devices it's available now for
free on the iPhone and what also makes
it unique is if you're plugged into
Google services it brings group video
chat and yeah I know their spring it
isn't as tightly integrated and this is
something FaceTime users have been
waiting a long time for now google also
showed off significantly improved voice
recognition and Google now will support
more information cards for movies TV
shows and public transit hitting it
directly against Siri and the big one we
all know how Apple maps and google maps
have been going at it well the googs
also previewed their reworked maps that
will hit iOS with a cleaner new UI that
goes edge to edge with tablet versions
like the iPad taking advantage of the
larger screen real estate now it will
integrate a zagat restaurant ratings
into the app and it will include
real-time dynamic rerouting for traffic
and transit options while you're driving
now this is probably the biggest
announcement that affects most of you
the Apple biters in I'm excited for its
summer release now I know you're all
waiting for some sort of news from Apple
but this one will probably hold you over
for a little bit we talked about iOS
going with a flatter design a couple
shows ago and the team at simply zesty
took information from the latest rumors
and built this awesome video concept
showing off what a flatter iOS 7 might
look like it incorporates cleaner look
and a flatter design I'm just gonna
enjoy some of this oh and even widgets
oh oh yeah I feel that too yeah
kind of catchy all right guys let's
follow up with a story from last week
and it looks like the 50 billionth app
was downloaded and the lucky app was
paper from the team at 53 apple also
included this fun little thanks to
announce the milestone but the name of
the winner hasn't been announced because
I will track them down and for those of
you that have been waiting for over four
or five years to finally message with
your friends on blackberry messenger
well blackberry announced that the BBM
app for iOS and Android is coming this
summer so now you can message with your
one buddy that's still using a
blackberry and we need to make a
correction from last week's show there's
a story where I mentioned how a bit of
605 thousand dollars for coffee with Tim
Cook was equivalent twelve thousand and
ten jack-in-the-box tacos well even
Trevor Burnett wrote in with that's like
fifty dollars a taco I know it was a
total brain fart and many of you pointed
out that it would actually be 1 million
two hundred and ten thousand tacos at
fifty cents per taco so I just wanted to
say I'm sorry I'm human and see not all
Asian people are good at math me too
Brian it's good to know i'm not alone
alright let's do a quick giveaway I'm
excited to hook you the Apple biters up
with this sweet aluminum frame case
called the AL 13 for my buddies at em
that's the name of the company now this
frame comes in different colors it's
real sturdy and it adds a classy design
element to your phone it comes with a
screen protector and the packaging is
pretty insane so we're giving away a
total of five in either blue or gunmetal
for the iPhone 5 now all you have to do
is send me a tweet at brian Tong or an
email to the apple byte at cnet com and
tell me who was the Apple beta tester we
identified from last week's show and
i'll randomly pick five you all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show keep sending us your questions and
i'll get to as many as i can i'm brian

Apple
