is the Nokia Asha 5:03 this is a global
phone nokia calls it a smart phone I'm
not so sure I'd say it's more like a
very well appointed feature phone let me
draw your attention to the color here
this one is bright yellow also comes in
a lot of other bright colors like orange
blue green also white and black another
thing you're going to notice about the
phone and its really cool look is that
it has sort of an unusual kind of
trapped in Ice Cube sort of aesthetic
going on if you kind of look at it from
above and tilt it from the side the
color Peaks out that you can sort of see
this plastic casing over it I think
that's really neat and that frankly is
the best part of the phone it's also
small that means that it is compact and
portable you can stick it in a pocket
really easily
unfortunately the screen is really small
and there's all this black bezel going
on the screen is three inches and the
display resolution is actually very low
it's QVGA this makes a big difference
even though the icons are small they
look a little bit jagged around the
edges text - and images don't look very
good at all there's also a browser on
here that will compress images to low
quality so if you don't change that
you're really gonna tell us see a lot of
grainy pictures when you're surfing the
web you can't change it to a higher
resolution but that is gonna mean it's
gonna take longer to load ask for photos
you take yourself there's a five
megapixel camera on the back with flash
that could be good some Nokia 5
megapixel cameras are at this one is not
that is because it is fixed focused so
you're gonna have a really hard time
determining if it's in focus on your own
you won't be able to take a lot of
motion pictures or pictures of squirming
kids and dogs
there is a VGA video recorder that takes
some pretty poor video I wouldn't
recommend using it to share with a lot
of other people so why even consider
this phone at all well because it is $99
that's gonna be pretty good for people
who are interested in a budget device
especially one that does have things
like email on here a lot of social
networking apps a lot of different games
voice recorder FM radio so there are
certainly amenities
you can also import your social
networking contacts into the address
book so there are provisions for you
this phone does not support LTE but it
does support 3G 0.5 a little bit of a
faster 3G connection the Asha 503 is not
going to be available in the u.s. at all
instead it is available in select
markets globally Nokia also has some
other phones in the Asha line including
the 500 and the 502 the 503 that I've
got here is the priciest of the bunch
but it is also the best appointed I'm
Jessica Dahl court for CNET you can
