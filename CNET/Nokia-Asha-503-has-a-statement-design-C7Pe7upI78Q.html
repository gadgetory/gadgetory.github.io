the nokia asha 503 this is a global
phone nokia calls it a smartphone i'm
not so sure i'd say it's more like a
very well-appointed feature phone let me
draw your attention to the color here
this one is bright yellow also comes in
a lot of other bright colors like orange
blue green also white and black another
thing you're going to notice about the
phone and it's really cool look is that
it has sort of an unusual kind of
trapped in ice cube sort of aesthetic
going on if you kind of look at it from
above and tilt it from the side the
color peeks out that you can sort of see
this plastic casing over it I think
that's really neat and that frankly is
the best part of the phone it's all so
small that means that it is compact and
portable you can stick in a pocket
really easily unfortunately the screen
is really small and there's all this
black bezel going on the screen is three
inches and the display resolution is
actually very low it's qvga this makes a
big difference even though the icons are
small they look a little bit jagged
around the edges text to and images
don't look very good at all there's also
a browser on here that will compress
images to low quality so if you don't
change that you're really going to tell
us see a lot of grainy pictures when
you're surfing the web you can change it
to a higher resolution but that is going
to mean it's going to take longer to
load as for photos you take yourself
there's a 5 megapixel camera on the back
with flash that could be good some Nokia
5 megapixel cameras are at this one is
not that is because it is fixed focus
you're going to have a really hard time
determining if it's in focus on your own
you won't be able to take a lot of
motion pictures or pictures of squirming
kids and dogs there is a VGA video
recorder that takes some pretty poor
video I wouldn't recommend using it to
share with a lot of other people so why
even consider this phone at all well
because it is ninety nine dollars that's
going to be pretty good for people who
are interested in a budget device
especially one that does have things
like email on here a lot of social
networking apps a lot of different games
voice recorder FM radio so there are
certainly amenities here you can also
import your social networking cons
hacks into the address book so there are
provisions for you this phone does not
support LTE but it does support 3g point
five a little bit of a faster 3g
connection the Asha 503 is not going to
be available in the u.s. at all instead
it is available in select markets
globally nokia also has some other
phones in the asha line including the
500 and the 502 the 503 that i've got
here is the priciest of the bunch but it
is also the best appointed i'm jessica
