gets throughout the house it's got some
cool technology the AR thing is fun
although obviously all the pros turn
that off because it makes it easier to
catch precious pokemons
all at Pokemon actually it's the plural
so and it's got a Pikachu in it electric
yellow pause so those things are fun but
beyond that I think that there's one
thing that Pokemon go does that I
haven't seen a game do in ages it
doesn't tell you anything about the game
when you start it up it gives you some
instructions but they're so basic and if
you play pokemon go for a while you'll
know that what you're told at the
beginning those instructions and the
sort of amiga tutorials really don't
give you any idea of what you have to do
the narrowing circle thing when you're
when you're trying to catch the Pokemon
how does that how does that affect the
likelihood of a catch when you put down
a raspberry does it only work once I was
talking to someone who was getting very
frustrated by poker stops because they
were sort of tapping them and they
didn't know you had to spin them the
first thing I did once I've been playing
for a little while was I went online and
started looking at what other people
were doing and then I found other people
who were playing and I started talking
to them and that I think is why the game
has that sense of community it's why the
game feels like such a phenomenon
because beyond just everyone playing it
everyone is talking about it and the
most important thing you can do when you
start playing Pokemon go is find someone
who already knows how to play it and get
all their knowledge you teach me and
I'll teach you
and I love that it feels like you're not
just collecting Pokemon you're
collecting information on how to play
the game and that is genuinely half the
battle in how to win at Pokemon go it
feels like being back on the playground
it's harking back to an era of gaming
that we almost don't have anymore
that feels like going back to a time
when gaming was less just about playing
the game by yourself and more about
talking to people about the game anyway
that's my extremely intelligent and well
reasoned argument for why Pokemon go is
so popular but hey maybe you think you
can do better so let me know what you
think of the game and whether you've
been enjoying it in the comments below
to train them is my cause Pokemon thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
