exciting competitive portion of our
BlackBerry z10 road test I am so excited
about this I have been excited about the
idea of doing this road test since I
heard about it but also very nervous
because we have only the BlackBerry z10
as our guide that's right and I have had
very little time on it and it's a brand
new OS full of lots of quirks and
interesting difficulties
X is a generous word how to find the
home screen for example the home screen
and I don't think Vodafone by the way is
doing this thing any favors like the
performance is very slow so basically
we're starting here we're at the plaza
catalunya in beautiful Barcelona and our
producers have given us a list of
objectives that we have to accomplish so
we're gonna have to go places buy things
take a train all those things are
pre-loaded onto my BlackBerry z10 in my
reminder app but don't lose me remember
I will seem to remember app remember app
clicking it barcelona road test file
objective 1 get to markets de la
boqueria try an unusual food and tweet a
photo of it awesome so that's the
gigantic like awesome market that I've
heard about food market ok so yeah I get
there from here
with just our phones ok
Oh see where we are I'm not even getting
coop there's my map
slowly loading slowly loading penny yeah
so far the slowest race ever it's a
pretty big market like why would it not
just immediately be like oh yeah what
I'm gonna do what happened look we just
crashed I'm just gonna use a Google
Google custom search
how many objectives do we have on this
just the one right it doesn't work hit
by lunchtime
all right oh my god so I can't just we
need to go that way and then turn left
that's it all that work
Molly I I don't think you understand the
idea of a race we don't have time to
shoot pictures of bunnies I was racing
that ever'body's stay on target
stay on target it's testing the camera
I knew Google could do it
there is no shortage of weird-looking
food I'm thinking this is gonna be
faster if we split up each of us has ten
minutes to find a weird food okay and
then we meet back here compare I'm gonna
have weird you
it's all I all comes down to Gallic I
don't want to go Freddie
yeah
oh man chicken I don't have my machete
so ooh look at this oh wow that is weird
take a picture of it
detecting face oh god please don't
detect a face
they're all alive
today it's not that adventurous because
we come to the spoon but it is magenta I
mean gesture yet how do you do
I got people hi yeah oh my gosh I know
this beautiful fruit I mean it's unusual
it's not the scariest fruit here cuz it
comes with a spoon I really wanted to
get something that would terrify you
yeah but I chickened out and I got
churros but not any true is like
anything I've ever seen before
woah it's got honey on it so got churros
and honey tentacles I wanted to get a
goat head and they have plenty of them
for sale I wanted to you know what the
market for goat heads right now it's
really you know it's really all right
I'm gonna take a picture of my feet daya
you take a picture of your shirt oh I'm
gonna tweet it
owner if I can at you Oh God really
I can't just type it no won't let you
know no the Twitter app is truly
terrible there we go
tweeted tweeted photo uploaded to
Twitter so objective one down howdy I
know we did it I did it weird food
completed all right checked off okay now
objective to is each take five photos of
luck cutted the wrong see if you can
figure out first mode upload one to
Facebook share via NFC oh also objective
to involves find lecithin oh oh I saw a
sign I'm going old-fashioned let me know
more mapping wait you saw some that's
not sign appointed to cut that article
let's do that alright following you I
didn't have anything more specific than
this way but now I see another like set
of blue signs she's four five heroes
date or I stand target Kathy throw that
way that looks like I do draw than me
pretty clearly they got their ballot
spire that is beautiful
that was one I figured out burst mode
you did yeah yeah burst mode is a little
man with the exploding water out of
space
first I'm gonna burst my kids remember
that time we got kicked out of us alone
for bursting a kid and first tell me
what you're gonna burst me okay ready 1
2 3
did you burst me ok this is the first
solid point that the black bears done
first mode for the wind pretty cool dude
all those tourists that you see we're
always trying to do that photo yeah they
need blackberry burst mode whoa gosh
fires gargoyles
I mean burst zoom all right let's keep
going
wow that's really pretty more artistic
oh we artistic oh I have more than five
photos I have I went crazy got some good
stuff though I know me too
okay so I'm gonna try to enhance edit my
artistic lens flare shot I like that you
can edit right natively in the I know
you've got kind of a cool little edit
button all right I'm just gonna enhance
so I'm not gonna do much film show up
it's cool I'm going with that because
it's very gothic and save
I made mine look like something out of
Game of Thrones or spare room got back
to camera where's my link sure Facebook
minor editing post better upload has
started is it there
oh yeah it's there it's there that's
pretty great and it was lickety-split -
really easy just right from the camera
have one little point for Vodafone -
okay so now though this is a tricky part
we have to share photos via NFC okay so
I think I have an idea of how to do this
sure we hit the share button oh look
anything if C to share files please
align the back of your device with
another industry device Oh
waiting waiting receive data transfer
receive that's coming three seconds 13
seconds
21 seconds 22 21 20 18 19 not as fast as
in the commercial it is not at all I
thought we were like if you do this with
a stranger it could get awkward yeah
actually we're not strangers then it's a
little awkward received four files so
you gave me four and I give you okay
phew
so then does this somewhere in my
library it's not in my photo library
yeah wherever they transfer to I'll
never know you got a file manager and on
device it's in under downloads it's not
under I guess it wouldn't be under
camera because I didn't take it with my
camera but it's not also not under
photos it's under downloads and then for
some reason I got the same photo four
times I got three I got three so maybe
it would be a lot faster if it was only
sending it to us one that's probably
also we've determined that three of my
photos are with four of you our exchange
rate for photos is really weird
alright nevertheless I would say we have
completed this objective for sure let's
check that sucker on right checked off
now we're on to objective three find a
metro station and catch train to the Arc
de Triomphe
okay alright do it sure there's a sign
for that metro station yeah that's gotta
be easy to find sure no particular place
to be
we're doing good dude
I found the subway pretty soon I expect
we will find a train hope we gonna feel
we're here as my faciem I know
look at that
they have a huge arch here that is
amazing we're getting a good tour we're
here
we did it we found a metro station and
caught a train to octave tramp which was
objective three we totally did so we're
checking that off boom now objective
four find a nice place to enjoy the
lunch they really understand us there's
a lot of options for that because this
is all nice I know let's go do it we did
it we did it cheers Cheers we complete
our challenge that's pretty good so what
do you think kind of nice overall now we
did our challenge we've had these for a
little while yeah what is your
impression of the BlackBerry yeah I mean
we've been using these all throughout
our European travels and you know I mean
I think so part of some of our issues
could have come from Vodafone and the
local service but you know I have to say
as an operating system BlackBerry OS 10
just is not there yet and that is not
really acceptable in this day and age
when iOS Android and Windows Phone are
all so good yeah there's some good
things about it I mean we both really
liked burst mode and some of the
accessibility of the common apps that
you get being right there on the phone
already but man it is a clunky hard to
use unintuitive experience picking up
this phone even for somebody that's used
to you know using lots of different cell
phones and getting around maneuvering it
just feel like I'm doing extra steps to
do common activities I it's rough it's
gonna be hard for an advanced user and
hard for a newbie and then on top of
that the app support is not there it's
heartbreaking to pick this up and have
Twitter Facebook LinkedIn built right in
but not be able to download Instagram so
I mean I hate to say it I was pulling
for this phone I think the q10 has a lot
of potential because people want the
keyboard but for me right now I have to
save a z10 as a do not buy I agree
without the keyboard there's really no
reason to get this phone over other
better smartphones cookie
we have now thoroughly road-tested the
BlackBerry z10 here in Barcelona so now
we're going to destroy it as best we can
I think Jeff's really been looking
forward to this yes it's a little
cathartic for me he had a really pretty
buggy unit so I feel okay about I don't
know throwing this one down the stairs
all right Molly you do the honors yeah
okay ready here we go one two three back
of the case excellent just popped off
really hard it's designed to do this
that's how I still on them yeah yeah to
gether no problem well I think I'm
handled that so well we might as well do
it again okay oh I got some I saw some
corners yes I think the role is not as
cool as this yeah toss was a little more
violent it did get a little edge action
nope no problems yeah hey you know what
I'm thinking let's take this drug test
up a nut I like I like this idea so the
thing you're always doing at scenic
vistas is taking pictures in high places
accidents can happen well this is gonna
be a great shot of year oh all right we
are oh I see glass on the ground come on
down get a shot did I get
Oh little red light like to have a
message you have a message the message
is why why I'm so going the blinking
that was amazing I know edges this is a
downright dangerous situation no I think
that red light just came on for a second
to be like what's wrong with you huh
this system worth day it's the telephone
osm what day beautiful weather we got to
come to about so many more often I'm
seriously go there's no World Congress
even where it's at I like this actually
I always let it go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
