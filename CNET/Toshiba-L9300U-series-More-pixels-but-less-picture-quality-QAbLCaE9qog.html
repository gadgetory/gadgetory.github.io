the toshiba 65l 9300 you this is the
company's best TV for 2013 and it is a
4k resolution television that means it
has four times the number of pixels is
standard 1080p TV the idea is to provide
extra sharpness when it is given 1080p
and 4k sources of course 4k sources are
extremely uncommon today she mostly
going to be up converting 1080p and
watching it on this television toshibas
exterior design falls a little bit short
of some of the other 4k TVs out there
that look really futuristic to justify
their high prices this set has a silver
bezel around the edge these sort of
rounded corners look a little bit retro
the stand matches at least it's open and
it does allow a little bit of swivel so
that's one nice feature another
unfortunate retro touches the menu
system it was pretty slow to respond and
on a big screen like this it's
old-school graphics really look data
there's a lot of jagged edges and
softness that menu does encompass the TV
smart TV feature suite which again is
not really laid out or designed as well
as some of the other TVs we've seen the
cloud TV function as they call it kind
of berries the best functions including
netflix and a lot of the other streaming
services there is no Amazon Instant on
this TV another kind of knock and all
told it is one of the least impressive
smart TV Suites we've seen on the other
hand Toshiba does include in the box a
wireless USB keyboard with a touch pad
so that makes navigating the browser in
particular a lot easier on this TV on
the other hand the browser of course is
pretty lackluster compared to we're used
to on your phone or tablet or especially
a PC the other big standout feature on
this television is passive 3d Toshiba
throws in four pairs of 3d glasses and
that passive 3d plus 4k resolution
really helps i'll talk about that in a
little bit personally talk about 4k
resolution on this TV real quick like
the other 65-inch 4k TVs I've tested
it's really difficult to tell the
difference between this and a 65-inch
1080p TV with both 4k and standard
program material so again you're not
going to get much of a benefit in
sharpest on this TV despite all those
extra pixels unless you sit extremely
close this TV despite its 4k resolution
really falls short in other picture
quality areas primarily contrast it's
black levels are relatively light again
lighter than a lot of the other budget
LCD TVs that I compared it to let alone
ones in its price range that of course
me the picture look pretty washed out
the color is not quite popped nearly as
much as you'd expect on a TV that cost
this much there's also some blooming
artifacts where some of the brighter
areas spilled over into the darker areas
off angle wasn't great and this TV did
collect a lot of light in a bright room
so I'll told a pretty bad performer
again for a 4k television color was
pretty good and again we did mention
that 3d picture quality 4k resolution
plus passive 3d gives you the best of
both worlds you get excellent sharpness
with 3d basically the same as an active
3d TV as opposed to a standard 1080p 3d
TV where you do have some artifacts none
of that with this television you also
get the benefits of passive 3d which
includes zero crosstalk which didn't get
those ghostly double images the glasses
are a lot more comfortable and cheaper
to use so all told this TV is great for
its 3d but again it does suffer those
same quality issues that we saw in 2d
the toshiba's connectivity is ample with
4 HDMI one component video input and
even an analog VGA style pc input
there's also a pair of USB and an SD
card slot toshiba also says the hdmis
can be upgraded we compatible with 20
specification meaning they can accept a
60 framerate signal with 4k that
firmware update is coming soon the L
9300 you is a 2013 for ktv 1a toshiba's
first and the company did announce a
slew of other TVs in 2014 with 4k
resolution that might improve upon this
TVs picture quality until then don't
worry about this one wait for the next
one that's a quick look at toshiba zell
9300 you 4k television I'm David Katz
