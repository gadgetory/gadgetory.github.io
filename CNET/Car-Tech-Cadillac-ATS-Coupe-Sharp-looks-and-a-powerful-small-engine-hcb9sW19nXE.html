the best of the European sports coupes
the 2015 aks final just needs a little
bit of refinement to get it there the
2015 ATS coupe is the two-door version
of Cadillacs entry-level model the ATS
with this new generation they've really
smoothed over some of the edges made it
look a little more normal in the center
here I've got a touch screen this is
what Cadillac calls Q the Cadillac user
experience now this comes standard in
every 80s but navigation is actually an
option I add on to the system I have it
on this car if I press the button here I
get to see the mass the maps are very
rich I get really good looking buildings
here what I don't like about the system
is its kind of slow when you first start
up the car entering into destination can
take a while because that all takes a
little while to boot up and that's kind
of frustrating because that's when you
really want to enter a destination
I have a 4G data connection built in in
this car that's for OnStar that's what
you'll find in most new GM vehicles
these days for audio sources along with
Pandora I have three USB ports I've got
two in the console here and one hidden
end of this little pouch here I can
actually put my phone in here and just
hide it away and keep it plugged in I've
got HD radio and satellite radio as well
an bluetooth streaming in this
performance trim version of the ATS I
get a few driver assistance features I
get a forward collision warning little
flash of red light if I'm about to hit
another car I get Lane Keeping Assist
which it'll actually turn the wheel if
I'm about to drift over a lane line I
also have a very good reverse camera
here if I put it in reverse it shows two
dirty lines and also if I'm about to hit
an object behind me they're all very
useful
we have two engines available for the
Cadillac ATS one is a 3.6 liter v6 the
other is a 2 liter 4-cylinder with turbo
charging now that's engine we have in
this car and it's pretty impressive
because it puts out 272 horsepower 295
pound-feet of torque that's 14 more
torque then the sedan version of this
car because while the coop so Cadillac
thinks it should be a little faster a
little sportier that's made it to a
six-speed automatic transmission you
actually get a six-speed manual in this
car with the automatic we have sport
mode and a touring mode I have it in
sport mode right now that's for your
more dynamic driving that tightens up
the throttle response and also engages a
sport program in the automatic shifter
the way to engage a sport mode is by
driving hard so you got a hit the
accelerator fast gets an acceleration
then brake hard then accelerate again
like you're going through some corners
here and you can hear that engine coming
up pretty strong here it's got a decent
growl to it we have a fixed suspension
on this vehicle this fixed suspension is
okay it's good in the corners it's
definitely it for handling it keeps the
car very flat
the 2015 Cadillac ATS coupe goes for a
base price of thirty thousand nine
hundred and ninety dollars but in
performance trim with all-wheel drive
we've got it for forty seven thousand
nine hundred thirty dollars now we're
gonna add navigation of the Q system for
one thousand thirty dollars and the
driver assistance package for three
thousand four hundred sixty dollars that
puts us at a total of fifty two thousand
four hundred twenty dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
