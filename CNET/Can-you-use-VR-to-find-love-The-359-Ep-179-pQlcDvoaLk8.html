cnet lovers Roger Cheng Alfred hang and
me bvg first up third way see that

or that we're all just lovers the other
indicated as your lover's listeners all
right and we're from Cena little hell
wasn't even listening to you that intros
oh haha we're off to a great start as
usual so we're gonna be talking about
happy Valentine's Day everyone so in
wood thanks for watching us on the day
where you're supposed to you know
celebrate with a significant other or
something no you should be watching us
yes we got that yeah thank you forget
that uh no so we're gonna we're gonna
have a little bit of a Valentine's
themed start to the show will be talking
about it's complicated CNET's package on
love on the modern age we'll be looking
at actually a story written by our
former intern and frequent guests on the
show Samantha roads and will after that
would be talking about a story you wrote
on nintendo's switch and it's I bet on
the wacky I will be running through a
couple of tips on extending the battery
life for your macbook pro and just a
lastly we'll have a little shout out to
Maggie riddims profile on the new FCC
Chairman Ajapai and how he probably
spells the end of net neutrality as we
know it with a smile with a smile though
he's a really nice guy yeah just you
know our everything you love so as
always if you have any questions about
any of these topics or more leave them
in the comments section Brian will pick
out the best and we will answer them in
less than four minutes hopefully
approximately three minutes and 59
seconds and here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the talk tile wide wide sea you know go
go right welcome to the 359 when we talk
about the top tenth of the day and all
the crap we want to throw in I'm Roger
Cheng I'm out for dang happy Valentine's
Day if you haven't noticed our site is
inundated with romance theme stories are
former intern Samantha Rhodes is an
interesting piece in which he embarks on
a VR date in the
is all part of the broader it's
complicated package check it out in cnet
Alfred would you go on a VR date no I'm
not it none of that looked fun at all
there's there wasn't any food involved I
think like most like a majority of my
dates are just me eating and then you
know and bubbly pretty much I don't have
to hear anything I say um so I mean it's
kind of cool you get to go likessee
being in outer space and things like
maybe if it was like a concert that of a
musician that you both liked or
something but if it's just well one of
the features that they mentioned
actually was the ability to take a 360
photo say your hotel room or work
wherever you are cheese and sort of turn
your setting turn the setting of the VR
room into that photo which is kind of
cool yeah I don't think I would do that
with a stranger like I I think it helps
for long-distance relationships if
anything you know it's kind of a cool
new experience you can share something
and that but as far as like you know
just somebody that I kind of met online
or something like that I don't I don't
think that's like fun at all to do now I
mean there was definitely the same kind
of skepticism with online dating when
first came out there's a lot there was a
stigma behind it you like oh you're you
can't find a person in real life you
gotta go online I mean it's not that for
me it's more so I think VR dates or it's
just I don't think the technology for VR
is really there yet to make it seem like
it's actually worth it right yeah no
definitely all right next up Alfred you
wrote about Nintendo yes I spoke of some
of the folks at Nintendo yesterday
previewing the one to switch and you
know how in some of the previews a lot
of the games look really you know
angered yeah there's the one where
you're milking a cow and there one where
you're feeling for how many balls are
inside a wooden box you know and the
thing is Nintendo knows exactly how
goofy you look when you're playing these
games and they're kind of betting on
that so they're taking a jump back to
counter their wackier games yep games
like warioware or um you know con even
you know not even that wacky but it's on
that line where they they want people to
see how much fun you're having and they
want that experience to last with you
and you know they want that's basically
what they want out of the switch the
ideas you sort of robes that they want
the switch to kind of like a deck a car
they can pull out there's almost social
element to it yeah you can play it
anywhere at any time that's that's kind
of the big
at that they're making right now all
right next up we've got Stan shanklin
with a great piece on macbook pro he he
bought one of the new MacBook Pros with
a you know the touch bar $3,000 very
useful touch bar yeah but there's a lot
of controversy but the battery life he
actually went on the phone got on the
phone with Apple Google a bunch of folks
to really get the details and he came
away with a couple of great tips I'm
just gonna run them through like dimming
the screen which surprisingly the
macbook pro the new one runs a lot
brighter in general so good gaming it
actually will extend the battery life
that's an obvious one they were USB
devices which actually will wake part of
the system that is snooze mode usually
use Safari so don't use Chrome quit apps
close browser tabs unplug dongles and
even watch videos in full screen mode
and turn off the closed captioning so a
couple of easy tips for you I know it's
like this is a limited it's it's so sad
that this is what you need to get a 12
hour battery life out of a high end
laptop it's like buying a really nice
car and then being told like the only
way you can save money on gas is driving
like five miles an hour right it's just
what's the point right and then lastly
just like shout out to Maggie written in
her profile on added pi the new FCC
Chairman is a really nice guy we've kind
of had a great look at his personality
he's actually a really smart guy really
well suited for the job but he's
probably the man who's gonna be taken
away net neutrality so all those things
you were talking about the protections
that were put in place the last few
years you probably say goodbye to most
of them but at least he'll be nice about
it exactly more of these stories check
us out seen it I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Alfred Aang thanks for listening rest in
peace net neutrality well not yet but
you know that's comin will be so cool I
mean it's coming like a freight train no
don't you think yeah he's been very
aggressive he's jumped on and just as
soon as he was a promote its chairman he
started you know putting out one move
after another one after another programs
in place so he's you know like Trump he
has been moving quickly so let's talk
about what that really means for those
who really don't know how net neutrality
plays with that
means for a user side experience on the
internet what will the lack of net
neutrality risotto ultimately what was
put in place was a 20 at this point
2013-2014 where are we not twice f jun
2015 sorry what was put in place was
basically a telephone style rules close
basically something called title to
which gave the SEC power to enforce
stricter rules to to ensure that all
internet traffic is is treated equally
like you can really play favorites and
entitled to is sort of the it's
basically the backbone to the law so
these rules its guiding principles what
object I is set in the past he doesn't
think those are overly onerous that
they're actually going to cut down on
investment they're going to they're
going to basically make companies
reluctant to invest because they don't
want to deal with these rules so you
sort of see the letter you know you can
sort of see where it's going with that
right he's basically going to put in
place or he's going to sort of just
mantle a lot of the regulations that
were put in place the last few years for
the protection of net neutrality so that
he argues again this is supposed to spur
investment and that competition this
normal free market competition will will
keep things in check but a lot of
consumer advocates feel that you know
without these laws in place there's a
lot of powers given back to the cable
and telecom providers right layman's
terms time warner's going to ruin
everything I'm water well ATT comcast
not time order necessary time warner
Mike's Game of Thrones and it's
wonderful and not it's a Content company
anybody used to spectrum in one no no no
that's time order cable right so
different companies it's totally
different company fair enough the Time
Warner has a whole issue about the bug
we're not the cable guys we making with
roads were awesome so there's until I
get bought by direct or 18t of course
there is way of all benefits to this
benefits to removing laws I mean with
the spurred competition allegedly you
could actually see some aggressive
advancements in speed and maybe service
as long as you like paying way more for
it there it is yeah that in part look
part of the problem is that that they
can introduce all kinds of new business
models and you're starting to see it
already prioritizing some traffic you
know 18 tease DirecTV now video service
doesn't count against your data if
you're an AT&amp;amp;T customer which
you know great for consumers but yeah it
also means that like I'm willing to
spend more time and money on DirecTV now
than say Netflix or YouTube or other
services that do count against my data
now I know that there's been a lot of
discussion and fear over what this could
actually impact as far as content goes
outside of the fact that there will be
greater tears of availability I guess
maybe is the word would this actually
have an impact on the kind of car you
gonna see like the internet police come
down and say you can't watch weird porn
on the internet I don't think it's about
that it's more about the fact that light
speed right no it's not just about speed
it's really about access to new kinds of
content right so just to clear that out
yeah like so for netflix is going to be
all right no matter what because netflix
has the money and has the influence to
ensure that its video traffic will get
through to you perfectly mm-hmm what the
problem is that you know the next
netflix right or even something like
krackle which would kind of make we make
jokes about before like we don't no one
watches crackle for anything but
comedians drinking coffee with in cars
or whatever those kinds of new startups
may not have a chance because they don't
have the money like pay for preferred
access right their service isn't going
to get the term is zero rated their
service will count against your data
it's not it's not going to get that kind
of cushy deal that's a right say directv
now or go night it gets so just props to
crackle not to influence any kind of
conflict of interest or whatever but I
like crackle because they have the Real
Ghostbusters and news radio on it I have
news radio mm-hmm I'll have to go back
to the watch crackle know you like news
radio that's when I his favorite ever
shows absolutely like yeah yeah yeah
yeah brilliant I mean even when they
lost Phil Hartman it was still ok yes
radio you're too young yeah you were
born now that's not true you were alive
buried is ready you're just very very
young it was a I forgot who created it
but it was dave foley and steven root
Stephen yo is probably best known as the
Milton the staple guys omnis from office
space office space the he was also a bad
bill boat doe tree from king of the hill
right uh okay and he was in dodgeball
and he's an incredible voice actor he
was the boss in that and
Phil Hartman and Joe Rogan one of his
earliest rules d dick andy dick back
before he lost his mind and he was
actually legitimately one of the
funniest parts of that show yeah so
crackle right on anybody out there have
any input or concerns over the net
neutrality alarm that might be raised
we'd love to hear from each other issues
i mean the initial question like that
like i asked alfred this would you use
vr4 dating like could this be the online
dating service of the future I mean
didn't this kind of already happen in a
creepier way with like second life well
yeah but that wasn't VR true no not like
Sims kind of dating yeah yeah you're
basically warcraft i called it exactly
you're like you basically scare out
you're standing it I mean I I think
avatar avatar this a little more
transparent i think it was Villar in the
sense like the way that Mark Zuckerberg
had demonstrated it and yeah by oculus
yeah yeah where you know you could like
play games and like draw like swords and
stuff and do all that stuff that would
be on share photos with each other yeah
yeah but like the way it is now like the
way in the article that we have you know
it's just you know it's it's glorified
360 video then you'd stop calling it VR
well I mean it's v are you sexy
marketing you're no you're in this
digital space world right yes and it's
the are dating aspect i mean you're
talking with one with another person at
least that just solved one of the
problems of the arse it's a very
isolating technology generally you're
kind of stuck there by yourself
experiencing this you're like it's been
really cool i wish i could talk to
someone badass in this respect you know
if you're in this sort of ER this weird
environment with somebody else get Lee's
bond over that you go on a VR date if I
wasn't married sure you don't really
date I don't know I'm tarried no have a
kid we don't go on dates you kidding me
uh yeah it's kind of new school like we
really didn't do a whole lot of dating
in my era you hung out you know that was
the PC term I guess true again why don't
I go to the sock hop I'll go steady whoa
whoa what how old are you Ryan making
fun of Roger for being old uh no I mean
I would have went on dates yeah I live
in the city go out I've gone out yeah
but and you would do that over virtual
reality what would you do what would be
an ideal be our date
volved i know i know that's foods a big
deal I get it I mean just have like a
bag of snacks I'd like to you pretty
sure like eighty five percent of my
dates involved food here we go no wait
you start a VR day and then you have an
Amazon drone drop off Prime fresh just
have a bag of pizza yeah you're just
munching on chips as you're doing the VR
date I mean it well for me it's kind of
jersey if it's just if you take away all
the other distractions besides the VR
world and it's just one person another
person talking to each other that's yeah
that's just like a webcam thing I I
guess yeah but i guess but vo video I
mean then long-distance dating skype
dating for a long time now yeah true I
think yeah other people i know that yeah
i could see this for folks along
distance relationships or marriages like
ya doing this remotely being like say
for me like share my hotel room or share
where I am and say Barcelona mobile
world congress with my wife and kid
that's kind of well my wife am I gotta
have my kid in a VR headset yet but I
think that's pretty soon enough so that
baby I mean that ooh think about how
many relationships respond I first VR
helmet has gamers people with a headset
playing a game together that that's a
date you know yeah yeah yeahs in a lot
of people's books like it says isn't too
far off I just I'm wondering what could
be done in a VR experience like what
couldn't be done it's VR truth maybe you
could I mean may tried that power
rangers experiences yes maybe like you
guys hop in Megazords together like my
god destroy whatever it is they destroy
those alien monster pinging in a game I
think VR games would be cool be our guy
yeah yeah because you're doing something
then adding a social element to it if it
was just like watching something I don't
know it seems kind of doesn't seem like
cool I mean again with the long distance
thing you used to be able to get on like
Xbox Live and watching the efflux
together I kind of missed that really I
never know yeah it would it was its own
kind of stand-alone thing bridged off
the xbox live network but it was
explicit in a netflix type scenario and
it looked kind of like mystery science
theater 3000 and you could it like a
moat your lily I had to work around with
that with my girlfriend when we were
long-distance for like a year where we
did like Google Hangouts and then shared
with the screen where one of the screens
had yeah right oh yeah yeah that you
should be fun Michael in the chat says
show each other pictures of food
but that's just Instagram yeah that's
not really nothing that's the bottom
yeah that's kind of torturous because
you're just looking at food after why
you get hungry just like what's in this
date so I can have a real meal now ok
let's go into this isn't the dark web
but it's a little deep web in YouTube
what's it called mukbang why what so
there's like a trend on YouTube where
people will just consume mass emotion
thing yes oh yeah I believe yeah and
they that the Prem is especially massive
I thought it was like a normal amount of
food I I think it can go to whatever
degree but yeah it's kind of a strange
idea where it's like you're joining
someone for dinner you just kind of
watching them eat and like I think you
can people twitch that don't think it
like donations have it to buy the next
minute like you're having a lunch of
somebody online all right on that on
that really weird usual note let's slow
this will wrap it up early we got to run
off to our Valentine's Day dates with
