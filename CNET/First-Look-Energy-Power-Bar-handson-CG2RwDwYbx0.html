we're gonna take a look at the energy
power bar now you may know energy from
its line of traditional speakers but the
power bar is the company's first sound
bar and it's selling for $400 now a lot
of new sound bars have a slim thin
profile but the power bar is still
pretty chunky it has a thick cylindrical
shape and it's actually curved on the
bottom so you'll need to use the
included rubber feet to keep it from
rolling back and forth around back
you'll see there are just two inputs an
optical input and an analog input so you
want to connect everything to your TV
first then connect the TV's output to
the power bar there are also keyhole
slots on the back so it's easy to wall
mount the included subwoofer is wireless
and it's relatively compact which is a
simple gray finish via the sound bar or
the subwoofer are really that exciting
to look at but they're not objectionable
so they should blend in well in a living
room the power bar can be controlled by
the buttons on the front panel or by a
remote but energy doesn't include a
remote with the system instead you're
expected to program the power bar to
accept commands from your TV's remote
now that simplifies the amount of
remotes you need but it's not quite a
perfect solution the problem is when you
go to say increase the volume the TV's
still going to be receiving those
commands and if you've turned your TV
speakers off like you're supposed to you
may get a message reminding you that the
speaker is disabled now the power bar
isn't the only sound bar with this flaw
and it's not a problem with every TV but
it's still a frustrating design choice
and you should check out your own TV
before you buy this product with
Energy's reputation for great sounding
speakers we had high hopes for the power
bar but it really wasn't that impressive
the real strength of this system was
playing back to channel music but when
you switch to blu-rays and DVDs it
started to sound a little flat the sound
just wasn't quite as detailed or as
powerful as we would have liked and when
we compared it directly to Yamahas y es
101 and hires SBE v40 slim both which
cost a lot less we end up preferring
both of those systems for movies so
overall energy is a great company for
speakers but the power bar misses the
mark especially when there are so many
other good competing sound bars that
offer a better value
I'm Matthew moscovia and this is the
energy power bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
