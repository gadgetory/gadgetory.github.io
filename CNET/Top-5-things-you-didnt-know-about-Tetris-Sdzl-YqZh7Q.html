know about Tetris we talked to skin nets
at Dan Ackerman to find out all kinds of
checkers things because he literally
wrote the book on Tetris it's called the
tetris effect go biased
anyway let's get to the five at number
five it's a work of art the original
black and white version of Tetris is a
part of the permanent collection at the
Museum of Modern Art number four you can
play Tetris on pretty much anything
Tetris is on more than 65 platforms it
holds the Guinness world record for the
most ported game ever there's even a
version that runs on certain Hewlett
Packard oscilloscopes but it's an easter
egg and number three there's a 3d
version of Tetris this 3d game wasn't
designed with some knockoff artists
tetris is creator built a 3d version of
Tetris called welt wrist
well trous is a top-down version of the
game at number two Z shaped pieces are
awful if you received only Z shaped
pieces you would lose after 120 pieces
no matter what at number one how Tetris
was packed in with the Gameboy
now this one's insane the year was 1989
the Soviet government held the rights of
the tetris game because the Soviet
government owned the rights to
everything out of the USSR Nintendo
hired Hank Rogers a game developer who
ran bulletproof to make a deal Rogers
travelled to Russia to talk to elorg a
Soviet agency ile org was actually in
talks with three separate parties at the
same time about console and handheld
rights to Tetris Rogers showed off a
Famicom version of Tetris and elorg
freaked out thinking it was an illegal
version so Rogers paid them a royalty
check a forty thousand dollars on the
spot that got Hank Rogers and intent of
the handheld rights for the new Gameboy
but for the rights for living room
consoles like the NES that was the big
prize due to a pre-existing relationship
elorg offered a right of first refusal
to another party but that party missed
the deadline then he Lord did a deal
with Nintendo directly five million
dollars later and Nintendo had the
rights bulletproof with the developer
Nintendo with the publisher via the
Tetris story is fascinating get Dan's
book the Tetris effect available in dead
tree and electronic book formats
I'm Aya's after I'll see you online damn
