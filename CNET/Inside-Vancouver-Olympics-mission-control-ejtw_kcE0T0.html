Vancouver at the 2010 olympic winter
games i'm here at the technology
operations center with Magnus Alverson
who's the chief integrator for access
origin the company that helps pull
together all the technology and so far
it's been a little bit boring is that
what I understand yes is be boring and
I'm very happy because of that the game
started for us really on Friday last
week and the objective is to be bored
and so far we we as bored as we can be
and that's because all the planning
obviously months and years of planning
goes into this tell us what some of the
things we see behind us what are some of
the folks doing and monitoring okay so
behind me we have the technology
operations and I usually compare that to
lasso Mission Control so what people are
doing here is that they're monitoring
and they are helping to support our
operations that the venue's will also
have some senior decision making in here
so just to give you an idea I said this
is a mass of Mission Control and venues
I usually compared to Apollo 13 or
whatever so as long as everything goes
well we don't have anything to do but
when things happens at the venue or
something they call us in this basically
Apollo 13 scenarios I induce them we got
a problem and in here we we help them to
solve the problem we have the expertise
we know what's going on and we have that
the senior team in technology throughout
the whole Olympic arena but so far
nobody's said Vancouver we have a
problem so far so good what are some of
the things that you have had to adjust
with it sounds like the weather has been
one of the things yes weather has
impacted us quite a lot as you know
there have been quite adverse weather
conditions where actually the weather
has been too good so we have to
reschedule a lot of the competition and
that impacts what we what we're doing
here also the unfortunate accident in
the luge training had us to to move the
start gate in the core state so we had
to redo some cabling and move some other
scoreboards now you talk about things
going smoothly what are what is the
amount of technology it takes to put
together something like the Olympic
Games well we have about 6,000 pcs in
the
800 servers about 800 networking devices
that puts into the whole solution and
just to give you a little bit of an idea
of storage space we have about 130
terabytes in total that goes into the
dissolution thanks Magnus you're welcome
