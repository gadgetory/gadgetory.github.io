Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update as the year comes to an end I'm
sure you're only thinking about holiday
plans and New Year's parties but here at
cnet we're gearing up for the consumer
electronics show in las vegas and our
coverage kicks off shortly after the new
year on january fifth a few companies
are now teasing big announcements in the
world of televisions LG and Samsung will
be showing off huge 105 inch curved TVs
both models will display 11 million
pixels it's madness but that's CES every
TV maker tries to outdo the other with
specs but most folks won't be buying
anything like that for their living
rooms as for the curved display we
started seeing that technology this year
where the screen bends slightly in a
fixed position remember Palm smartphones
and the operating system known as webOS
well palm may be dead but LG is using
the operating system in new smart
televisions that will be on display at
the show earlier this year LG bought the
rights to webos from HP which acquired
palm a few years ago LG isn't bundling
the operating system with more mobile
devices instead is just using it for
Smart TVs that can stream media and use
various apps in the world of tablets
Samsung could show off a large 10.5 inch
tablet a Korean news report points at
details in a Samsung shipping manifest
that could be a new tablet perhaps the
upcoming Galaxy Tab for samsung may hint
at this during CES or it may save it for
its own event as for smartphones we're
expecting screens to grow in size since
last CES we've seen seven noteworthy
smartphones launched with screens that
are larger than 5 inches and resolutions
will also improve to go along with those
larger screens perhaps more important
than size will be the software tricks
like smarter hands-free controls we may
hear more automakers integrating things
like series voice assistant Apple's
iPhone 5s was the first phone to have a
64-bit processor and other mobile
devices could follow because 60
orbitz can boost your gaming and video
editing experience we may hear some news
about mobile plans t-mobile is teasing
that it'll have a big announcement to
make soon it could be announced at the
show t-mobile has been on a roll lately
unveiling new ways to charge customers
by ending contracts and switching up
plans that's your tech news update the
show will be on break during the
holidays but I'll be back soon with
fresh episodes to keep you posted on the
latest news from the consumer
electronics show you can find more
details at cnet com / update and follow

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
