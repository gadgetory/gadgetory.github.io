hey everyone welcome to another episode
of ask the experts where myself Jeff
Bakalar from cnet Peter Brown from
GameSpot he'll talk eventually just not
right now we answer your next generation
console questions today Peter all right
answer me this Ben wants to know all
about connect and will it work with the
voice commands in a noisy or crowded
room so I'm sure you've had a crowded
room where your connect lies won't work
okay now talk oh okay yeah we've done a
lot of testing around the office
actually where we have a lot of
different editors talking to each other
share talking of air connects and it's
not that reliable when there's other
chatter going on right i mean you have a
hard enough time just in a quiet room
i'm gonna connect is still really picky
if you have other people making any kind
of noise yeah it's totally gonna disrupt
the you know the signal that it's
looking for from your voice that little
waveform that you know audio mix right
talking to connect as I talking to a
like a senior citizen there like maybe
like a grandmother like I have a 92 year
old graham with a real old person thinks
I contact with me and it's like you know
we connect on a certain level but it's
just in one ear and out the other and I
feel like that's what kind of what
happens with connect it hears you
doesn't always understand you yeah and
that's super frustrating when I had my
xbox during the review process out of
the first 100 times I tried to get xbox
to turn on with just the praise xbox on
yeah after 100 tries it only works 68
times on the first try interesting which
that's not very good that's like a
d-plus you know both playstation 4 and
the Xbox one will play games but
Microsoft's big selling point without
extra hundred dollars is this notion of
no but it's going to change
entertainment so it change the way you
interact with things and when it doesn't
work it's certainly disappointing and
I'm I'm kind of sick of people giving it
a pass people saying you know it doesn't
really work but when it does it's like
it's from the future that is true but
there's else would that be okay that
would not be okay like this car is
awesome that starts so that sort of
success rate in my opinion is really not
acceptable yeah surprisingly enough to
ps4 voice recognition stuff might even
work a little better
I found that it did yeah yeah there are
fewer commands by far I think there are
three dozen commands for the xbox one
there's a lot for playstation 4 there
are maybe one dozen and i found that i'm
able to speak to it in a really natural
tone and pace sure and it responds every
time it's pretty simple it's say you
know like go home or load this game
right there seems to be a lot of you
know sort of code that you have to play
with when you're when you're talking to
xbox oh yeah PlayStation it seems a
little more seamless and intuitive and
to me that's what I want that's the
experience I want when I'm talking to a
game console yeah there's certainly a
lot to cover both the Kinect and the
PlayStation camera right have their ups
and downs a short you know the pros and
cons but one really important thing to
consider is how much space you have in
your room and Jesse a gamespot reader
wants to know how much feed do you need
for these cameras to work right so
that's a great question because I don't
know how it is here in San Francisco but
in New York you have you really know
your kitchen your living oh it's no
better yeah all right my bathroom is in
my living room oh that's cool that's
convenient oh okay gross all right so
check it out I I have about five feet
from my connect and that's kind of for
me I think the sweet spot I've gotten it
to work real close up just I've been
messing around with in see how close it
would actually work they both have super
wide angle lenses right and there's no
mechanical movement within those devices
so they do a really good job at sort of
zooming in from that frame that they are
looking at sure so even if you're sort
of all the way to one side of it both of
them will sort of seek you out and zoom
in or do what they have to do especially
in skype on the xbox one shares one of
the big features a actually attracts
people around the room it'll resize the
frame to fit whoever is there right the
PlayStation camera doesn't have that
many applications out for it yet right
there's playroom and then there's the
twitch streaming but that's basically it
right you're really not getting I mean
and then there's like the the DVR stuff
which you'll you know you can do like
the commentary stuff for but that's only
for Xbox one right not for PlayStation 4
right so Jeff what do you think is voice
recognition and face recognition is at
the future of entertainment
the living room no I totally sucks man
hey it really does suck it doesn't work
well enough and when it does it's good
but be that guy don't be that guy it
doesn't work well enough to make it the
exclusive way to control all of your
stuff until that day comes I stay away
from it right enough yeah okay well
that's going to do it for us on this
episode of esque the experts Thanks to
everyone who sent in those questions
they were totally kick ass and we love
you for it until next time I'm Jeff
Bakalar I'm Peter Brown that's going to
do it for this episode we'll see you
guys very soon thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
