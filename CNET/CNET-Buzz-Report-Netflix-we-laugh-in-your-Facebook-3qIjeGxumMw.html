report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week the
Dark Knight meets angry birds on
facebook now there's a visual iOS 4.3
arrives and HP aims high but first it's
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the Microsoft Xbox Kinect the
new world record holder for fastest
selling consumer device microsoft
announced it had sold more than 10
million of the Kinect accessories and
between november and january it was
selling them at a rate of more than
133,000 a day the Guinness Book of World
Records certified the fastest selling
record this week Microsoft for its part
issued a statement saying now can we
stop talking about the kin seriously
people and now for the news warner
brothers announced this week that it
would sell streaming movies on facebook
the first movie to launch will be the
dark knight with more movies coming soon
rentals will cost about three dollars
but you have to pay in facebook credits
so it'll be about 30 facebook credits
the news instantly caused analysts from
goldman sachs to claim that facebook
could become a credible threat to
netflix down the road and netflix shares
were actually down on the news ok we'll
wait isn't it goldman sachs that bought
a huge chunk of private facebook shares
and is trying to give its investors to
buy into facebook pre-ipo and now
they're convincing people to sell
Netflix because they're analysts say
that Facebook is going to kill them Wow
Wall Street is shady I know shocker
right but also isn't it netflix that
cost about eight dollars a month and
gives you basically unlimited access to
either DVDs or streaming movies and
facebook is offering you one movie and
then more movies from one studio that
are going to cost three dollars each
that you can only watch on your computer
well I why our shareholder so wimpy
moving on too much bigger facebook news
it's confirmed angry birds is coming to
Facebook in May the combination of
combing through your old
high school friends pictures and playing
angry birds is likely to prove so
engaging that I predict global
productivity will plummet and internet
addiction will rise so much that it
causes people to literally stop eating
and sleeping and fall over dead like
those people in the serenity movie
seriously this is not a good idea okay
this next story could be a good idea
though Deutsche Telekom is reportedly in
talks to sell t-mobile USA to sprint
nextel so if those two merged you'd have
a mammoth third carrier in the US that
supported both gsm and cdma networks
meeting it could pretty much carry any
phone it wanted and then you know what
would happen the commercial wars would
get really good and in headlines this
week HP's new CEO Leo Apotheker said all
HP computers will ship with webos
installed as a dual boot option yeah I
mean you hear people talk about want to
be an iPad killer maybe an Android
killer but when do you see somebody
announced that they're going to become a
Windows killer that is ballsy I like
that Google pulled more than 50 apps
from the android market that were
infected with malware and then Google
reached out and remotely killed the apps
on people's Android phones so they
wouldn't have their identity stolen and
stuff now I guess that's the responsible
thing to do but can you imagine if
Microsoft did that with your computer
not good Apple's iOS 4.3 arrived
Wednesday two days before its scheduled
March 11th release the update lets you
use your iOS devices as a personal
hotspot for an extra fee and lets you
use airplay to stream music video and
pictures to an apple TV it's also
reportedly a lot faster so you don't
have to feel bad about not getting in
line for the newer faster ipad 2 on
Friday you're not going to do that are
you don't do that and finally this week
Charlie Sheen has jumped the shark yep
just that fast first his new twitter
stream became the most annoying
self-promotional and self-important
twitter stream of all time then there
was the super embarrassing bomb of the
ustream show called Sheen's core
and then there was the massive overuse
of the word winning in the general
overexposure now the internet worm has
turned and there's even a browser
extension that lets you censor all
mention of Charlie Sheen just goes to
show that crazy only gets you so far
tiger blood or not and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Mollywood and thank you for watching
light you whore kind of gnarly image I'm
burning my own face but I can't feel the
heat because I don't feel pain because
pain is a king pain is a myth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
