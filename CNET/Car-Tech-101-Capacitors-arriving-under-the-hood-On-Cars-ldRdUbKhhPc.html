today is either in its 12-volt battery
that runs the starter lights and
ignition or in a big motive battery if
your car is an EB or a plug-in hybrid
but there is another way in a capacitor
capacitors are caps store electricity
like batteries but differing in four
major ways first they charge really fast
second they discharge or deliver
electricity really fast both of those
behaviors because unlike your car's
battery capacitors store electricity as
electricity not as a chemical soup that
contains electric potential thirdly caps
are light no LED plates and acid
solution and fourth they laugh at
extreme weather but traditionally one
big downside has kept capacitors out of
a car's powertrain and that is low
energy density capacitors have usually
held a small fraction of the energy
found in a car battery and took up a lot
of space to do that
enter ultra capacitors these have a much
higher energy density so they can do
more work and yet still fit inside
today's tight engine bays and other
locations and their time seems to have
arrived on the coattails of new car tech
like automatic start/stop electronic
adaptive suspension and electric turbos
each of those demand a lot of new
current that is delivered in as little
as milliseconds yet to preserve
efficiency want their power source to be
recharged easily capacitors have that
written all over them
Toyota's Supra hvr hybrid race car used
a Supra cap in its powertrain to store
power for an electric boost motor and
doing so it won the tokachi 24-hour race
in 2007 a capacitor which is like a
battery but charges in seconds more
down-to-earth Mazdas oddly named ie loop
tech in their cars today uses a
capacitor but not to drive the car in
their case they use it to power
accessories and that takes load off the
traditional harder to charge lead acid
battery ie loop uses a special
alternator that freewheels when the
engine moves the car but the moment you
let off the gas it wakes up to turn
outgoing energy into electricity
capacitors themselves are nothing new
but super capacitors being found under
the hood likely will be more car tech
