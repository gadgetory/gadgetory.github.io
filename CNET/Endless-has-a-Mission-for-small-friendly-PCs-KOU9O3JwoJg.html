a lot of choice but maybe these small
computers from endless might be more up
your alley they are called Domitian mini
and the mission one now these are both
designed for pretty much anyone from
kids all the way through to adults
they're running the linux-based endless
OS but it's been designed so it kind of
looks a bit like a smartphone interface
as you can see there are a lot of app
icons on the screen and it's designed so
you have a lot of access to offline
content so for example it can pull down
Wikipedia entries so you don't
necessarily need to be online to access
a bunch of content from Wikipedia
through the recipes and more there's
also a way to teach kids how to code
through this chat like interface now the
two models the mission 1 and the mission
mini are both going to be made available
in the US they both have this bamboo
like finish on them and the mission 1 is
got an intel-based processor it's going
to cost two hundred and forty nine
dollars it has two gigabytes of ram and
a 500 gigabyte hard drive while the
mission mini the smaller model is one
hundred and twenty nine dollars and has
an arm-based processor and 64 gigabytes
of internal memory they all have a bunch
of ports including hdmi the mission one
has vga out as well plus the standard
ethernet and USB ports as well they're
going to be available from the endless
website now or you can order them from
amazon starting at the end of january
