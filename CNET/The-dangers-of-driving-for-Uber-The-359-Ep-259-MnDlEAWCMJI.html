first Tuesday episode 259 of the 359
podcast and in the house today Alfred
Eng Ben Fox Ruben and Derrick Earth
thank you so much for joining us first
time for Derrick
thanks for being here by the way happy
Anniversary honey I know you don't watch
the show but been a wonderful 7 years so
thank you throw that out there thank you
I've really enjoyed these last seven
years back you know we've really we've
grown together it's been so lovely
anyway we've got two interesting
exclusives and scoops that we had on
SEANET today that we're gonna get
through on the podcast first up Dara
just got back from a trip from Africa
she's gonna talk about an uber story
that she wrote about with rich neova and
Alfred is here to talk about blue phones
troubles with Amazon anyway without
further ado we'll get to the main
podcast send in your questions and
comments and Brian we'll get to as many
as you can
at the end of the show and here we go
for the recording in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Inge and with us today is uber
reporter Derek her Dara thanks for being
here thanks for having me
so Dara you just got back from a
reporting trip in Africa where you
reported on uber hiring a security
company to protect drivers from getting
attacked there how did you hear about
this well I was there with our colleague
retinue Eva and also another colleague
James Martin who's a photographer
Christina and we decided to take some
overrides and see what was happening on
the ground in Johannesburg and the more
drivers we talked to the more we heard
about this violence that's happening
between taxi drivers and neighbor
drivers so it's gotten so bad actually
that uber hired armed security guards to
station and certain like of like the
busiest areas right so violence between
taxis and uber drivers isn't isolated to
South Africa it's happened all over the
world but what's happening in South
Africa is pretty extreme violence some
people have been killed
then hospitalized there's been beatings
with iron and sticks and bricks and so
to quell the violence
uber has hired this private security
company quite quietly hired so why are
the taxi drivers so upset about the uber
drivers I'm assuming that it's mostly
the taxi drivers that are the aggressors
in the situation right
yeah the taxi drivers feel that uber is
stealing their jobs
Uber's that cost to take an uber is far
less than a taxi and so taxis just can't
compete so they're they're really upset
that they're losing their jobs and their
livelihood
another thing is to be an uber driver
you have to have a certain kind of car
has to be 2013 are newer four doors air
conditioning and a lot of poor people in
South Africa can't afford to even lease
a car like that so it's there's a slight
discrimination happening for the uber
drivers especially because the violence
has really amped up hmm have you heard
from them that like they want to move
away from being over drivers altogether
and like I'm sitting here thinking like
how is this worth it to keep doing right
ya know a lot of uber drivers we've
talked to said they have all these kind
of safety measures in place like they're
really on guard when they drop people
off if there's not the security company
there and some of your drivers we talked
to you said they have friends that have
quit because it's just too dangerous
it's scary yeah definitely that's thanks
for writing that story it was really
interesting read also Alfred you came
out with a story today that Amazon
actually was yesterday Amazon suspended
sales of blue phones over potential
security concerns get us up to speed on
that yeah so this broke out last week
during blackhat on Thursday these the
security company called crypto wire had
discovered that a certain number of blue
phones were still using a dubs firmware
which in November this got discovered by
crypto wire where basically this
firmware was sending very personal data
on your phone to servers in China and
was never specified what it was being
used for while it was on those servers
but it would send data like your phone
number apps you used how often you use
these apps your MAC address you know
cell phone tower data in some scenarios
where they can find out what your
location is and they weren't exactly
informing their users it was in their
privacy policy it is essentially a
section that nobody reads yeah and it
got to a point so that happened in
November and then when that happened
blue basically said we didn't know about
this we've gotten rid of it it's gone
now we've really you know value our
users privacy however last week at
blackhat crypto wire at their
presentation basically said that's not
true
we found these phones in May that still
have this firmware on it and it's still
extol trading data to these servers in
China and they aren't telling they
aren't notifying users when their
personal information gets lost so
yesterday we found out that Amazon
actually ended up suspending the sales
of blue phones which is a heavy hit for
both Amazon and blue considering that
blue phones were really known for their
cheap prices on Amazon and it was the
top-selling phone on Amazon's market I
mean like one of them sells for like 50
or 60 dollars like this is a cheap phone
yeah and it was also their top-selling
phone and now it's the sales have been
suspended until they figure out what's
going on with Blues security concerns
and private
see concerns for a lot of people right
so in the meantime do you think it's a
good idea for people to buy blue phones
until this whole thing gets figured out
I can't suggest for what people should
buy but I mean I wouldn't you know I
wouldn't take the bet yeah
all right anyway if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred Inge
and Dara thanks for joining us yeah
thanks I don't think you have to worry
about anybody being delving into the
blue phones if I'm reading the comments
section correctly today like yeah so
it's blue by the way BL you know you're
only listening to this on audio and
sometimes sometimes yeah but but it's
it's sometimes like yeah that cheap is a
little too good to be true I suppose I
mean like I was pretty surprised that
the reason why they can afford it to her
to be that cheap those because the the
firmware that I was talking about aid
UPS that's only usually found on cheap
phones and like that's because their
service is cheap as well you know when
you're buying when you're not just
buying like the hardware your there's a
lot of like software things that they
have to pay for it use on it as well
yeah and aid UPS is relatively cheap and
that's like a large reason why I'd be
curious to see what sort of things they
would have to change to actually
convince Amazon till I get back in there
yeah I mean when it happened the Amazon
had also suspended their sales back in
November when this first report came out
and I'm sure that they've you know made
some adjustments to you know get back on
the market and climb back on to the top
of the charts but I didn't know that
they spend down back in November and
yeah came back but now it's like you
know fool me twice you know can't get
fooled again anyway on to the questions
yeah I mean besides the raving amount of
I hate blue phones going to that we'd
love to actually hear some feedback from
those who maybe have driven for uber
such as our friend Matthew - err -
what's up he says I drove herbal brew
bur briefly a couple years ago didn't
fear for my safety actually met some
interesting people the worst were the
drunk 20-somethings but Matthew could
you actually try to remind us where
we're about you are in the world again
and if anybody else at the same time has
any other experiences driving for uber
and have had safety concerns themselves
and related sense we'd love to hear
about them meanwhile Derek could you
expand a little bit on what you're
seeing develop like it because as this
continues to unfold right yeah so we had
heard uber drivers talking about this
private security company so we actually
tried to track them down and found them
and indeed there were guards at these
dangerous drop off spots which tended to
sorry which tended to be busy train
stations and other bus stations are
there busy areas so the guards we they
wouldn't talk to us they said they
weren't allowed to talk to us and we
couldn't take their picture but they
were fairly menacing looking they were
really nice but they were they were
armed they every all the murderers said
they were armed when we asked them if
they were carrying a gun they said they
couldn't disclose that all right good
that you don't make pictures of them
yeah I know that you couldn't take
photos of them but can you describe kind
of what they look like
yeah so they were wearing all-black
military gear so combat boots you know
what are those pants with the pockets
bulletproof right and like the black
beanies too and they had a little thing
of mace in the pocket and I know that
we're looking at this from like a
security for the drivers kind of point
of view but is anyone else like kind of
like creeped out by the fact that rumor
has the capacity to legally hire a
secure like at their own private
security like armed force in like
another country that's kind of creepy
right like that's I mean like it's it's
it's a private company I guess I I hear
where you're getting like what we're a
private company we don't have people
with like potential like guns and
bulletproof vests like at our offices
all the time yes phasing goes kind of
like danger that's true it's and and if
I was what I can be working in the C net
I don't I don't know it seems a little
weird it's like it you know the oil
companies that yes militia that guard
their you know oil tanks the NOI
Alliance but what's interesting I think
also is that this is you know more of a
band-aid to the problem for the violence
it doesn't get to the root problem why
the taxi drivers are causing the
violence which is this desperation
because they're losing their jobs and
their income
yeah so I mean the taxi drivers said
they've asked Ober to have the same
rates as them it feels like uber is just
kind of you know responding to force
with more force as opposed to like the
underlying issue like you said right and
a lot of lots of taxi drivers said that
they said you know goobers just bringing
more violence by having this these armed
guards yeah looking at this a little bit
more broadly we talked about this before
the podcast that like while you are at
the Daily News you wrote about you know
violence relating to Oberer driver yeah
York yeah right so like this doesn't
this is in a lot of place yeah I mean
yeah but that what it wasn't like an
all-out war between you know taxi
drivers and uber drivers there was just
a lot of people were targeting the
Kluber drivers at the time because they
were easy to like steal from mm-hmm
and that nicer cars and all this stuff
and they you were guaranteed to at least
get a smartphone out of it kind of thing
yeah that's what's happening in Nairobi
is more but they're just gnarly tales
that we heard you know of people being
locked in their trunks and driven out to
the bush and stripped clean yeah
Kevin in the chat has a question for the
record were podcasting out of New York
Madera here from San Francisco he asked
didn't you guys have your own problems
in SF I remember hearing about a driver
going berserk on the passenger is taking
a hammer out and hitting passengers on
the head I've never heard about that
could you fill us in yeah I covered that
story and worked with the lawyer
representing the victim yeah that was
crazy story this driver he just was a
little off and started driving these
passengers not on the route they were
going to and so they asked to be let out
and he just went after them with a
hammer and
and hit I mean he was severely injured
one of the passengers hit him and that I
he lost an eye
oh yeah I know it was crazy I don't even
know how to respond to that I know yeah
I there like that's not like the only
story as far as that's concerned right
like uber has had these problems come up
a lot because they're growing so quickly
sometimes like they'll get bad apples
and as far as becoming drivers course
like this security firm goes itself I
mean you had to go all the way you know
out there to basically find out about it
through goober drivers I mean why do you
think this is something that Hoover
kinda wants to you know keep a secret
it's not good publicity and to you know
that the uber drivers are dying I mean
people have died and it also doesn't
make people want to be over drivers and
that's supers big goal is to get more
dot the more drivers it gets the easier
it is for it to compete and take over
yeah and I know you were mentioning a
bit earlier that these drivers you know
they were telling you about
they're very vigilant when they're
driving and they're looking around when
they're like dropping off passengers and
things like that so even with those like
extra security do you think that they
feel safe at all they said it does help
okay
they said it's it's it's gotten better
with the security guards and I have to
say this train station that we were at
where we found the guards is not the
safest train station but that block felt
very safe and the guard he told us he
are perfectly safe on this block and I I
believed him how about usually makes me
feel safe we counted four or five and
that was just at that one station right
in that one block of that one stage
right so what happens if you if you're
in inside the train station and you hail
and uber the app will direct you to that
block because right outside the
translations the taxi stand and the
ubers used to stop there but because of
the violence they now have to stop the
block away and so that the app will
direct you to that block and then
there's where the guards are mm-hmm do
you know if the app is do you know if
those guards were only specifically for
uber like if there was some other you
know kind of chaos breaking down they
want to get involved right like if it
was between two taxi drivers or
something
right it's it's unclear what would
happen there definitely they're working
for uber so but they seem like the kind
of people that would want to quell any
violence
I got a wonder how many elements are at
play here because there's a lot of
variables is it partially geolocation is
that the the spiraling corporate
corruption of uber itself is it just
intense competition since it's not
localized to only one location however
we are focusing on a very specific
incident that's happening in South
Africa as we speak I just wonder how
many elements are truly at at play here
and what they can do about I mean they
can have security but is that really
gonna fix this no yeah that's going back
to this whole thing where security is a
band-aid for the problem but I mean this
to me this boils down to competition
uber is trying to win in this market and
that means taking over
taxi drivers business I I don't know if
would say that but that's that's what's
happening otherwise why would they be
undercutting at a loss yeah and that's
what's happening around the world and
that's why you see this desperate taxi
drivers everywhere getting upset you
know there was also another element that
you kind of ended your story with that
let's talk a bit about that you were
talking about how there's now created
this kind of separation between who uses
taxes versus who uses ubers right and in
South Africa that's you know you you
feel segregation really strongly because
of its history with apartheid but taxi
drivers told us that white people don't
take taxis anymore so they're generally
taking ubers because they're newer cars
they can utilize the app which makes it
a little bit easier to hell you can
charge your phone get gum water you know
that taking uber is nice the drivers are
nice that's very professional the taxi
drivers can you know it's kind of like
New York City like do you don't know
what you're gonna get and I mean for me
that's kind of fun but there's you know
when uber driver was complaining of
taxis like you get in the taxi and you
can look down and there's a hole in the
floor and you can see the road you know
they're just like there went down cars
and it's more expensive and
more expensive right so like one could
argue that it's a worse service that's
more expensive right but at the same
time uber is undercutting the price at a
loss right so it's not a sustainable
model for that and exactly and and at
the same time you can only take an uber
if you have a smartphone mmm and credit
card you know so there's that kind of
discrimination happening class
discrimination just to bring a little
levity back to the conversation hey
maybe the the hole in the floor as they
say with all the things wrong with the
iPhone that's not a bug that's a feature
that was that wasn't interesting I
didn't want to like get to that in the
four-minute portion but it was
definitely an interesting element that
you heard from people on the ground so I
did one of address so yeah it was in two
minutes interesting element and another
part of the story well when that taxi
driver told me that I you know it really
brought it home for me how hard this
situation is that this Western company
has created and you know that seems to
be the story around the world
especially I know in China with like
needy like that they kind of messed
things up a lot there too because they
had a whole system going on with the
amount of like rideshare drivers that
they had for DD right yeah and and in a
lot of other countries there's all sorts
of forms of Transportation motorcycles
bicycles you know to do so it's yeah
it's weird it's it's literally disrupt
it's almost as if you can't take one
country's culture and just implant it
somewhere else that's what you don't say
I'm shocked all right do we have any
other questions or well we I I think
Kevin is just wondering or I'm sorry if
I'm miss quoting here no Evan sorry Evan
is wondering if other alt elements at
play could help this what about things
like cameras and cars and I'm kind of
curious are there any other services
besides uber is there lyft in the area
is there anything left is us only
there are local services there's one
called tax if I definitely in Nairobi
there's one called zebra which I was
corrected it's zebra oh yeah so and that
they're there in South Africa I think
they well I actually I don't know if
they're an African company but there are
other competitors but uber definitely is
that the big yeah my question about that
though was like let's say tax if I like
a tax if I driver comes through I'm sure
you know the cabbies there also kike
would would hate them yeah and if that
person's getting like attacked like what
are the other guards like kind of stop
that or is it kinda like well he's not
an uber driver so sorry you know I would
assume the guards would help out cuz
they're just they seem like those but
who knows I don't know what their
agreement is with uber and if they're
not supposed to get involved in anything
else yeah yeah alright that's probably
the we'll have to leave it off for the
day yeah we're running out of time but
as always keep the stream of conscious
in the comments section and will of
course link out to the story and this
will be ever developing on CNET and
