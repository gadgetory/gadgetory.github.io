brian Tong and we're back from another
amazing CES in Las Vegas but guess what
I'm not so you know sure there might be
some huge apple news that just happened
but I'm on a beach right now sipping mai
tais that's right I'm a time-traveling
robot and I can be at two places at once
now instead of giving you guys no show
at all we ask you to ask us your burning
questions you know the Apple bike crew
that's right people like the lovable
Charlie or my super thoughtful and
amazing producer Jamie and really the
happiest guy on our team Jim so let's
get your important questions first
vignesh shashidhar asks do you know when
we can expect to see a touchscreen on a
Mac I think eventually someday we will
but what needs to happen first is that
OS 10 needs to take on even more iOS
like features now I could see a
touchscreen imac that would be great for
business displays and restaurants apple
won't try to be just like windows 8 and
consumers really aren't asking for a
touchscreen desktop yet but we're
getting there now chances of this
happening in 2013 I'm going to say not
this year but it wouldn't be a surprise
if we possibly do now Chris Wang ass
Apple is just not innovating as much
anymore should I be worried well Chris
apples really a more mature company now
and it's okay to have a solid year like
they did in 2012 we just need to see
something in 2013 and that thing is
probably going to be the apple TV or
something for the living room now Tim
Cook pretty much said they're working on
it and 2013 will really be the year that
they either stay ahead of the game or
really lose their mojo all right Jerome
Walker ass ipad 3 or iPad Mini drom here
I'd say either pony up for the ipad 4 or
wait until the ipad mini retina that's
probably a better way to spend your
money if you ask me now we also get some
fun corrections from the Apple biters
like this one from Chris lampe about an
episode a while while back he writes in
with despite misters our necks
claimed that it would be possible to put
Bryan in a kona bag and fly him on a
unicorn to a rainbow sunrise unicorns
don't actually have wings the following
week use an image of Pegasus to
illustrate a comment about tech unicorns
I find this laughs most distressing and
hope you will issue a correction soon so
I can stop fearing for the future of our
nation thanks for bringing this to our
attention and I stand corrected mr.
Lampe all right let's go to our
lightning round at Keith's briefs Oh
sass if you were left in the cold Tundra
who among Jim Charlie or Jamie would you
choose to be with well that's an easy
one Charlie now at ekman ass do you know
how to speak Asian really tech men the
answer is no but I do know how to tie
bow all right Marie caballos asks what
does Brian do to get on Jamie's nerves
well he always comes over and breathe
down my neck and since Jamie this needs
to be changed can you move it fri frame
is over oh wait can you add this picture
and music sound clip to it and then
he'll come back and say oh wait I like
the original version better and then he
just always sings in his office he
thinks he's the asian assure he always
sings and dances in front of Charlie Jim
he annoys them he just dances in circles
and also he Clips his toenails and it
okay okay that's enough Jamie I'm gonna
stop you right there thank you now Carl
meters ass boxer or briefs comendo
Sarah Ram Singh ass what's the non apple
product that you can't live without
don't say the mcrib well i only have
apple products but i also have my pet
Twitter bird okay little Tweety it's
time to fly okay it's time to fly fly oh
now John taxon wants to know is there
any question more important than what's
better creamy or crunchy peanut butter
trimming and probably one of the cutest
emails of the year this email comes from
Caitlin Comstock who wrote an essay for
a third-grade class and here's part of
it my daddy has three favorite shows he
likes to watch my daddy's first favorite
show is apple byte he likes apple byte

latest apple news and tips and tricks

imac and others of all the shows daddy
