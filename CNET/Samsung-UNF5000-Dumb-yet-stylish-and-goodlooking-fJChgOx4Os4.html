cnet and i'm standing next to samsung's
un f5000 this is a 40-inch LED LCD TV
this series is also available in a 22 a
32 of 46 and a 50 inch size so a good
range there in the smaller screen size
is among TVs this is one of samsung's
entry-level 2013 TVs that means it's one
of the few that doesn't have smart TV
built into it so you won't get all those
apps and other smart TV doodads or
internet connectivity found on some of
the higher-end models it does have some
of the nice styling cues of those higher
end models however including a nice thin
bezel around the edge and a relatively
thin profile when seen from the side
that's thanks to its edge lit LED s
unlike on some of the step-up models
however the Samsung stand is not allowed
to swivel around back there's only two
HDMI inputs which might cramp your style
if you're going to connect more than two
devices that use HDMI unfortunately
that's pretty much everything these days
including cable boxes game consoles and
DVD players so you might need to buy an
external switching device to make up for
the lack unlike it's more expensive
brethren this TV also lacks a couple the
high-end picture adjustments although
there is plenty for most people to get
the job done Samsung's entry-level
remote is also pretty puny and packed
with buttons but at least you get plenty
of direct control despite being a
relatively inexpensive TV we were pretty
impressed by the picture quality of 5000
it has a relatively deep black level for
an LED LCD it actually out does its
higher-end 6300 series cousin in terms
of delivering that inky black that makes
dark scenes especially when you have
lights down look really nice when you
turn up the lights the set screen also
does a pretty good job of dealing with
glare one of the downsides of the f5
thousands picture however its its
inability to properly produce the film
based cadence that some of the other
high-end TVs can get despite the fact
that Samsung calls this a 120 cm our TV
it doesn't have 120 Hertz refresh rate
so it will get a little bit more blur if
you're sensitive that sort of stuff all
told whoever we're really impressed by
the picture quality f5000 and consider
it a really good value if you don't
really care about smarts that's a quick
look at Samsung's UNF 5000 LED TV I'm
David Katz man from cnet
