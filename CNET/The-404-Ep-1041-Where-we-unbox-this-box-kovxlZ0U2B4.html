we're streaming live from New York City
Jeff Aguila and I'm Justin you like this
is the show where we unbox this box
touch my candy in the pre-show
I need kinda yeah I got sweet tooth just
one I love candy going around the room
Sharon what kind of candy you like yeah
after all this news comes out that sugar
is the new fad what news what news that
you read Sanjay Gerty you're old news
scuse me Sanjay Gupta's special report
on 60 minutes mmm our own CBS is 60
minutes couple weeks ago bad turns out
sugar causes cavities smog also know
they were actually relating sugar and
the amount of sugar intake to pretty
much every terrible disease one can
acquire yeah which is awful this is why
you don't drink soda every day I stopped
drinking soda I feel like after college
yeah not only and I feel like men have
an easier time at this cuz whenever I
say this to a woman they slap me in the
face I go oh yeah I stopped drinking
soda when I got out of college and I
lost like 15 pounds in them in like a
month
oh you're saying that women can't lose
that weight not some just saying what
happened to me when I told her got
slapped around only had more to do with
your general demeanor and whatever the
circumstances let's not you know let's
not get into semantics candy candy man
there was this place called way back
when in my hometown and it was one of
those really old timey candies no I love
that no now if you go to sweet factory
they give you the bag you got to do it
all yourself looks like a full-service
candy shop right like it was like Willy
Wonka sort of stacked Lee yeah the
ladders opened up from behind the
counter yeah they actually gave Mike
apothecary it was like a it's like a
deli style like wings this system where
you'd be like I want a half pound of the
shock tarts yeah a quarter pound of
liquorice whatever all made out candy in
ambiguous wrappers oh it was so good in
an a also sold like hand-painted signs
and like cute like Americana stuff
right then they had like a candy
shopping bag it's like where can I get
an unlimited amount of unnamed peanut
butter cups not Reese's just peanut
butter cup oh right and then just like a
garden gnome yeah exactly way out right
why not
the boardwalks all about that boardwalk
Empire's like know what right no that's
what the well I guess yeah city on your
first boardwalk yeah I grew up in
Huntington Beach what most famous pier
in California what do they have there
look at Ruby's there it's totally is it
like much like it is in saltwater taffy
yeah yeah they got like a candy barrel
where you go and like taffy is it I
think I'm just saying this but I feel
like the dirt like Jersey Shore claimed
the invention of the saltwater taffy I
think I might that might be true because
the water is extra salty no no it's not
made with saltwater or maybe it was
originally I forget the origin etymology
behind that right but I think you're
gonna look this oh yeah I'm gonna look
at allow you to take credit for this I
can't see it being is a variety of soft
taffy originally produced a market in
Atlantic City New there you go I told
you so it says Wikipedia the legitimate
source to every fact why what kind of an
agenda that said that my baby was
originally like me and Nana baby I'm
trusting you that makes more sense why
somebody would want to vandalize that
information true saltwater taffy origins
come on something you would do before
this show my mr. burns laughter but I'm
saying though know the original point I
was trying to make is that you know
candy shops aren't the same any they're
not where there are none yeah and there
shouldn't be because it's terrible for
you oh come on I mean every once in a
while it's nice to get like a fun dip
you ever have so much candy that you
just feel like you're gonna shake your
brains out you know when you're a kid
Halloween Halloween time oh the trade
it's just too much yeah it's too much
draft you know the
I dunno the candy draft but I'm serious
though and I hate to like dampen this
whole conversation but keep but sugar is
really bad don't Wilson listen you know
what they said you know what they said
what mr. Gupta said he said oh he was
interviewing some sort of nutritionist I
forget who it was some sort of high
authority guy and he was saying in the
90s it was the war on fat right if you
look at like all the average fat content
of snack food it went down but the sugar
went up so they comp you know they
compensated the lack of fat with it just
tasting sweet I guess right it was the
trade-off and now they're like oh yeah
sugar causes cancer it causes all this
terrible crap right it's gonna kill you
just as fast as fat dude it's totally
the fault of I don't know what Cookie
Crisp you think no I'm sorry it's not
anyone's fault it's just not it's just a
natural sort of you know human nature
you can evolve you're gonna avoid one
thing and fill it up with something else
yeah I don't know why you're probably
better off eating fat than sugar when it
comes down to it yeah just eat sugar
cane when I was a kid what yeah you
would you ever do that yeah you like buy
it on it suckle yeah exactly we mean
like the Hawaiian that's natural it
occurs in nature yeah I'm gonna kill you
that argument could be said for a lot a
lot of things
speaking of candy yeah I like it and has
nothing to do with the stories we're
talking about today but which story do
you want to talk about first let's talk
about okay this is this is a good
segment speaking of candy in everyone's
favorite movie we were talking about
this before Charlie in the Chocolate
Factory yeah anyway getting back to my
transition everyone loves that movie
turns out that Steve Jobs actually
wanted to create a Willy Wonka style
contest to commemorate the what do you
laughing I just if you look at the
article yeah can you pull it up there's
a great Willy Wonka Steve Jobs Photoshop
job yeah I don't want to credit this to
95 max I think they just stole the photo
but here it is it's so good I've always
got like a velvet blazer with the huge
lapels in the
yeah it's gene Wilder for sure yeah so
he had this idea to celebrate the
millionth sale of the original iMac hmm
this was I think in the late 80s early
90s
okay came back to the company right
after next yeah after next and he wanted
a sort of publicize the fact that they
were about to sell the millionth iMac he
had this idea to hold a willy wonka
style competition with an actual golden
ticket that they designed unfortunately
don't have a picture of that oh my go
they take yeah and so this is the way it
would work he would put a one golden
ticket inside a single iMac box right
right and you know whoever found that
would be invited to Cupertino they would
get their money refunded for the price
of the iMac then boys which is great and
a lifetime supply of iMac yeah exactly
and a tour of the Apple Campus yeah
which doesn't even sound that cool right
I mean you would really want to take a
willy wonka tour yeah
Apple Campus tour I was just gonna say
I'd be like hey thanks but no things
yeah good take the refund oh are you
gonna pay me whatever salary I'd be
losing that date right yeah are you
compensating me yeah you know time is
money so I mentioned then this guy
complain about stealing other people's
ideas yeah what does he do we just lift
this from this movie what was that guy's
name in the original movie gene Wilder
No Deal the bad character of the bad guy
slugs worth slow is it slugs worth slugs
worth sounds wound up working for Wonka
right all along he was actually good but
not quite I don't know hugs cherubs also
like dude what makes you think that
photo is photoshopped oh slugworth
slugworth nailed that guy look creepy
remember the movie is creepy asking
God's it looks like
Hannibal Lecter so he was actually gonna
dress up just like this I mean this is
clearly a photoshopped picture but right
he was gonna dress up with that infinite
stop hat
he looks good man it looks like Larry
David a little bit does it look like
Steve Guttenberg as well a little bit
we'll ask him tomorrow when he's here
that's funny man that's pretty cool
though I mean
it eventually couldn't happen because I
guess California state law required all
contests to be no non proof of purchase
like so there's no no purchase for entry
required right but since you had to buy
the Isaac I'm not gonna go for that
didn't work yeah I want these people
buying my IMAX yeah it's an interesting
little story thanks for that Justin
you're welcome
appreciate that talk to me about this
band who decided to release their new
album on a Nintendo Entertainment System
cartridge this pretty cool it sounds
cool I originally I was excited when I
pronounced run down until I actually
read about it yeah but but I did you
read it I did when you look at the photo
though I get a little excited yeah so
this band Fort Atlantic there this
alabama-based rock band they're
releasing a digital copy of their latest
album in a NES cartridge and I think the
in should be replaced are the on should
be replaced within right and it's
headlined because it's not actually
playing off the NES cartridge right it
the music comes embedded onto a USB
flash drive which is put physically into
an it yeah world were you expecting I
thought it would be some kind of like
8-bit remix thing that if you put it
into an original NES system it would
play through that game I look it's
that's what's it on headline it's just
on boy it's a stunt okay what you mean
what do you want from these guys I just
said that's how hard is it for a band
even you know get the money together to
record a record right now you want them
to figure out a way to have it play off
an nes well they're not you're right
they're not on a major label or anything
yeah it's tough stuff out there and
where the heck beans do they get 50
original NES cartridges that is a great
question I feel like they might be those
knock-offs do you mean what no I feel
like you could buy from some factory
somewhere probably in China I didn't say
you did tell you were trying to say well
I maybe was inferring that or you know
but yeah that's uh that that's strange
that you can just buy all those what are
they doing there how can you get your
hands on that well you can pay $25 and
go to their website I'm not sure what
that is exact
but yeah they're only made 50 of them
$25 apiece which is kind of a good deal
it's not even pay $12 normally for a
digital version of it no for sure and it
seems you know practical and not clunky
at all just take this cartridge and plug
it into your computer right works for me
I do think that this raises a question
of what else bands can do what else can
they offer more you know to entice
people to actually buy a physical copy
yeah yeah I was talking about one of our
co-workers about this the other day near
that band hot water music course hot
water music is releasing their new album
but they're actually including a ticket
to one of their live shows with the sale
of every physical disc brilliant so
which is genius I think that's awesome
yeah that's what you do and I mean I
guess it's kind of tough because you got
to redeem it online in the location you
bought it in its finest of that you know
you get sure they're actually coming to
your city first if you got to do a
little legwork that's fine I think I
agree incentivize with a material
product that you can try hire it like a
t-shirt right okay I buy the new Justin
you record which is terrible spoken word
spoken word he just reads headphone
manuals yeah I get a t-shirt yeah you
know and you don't charge a lot t-shirts
are freaking cheap okay everyone knows
it doesn't cost a lot
I was shocked a couple months ago we
went to go see masters on they were
charging $30 plus for t-shirts right
those don't cost more than $3 apiece
$4 apiece so make the you know make the
album 15 bucks it comes with a t-shirt
I'm buying and even if a band has to put
on a few extra shows to support the
people that get tickets through the
album sales right that's fine right
isn't that what a band loves performing
for their fans most of the time yeah you
just want you just want people to come
into the building right and if there's
there they might buy a t-shirt and
you'll make more money and don't forget
you know it's just the more exposure the
better there's a lot of things that
people don't know about the artist venue
relationship and the exchange of money
that goes on in that sort of
relationship right bringing more people
in it's always better right all right I
miss looking at album art and reading
lyrics inside the booklet I do I don't
like that is an aesthetic that is truly
will be lost
I came over the last time I remember
when I was little I would put a CD in
after I bought it from like warehouse or
Sam Goody yeah I put it into the CD
player and then listen to the entire
album as all the way at the art and then
read every single lyric that was a very
special experience but granted only did
it once per CD that's fine though you
did it once and you know I the thing
about that and there's I thought I'm
really glad you brought that up because
that was like such a unique and personal
experience yeah you know what I mean
because it was always in the back of my
parent's car that I did this because it
was like on the way back from nobody
beats the whiz right something like that
you guys had it's like a fries okay but
they're out of business um and you would
just you know you would you you bought
the record because you like two or three
songs and then those other tracks that
you knew nothing about you would listen
to and you'd read the lyrics you'd be
like oh so that's what this guy's saying
right this is what he means right and
like oh really it doesn't even sound
like he said that but I guess you did
you know stuff like that and even if you
didn't necessarily like the way the
music sounded right off the bat you
wouldn't change it you were just listen
to the song because you're reading it
was like an experience you know yeah I'd
be like now I don't know is probably a
big assumption to make but when people
are listening digitally it's really easy
to just click one button and then skip
the track you know they probably like
rifling through so many songs well I
mean I you know growing up I made the
change from cassette to CD early it was
like when I was 12 or 13 you know so
it's not like we had so much time with
cassettes where it was just like you
almost had to listen to the whole thing
right but I just think that there's this
certain you know experience that's just
lost it sort of said you know I don't
know I feel there's got to be some
people still do that probably older I
remember before I had a CD player in my
car I would buy a CD that I liked take
it home to my home stereo set yeah and
then record the CD to a tape so that I
could play it in my car which only had a
tape player oh wow so yeah do the extra
legwork to just to get to radio format
you would rip your CDs on you old slide
out goddamn you old pirate I'm old
you're not old we are all yes combined
age of 90 in this room speaking of
Nintendo a little earlier
this band releasing their album inside
of a NES cartridge little news here to
report Nintendo everyone's favorite
videogame company from their childhood
has reported a first annual loss of 460
million dollars I will say that again
460 million dollars that's almost half a
billion did you say this is the first
time they've ever posted no they have
this is not the first time but I think
the real headline here the real news is
that they're predicting a turnaround
year for 2012 I'm not so sure that's
gonna happen
there is a lukewarm reception over Wii U
that would be successor to the Nintendo
Wii and the 3ds I mean I know it's doing
okay in terms of sales but is that you
know and I'm upset because I can't
really talk to anybody about this right
now I'm just sort of saying this out
loud
either and just sort of know what's
coming out next year that they force
this year this later this year yeah yeah
I supposedly jump profits the Wii U I
mean I guess a cheaper 3ds they have a
couple titles that are incoming you're
looking at new Super Mario Brothers 2
which was their reboot of Mario Brothers
they're portable reboot of it which is a
lot of fun but I mean god I played the
same goddamn game a million times over
and over and over again it's like I I
don't know then you've got brain
training and Animal Crossing yeah which
is just keep the cycle continues the
same game over and over again do you
think that maybe Nintendo should release
a non motion controlled game console do
you think that'd be a possibility from
now on like ever will they ever release
an on motion it's a great question I
don't know do you think that'd be a good
step in the right direction for them I
don't know I almost look at Nintendo now
you don't even put them in the same
categories Xbox and Playstation right
you sort of just say like Wii controller
sucks for playing no motion control
games well yeah yeah for the most part
but they're just doing their own thing
now they're more than just you know
conventional video games I think
you look at like Kinect and you look at
move and you're like alright that was a
nice attempt yeah but those guys know
the real deal they know the real
moneymakers they're sticking to that we
in Nintendo's sort of view on the market
it's like you know they're just sort of
experimenting it's like this
never-ending experiment now you know the
Gamecube which I thought was a great
system was their last traditional video
game console at what point do you think
that Nintendo stopped becoming viable
for the serious gamer right like Xbox
Playstation when the we came out when
the we came out when the we came out
because when that when that thing was
announced it was it was it was mixed
there was a lot of mixed reactions
people were like oh my god they will
read their revolutionising the industry
again you know and everyone was just
head over heels then when you played it
you're like okay
I get this it's for kids not for
everybody right I don't know I don't
know it'll be uh it'll be interesting
you know and I still think their biggest
Achilles heel is their lack of
third-party support and their lack you
know there is very little incentive for
a third party to just say alright we're
developing exclusively for the way it's
just tough it's tough man it'll be
interesting I don't know I don't know I
don't I kind of worry about it poor
Nintendo you know I do did not think
they'd be in this position right now say
that we'll take a break when we come
back more 404 we've got calls we've got
videos we've got all kinds of fun to
share with you right after this stick
around
the show where we all sing
welcome back to the 404 soon they're
just gonna have like we've daisy-chained
85,000 fluffy tribe and you know we're
doing some no doubt a hologram yeah
lyrics those those videos are crazy
watch the video if you don't know we're
talking about it's uh more will just
tell you right now yeah it's a couple of
hard drives things like six hard drives
daisy chain yeah there I was eight yeah
to play the Oh chip double oh seven
theme song it's pretty awesome
bangerang mingling but here's my
question to that video though why yeah
just why why you know there's got to be
some cooler things I guess I mean why do
anything why do a podcast every day for
the likes men for the likes do it for
the likes all for the life and the perks
yeah the perks of likes let's talk about
iPods yeah listen you know I mean like
we've got a couple emails about this
mmm-hmm what introduced this so recently
we've been making fun of Apple's attempt
at getting people to think Siri works by
using people like Samuel Jackson yeah
and Zooey Deschanel yeah and these weird
sort of commercials that are misleading
I think we all sort of agree on yeah
and we were a little surprised that it
was the first time that we thought Apple
had used celebrities to endorse their
products to advertise their products I
knew that wasn't it I need now someone
brought this to our attention our buddy
chase and he sent us links to not only
the first iPod video which is not any
celebrity we'll just play that because
it's awesome right but we'll also play
the first ever the first ever jeopardy
celebrity which is Jeff Goldblum
endorsing the iMac right so whatever
order you want to do this let's check
out these videos uh let's watch the Jeff
Goldblum one first yeah it's pretty
awesome let's just I love hearing him
talk he's such a brilliant just annoys
change like there's a big party going on
these days everybody said what's your
email address what's your email go
also the email you I don't have an email
what's this you know like that and you
feel left out you've been confused too
expensive or something well now good
news is a computer so easy ten minutes
out of the box you're on to the internet
you're emailing everybody you're part of
the party it's as easy as you know
licking a stamp
see now I remember do you remember that
commercial I'm very very kind of that
what that's not that old that's probably
ten years old Yeah right
I remember rolling my eyes he was so
nonchalant about email that's how we
always talk he always sounds like he's
professional yet like a dinner party
right yeah or he's always like you know
in a philosophical you know internal
struggle right something like that but
what's so cool about that is Jeff
Goldblum could sell me anything
yeah and I'm part of this project now
it's email what's your email is that
some premiere for The New Yorker yeah
you've asked for someone's email like in
a social way yeah but dude it's also ten
years old Jeff Goldblum could sell me
anything yeah he could sell me a shoe
box filled with manure right I would buy
it but what's interesting about this
commercial to me is that they don't
actually show the product now Mary Ann
just talked about if that was made today
they would be doing 360-degree views and
exploding views right yeah this is just
really simple for sure which is
different for its time yeah absolutely
I I really like watching that though
let's take another trip in the way back
the YouTube comments are saying that
Jeff Goldblum is clearly drunk he's not
drunk
there's no drunkenness here I don't I
remember seeing this commercial we're
talking about the first-ever iPod
commercial it's a good one I think it's
a really good commercial remember this
vividly it's very telling it's very
symbolic of the times face melting face
melting to put it lightly let's see it
gotta lose his pants our yeah yeah
corduroy yeah he doesn't even have a
cell phone to take with him a thousand
songs in your pocket a thousand that's
so cool
that is cool god I remember did you have
the original iPod no my friend one of my
close friends did I miss it a lot
oh man I bagged so many groceries to pay
for that original did you must have cost
you your entire year's salary this 409
and back in what a one yeah it goes more
back then yeah that's expensive it was
really crazy for the eight gigabyte
version this is the one the original had
the moving wheel on right at all the
subsequent models after that was it
really moving it was moving yeah yeah it
had a moving jog dialing right but I
mean to understand how revolutionary the
original iPod was you got to look at the
product that came before it and this was
one of the most popular mp3 players that
I think everybody had is the REO PMP 300
and I hope this is a history lesson for
people I don't you know that maybe
you're a younger and listening to our
show but this had it was 32 megabytes
max so that's like five songs maybe yeah
and that's it five songs sometimes I
would de encode them matter like 96 bit
more songs like Stanley trash yeah
exactly what it was worth it
I mean it was small yeah but you know I
had like physical buttons it's ugly like
gray screen here and it connected via
parallel port which computers don't even
have right now I remember my first mp3
player was like a creative 128 yeah
something made by no Matt or something
like that yeah and they had a screen
though it had some sort of nonsense BS
screen it was like a color screen I
don't remember but to go from something
like this you know this like ugly
cigarette box looking things yeah right
to this it's crazy I remember it blew my
eye just like when I took it out of the
box gotta be really passionate but it
still looks awesome it looks cool man I
had like the reflective mirror finish on
the back it was all why
remember back now all white things seem
really generic because everything is
life they seem cheap now yeah but back
then it was crazy
my the biggest thing for me was
aesthetically the design and the font it
is that Mac font on there and I just
remember being like man this is cool I
had a FireWire port on top I remember
right right with like a little window
yes as you could slide open yeah detect
it yeah oh my god you believe we're
waxing poetic about freakin a 12 year
old iPod the first iPod or 11 years old
that's unbelievable man look at the fog
to understate it son it was ridiculous
talking about this it blows my mind I do
remember thinking that scrolling through
a bunch of songs using your finger felt
really inefficient yeah like when you
could just like press a button wants to
me it always did yeah to me it was I
never enjoyed scrolling with the wheel
how is it easier than just holding down
a button right or just clicking a button
a bunch of time yeah you know what I
mean yeah yeah but that was until you
actually filled it up with a thousand
songs right I remember the third
generation with the four green lights
yeah red lights right right no buttons
everything was touch all right that was
maybe my first iPod and I just remember
being like man you know this thing looks
and sounds really cool man I don't like
moving around but this yeah this jog
wheel that didn't move right I kind of
want to buy one of these original iPods
again just for I'm gonna say no yeah it
probably weighs four pounds it would
work though if you bought a new one in
some kind of serial port and didn't have
a used battery in it yeah cuz those
batteries died quick these were also
spinning platter hard drives too so they
had to buffer a little bit while you
were playing certainly did God so cool
yeah I feel like that first iPod will
won't find its way into museums yeah
somehow oh I showed you this photo but I
kind of want to put it up on the screen
hold on let me just see if I can load
this up oh my never when you were
talking about like some of the photos
you found at home core lines and stuff
that your course so I was like looking
through my old photo bucket account
because I've been transferring it over
to imager yeah and I found a bunch of
really old pictures and I want to see if
I can bring this up did I tell you that
I was a huge PD
like I was obsessed with like Palm
Pilots in scuffle you disclose this
embarrassing detail to me a few days ago
and I believe I made fun of you for like
40 minutes yeah I was telling about how
I would go to Fry's didn't work at Fry's
no ahead and try to help people with
their PDAs right because you were a
winner
I was so obsessed with that I would clip
out newspaper advertisements I'm sure
you do and then I made a collage out of
it gently did boom oh my god this is you
know what I'm just gonna write this off
as like your street art this is like a
24 by 36 poster size of all clippings
it's enormous
newspapers its enormous which is crazy
to look at now because they're mostly
gray scales right right these are like
the original like palm 3yz flat fives
metros look at this hand springs in
garbage unbelievable so you were just
like hey I got a I got a sunday circular
yeah what else am I gonna do and collage
them all together you guys you know all
and talk to girls some no leapings are
gonna cut them you know what and when
the mood strikes me I'm gonna include
the frickin price and some of them yeah
yeah yeah which is crazy to look at now
as well cuz some of these $799 on mostly
from Best Buy a lot of yellow tags there
yeah definitely you sir let a truly
sedge which led me into the man I am
today if that's what you want to call
yourself be my guest
no but serious everyone's got their
weird little things it's it's cool let
my cred never be questioned it will
never come into question no one can ever
argue with that sir you need to somehow
find a way to like prove your geekdom
cuz jeff has I have they'll report back
to us don't you worry about that I want
to talk before we hit up the the
voicemails for the day I got to talk
about this game because I'm not sure if
it's still a joke but apparently it's
not we're gonna thank Marlon our buddy
from Trinidad sending us this link it's
a new NBA game
mmm called NBA baller beats mmm
for Kinect I was reading about this you
reading about this we got to watch some
of this video is this actually a game or
is it like one of those online games you
know it's a game it is a game being put
out by Majesco which is a New Jersey
based developer and it's basically a
basketball game for Kinect that you play
with a real basketball and you're
dribbling has to sync up with beats
on-screen let's check out the video I
repeat that in this video right here oh
my god it begins this way for all of us
discipline determination and dedication
at some point it's common talent emerges
Oh take your game yep
oh the next level is off the court I
guess whoa the matrix yeah a real ball
yep that's a real ball real steel ball
not included raise your game Oh in be a
ball of beats oh dear um oh dear so
correct me if I'm wrong Richard Justin
is that a video game where you dribble a
ball in front of your TV and watch yeah
yeah it's hard to tell exactly what it
is because one they don't show any
gameplay right whatsoever
well they do show a guy playing in an
actual court right and their language is
not part of the game they say raise your
game to the next level because the next
level it's not here right it's in front
of your TV and what if you have carpet
in front of your TV what yeah what yeah
what if you're and what if you have
neighbors below here yeah pissed but at
least it'll be in rhythm if you're
successful I suppose yeah is this a joke
what what's going on I can only imagine
Emily I'm gonna play devil's advocate
you please no I don't mean to improve
your dribbling skills no it's bought
well I guess that's like a sign if I can
just improve your dribbling skills I'm
playing on a court it's baller beats
okay the the dribbling will sync up two
beats man yeah I got that you know what
I'm saying right how does it differ from
just playing music while you play
basketball on a real court huh you mean
playing basketball with a soundtrack
yeah exactly different never heard about
that you will be playing this game and
not shoot a basketball right you'll just
sort of maybe make the motion to shoot I
it's crazy that you have to actually use
a basketball I thought the whole idea of
of Kinect was that they take the
physical
of the games well just be like you know
like exercise your wrist by broken wrist
game that would be sick
we should definitely parody this video I
think we really like emulating blow up
man yeah blow up man that is so stupid
yeah I wonder how much they gonna charge
for this though I'm not worried about
that how many are they gonna sell yeah
and you think it doesn't that's really
embarrassed goes done some decent stuff
now you have they yeah
the before maybe once or twice I you see
a chance to play this game like it's not
gonna weapon I'll love to get a video of
that oh archive you know what I'm gonna
make an effort to get my hands on this
game I'd like to ago I like to attend
with alright sweet let's do some calls
from the public before we have to say
goodbye for the day time to show the
love chat room brings up a good point
