lot of his viral videos with his Canon
7d well my man Brian Tong from scene at
the senior editor is right here with us
no thanks for coming in my world oh I
love coming out to your neck of the
woods and you know it's a beautiful
place for you can you tell us about not
only Nelly's cameras but some of the
alternatives if Nelly needed to perhaps
step up his camera game well you know I
know Nelly has some nice gear but you
could really step it up and we're gonna
start off with our top pick this is the
Canon 5d Mark 3 this is a great camera
by the way it's great in low lighting
situations also the autofocus is fast it
does have some features really specific
to video so there's a headphone jack on
it there's also the audio levels that
display on the screen so this is really
for the filmmaker on the go
Canon 5d Mark 3 that thing does it all
oh there's canon folks in their night
convo yeah so on the Nikon side you want
to check out the Nikon d800 now this is
just under $3,000 so it's a little
cheaper than what canopy puts out there
some of the best image quality out of
any camera at 36 megapixel CMOS sensor
so you're gonna get amazing photos
amazing video and so that's that's a
standout on the Nikon side okay so what
about someone that's a little more
budget-conscious we've got you covered
there we want you guys to take a look at
the Canon t5i now this is a camera
really for the entry-level sort of
someone who's just getting into DSLR
photography so what that means is you
get not only the body but the lens at
the same time it's $900 it also has kind
of a flip-out LCD screen so this just
makes it really easy to use as well it's
in a different way so definitely check
out the t5 I hear a starting
photographer video maker what that once
used a DSLR by the way you also see all
these action videos now what's the deal
if you want to break into the action
well we can just forget about DSLRs when
you come down to that we're talking
about the GoPro Hero 3 this is just an
amazing camera if you haven't seen it's
about just yay big they start at 199 and
you can mount them on like a bike you
can put them on a surfboard you can put
on a helmet to get these just amazing
first-person perspectives and that's a
really hot pick that's not a DSLR but
still does amazing video you know what I
love there's so much technology just
percolating inside your head it's it
comes from the hair is that what that's
what that's what it here see it's not
just sexy it also has that's why thank
you to it thank you Kevin Brian Tong
always good let's get back to Nelly I
gotta go all right thanks for coming to
hang out with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
