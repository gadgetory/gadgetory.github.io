exciting words in the English language I
don't know I'm just a tech journalist
but I do know that this top freezer
fridge is a pretty good one it's the LG
LT CS 2 4 2 2 3 s and it's a very large
24 cubic foot model that costs $1,200
now that's the same large capacity as we
saw with the Kenmore 7 9 4 3 2 and that
fridge is actually built off of an
existing model of this one so they're
very similar this version though has a
better design with recessed handles and
a stainless steel finish both of those
contribute to a more modern aesthetic
opening the fridge up you can get a good
sense of all the storage space inside of
it this is about as big as top freezers
get you've got plenty of room for
groceries we were able to fit all of our
goods inside of it along with our six
bulky stress-test items an extra large
pizza box casserole dish things like
that all of it fit just fine didn't need
to move any shelves very happy with that
result one very minor quibble with the
storage space for such a big fridge it's
got a pretty small but urban not big
enough to hold a tub like this one of
margarine or butter just something to be
aware of overall though I think this is
a nice design it's not terribly
feature-rich there's no water dispenser
and no touchscreen on the front but you
do get a nice deli drawer that runs the
width of the interior and also that nice
diamond contoured pattern at the bottom
of the indoor shelves it just looks good
my real question with this fridge though
was how its performance would stack up
against that Kenmore model which is one
of the best performing top freezers
we've tested here's the heat map of that
Kenmore you can see it did a great job
and kept temperatures at the default
setting right around where you want them
to 37 now compare that to the LT CS 2
for 2 to 3 s here it's not quite as good
you've got temperatures inching up close
to that 40 degree mark in the body of
the fridge and hot spots throughout the
door and in the crisper bins and then
here at the coldest setting it only
inches down about two degrees I'd like
to see bigger swing than that more
flexibility to dial the temperature down
still the performance is passable here
and it's really all about the storage
space here with seventeen point six
cubic feet in the body to fridge you're
getting more than you'd get even with
some mid-range French door models so if
you're thinking about upgrading to one
of those just for the size you can save
some money and go with this instead for
the full skinny on this fat fridge check

out appliances I'm right Chris
