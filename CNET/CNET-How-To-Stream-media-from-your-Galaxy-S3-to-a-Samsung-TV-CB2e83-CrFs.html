and a Samsung Smart TV you can
wirelessly stream content from your
phone to your TV with a little effort
it's the Samsung AllShare Play app that
lets you do this and a lot more but
today I'll just show you how to stream
music videos and photos from your phone
to your TV first make sure your phone
and your TV are connected to the same
Wi-Fi network then launch the AllShare
Play app on your phone you'll be asked
to either create an account or sign in
if you create an account when you set up
your TV just use that account or if not
set up a username and password back on
your TV launch the Smart Hub then head
on over to the AllShare Play app which
is already pre-installed now log in by
hitting the a button on your remote and
use the same username and password you
set up just a minute ago hit login and
you should end up at this screen now if
you go down to a tab like videos you
should see your phone over here on the
right but if you don't and it looks like
this you'll need to change a setting on
your phone so go to settings more
settings nearby devices and check
file-sharing now you should see your
phone show up now that you're connected
there are two ways to stream content the
first is by exploring the content on
your phone from the AllShare Play app so
for example I can go to the Photos tab
select my phone and my gallery will show
up over here on the left so as you can
see it's pretty fast and you can even
browse photos full screen by selecting
them and then just clicking through and
if you hit this tools button on your
remote you'll have even more options
like starting a slideshow or changing
the size of the photos
also check out music go down to music
select my phone and all my tracks will
show up so I'll just pick one hit play
and it'll start playing through your TV
also if you want more options like
choosing from a playlist don't forget
about that tools button so that's one
way to stream content the other is by
browsing through media on your phone and
then sending them to your TV in this
case you don't even need to be in the
app to make it happen
it'll just interrupt the show and play
it which is awesome and annoying all at
the same time here's how it works
find the song or the video you want to
play on your phone play it and you'll
see this icon show up it shows up next
to anything that can be beamed to your
TV if you don't see the icon hit the
menu button and select scan for nearby
devices once it scans then you should
see that icon show up tap it and your
media will be beamed to your TV
here's that works with photos find the
photo you want a beam select it and tap
that icon and when you zoom in and out
on your phone it'll do the same thing on
screen pretty awesome now if you don't
have a Samsung Smart TV and you still
want these features check out the
AllShare cast dongle it basically adds a
lot of the same functionality to your TV
I also mentioned that all share lets you
do a lot more than just beam content to
your TV it's a full DLNA hub so try it
for sharing content between your PC
phone tablet and your TV alright if you
have any questions hit me up on Twitter
