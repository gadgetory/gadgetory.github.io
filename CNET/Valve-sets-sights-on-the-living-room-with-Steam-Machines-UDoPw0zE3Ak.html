game developer conference with valve
checking out steam machines now you're
probably familiar with Val they're one
of the massive gaming companies and
there is also for steam which is a game
delivery platform now valve has been
making a push into the living room space
Kontos kind of ruled the roost there but
PC gaming deserves to be then that's
hopefully going to change this November
when the steam machines are widely
available now steamos is going to be the
platform let the steam machines run the
machines are technically pcs but they're
running steam OS which makes bring the
sort of content like experience to the
PC platform now it's all revolves around
this controller this is going to be the
gamepad that the steam machines run and
they sort of imitates a proper mouse and
keyboard or a trackball experience or
really whatever you'd like now it can be
used to emulate your traditional mouse
and keyboard or it can be used to
operate sort of as a trackball or as a
gaming pad and something you might be
familiar with from the xbox one or the
PlayStation 4 now the controls here can
be mapped and altered you know
configured anywhere you like and that's
going to be helpful when you're playing
some of these thousands of games
available on Steam now see machines are
going to come in all shapes and sizes
you can expect machines from companies
like talkin Northwest and alienware but
the one I'm most interested in is the
steam link now this fifty dollar box
also available in November can actually
connect to your home network and it will
connect to your existing gaming PC and
stream games from your actual gaming PC
or a steam machine if you also like to
own a state machine to your television
that's gonna be super interesting for
someone like me who builds an Opie
season is constantly upgrading and
always is going to want the best of the
best but not necessarily wants to shell
out for a new steam machine every couple
of months you expect the steam link and
all the other steam machines that are
going to be available in stores starting
around this November I'm Nate raza cnet
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
