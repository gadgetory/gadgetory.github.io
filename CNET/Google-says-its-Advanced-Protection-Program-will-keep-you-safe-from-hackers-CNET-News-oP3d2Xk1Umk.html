your password to keep your account safe
passwords get stolen by hackers all the
time and even if you have a two-factor
code sent to your phone by text message
well bad news hackers can in some cases
intercept those too
now Google thinks it has an even
stronger system to keep hackers out this
tiny keyring may not look like much but
it's what Google says will keep your
email account as secure as possible from
hackers this key ring is at the very
heart of Google's new so-called advanced
protection program
the keyring acts a lot like a physical
key like to your house or to your car
except it's for your Gmail inbox and
while it's not a replacement for your
password only one of these key rings
makes stealing your password basically
pointless because any hacker trying to
access your account will also need your
physical key as well here's how it works
to log into your Google account you'll
enter your email address and password
and then you push the button on the
keyring and you're logged in that's it
it's fairly simple you might think well
what's the point I can just use the
usual two-factor authentication that
Google already offers why would I need a
physical key well granted for most
people two factor authentication will
protect against the majority of hacks
and attacks but a physical key is much
harder to steal than a text message or a
code sent to your phone especially from
hackers who are in other countries or
working for a foreign government these
physical keys also protect you from fake
phishing sites that try to steal your
password because these keys only work on
genuine Google pages Google says that
those who are most at risk from
state-sponsored hacking should sign up
for the security program like activists
politicians and lawmakers business
leaders and even reporters and
journalists who need to protect their
sources there is a downside to use these
keys you'll have to give a little bit of
convenience for your protection you can
only use Gmail comm and Google's own
apps for iPhone and Android when you
sign up that said for about twenty
dollars for each key ring one you'll
keep with you and one as a backup you'll
need to keep somewhere safe
any Google user can sign up and benefit
from what the company says is its
strongest account protections yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
