one s it's real and it's forty percent
smaller has an integrated power supply
supports HDR gaming and 4k resolutions
and it'll go for 299 when it's released
in August what about the games all the
exclusive titles shown here were labeled
Xbox play anywhere meaning they're
exclusive to Xbox one and Windows 10
it's a bit of a language pivot as
Microsoft tries to blur the lines
between their console and PC gaming
things kicked off with Gears of War for
which will support co-op cross play
between the xbox one and pc gameplay
look well it looked like a Gears of War
game that comes out October 10th forts
of horizon 3 was announced it's being
touted as the most social force a game
ever that hits September 27 we got a
more in-depth preview of recore it's
looking like a stylized action
platformer game where you can make use
of a group of different robots in your
journey that's set for September 13 then
we got a final fantasy 15 demo it's not
Xbox exclusive but we saw a really
strange boss fight that wasn't very
exciting it was tough to figure out what
was going on but that games out
September 30th Xbox Live is getting new
features that are aimed to improve the
online community experience they're
adding clubs which will organize groups
of like-minded gamers and arena which
sounds like Xbox Live's new tournament
gaming platform if you've ever dreamt
about totally customizing your own xbox
controller now you can using xbox design
lab that's pretty cool ID at Xbox got
some stage time they showed off some
indie offerings for Xbox one owners
inside the game from the studio that
made limbo will be hitting in June and
we also saw a really solid demo for a
game called we happy few which will be
available on Xbox game preview starting
july 26 third-party developers also took
the stage to announce new games but
they're not exclusive to xbox tekken 7
will be debuting in 2017 and a
christmas-themed dead rising for is also
on the way presumably in time for the
holiday
but we don't know the dates just yet we
got to preview a really over-the-top
boss battle and scalebound which will
release next year also on the docket
with some pre-cut gameplay of sea of
thieves the coop pirate adventure game
from rare and we were also teased with
state of decay two and halo wars to
finally Xbox head Phil Spencer took the
stage talk about the future of the Xbox
family he announced something called
Project Scorpio Xbox new console that
was leaked out recently and played a
very short video that attempted to
summarize what the new hardware is it
will support full 4k gaming and VR and
ultra powerful GPU and live alongside
the xbox one and xbox one s family of
consoles so right now microsoft says
project scorpio will be out holiday 2017
but that's obviously subject to change
we don't know much more about scorpio
and quite honestly it's getting tough to
make sense of two new consoles being
released so which one are you supposed
to buy and should you wait for Scorpio
