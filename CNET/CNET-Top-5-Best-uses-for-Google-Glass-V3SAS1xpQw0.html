this year the most interesting has got
to be Google's internet-connected
eyewear Google glass but aside from
making you look a little strange and
taking pictures as you recklessly spin
people's kids around
well Google glass actually do for you
I'm Donald Bell and today's top five
I'll be counting down my list of the
most useful ways that Google glass might
be worth the public humiliation starting
things off at number five TV enhancement
a little screen help make watch the big
screen more fun now Google doesn't show
any couch potatoes in their promo videos
but you know is gonna happen you could
call it play your stats during a
baseball game or look up an actor's IMDB
page during Game of Thrones on the
downside Google has a knack for putting
ads on everything it makes at number
four biofeedback you think the Nike
FuelBand is awesome you just wait until
you have a heads-up display of your
heartrate your calories burn your steps
taken all that stuff superimposed over
your morning jog maybe it'll help you
with your golf swing or jump shot maybe
you will gently remind you that you've
been sitting on your ass in front of
your computer for six hours straight
Google glass could make us better people
coming in at number three face
recognition now Google hasn't announced
this as an actual feature yet and I
understand that there is a huge privacy
obliterating downside if they ever did
but won't it be fun for like a minute I
mean as someone who is really bad at
remembering people's names
it would be like crutches from my brain
oh hey how's it going Dave you know it
would maybe would also tip you off
there's someone at a party that you want
to avoid like an X or some creep wearing
Google glasses all right now we're
starting to get into the genuinely
useful stuff at number two instruction
want to learn how to bake the perfect
oatmeal cookie just pull up the step by
step YouTube video on your eyeball need
advice on changing a diaper hopefully
not your diaper just get mom on a Google
hangout and a show or a point of view
streaming HD video of what a disastrous
parent you are so we can upload skills
directly into our brain matrix style
Google glass might be the next best
thing but it also has the potential to
be the final blow to any sense of
personal space we have left before we
get to the number one potential benefit
of Google glass let's account for the
negative side effects have you ever had
a complete stranger come up to you and
put a camera in your face it's
unsettling and if Google glass takes off
like Google hopes any notion of public
anonymity will be gone we will be the
big brother we've always feared and if
you think smartphones have killed dinner
table conversation just wait until
Facebook and Twitter are running
constantly on everyone's eyeballs it's
enough to make you want to live off the
grid and black out the windows in your
solar-powered geodesic dome you have
every right to be ambivalent about this
thing but maybe it's all worth it for
number one right navigation Google glass
looks like the best tool ever invented
for the directionally challenged whether
you're in your car on your bike or
hiking around you've got a permanent
readout of where you are and where you
want to go it'll be great for tourists
or just anyone trying to figure out
their way out of an Ikea so there you
have it five potential uses for Google
glass that have me both excited and
slightly terrified for Humanity you can
follow me over on Twitter for updates on
my geodesic bunker or head over to top-5
