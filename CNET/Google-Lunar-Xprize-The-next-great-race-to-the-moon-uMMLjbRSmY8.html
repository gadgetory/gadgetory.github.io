Teague launched a
twenty-five-thousand-dollar prize for
the first person who could fly from New
York to Paris non-stop it took eight
years for a man to win that prize
Charles Lindbergh and ultimately that
kicked off the transatlantic flight
system 10 years ago a company called
Scaled Composites won the 10 million
dollar and sorry x prize being the first
company to take us up to the edge of
space and back down again kicking off
what will be ultimately a very lucrative
space tourism market the latest prize is
the google lunar xprize 30 million
dollars worth of prizes to the team that
can get us all the way to the moon it's
like a game of cards everyone is playing
but there must be a winner we are going
to the moon we are very confident on
winning x prize we're down to 18 teams
now all of whom are gathered here in
Budapest for the annual team summit the
teams are kind of helping each other out
but don't forget they're also competing
it's only the first one that gets to the
moon and drives 500 meters and send us
back live video it's eligible for the 30
million dollars in prizes over the next
year you're going to see a lot of
activity from our team we're gonna be
working every day and tell me lunch now
in addition to the 30 million dollar
prizes there's six million dollars worth
of cash up for grabs over the course of
the summer of 2014 these are called
milestone prizes and five teams are
eligible for those prizes teams that are
part of the XPrize already felt that
what they were doing was important but
the fact that teams can earn money while
they're doing what they need to do any
way to get to the moon is substantial
over this summer we're going to be
visiting all five of those milestone
teams in the u.s. Germany Japan even in
India to see their test we're going to
see Rovers driving around courtesy
rockets firing honor
it's gonna be pretty awesome stuff and
you will not want to miss it I believe
this entire Google X pies and pop time
sinus is pretty awesome you get to learn
so much more things that you would have
never come in contact with in your
normal life we are participating in
something very special and very very
great thing i'm tim stevens was seen at
and join us for the rest of the courage
of the milestone test for the google
lunar xprize</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
