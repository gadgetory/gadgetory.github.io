and on this table we're gonna do a
little bit of a comparison on the fly
air pods versus beats X versus power
beats 3 these are all w1 chip based
headsets they are wireless although you
know some of them do have wires but
let's kind of first break down the stats
and then find out which ones are best
for you and how you want to use them ok
so I'm off the air pods
1:59 price point obviously the most
Wireless of them these are really the
true wireless earbuds the big thing
about them is you can only use either
Siri or pause and play you have one
command or the other you can't do
anything else so it doesn't have the
functionality of the others also really
one size fits all if this does not fit
in your ear it's just not going to be an
option right away but the convenience of
them the fact that it has an additional
you know pack that carries em looks like
dental floss but gives you 24 hours of
juice if you have the charging case with
you which you will um that's what you
have here now let's go over here the
beats X the cheapest of the group 149
price point you have the wire design
that looks you know less less goofy I
guess you could say it has the full
functionality pause play stop track
change volume up right here in the
remote also the best sounding of the
bunch because they fit really deep into
your ear it seals off the sound and you
get the most bass and um from them and
then let's check out the power beats 3
this is the most expensive of the bunch
for $1.99 it's really for someone who is
super active running shooting hoops if
you like to warm up and do that these
are the ones for you they do have a
wired design but it's a lot shorter it
wraps around the back of your neck and
then you can tighten it it also has the
full functionality with the remote on
the side and then it wraps around your
ears so it keeps them really stable some
people don't like that feeling but I
love them when I work out now if we talk
about call quality because this is
important in the microphone which one's
the best in our tests the air pods stand
out as the best one for call quality
both receiving and sending your voice
when you talk about ii these two guys
are pretty close but what stood out the
most of the beats x the microphone
actually kind of rests closer to your
mouth so we tend to find that it was
better sounding versus the power beats
where the mic is let rest a little
further back so it it might be a little
more muted they all work fine but if you
want to talk about call quality it's
going to be the air pods
let's talk battery life here the air
pods are equipped with five hours of
battery juice but then this extra packet
comes with that you can carry around
with
you gives it 24 hours if you talk about
the beat sex that gives you around 8
hours of juice from start to finish but
you don't have a charging case with it
and then if we talk about the power
beats 3 that gives you 12 hours of juice
before you have to recharge them now
just for you break it down if you had to
choose one of these three I'm also going
to lean towards the air pods the reason
being they are the most convenient they
are really truly wireless as long as you
don't care what they look like these are
going to be the ones of the three if you
had to pick one that I would say you
know what you got to go this way now the
beats X falls somewhere in the middle
again they have the best sound but if
you're someone who's really all about
Fitness like I said the power beats 3
they are $1.99 these are really the best
if you're an active person but if you
you know you want to go ham you're a
baller I'd say get the air pods for
everyday use get the power beats 3 for
exercise and you're going to be set so
you just kind of wanted to break down
the advantages and disadvantages the air
pods versus the beats X versus the power
beats 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
