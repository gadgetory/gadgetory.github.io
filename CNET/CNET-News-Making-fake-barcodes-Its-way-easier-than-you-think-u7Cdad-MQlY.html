conference rooms for court rooms this
week as he faces four felony counts of
burglary the accusation running a bar
code scam to buy Legos at a fraction of
their actual cost how you ask well the
man allegedly covered up barcodes with
forged labels that he created it turns
out it's not that hard to print these up
at home the result he paid far less than
retail value at checkout the retail
industry doesn't track barcode fraud
separately but along with other losses
it all adds up to a pretty penny
we know that retailers lost over thirty
five billion dollars in 2010 due to
theft fraud and switching and replacing
barcodes on store merchandise there are
high tech fixes such as RFID tags but
they come at a price some of the
expensive solutions are some of the new
league design checkout systems that
detect weight so all of the weights and
measures are entered in every piece of
information about that product comes in
a cheaper line of defense is employee
vigilance 92 95 percent of all products
everywhere has a barcode physically
printed on the box or the label they
should know that if there's a sticky
back label with a barcode that should
raise a red flag so it goes back to
training stores should also make sure
point-of-sale terminals display specific
details when a product is scanned so
cashiers can match descriptions with
physical items</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
