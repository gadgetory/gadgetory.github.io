CES 2015 I got a pretty cool demo lined
up with the tag gps + pet tracker and
joining me is tag CEO Scott neuberger so
thanks for joining us Scott and I see
the new tracker her tell us a little bit
about what makes it new because you've
been doing pet trackers for a little
while now yeah so tagged gps + is a
brand new device launching this week at
CES shipping in February um it's
designed to be stronger longer and
faster than the original tag device has
a new collar attachment system so it's
over 10 times stronger attachment to the
collar why do you need to have the color
stronger our dogs trying to take it off
you'd be surprised how much force dogs
are involved in when they're running at
10 miles an hour you know snagging on a
tree this goes undergoes a lot of force
a lot more than any human wearable goes
under um definitely flexible but also
still light because I think that's also
important to a dog owner they don't want
their dog be wearing something heavy on
the collar absolutely the new device was
also designed everything inside of it
was miniaturized we were able to get a
larger battery in the device it's got a
twenty percent larger battery in the
same size actually a little bit smaller
product also the software has been
totally rebuilt to make it detect
breaches even faster so if your dog
escapes you'll learn about that escape
even faster than before which is already
the fastest in the market so by putting
this on your dog you you're able to get
an alert of not only when they leave a
certain perimeter so like you can pre
set up a perimeter exactly so you set a
tag safe zone and when that around your
house around your work around anywhere
that you bring your dog and if as soon
as your dog leaves that zone you'll get
an immediate alert on your phone you can
open up the app iOS or Android app and
find them the other major new feature
about the devices we're introducing a
air temperature sensor into the device
first of its kind in a wearable device
so if your dogs over in a dangerous
condition either too hot or too cold
you'll know about it over 3,000 dogs die
per year and a hot car
we want to make sure that never happens
again we we have a demo of this right
now actually so let's go to the map of
the tag tracker what are we seeing on
the screen right here you're seeing on
the screen right here is Henry which is
the service dog of Janet who's outside
the the las vegas convention center so
we have our Henry camp set up and Janet
and they're wearing why the tag trackers
right trackers they're located right
there and they're going to make their
way into the city on the map on your
laptop Henry's just right outside the
convention center it's it it definitely
has the pin point outside of the
building so how exact can this GPS get I
mean obviously as a challenge for GPS
sure so so it's within 20 meters plus or
minus um so it's pretty accurate it's
the same accuracy you would get from any
GPS you know in your car or anything
else so there is a little bit of error
but but within 20 meters it's almost
exact now Henry is a service dog for
Janet and we can tell you said
temperature so can we tell that it's a
little colder outside than it is in here
doesn't have his temperature yet on
there so the temperatures not yet built
into the app but it will be before the
februari launch of the product the idea
is that if your dog is outside for too
long on a hot day especially someplace
in Las Vegas that's good to get an alert
automatically push to your phone exactly
so so yeah it's a connected device it's
on the internet all the time if it ever
sense is a dangerous condition it will
let you know immediately long does that
battery lasts so that's one of the great
things about the product it lasts over
two weeks in between charges and we
believe the new device will be even
longer that's because of our exclusive
powersave technology that we've built
into the device so about two weeks she
said yeah yeah cuz obviously dog does
want to have this collar up I mean
messed with all the time so I guess you
would have to just charge it overnight
one night every two weeks or something
yeah exactly it actually charges quite
fast about in about two hours you get a
notice on your phone when the battery is
low and then you'll get a notice again
when it's fully charged and so you can
put it right back on your on your
now what are some of the challenges in
building trackers for dogs vs humans say
I mean the trackers right now are a big
industry it's blowing up we're seeing
trackers for kids trackers for pets
they're all doing different things but
what do you find to be a big challenge
that you're trying to work on right now
sure so you know get making the advice
as small as you possibly can everybody
wants to you know everybody wants to be
able to get it on even the I got the
smallest cat or the smallest toy poodle
so we're always trying to miniaturize
the product on this this we've been able
to miniaturize quite significantly in
this version while still maintaining a
long battery life in fact even longer
battery life than the original device
making sure it is easy to take on and
take off um you know it sounds simple
but something that's easy we got Henry
in the elevator making our way up here
so eventually we're going to be able to
you know update the app and be able to
see the difference in this right exactly
um you know I'm also wondering about
when it comes to GPS trackers if there
are other ways to or what people are
wanting in their phone in terms of
alerts sure because there's different
kinds of things you get set up now
people are doing all sorts of apps to
control where their families at I guess
you have a partnership with alarm calm
now right yeah so we're announcing this
partnership with alarm calm this week at
CES it's a full integration of our of
our product into their system so tagged
gps + can be purchased by alarm.com
customers and integrated as another
device in their alarm comm system so
just like their video cameras they're
smart thermostats and now their pet
tracker is all part of their alarm
system and they're connected home a
system at home all in one I mean now we
have smart devices I guess that's the
key trying to bring these different
devices together right exactly bring all
these different devices together let
them talk to each other let them
interact with each other and let the
user experience them all in one
environment so they don't have five
different apps five different things
they have to remember login it's all in
one place and
and it's a seamless seamless product
machine any future and oh here they come
they're almost at the stage here I
wonder if the cameras going to show that
out there that here we go Henry has
arrived so we can whoa and so is Janet
alright so let's update the app to be
able to see obviously if if your dog was
lost you'd be able to keep checking
where they're where they are to go you
know take care of it yourself versus
having something like a chip put in the
more or here you have a lot more control
right so so this gives you the control
to find your dog yourself anything else
a chip or anything it's leaving in the
hands of a Good Samaritan or somebody
else and you know for somebody you love
like a member of your family you want to
have that control to keep them safe at
all times well well this is delightful I
think it's a CES first we have a dog on
our scene aid station well Jan I don't
ask you a few questions so thank you for
doing this demo I really appreciate it
up so what has it been like with having
your time with the tracker is this
something that you would really see a
big value and for what you do really the
safety of my dog is paramount for me
because if something happens to him then
I'm lost he is still in training so that
if he was to go exploring on his own
which he's been known to do I could find
him and so it's very it's very important
the other thing that I'm kind of a its
safety paramount is safety his safety is
is my biggest concern you know what what
about the data plan on something like
this I mean it are things getting more
affordable how are things changing with
with being able to have live gps
tracking at all times yeah so we've been
able to get our data costs down to the
lowest of anybody in the industry on
because of as the industry blows up
there's more and more out there is
easier to do so our cost is only ten
dollars a month and five dollars a month
for multiple trackers give you a couple
dogs it just adds another five dollars
instead of ten dollars
we got you and there's so much data
being created by the device you can men
on eter their health their activity how
much activity they're getting make sure
that they're getting enough activity
this tracker inside of all of this
you're also getting like someone's like
that yeah is there a point where there's
just too much data we haven't reached
that point yet but we'll let you know
when we do well thank you so much for
this demo this is delightful and thank
you jen and henry i really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
