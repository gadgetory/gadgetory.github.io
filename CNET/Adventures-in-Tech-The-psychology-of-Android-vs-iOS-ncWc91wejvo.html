psychology that fuels the smartphone war
iOS Android a bitter war of gadget
rivalry that shows no signs of abating
but why do we get so worked up over
something as ordinary as phone software
the answer lies in the psychological
makeup of humankind and the prehistoric
mental mind games that our brains love
to play I wanted to explore the science
behind smartphone passion why do online
discussions about Android or iOS so
frequently turn aggressive but as it
turns out grasping the intricacies of
the human mind is harder than we thought
you come across a tortoise lying face
down in the desert
subjective luckily we bumped into
psychology lecturer mark Colson who
explained that while fans grouping
together is a natural human process the
act of being part of these groups makes
your brain do some very weird stuff
group memberships and incredibly
importantly we are social species we've
designed to operate in groups but one of
the things that goes alongside group
coherence is some sense of difference
from other groups and that might be
translated into disliking or even
aggression the technical name for these
clubs are in-groups and out-groups
humans can mentally place themselves in
a group in mere minutes while research
suggests that strong psychological
allegiances can form over very trivial
matters like whether iOS or Android is
best or whether the heart-stopping
Adventures of the handsome Captain Kirk
are more exciting than the boring war
councils of Captain Picard our tendency
to form these gangs can have unwanted
side effects our minds end up twisting
the way we hear information so that the
group we belong to seems superior not
surprisingly perhaps when you're told
information about a group you're not a
member of you're more likely to remember
the negative information and less likely
to remember the positive information
anyone with a human brain is vulnerable
to this odd tribal behavior no matter
how unimportant the thing you're siding
with really is perceiving Android or iOS
fans are sworn enemies isn't
particularly helpful so why does it
happen the answer is that once upon a
time this sort of uncouth behavior could
have kept you alive
compared to mammoths and saber-toothed
Tigers prehistoric humans were basically
useless completely bereft of Awesome
claws or shaggy fur to stay alive these
pitiable Apes had to stick together as a
group and to make that team spirit
happen their brains emphasized the
positive aspect of their own tribe while
seeing the worst in other groups so we
are a pack animal we're an animal that
hunts in groups the best way to ensure
that that's a successful strategy is to
have processes that keep groups together
of course this psychology stuff doesn't
tell the whole story of why we feel so
passionate
Android and iOS but grasping how our
caveman Minds influence our actions does
help us understand why we get so wound
up we live in a mind-blowing age but our
daft old ate brains are still playing
catch-up and we should be wary of
letting these wants useful mental
oddities get the better of us after all
Android and iOS they're both pretty cool
if we are people who have bought into
iOS or Android then these are both
fantastic tools they're wonderful they
they allow us to do things which are
really valuable why do you think we get
so passionate about our mobiles and
who's the better Captain Kirk or Picard
let me know and tune in next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
