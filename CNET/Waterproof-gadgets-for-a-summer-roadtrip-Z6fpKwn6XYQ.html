them in the drink and it's a very
expensive paperweight I'm like sisa
biddies from CNN I'm gonna give you some
tips on your waterproof gadgets plus a
couple of top picks for your summer
vacation the first thing you to look out
for when buying a waterproof order dust
proof gadget is the IP rating the first
digit in the IP rating is to do with its
dust resistance and the second digit is
all about waterproofing for example an
ip67 gadget like the Samsung Galaxy s5
is totally dust proof that's what the
six means and the seven relates to how
waterproof it is so one meter
submerged for up to thirty minutes an X
in either of those digits just means
that it's either not waterproof or dust
proof now onto the gadgets if you want
something that's going to make the most
of your summertime adventures and
harness the power of the sun's and the
rugged ruckus is for you this is a
Bluetooth speaker plus it can also
recharge your gadgets via microUSB it

direct sunlight plus it's also ipx4

submerged up to two meters for 30
minutes and it works for iPhones Samsung
Galaxy handsets and a couple of extra
ones as well for beats by the beach or
the pool then the logitech ue boom is
one for you this is a wireless speaker
it is ipx4 so it means it can be
splashed about as much as you like and
won't break plus if you've got two of
them you can hook them up side-by-side
via the UE boom app and stream your
music in stereo if you can't bear to be
without a big screen on your holiday
then the Sony Xperia z2 tablet may be
for you it's got scratch resistant glass

something on it plus it's IP or 58 rated

50 feet plus it's as tough as old boots
