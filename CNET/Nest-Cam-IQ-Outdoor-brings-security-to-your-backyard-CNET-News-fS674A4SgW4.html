intelligent outdoor security camera on
the market today it provides critical
and actionable information like if
there's a stranger in your driveway or
your backyard it also can give you peace
of mind by letting you know when your
family comes home this is so packed with
technology I'm going to share with you a
couple of my favorite features first of
all nest cam IQ outdoor is really smart
it can tell me from 50 feet away if
there's a stranger in my driveway or if
it's just my babysitter and if it is a
stranger with super sight I can zoom in
on that person from the app and track
them as they go through my property and
I get a picture-in-picture view for full
context so I can see what's really going
on and that makes for better security
because if you have a bad guy in your
property you want to make sure they
never get into your home in the first
place the other thing that I really love
about nest cam IQ outdoor is that it's
beautiful
you know most outdoor security cameras
look pretty industrial and that's fine
on a warehouse or a parking garage but
not so much on your home so we designed
something beautiful and we put a lot of
thought into that design it's ip66 rated
so your security stands up to the
elements also its tamper resistant and
the power cable is designed to run flush
through the wall so it can't be tampered
with it also doesn't have any batteries
it's always plugged in so you don't have
to worry about it going offline it also
has a speaker that's 15 times more
powerful than the speaker that's in nest
cam IQ today so if there is a bad guy
outside my house I'm gonna open up the
app and home to go away and he's gonna
hear me nest cam IQ outdoor is the first
beautifully designed rugged outdoor
security camera with facial recognition
there are so many so much capability
packed in this camera that I'm not going
to cover it all the day but I'm going to
encourage you to go upstairs for demos a
little bit later and see it live nest
cam IQ outdoor is available for
pre-order today for three hundred and
forty nine dollars in the US and Canada
and it'll be shipping in November and
the US Canada and Europe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
