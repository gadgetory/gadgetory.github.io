scale and spin for the cameras
that's the pitch for The Naked labs body
scanner a $1400 smart mirror and scale
available right now along with measuring
your weight and body fat percentage the
3d depth sensing camera is an Intel
processor in the mirror capture your
physical form from every angle which
lets you scrutinize your love handles on
your phone or compare them with last
month's skin now maybe that all sounds
terrifying but it's right in line with
for today's data-driven smart homes
seems to be headed and as our team
tested the scanner out here at the scene
at smart home we came away with some
strikingly different conclusions so the
naked mirror not gonna lab broke my
spirit a little bit when I stepped on it
the first time I thought I felt pretty
good about my body and my self-image but
when I stood on the scale and let the
mirror take all these 3d renderings of
me and then saw myself like looking like
a big pile of mercury I could see every
lump and bump and that was distressing
it's one thing to look in a static
mirror when you're at home and check out
your butt in the mirror see how it looks
in those jeans but it's another thing to
have this like very intimate portrait of
yourself in your pocket so I probably
wouldn't pay for the naked mirror but I
actually kind of appreciated I've been
trying to eat better and work out and
get in better shape and when I first
started to do that an ordinary scale was
showing me progress I was losing weight
but after a few months of that I stopped
losing weight and then it was tough to
see if what I was doing was having any
effect the naked mirrored gives you
those kind of details they're able to
see the body image you're able to see
your fat percentage you're able to see
all of this stuff that could point to
the fact that okay no the pounds aren't
coming off like they used to but you're
getting a little bit more toned the fat
percentage is going down or no no you
really are plateauing in every way so
you need to workout a little bit more I
think it could be helpful and I'd use it
if it was around though I'm not super
sure it's worth the money for what it's
worth the scanner worked as advertised
giving all of us precise accurate
measurements and frightening ly
realistic scans with only the occasional
Bluetooth glitch naked labs stores your
sensitive data in the cloud encrypted
and decoupled from identifiable personal
data of course even the faces are a bit
blurry to help reassure that no one
could identify you if that cloud ever
sprang a leak now I doubt that that's
enough for some folks to feel
comfortable at this thing but I also see
lots of potential naked labs wants to
let you sync your scans with personal
trainers medical professionals and even
clothing manufacturers to help put that
personal data to use it's a tall order
but if the company can establish trust
with consumers I can see people buying
in still it's very early and very
expensive at 1,400 dollars the price
will undoubtedly need to come down in
order for this tech to make its way into
the mainstream but as much as people
obsess over fitness and physique this is
a category and a company worth keeping
an eye on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
