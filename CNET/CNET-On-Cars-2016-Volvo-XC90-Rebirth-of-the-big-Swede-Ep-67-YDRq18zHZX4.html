future Android auto finally hits the
road it's just like using your phone and
CNET's top rated cars mid 2015 it's time
to check the tech PC cars differently
nice you loved them on the road and
under the hood but also check the tech
and are known for telling it like it is
ugly is included at no extra cost the
good the bad the bottom line this is CNN
on cars
welcome to scene at on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian cooling well volvo as you know
has always marched to its own beat and
in recent years it kind of marched off
into the weeds now they're plotting a
course for comeback row and i'm doing it
in that guy the all new xc90 the big
launch for them let's drive one and
check the tech this is the new xc90 and
it's a very big story for them now I can
recall not too long ago well yeah it was
long ago when Volvo was the number one
selling European luxury car in the US
you didn't talk about mercedes and BMW
and Audi that much in those days where
sounds have changed in the first third
of this year luxury car sales in the US
have gone up about five percent and
Volvo sales about zero percent that's
what they aim to fix with these guys
these xc90 s come in two basic flavors a
t6 and a t8 the six of the eight share
the same combustion powertrain but then
the eight adds plug-in hybrid electric
motivation on top of that they're both
three row seven seat vehicles and as you
can see they've got a new but
identifiable Volvo look this is their
first big project since the acquisition
by Chinese money five years ago so a lot
of eyes are watching both t6 and t8 xc90
s have the same unusual engine a small
2-liter four-cylinder but it gets bulked
way up by not a turbo or a supercharger
but both the supercharger kicks in first
the turbo takes over at higher rpm at
which point the supercharger disengages
to reduce drag then the t8 steps it up
with more tech because we've added the
motor in the back the battery in the
middle and all of our transfer and
control circuitry 400 horsepower now 472
pound-feet of torque zero to 60 comes
down from around six seconds to 5.3 even
though the weight goes up about 400
pounds efficiency is expected to be
around 59 MPGe which is typically how
you start to look at these cars that can
spend a fair amount of time running
electric we don't have it fully
certified EPA yet in front of you is an
LCD instrument panel that's becoming
almost required in luxury vehicles over
here to the rights of one that your eyes
been tending toward right there's a
tablet style interface and it's more
than just tablet in its size and
orientation it's also tablet it's muscle
memory you got a home button at the
bottom you drag down here to get your
settings you go left and right to go to
specialty screens on the left or all
your vehicle and car functions go back
one more to home go another one to right
and there's all your infotainment
functions it's a whole lot of settings
for your different driver assist
controls including parking including
collision avoidance lane keeping aids
reading road signs to get that up on the
head-up display and things of that
nature let's talk about the driver
assist now since that's what's
controlled they're the ones getting a
lot of attention handles your injuries
or hopefully prevents them if you go off
the road but it doesn't prevent you from
doing that that's already existing in
lane keep and lane departure
management this is one that handles
spinal injuries if you go into those
ruts on the side of the road at high
speed so it's going to give you more of
a crush zone underneath the seat
it also cinches up the belt they say
it's all about spinal compression
protection there's automatic braking
during left turns at intersections so if
you're about to turn into someone and
get yourself t-boned the car won't let
you it's gonna cram on the brakes this
is all camera and radar based the same
camera and radar looking out front for
pedestrians and cyclists both day and
night and with automatic braking there's
a rear-end protection system here you
know it's the worst feeling in the world
you're sitting there a sitting duck and
you see someone's about to plow in the
up and if that's the case it's gonna
lock its own brakes to prevent its
movement as a projectile and it's also
gonna cinch up your belts to prevent
your movement as a projectile pilot
assist is similar to what a lot of
carmakers are bringing out which is the
first step of autonomy it'll handle
adaptive cruise so slow speed stop and
go and keep you in your lane and your
drive controls in the xc90 begin in a
very Swedish manner with an RO force
crystal drive control handle which gets
you into your PRN D and B high
regeneration mode because we're in the
electrified t8 here is your start/stop
you rotate this thing and behind there
is this nice little neural drum which
you turn and click to get to your
different drive modes now all-wheel
drive is where you force it to go into
AWD using that rear electric apparatus
here's a mode that says don't use the
battery I want it for later hybrid is
kind of as you can imagine a mix of both
for general use power is your sporty
self explanatory mode here's a rough
road mode again adaptive suspension
all-wheel drive this vehicle can stretch
itself various ways and you can set up
and cook your own mix under individual
so not only is that third row pretty
credible I'm gonna have seen much
smaller here's a sign of our times the
middle seat in the second row can be
moved forward and back forward so the
little one back here doesn't get
separation anxiety
I wonder which country's market research
told them they needed this
I'm in the t8 right now some numbers on
its electrification it's got about 17
miles of pure evey range what's
interesting is it can run electrically
in the right conditions up to about 80
miles an hour so it can be a full
freeway electric car and your charge
time if you've got a 240 volt high amp
circuit which you're going to want for a
plug-in car is about two and a half
hours and of course it regens as you go
none of these drive modes I find that
the you know pure eco drives what you'd
expect it's quite muted as you can
imagine this power mode the sporty mode
is the one that gives you your best
engagement really feels the best but it
won't be the most efficient I'm hearing
a lot of sort of electric power train
sounds which sometimes can be oddly
intrusive whining sounds but I need to
wait till we get a final us spec
production xc90 in our hands to really
judge this powertrain one thing I can
tell you now you will hardly believe
that there's a small 4-cylinder at the
heart of this rig really comfortable
ride and then a great job dialing in the
quality of the ride now it doesn't
matter what of the modes I'm in it's
never harsh and it doesn't feel like
it's weight to be honest this doesn't
feel like the poundage that it reads on
paper which is always a nice trick for a
car now when I'm liking in this t6 that
I'm getting a chance to sample is the
lane-keeping technology that Volvo uses
it's very nuanced it's very confident
feeling that's going to be important as
we roll out semi self-driving cars soon
to consumers the vehicle feels like it
is really in charge and knows what it's
doing it's gonna go a long way toward
getting people to leave the skeptical
range and say you know what this works
okay let's wrap up now five points that
make the xc90 very notable first of all
you see the whole new look it's a fresh
face for Volvo and it's gonna have to
make a market impression get inside
you've got the new look and feel of the
census Kinect technology under the hood
they've made a bold move two
four-cylinder engines not even big ones
that have turbos and supercharging
they've got the plug-in technology added
to the t8 variant and finally they've
got some state-of-the-art driver assist
technology that in some cases nobody
else has or at least has as aggressively
this will be important cars to watch
when the t6 arrives July 15 the t8 in
October find our full take on the new
xc90 over at car cnet.com well there's
been a huge amount of tech innovation in
headlights in the last 10 years or so
but it turns out one of the biggest
needed innovations is not technology but
technique that of the smarter driver
using those headlights we'll get into
that when see that on cars continued
well it's dusk evenings approaching
you're about to out drive your
headlights
you're probably driving in the speed or
what you can hit
is out there beyond what you can see you
can remedy it with better lights and
more use of them a recent study by the
Automobile Club of Southern California's
Automotive Research Center says
bottom-line better headlights should be
standard on a luxury tech option they
examine the real-world performance of
three basic families of headlights first
halogen headlights like what I've got
here on the 88 Ford and what maybe 80%
of cars on the road in the u.s. today
have as well this high-intensity
discharge headlights those are the ones
give you that kind of whitish blue
really intense beam and finally LED
headlights which to be honest are still
pretty exotic and rare they examine each
kind of headlight technologies for its
reach that would be how well it can
illuminate something non reflective like
an animal or a typically dressed person
on a road without overhead street lights
which by the way to couch for something
like forty percent of the miles we drive
each year they say the results well
first of all halogen just doesn't cut it
you can overdrive them as low as 40
miles an hour
high-intensity and LED low beams extend
illumination by about 25% beyond halogen
high-intensity and LED high beams got
out to nearly 500 feet and that covers
you up to about 55 miles an hour and
both those advanced types put out less
light here in the US than the same ones
on cars sold in Europe to regulatory
things now the behavior piece is
interesting they also found that most of
us are kind of shy about using our high
beams we're afraid to blind the guy in
front of us there were too lazy to sit
there and flick on flick off all the
time
so we overdrive our low beens typically
but this is kind of a shame because your
high beams can buy you 28% or so more
reactions on that's really a big deal so
three takeaways first use your high
beams see if the next car you buy offers
Auto high beams to do all the flicking
for you second opt for high-intensity or
LED headlights they really do make a
difference in reach and third check your
car for cloudy headlamp lens
they don't just reduce your range they
also scatter more glare at the other guy
it pays to double check if your car has
the most modern lighting technology
especially buying a new one now if
you're using your high beams and not
getting lazy and ignoring them and
realize that no matter what mode you're
in you're very likely out driving your
lights welcome back to see net on cars
coming to you from our home at the Mount
Tam Motor Club just north of the Golden
Gate Bridge well is almost exactly a
year ago we told you here on the show of
the announcement of Android auto and now
it's actually coming to showrooms for
the first time in 2015 Hyundai Sonata
it's a big step for the car maker and
for the industry as this is part of the
new vanguard of what you'll see in the
dash and how it's going to get there
let's see how Hyundai's done it first on
the road to the future well here I am in
my car with my Android phone and that
combination normally means some
hodgepodge Bluetooth connection for
streaming and calling some contacts
transfer some variable basket of apps
with different interfaces and this thing
clipped on the windshield or worse
juggled in my hand here's how we go into
the future
this new Sonata has the first production
rollout of Android auto an affordable
car it all starts down here you cable
your Android phone into the system as if
you were going to charge it let's say
it's not Wireless right now then you
lose the phone look up here on the dash
that icon just changed to Android auto
when you press that you're about to
enter the world of your phone but on the
dash for example right here your home
screen if you will is kind of a Google
now look things you've done or looked at
recently are relevant to where you are
right now
your round home button you recognize
that from your phone your phone icon
your nav icon
here's music and here's a return to main
screen you get over here to navigation
you recognize that interface that's
Google Maps your Google search box and
this is live and connected through your
phone plus the voice command to do that
beautiful freeform search that we love
that goes through the steering wheel
AT&amp;amp;T Park San Francisco here is AT&amp;amp;T
Park and of course the routing and
traffic calculations the same ones you
have on your phone but notice it's not
literally taking the whole screen and
putting it there it's artfully
translating it to the automotive
experience and limiting it to these main
hits of apps calling is very
straightforward again touch the call
nice big Clear button interfaces as well
to get things done on the touch screen
over here under music it goes to your
last streaming source from several on
your phone and if you want to get to
other choices it's got a drop-down next
to it
here are some music services with more
to come now if you were listening to say
radio before you hit Android auto it
respects that and doesn't force you to
suddenly switch to streaming customers
have told us that's what they want so
they want the phone experience that's
where where their life is in a lot of
ways their music their calendar the
places they want to go it's in their
phone so they bring that into the car
and they bring it in a way that
minimizes driver distraction the beauty
of this is that it lets you live with
your phone the same way in the car as
you do outside the car
okay so your initial takeaway on this is
how consistent it is with the experience
on your phone how it strips away things
and aren't essential to driving you
basically get what the big three here on
the screen imported from Android also
your interface is rock-solid you've got
a bigger screen mounted with good touch
response and integration to the voice
command button on the wheel though
blessedly the voice command is still
handled by Google in the cloud not by a
car system now specific to this car the
cost will be nothing if you've got a 15
or one of the pending 16 sonatas this is
a free retrograde or upgrade now that
free upgrade has to be done at the
dealer right now but later this summer
Hyundai says they'll make a download
available at my Hyundai comm and that it
will be simple enough that you won't
have to figure breaking your ride it
takes a little bit of time a tree
flashes the head unit you basically plug
it in and you do nothing until you
remove it when it's done and it will
tell you it's done so really almost no
interaction with the vehicle other cars
will follow later within their lineup
the other thing is you don't lose the
other Hyundai features not in this car
if you already have nav in the vehicle
you get back your places icon and you
can drop back down to Hyundai navigation
all the Hyundai media the Hyundai radio
choices so this is a dual stack strategy
later on Hyundai will have something
called a display audio system where
they're going to strip out navigation
and a few other bells and whistles and
you get a lot of the Google goodness in
there as a primary function not an added
function
and one of the most interesting things
about this is that it may signal the
beginning of carmakers admitting to some
degree that they don't do mobile as well
as the mobile company it would be
essentially impossible for us to keep up
with every infotainment option out there
so by letting Google handle that we're
able to bring used a variety of apps
into the car and meet the customers
needs send a message to Amy Johnson now
the other shoe to drop
soon is carplay which does basically the
same things in the same way but on your
iPhone Hyundai has that coming in early
2016 and the day after Hyundai put
Android auto in showrooms Chevy
announced virtually all its 2016 will
offer Android auto and apple carplay by
2020 it's expected that 40 million cars
will be running Android auto and nearly
that many carplay according to a recent
estimate by IHS automotive so here is
our first case of the new vanguard apple
carplay Android auto together they are a
massively important story of Mobile's
becoming consistent in the - and finally
here hitting the market at a very
affordable price point
in a moment pick your tech turbo diesel
or turbo gas and top five high tech cars
we've loved so far this year when CNET
on cars returns
the gt3 has always had a special place
in a lot of people's hearts where other
911s offer a great experience all round
the gt3 offers a more hardcore time
without being you know the actual race
car in the back there's no real sign of
any seats just a bigger roll cage it is
quite noisy in here which for some it
might be great for others it might great
by more from the ex car team of CNET UK
@c Netcom /
welcome back to CNN on cars i'm brian
coolie that point the show we take one
of your emails this week it comes in
from bob d who has a diesel versus gas
truck question he says hi there brian
i'm considering the ram diesel versus
the up-and-coming ford f-150 with the
2.7 EcoBoost and expected 10 speed
transmission i wonder about the price of
diesel long term as well as the up
charge for diesel engine versus the cost
of a turbo v6 well Bob there's a few
things I can look at here for you in a
few I don't know that only you can
answer first of all you got to take a
look at first the up charge for the
engine type it's about four thousand to
get an eco diesel in a ram it's about
eight hundred to get an EcoBoost v-six
in the Ford look at the fuel cost in
your area and you can do that very well
from the government's Energy Information
Administration website where they look
at gas and diesel prices and do a nice
job of showing them by region and by
trend and of course look at the
different fuel usage between the two
power plants the best way to do this is
to go to the EPA's fuel economy website
and look at the fine print where it
talks about gallons per hundred miles
that's the best factor to use it's a
lesser-known metric but that's the best
way to say how much fuel am I going to
eat up across a given amount of driving
now the unknowables for me are which
kind of torque do you prefer the kind
that comes from that Ram diesel or the
kind that comes from that turbo gas v6
and the four they they're both good
grunty motors but they get there
differently
what kind of towing capacity do you need
and will you have in the way you can
figure either one of those trucks with
your options and your bed and your
engine and all that and you've also got
a look of course at the total
bottom-line price because you're not
just gonna buy an engine and try and
earn that back with fuel savings you've
got to pay off the whole truck that's
the real-world calculation and the
unknowable for all of us right now is
what mpg boost will the Ford get when it
has the expected 10 speed automatic will
it catch up to ram go from 26 to 28 or
will it surpass it and get all the way
to that magic 30 on the highway hard to
say but it's also hard to imagine that a
10 speed transmission alone could make
that happen well it's that time of the
year we turn the corner into the summer
months and wall a lot of folks take a
vacation to a degree so does the car
industry new car introductions quiet
down quiet
the next couple of months which gives me
a chance to look back here our top five
highest rated CNET review cars of 2015
so far number five the 2015 audi s5
getting a CNET score of 8.3
the v8 engine is gone but we love the
2015's supercharged v6 and of course the
essential Quattro all-wheel drive on the
downside this car's infotainment rig was
a step or two behind other outies
no 4G no touchpad no really big LCD
track purists won't care otherwise you
should number four the 2015 BMW 740il DX
Drive in be number one on a list of most
vowels it gets a score of 8.3 BMW has
proved best that modern turbo Diesel's
can be tuned for sporty performance and
even this big car proves it that diesel
torque feels like it shaves about 1/3
off the cars perceived heft while the
cabin delights with I Drive 4.2 that has
connected nav and about the best hood in
the business number three the 2015 Audi
a3 Cabriolet 8.4 score also an editor's
choice that's right the lonely a3 ranks
a couple notches above that s5 it's a
great driver that doesn't just rely on
its convertible top to make friends and
the a3 was the first us Audi to bring us
integrated 4G which utterly transforms
Google Earth and Street View and live
search oddly enough no voice command you
would have figured a company this smart
would have found some other place to
mount the sealing microphone when the
ceiling went away
number two the 2014 BMW i3 gets a lofty
8.9 this one's gonna be a little
controversial especially since there
isn't an eighth after the letter i' it
has carbon fiber underpinnings though
and a dwell magazine like interior
combining with iDrive and those
interesting coach doors that make the i3
feel a lot bigger than it is it's a lot
more money than a Nissan Leaf for about
the same range but we got the range
extender option which Nissan doesn't
even
along with several other aspects of this
car before I get you to number one let's
take a look at dead last
our lowest rated car reviewed so far
this year it's the 2015 Chevy Trax mini
crossover a 6.3 not so much that it
failed at its mission its that its
mission is rather Spartan its LCD head
unit doesn't even offer factory
navigation there are almost no driver
safety assist mpg wasn't even quite that
good and that ugly black body cladding
all around screams this is all I could
afford but if that is the case you'll
move a surprising amount of people and
stuff for a little over 20 grand the
number one car we checked out so far
this year is the 2015 tesla model s p85d
an amazing 9.3 score and an editor's
choice adding a second motor to this car
gave the big battery model s insane
acceleration it says so right on the
dash more importantly it gave it all
wheel drive this is also the Tesla that
ushers in their big move toward autonomy
mostly via over-the-air software updates
it's a near-perfect car if you buy into
IDI religion at all the downsides
include a $120,000 price none up seen
that style and the fact that owning a
Model S today is becoming kind of like
owning a BMW in the 80s if you know what
I mean thanks for watching hope you
enjoyed this episode by the way quite a
few of you asked where can I find a
particular top five or car tech 101
those are all waiting for you at Z net
on cars comm along with our full
episodes so you can dive into each one
of those specific areas and find just
the topic you want if you haven't looked
there already check it out we've got a
lot waiting for you I'll see you next
time we check the tech
