us with a brand new batch of smartphones
but not all of them are worth your time
here are the ones getting the most
attention on CNET right now in no
particular order LG's latest flagship
ditch the modular design for a more
polished look it's got a 5.7 inch screen
with barely-there bezels and a
waterproof casing that will survive just
about any spill or even a quick dunk in
the pool you kept that dual lens camera
on the back with a wide-angle option and
now with even more bells and whistles to
take advantage of it sadly what you
won't find this year is that removable
battery that we loved from LG but at
least wireless charging is a good
consolation price it may not end up
being a best-seller but this throwback
phone is definitely causing a scene at
MWC the Nokia 3310 came back from its
17-year hiatus and brought snake along
with it it's got a rounder and slimmer
design and color display but aside from
that it's the same old brick phone you
know and loved terrible image quality 2
megapixel camera and web browsing at
snail speed the cost of traveling back
in time about $50 the BlackBerry key 1
maybe another phone banking on nostalgia
this year if you're still yearning for
the days of physical keyboards and bbm
messages this one's for you it's got the
perks of the pass
plus all the modern conveniences of the
present a 4.5 inch touch screen and
fingerprint scanner running the latest
version of Android and perhaps its
biggest draw the security software to
keep your information private Sony
unveiled its top-of-the-line XE premium
this year with a 4k HDR display super
slow-mo video and the most powerful
Snapdragon processor in the market right
now but it's mid-range sibling is
actually the one turning heads at least
on CNET the XA one and the XA one ultra
have an elegant design with a nearly
edge-to-edge display and USB C port but
the 720p resolution is a huge step down
no fingerprint scanner and it won't
withstand spills of any sort so if
you're looking for bang for your buck
Lenovo's new Moto G 5 and D 5 plus maybe
the better bet less than $250 will get
you a nice looking splash proof phone
with a fingerprint scanner 1080p display
and removable battery for
smaller version and the same 12
megapixel sensor as Samsung Galaxy s7
which we love us customers may have a
hard time getting their hands on the
smaller d5 because only the 5.2 inch
will be available stateside this one
wasn't even at the show but it's already
making its presence known samsung
announced the sequel to the s7 at their
keynote on sunday promising to create
innovation of a kind this industry
hasn't seen in a very long time cliche
aside this phone is already shaping up
to be the talk of the town in the first
half of 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
