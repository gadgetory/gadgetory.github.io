headline-grabbing hardware but its new
mobile payment service Apple pay may
ultimately have the most impact on our
daily lives every day between credit and
debit we spend 12 billion dollars you
can't see it but encased inside the
iphone 6 and 6 plus is a near-field
communications or NFC antenna and an NFC
chip the new feature along with the
passbook app which stores credit cards
turns Apple devices into mobile wallets
to ensure security Apple is
incorporating touch ID the fingerprint
authorization feature and tokenization
it's basically generating a new 16 digit
number in lieu of the actual number that
you have on your credit card so that
that way when that's the information
that gets transferred to a merchant the
expectation is that Apple will succeed
while other efforts like Google Wallet
and soft card haven't taken off NFC
technology just isn't being adopted by
consumers I mean it goes back to the
whole like merchants aren't accepting
those technologies then customers don't
have anywhere to go to use them but
Apple has an advantage its brand is
basically that you know our technology
works like they sit around their way
they kind of look at all this emerging
stuff and they pick out what actually
will work well for a consumer and that's
something merchants will pay attention
to they know that when Apple moves into
a space consumers will generally follow
Apple has a solid start partnering with
retailers like McDonald's and Macy's
plenty of places to swipe and shop in
San Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet com yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
