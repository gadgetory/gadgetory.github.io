hi Andy
love your work thank you but tell me
what gets you out of bed in the morning
well that's very easy to answer it's
giant sexy Jeff Goldblum made by now TV
to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
Jurassic Park giant Jeff is not only a
great monument to the film but a perfect
Amash to what it is to be sexy and
opener shooters it's 20 feet long took
about 250 hours to make and while I
thought it was inflatable at first I can
assure you that Jeff's abs are rock-hard
which I'm sure is true to life what's a
pretty sure the nipple proportions are
spot-on - but has my favorite thing
about this though is that real Jeff
didn't actually know this was being made
so I love the idea of him coming down to
London having a stroll along the bank of
the Thames and coming face to face with
his giant sexy self it does sound like
some very odd fanfiction in the making
you don't hear until this evening so
you'll have to get down to London's
Tower Bridge pretty quickly if you want
to bask in all its glory in the meantime
though simply just enjoy all these
gratuitous close-ups set to romantic
music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
