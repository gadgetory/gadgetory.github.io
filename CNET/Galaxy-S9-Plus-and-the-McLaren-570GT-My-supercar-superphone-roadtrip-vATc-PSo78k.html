super phones I had the chance to bring
the two together in one epic road trip
across Europe and God it was awesome
the journey would take me 1,500
kilometres through Switzerland Germany
and France before heading back to London
the car a 20-17
mclaren 570s uber car with kittler good
looks and a v8 engine that will propel
it from naught to 60 miles an hour in a
lightning fast 3.4 seconds my goal was
to see how well the new Samsung Galaxy S
9 plus could capture the exhilaration
and the exhaustion of a
once-in-a-lifetime trip could the phone
take the place of my trusty DSLR and
shoot a magazine style sports car photo
spread what follows is my attempt to do
just that
my trip started bright and early in
Geneva I picked up the car from the
heart of a city at 7:00 a.m. and after
getting out of town I quickly found a
lay-by to pull over and set up the phone
to help me film the trip on the s9 I
brought a compact Manfrotto tripod with
a smartphone clip the challenge however
was framing the shot properly while you
get a live view at the scene when you're
in photo mode as soon as you hit the
video record button that view zooms in
dramatically it makes it impossible to
accurately frame your video before you
start recording as a result all of my
video clips needed trimming at the
beginning to cut out the time I spent
reframing the shot as you can see then
I've got the camera sets up it's I
basically need to set it recording at
this lay by and then drive for a while
to find somewhere to to press stop which
means one probably very long video file
but also means I get to video me
videoing me which might be a bit better
the next problem occurred when I put my
foot to the floor to accelerate onto the
motorway the sheer force of that massive
v8 engine of the McLaren cause the
little tripod to immediately topple over
I had to keep driving for 20 minutes
until I could safely pull over and reset
the camera to avoid the same happening
again I move the phone to my full-size
Manfrotto tripod and by extending its
legs to wedge in the passenger footwell
in the passenger seat there was no room
for it to wobble over while driving from
there it was simply a case of settling
down into the car and enjoying the
journey taking the faster motorways
meant I was able to relish the thrill of
the car as I cut my way around multiple
stunning snow-capped mountains
eventually I pulled off the motorway and
started to climb higher into the Alps it
was here that the car really came into
its own gripping tightly as I rounded an
endless string of hairpin bends shooting
forwards like a bullet when I stamped on
the accelerator and the road straighten
that with the windows opened the roar of
that huge engine sounded amazing echoing
off the sheer rock faces
I kept a vague eye on the phone pulling
over every so often to restart
recordings are shooting at 1080p
resolution rather than 4k and with a
hundred and twenty eight gig of storage
on the phone I wasn't at all nervous
about running out of space I carried on
following the mountain road winding
higher and higher snowdrifts building up
alarmingly on both sides
although the 570 GT had all-weather
tires and traction control it didn't
stop the rear wheels sliding out on many
of the corners of the snow-covered Road
while power sliding around the
snow-covered bends was immense firm it
all came to an abrupt halt when I found
myself in advertently queuing for a
train so interestingly I have come up
the top of this mountain and found I can
go no further I have to get a train with
the car but this is a train that I think
goes through the mountain because the
pass over the top is closed because of
the snow problem I have is that I have
no idea where this train goes I wasn't
expecting to need to take it in the
person at the ticket booth wasn't clear
at all on where I actually end up
certainly for now it looks like I am
going on a train in the car and it will
take me somewhere
this train trip started poorly the
rickety old train was only marginally
wider than the car and as I was towards
the front of the queue I was on earth
first to drive on the cars parking
sensors were bleeping in terror as I
crawled down the carriages the rough
metal of the Train Barry is threatening
to gouge great lines in the expensive
paintwork of the McLaren every inch of
the way
but that unpleasantness was far from
over the other thing I didn't realize is
that the tunnel had no lighting
throughout
the good news is is that it's at least
completely pitch dark
so as nice
noha day where I'm going
I can't see anything without
- light up try to do some filming
yes nine hand
the night
nothing at all
that's as much light as there is as you
can see us not very much
I really think they could probably do
with a few lie to me so they get less
terrifying
after what felt like two hours it was
more realistically about 20 minutes I
was back in daylight and once the GPS
caught up I discovered I was at the Goff
&amp;amp; Dean station
I wasn't very fun if I'm honest speaking
through the center of the mountain in
all-consuming pitch darkness some
makings of a panic attack because
there's no way out I can't even open my
doors because I'm completely wedged in
it wasn't exactly on my roots but I
wasn't far off they didn't take long
before I was at my first overnight stop
in the Swiss town of miring in it seemed
a great place to do my first photo shoot
of the car and with about an hour of
useable daylight left I drove around to
find the best location that's no easy
task not only do I need to find a spot
that includes the beautiful mountains in
the background
but that location must also have a great
looking area in the foreground for the
car to sit as I was alone on the trip
there was no second driver who could
quickly move the car out of the way in
an emergency I eventually found a good
spot and over the next 20 minutes I
walked around the car looking for the
best compositions that really showed it
off in the dramatic beauty of its
surroundings I got down low for many
shots as this angle gives any car a
powerful menacing look which works
perfectly for a high-performance car
like the McLaren I shot an auto mode on
the s9 plus as it seems he believes the
best-looking results I was really
impressed of its ability to keep the
bright blue sky under control but still
give plenty of detail in the darker
areas of the scene even looking at the
images on the phone I was impressed
back at my hotel I wanted to shoot my
room this is great to give some behind
the scenes color on a trip like this
although the camera has a fairly wide
angle view it wasn't wide enough to
capture the whole room a neat trick
however is to use the panorama mode and
pan the phone around to capture the
scene from one side to the other I put
the phone back on my tripod in portrait
orientation this time providing a
perfectly level pivot point but let me
simply push the phone gently in a
semicircle to capture the shots day two
would take me from the Swiss mountains
through the German Black Forest and
onwards towards my next overnight stop
in France I had over 800 kilometres to
cover or about ten hours according to
Google Maps which didn't leave me much
time to stop and take photos so I was on
the lookout for any locations that
didn't require significant details of my
route I set the phone back up on the
larger tripod trying various filming
angles to capture the amazing scenery as
I cruised through as well as a straight
on view I tried sideways angles out of
the passenger window and using the
second zoom lens I filmed the wing
mirror getting a great view of the
mountains behind me as we steadily
disappeared out of sight many miles
later my eye was caught by a roadside
logging station I Neil had to pull up
for some shots here
the huge piles of immense tree trunks
laid flat provide a great opportunity
for an interesting counterpoint the
ultimate non off-road vehicle going
offroad the muted colors and subtle
sunlight look great even on the phone
screen again I made sure to walk around
moving the car into different angles and
even opening the doors to try and find
the best shop at one point I even
climbed high onto one of the stacks of
logs to try for an overhead view a few
tweaks and snap to you later
and I was really pleased at this series
of images my next stop then was the
Gerald Sauer waterfall I didn't
intentionally seek it out but I happen
to see a sign on a roadside and simply
had to take a look around Gasthaus butt
off
I parked up and started walking down the
trail and along the valley to my goal as
I walked further and further the light
started to noticeably drop and I became
concerned that I wouldn't be able to get
there and back in time I had no phone
signal so I couldn't check how far the
walk was or she was even worth trying to
make it I started jogging on the path to
try and get there faster and eventually
came to the waterfall in all honesty it
was disappointing not least because the
main viewing spot had been roped off for
safety reasons so I wasn't able to get
the proper photo I wanted so back we go
I suppose that was disappointing that's
just one of the trials of trying to do
landscape photography in an area that
you're completely unfamiliar with I did
at least find a smaller waterfall on my
way back where I was able to snag a neat
shot with the phone and crouched down
low balancing on a couple of rocks to
get the best angle for the phone
shooting in manual mode this time I was
able to use a slow shutter speed in
order to slightly blur the water which
really helps give a sense of motion fine
it wasn't the Gerald Tsai waterfall but
it was a cool alternative after my
disappointing hike I decided it was time
for some fun so I headed to the Autobahn
with no speed limits on many of
Germany's highways that's where a super
car like the 570 GT can really come
alive
the understand is kind of as fast as I
as I want to go in this
the first leg of my last day took me
through the Champagne region of France
where I made straight for a boulangerie
to buy some quiche and an apricot tart
mmm
well done random patisserie in France
it's just site tested in a pastry case
but it's good hmm yeah that'll keep me
going
bollocks to the music on my own
soundtrack I visited this area before so
I knew just how stunningly beautiful it
can be however I haven't visited in
March and the combination of dense black
clouds and the driving rain meant that
shooting conditions were terrible were
still arriving out of the summer season
when the lovely champagne houses I
passed were all closed I did hope to
find some sort of luxurious champagne
mansion to use as a background for the
car to provide a wonderful context for
the area the nearest I could find in the
pouring rain was just an outbuilding it
was perhaps better than nothing but it
wasn't the stunning Vista or grand
mansion I hope to capture in what turned
out to be my last photo location of the
trip after cutting my losses in
Champagne I cranked up the music and
headed directly for the Eurotunnel
stopping briefly at one of a larger wine
warehouses in Calais for a box of
Frances finest I boarded the Eurotunnel
train thankfully a much wider carriage
from the Swiss Mountain Train so no
fears of ruining besides of my car
propped on a podcaster keep me
entertained while the Train took me
under the English Channel and back to
England
there's no question of a trip had been a
hell of a lot of fun driving an insanely
fast McLaren supercar through the Swiss
Alps and across the continent is the
sort of dream trip I never imagined
getting to do but the photography wasn't
as easy as I'd hoped the galaxy s 9 plus
played its part extremely well its
photos look great with spot-on exposures
and white balance manual controls to
help me get more creative and the wide
aperture mode helped capture as much
light as possible when I was shooting in
shady locations the sheer power of the
processor meant that editing is Snapseed
every night was an absolute breeze the
video quality looked mostly excellent as
well despite the frustrations in framing
blind for the zoomed in view the bigger
problem for me was simply being alone
having to find a safe place to park the
car each time I wanted to shoot meant I
was extremely limited in the areas I
could actually take the photos I could
have got much more dynamic shots of
someone else with me and it would
certainly have given me a bit more
flexibility to stretch the phone skills
a bit it's definitely been a learning
curve but despite that the phone has
helped me take some badass shots of an
incredible machine in a stunning
location and really that's all I wanted
the sheep friends still here hello sheep
