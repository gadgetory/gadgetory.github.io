Guttenberg share the flat big round of
applause for Steve I'm glad you're
direct from Brooklyn back from Brooklyn
I'm glad you're here because you can you
can sort of help sort of break down my
Italian vacation I just returned from I
just want to ask a question I was in
Italy maybe ten years ago okay and as a
vegetarian I wasn't prepared for
something yes I go to restaurants and
I'd say there was nothing vegetarian
menu so I said can I just have like
pasta and sauce is that okay and they
would look at me like I was crazy like
there's no vegetarians in there no no
you cannot I said we can't pasta right
was almost like that scene in with Jack
Nicholson you know no you could do it
you'd have to really explain yourself
though really you know this is funny -
yes can I just have that no so Stevens I
thought they were joking at first when
they said no you said it's a restaurant
you make pasta you make sauce just give
me some of that
I'm sure you could get that if you need
it would be they would look at you funny
they were not a comedy speaking of
getting funny looks in Italy Stacey I
had a great meal chef risottos clams and
shrimp and all that stuff really really
good with a very light tomato sauce very
good sauce and she's looking at me and
she goes I kind of want to put Parmesan
cheese on this and I'm like I don't
think you should ask for that I don't
think she'd do that
well it's an insult it's an insult to
the chef I said hey it's like Americans
are stupid mad they're not stupid but
for the most part they add this to
food that is all it's all the ketchup
like ever you put steak in catch a like
you're you're pretty much considered a
psychopath in some circles nevertheless
she goes to me she's like please I'm
like I know it's it's fine the way it is
but I would really love some Parmesan
cheese
she waiter comes by she goes can I just
get some Hamza and he act and he first
one go he was like oh like that American
yeah any like the whole like oh my eyes
like Mike oh I'm weak in the knees he's
playing it up but like he grabbed his
chest that his heart was broken
uh-huh but grudgingly brought back a
thing of Parmesan cheese and he was lady
spittin and that yeah right and and he
basically even as he was giving it to
her still continues to plead with Trevor
you should be like you sure you know
what second chin second-guesses please
man she's like I know I'm sorry it's
just the way I like it like it better
with the Parmesan cheese so I had it
before and after okay it was better
before Oh
I mean like so maybe she stays it just
has a nice I don't think that's what it
is I think she just like yeah you know
sometimes you just wanna you just want
what you want that's fine
Oh Americans goddammit of course America
Italy specifically where I was in the
country was where were you
so I was may you're like the bluff no I
had like the buckle where's the bow on
the top of the shoe the groin yeah
like a like a puritanical buckle I was
the buckle so like yeah if this makes
sense
I was the buckle that's not where the
buckle is it's the tongue of the boot
yeah the tongue of the boot but high up
yeah high up I flew into need what is
that
call the shin so it is called the amount
oh how can you mouth because there was
this sort of thing it's a very famous
tourist destination flew into Naples and
then drove about an hour to Positano and
praiano and Ravello and Amalfi in all
these places they drive on the right
side they do okay yeah what they do yeah
yeah the UK's like the only place you
never do that and there you know they
got their own problems so this place is
amazing it is uh the these towns that I
wore that I was in are all towns built
into the cliffs of mountain yeah yeah I
saw the pictures it's amazing it makes
really no sense when you think about it
because it's completely impractical for
Modern Life but nevertheless served open
for modern they were and modern life has
been shoehorned into what exists there
right now and it's amazing there's very
thin roads you have a good Italian cake
it's amazing
Tariq's it needs to change you know
there's a lot of Italian a lot of narrow
roads where you have to like walk not
get hit by skin I don't know if you do
so I did that and it was bad yeah
where'd you can they go on the sidewalks
yeah yeah and not kids scooters
motorcycles it's legit everyone's gonna
like really small cars a lot of Mercedes
like smarter electric cars yeah some of
that but I saw mostly like
diesel-powered cars a lot of that a lot
of diesel you can sell it everywhere
right
oh well that's common in Europe yeah
yeah so I saw you know see it stayed
four nights opposed 2002 nights and
praiano amazing really just amazing
scenery the entire region there is a
geological sort of phenomenon right
you've got caves and cliffs and Grotto's
and
volcanic remnants and all these things
it's super special I really really
recommend it I know it's not a cheap
trip but if you do have the means and
it's something you know if you're
looking for a place to visit
I really endorse the Amalfi Coast not to
mention holy the food yeah we don't
think I could eat that food now you do
okay really have just like a lot of ham
like a lot of meat but the dairy is the
problem right I put butter but don't
know here's the thing so this is what I
learned where I was staying in the
southern portion of Italy is more about
the fish and the oil up north is the
father in the south this is the cheesy
there's cheese but up north is like the
chicken parmesan because there was no
chicken parm I was in for eight days and
it didn't have frickin chicken parm yeah
I almost lost it yeah and realize like
what was happening to my last night
Naples where the cab drivers like yeah
dude you wanna you want chicken parm you
gotta go north don't talk like that but
like exchange programs but you wanna
hear something amazing he goes he's like
where you from were like oh we're from
right outside of New York City because
oh I have a family from Hoboken New
Jersey that's what I get and then you
know what it made sense like Hoboken is
for people who aren't in this area Hogan
is basically like oh it's I mean they
idolized Frank Sinatra yeah it is a very
Italian American yeah I saw he was from
yeah it's the it's the it's the
birthplace of baseball as well all right
I'll have you know yeah nah no hockey
do not compromise nope that's just where
the whole famous really that feel that's
there that's not where they feel the
dream no but at the corner of 11th
Street and Washington and Hoboken is a
baseball diamond and that's the first
one that legend has it I don't I don't
buy it I don't buy that for a second
yeah so there there's my trip law and a
little notice I saw amazing stuff it's
some good people there too good culture
that good culture there okay a very
European it's not you know
how many giant whale shirts oh my god
with like the giant horse on it is that
why there's a lot of like Fred Perry
there's a lot of yeah a lot of like pop
collars oh my god
it's like everywhere is Miami the pop
collar thing in Europe yeah they don't
so here's I'm still trying to analyze
the phenomenon of the pop collar they
you don't see it as like a fashion
statement okay I think they see it as
like I don't my neck to get burned oh
maybe this is but there's also writing
there like there's also like the brand
takes the time to stitch their name
there as well and also kind of imagine
that they're not quite as prone to
sunburn it way no more of it Dada yeah
it's out there a doc a peep I don't know
darker yeah so I don't know but that's
yeah well you have any more questions
about Italia I mean it was it was really
it was really something special
yeah I've been to Italy where were you
there I was 10 years ago I was there I
went to well I started in in Venice okay
yeah and then I yeah that place is
sinking Wow it's been singing for a
while and then I went to Florence and
then I went to Rome hear the weirdest
thing about being in Rome is I've grown
up in New York City but Rome was too big
a city for me that's how I couldn't hear
I couldn't handle it actually it drove
me crazy
you'll never go back it's crazy I didn't
know that it's so hectic yeah yeah and
that thing that you know they don't they
don't believe in like traffic lights and
yeah that can't and they're driving like
crazy perfect pattern there is so why he
wants to do it though I wanted to drive
but I did I get so you didn't drive it
all now
okay so that's it would be fine like if
I was driving because like when I was a
nice one there's no one on the roads
yeah just like cuz sure no one lives
there no one lives there but like the
second I got to a rat like if I were to
get to a roundabout in Italy and it was
just like oh yeah Austin like everyone's
just going there coming in different
directions oh wait in Tokyo they're
crazy drivers too no no Tokyo is very or
I was saying Iceland it's very quiet I
was saying about Tokyo is that it's such
crazy it's like the density of men
but like it just goes off in every
direction for ten miles doesn't say it's
crazy that's cool I gotta get there yeah
I got I gotta be beamed over there yeah
we'll get you all over so you know you
went to to Italy I had a great time but
I went to Bushwick Brooklyn yesterday oh
really and I had a great time I really
really did I went to had you not been
there I'm amazing
except dapped own records
okay this soul R&amp;amp;B label that's been
there since 2001 okay and it is beyond
funky and all old-school like old-school
really really olds clear they have a
recording studio there they have a
recording studio it's all analog there's
no digital equipment at all in the
studio
it's an 8-track machine there's no like
dumping it to Pro Tools and fixing
mistakes or anything they record live
bands no edits on many of the tracks on
adapt own record and it's just so basic
and gritty and authentic and really
inspire so you're walking through this
place and you're just losing your mind I
was because you know I had expectations
but it was better
they've been around 2001 oh yeah so they
started with Sharon Jones was their
first artist because as she says in one
of her songs because she was trying to
get you know deals with other labels and
she was too fat too short too ugly and
too black
so she didn't have the right look but
she had the right voice yeah but that
didn't count
yeah so she go on the voice tone and
then she's like the DAP tone ya star
so but Amy Winehouse recorded a lot of
her rehab record there yeah
and that made you sort of brought them
to prominence was when Amy recorded yeah
it's funny when you brought up the depth
because it wasn't her backup and called
the dap-kings
those adapt Kings I just watched that
documentary right
and I was just sort of scrubbing through
it in my mind if they hadn't mentioned
DAP tone records and I don't maybe they
did man have I cried what a story it's
um it's it's very unfortunate but she's
out there she's making a new record
right now but as we speak oh we talking
about anyone else no I'm sorry sir
oh yeah yeah well like so it's
interesting cuz the documentary like
almost raised the question like if she
wasn't so effed up with that record of
coming right I'm one that's the argument
on all like genius like a lot of these
genius artists that are amazing
comedians or what-have-you
like you know there's a reason why
they're able to do that and part of that
reason is the broken part of them that
like needs that juice to perform or can
you be a great artist and be happy and
well bad I think Tom Hanks I think is
that like I think he's a very good actor
he's not an artist though way sure you
know come on come on you don't think
he's a extraordinarily talented actor I
don't
okay what about a good actor he's a he's
always Tom Hanks but he's always the
nice guy who does the right shirt but
he's extremely likable
he is like an that is not something
everyone has a tedster I think the part
of him in shorts now if you're a great
artist there needs to be a part of you
that puts a lot of like way more
priority on your art than you do on the
rest of your life which in turn makes
you kind of miserable right but also
makes the art better right and again
it's not mutually exclusive but I would
say a lot of times why it's so common is
because of that is prioritizing the art
over their human right you know I'm not
a big guy Jerry Seinfeld fan but he said
thing like you know when he was starting
after all these other guys behind there
playing clubs and he just said and the
entropy says well why did you make him
he says because I wanted it more hmm
yeah I just would not take no I kept
trying even when I was being rejected
yes that's the other thing about being
an artist is you're not instantly
discovered no matter who you are right
so you get rejected for you know years
yeah sometimes very you need at the time
it needs to be right your tiger
right it's not just fodder you're gonna
always make oh yeah you need to kill
yourself over it you do so what did you
like what did you hope to get out of
there what did you want to be I was
there to write it that write a blog okay
and I went with Nathan from last.fm who
shot video of the Nathan great guy yeah
yeah so and the engineer Wayne Gordon
was there and to show me around and tell
stories about the label and the way they
make records and it's an aesthetic
that's the thing that's so interesting
about it they record live to a track so
there's no digital equipment at all in
the studio right the band plays live in
the studio with vocals and then they
play a complete song and when they pick
one that's good they say okay we're done
we're going to the next you know fixing
it in the mix so you're saying they just
like sit around and they like decide
which song is the one to take well they
just well they get multiple takes of the
song just do it and they did it's not to
say they would never overdub anything
but the basic thing is they're not
assembling music from bits and pieces of
stuff that was required it's not all
tracks it's not all it's not like over
400 tracks on Pro Tools and we'll take
like right first syllable this word from
Tuesday and lunch and six months ago
from yes it's just like the halt the
real deal that's cool man yes and you
know it's interesting that they record
analog not for an audio files like all
we think analog sounds good that's not
it at all
the reason they call they record analog
is for the discipline of analog oh you
mean it's uh it forces the artist to
constitute relation yeah to light should
not be like oh we'll just fix that in
polite that kind of yeah just got you
and they said you know if they have a
guy come in to do a part that doesn't
usually record there unless it's a
guitar player right so you do your
guitar solo so I think the guy plays the
guitar solo and then the engineer I'll
say so you think you can do it better
and then yeah let me give it a try
but understand that when you do it
better we're gonna record over the one
you just did Wow
and then they'll say you can't save it
no there's no saving in this technology
so yes is it is a track tape take that
stay stay stay so there's a big two-inch
tape okay so
rewinding the tape right it's back to
that white essentially right they don't
have to do that I mean is it they have
to do that no they can can they can make
more than one recording yeah why not
they don't have to record over yes they
have to record hey there's no room no
other place it could go where we're with
the whole second guitar solo co winger
I'd say the guitar so this is 16 seconds
long I hear what you're saying I hear no
I don't understand I heard you say Sol
Sol Sol the guitar solo starts at 2
minutes in just to make it easy right it
ends at 2 minutes and 16 sure so they go
back to where the guitar solo starts he
plays erasing the previous so they are
recording the separate tracks they're
not recording all instruments at the
same time oh they always are but let's
say there was a part what we're gonna
over target are part they understand I
just say they have heard it so for
overdubs that's how they're doing that's
oh you're right a lot a lot of pressure
a lot of discipline thank you so you
really have to like carry over like
there's so much they are on the track
that you come here it's buried but it's
just so I think that's it just it makes
musicians play a certain way it's not
it's not the right way to record for it
the average music all right right but
they just recorded now they do a lot of
soul and RB R&amp;amp;B records but they
recorded a rock band called the mystery
lights which is actually why I got
interested in visiting them because I
thought that's kind of weird cuz you
don't usually do rock bands yeah so the
produce the engineer / producer of Wayne
Gordon says why so the spin I really
liked them I took the owner label to see
him he liked them he said yeah let's
sign him and then he tells him like this
is how we make records right ok with
this nail like yeah no problem sure and
they were so into it and they said you
played it in the club you can play it in
you played all the time yeah but it was
just you know so it's a very different
and and the band records like I mean
their music sounds like 1968 sure ok
psychedelic rock music gosh essentially
they're things so it fits perfect it
fits perfect yeah and it was just it was
really exciting and even told me like
you know they're just like oh so I'm in
the vocal booth which they don't always
use like for this cut for this
man for the mystery lights the the
singer jumps around so sit so how do you
like this guy and he said I just had to
give him a hand mic and he just fell
right yeah that make sense but they do
have a vocal booth for some of the
vocalists who need it and I said when I
when I'm in the booth I said this boot
sounds really familiar like I don't want
to offend your talents as a recording
engineer but I hear the vocal booth on
your records yeah that's okay that's
part of the sound of this room sounds
like huh all right the one you're
currently in right now this room it's I
don't know cuz everyone's so loud it's
not that way something is and this is
something that's gonna be on scene it
it's gonna be unseen that beautiful yeah
so it's capped own records alright
everyone keep keep an eye out for that
we will will spam everyone with the okay
link when it goes up good ah Palmer
Luckey keep Steve know who that is
yeah you don't know that if you were
Palmer no have you heard this so Palmer
Luckey
is the 20-something year old yeah
mid-20s who invented oculus rift do you
know what that oh yes
I was then bought by Facebook for one
two billion two billion dollars yeah
yeah well that's where it ends nice were
the cool stuff ends so he walks away
with two billion dollars and then and
there's a bad part yeah well yeah look
so so you know oculus rift has had an
interesting sort of rollercoaster ride
on its way to retail so Palmer's no
longer involved no yes this is really
not about the headset not about VR The
Daily Beast just put out a report that
fingers Palmer Luckey as a financial
backer for nimble America an
organization that promotes Trump in the
forthcoming presidential election
through online and real-world
advertising and viral posts nimble
America front page nimble America's
front page features a story about
rapists operating in criminal gangs
the Mexico border echoing some of trumps
most controversial claims Thanks they're
shitpost their ships organizations it's
kind of a garbage news organization I
feel very weird this is a crazy story so
well I'm just because I heard about it
yesterday and I'm just still kind of
wrapping my head around my feelings
about it
now well we uh you know yeah made it
pretty clear that like I don't
politically aligned myself with that
stuff it's not yeah sure of course we're
you getting I guess what I'm getting at
is I don't begrudge him his right to
spend money and stupid play no more
stupid he's allowed to me whatever the
hell he wants and he is also technically
allowed to do those things in private
and not have that highlighted yeah but
now that it has been highlighted it
makes me I will 100% feel icky the next
time I wear a helmet
ie headset and maybe that's stupid so
like sort of attach that sort of
political ethos to of technology device
yeah because obviously like you know all
technology companies have their weird
like a potentially a moral or a but when
you heard that Woody Allen was having
sex with right what did you stop
watching what he saw that sort that's a
good comparison actually I mean I did
not watch it I did watch men head into
the first time by the way the other
night and and it was it's great it's
great and genius and also super super
weird and creepy
yeah well it's because you know what
happens next but when movie came out we
didn't know that okay okay
anyway I did really it was with the live
organ and it's so gonna banach play the
music oh wow you did that yeah that's
cool Wow what do you like better
Manhattan or any hell yeah I like
anything all better cuz any hole doesn't
make me feel good I think people say
cafe societies real good that's heard I
can't imagine that's good
okay which one I know you don't like the
Owen Wilson one was okay I didn't think
I hated that one who was the last one
that I liked was the one in Christina no
no the more recent one there was a good
one with he's not in it what he's not in
it match point no recent one person with
what's his name Phoenix burger Phoenix
no River Phoenix like he's a he's a
philosophy professor and he has a
quandary what to do the right thing ya
know it's really good it's not like two
or three years old already so many
movies anyway brief segue sorry um no
it's okay
yes I just feel very weird about the
situate you know what I you know what
I'm trying to like just like a weird
like mental quandary it's that feeling
that you can't quite put a word to you
know I've already see people on Twitter
game journalists being like eff this guy
like got it like a slimy and shitty as
it is you can't say that like you can't
judge his products now because you're a
scumbag Trump's yeah if you feel I'm
sorry not a scumbag he is a scumbag sort
of like subterfuge
oh whatever I mean if you feel like if
his political dealings or like political
leanings make you feel like you like him
less or whatever you 100% cannot cover
his stuff it exactly so that's the
everybody's personal choice but
Volkswagen what was that
that's German here hitler's car right at
the people's car yeah books wagon VW
so that means that like Jews should
never buy Fox wagons on paper
I guess they shouldn't buy so where does
it end
right I mean that's like we're yeah it's
a thing it's not him and obviously there
are thousands upon thousands of people
that work for iOS as a company so here
but the thing here though the thing that
I find most intriguing is like the
oddness of this story like this is very
odd
and I find that entertaining yeah it's
interesting because it's rare like I'm
not gonna gain the whole are like a
pretty tame medium unless like outside
stuff like gamer gay and stuff like that
comes up right but like from a news
perspective like you don't see the like
controversy or like this CEO did
something really weird like it'll be
it's pretty tame so when this stuff
happens it's just very interesting
because it really is like yeah oh wow
people they have weird things yeah and
if you're 20-something years old and you
got two billion dollars that there's a
lot of weird things happening in your I
would familiar probably I would though
if I was an early backer of oculus I'd
probably be a little bit pissed right
now because they are my money a lot of
wait yeah a fraction of it yeah a lot of
deaths there were a lot of people on
Twitter also vocalizing like oh you know
awesome this is great I helped but you
can't apologize man efest oh right you
can't vote fully vet anyone you right my
tortoise there's no if you're gonna give
money to someone whether it's Apple
whether it's Samsung whether it's palm
or walkie your oculus whatever you will
not there's gonna be someone along the
chain that does something that you do
not like yeah yeah you're heroes right I
mean of course you know all about thing
you could find that guy oh no now I
don't like him it I think the Woody
Allen things are really a good example
yeah actually I think a lot of his stuff
is also a lot of he-said he-said
she-said sorry um whereas like there's a
smoking gun he but he did but you can
say he did yes he marry his married
which is not cool which is not the best
it's not awesome not it's it's it
happened it's not great right we're not
happy about it so and you can make that
choice of once that came out you could
make the choice unless you and some
people probably make that choice so you
know and I'm sure moving forward a lot
of people will be like if there's an
oculus to or whatever will say I don't
want to support this guy right well you
don't have short memories and stuff like
they do they're not gonna but luckily
the vibe is better so
all right here is what we got next man
it's so weird that this happened I can't
get like when I saw this story I was
just like what yeah is happening people
photoshopping the Time magazine the dumb
Time magazine cover like how many told
like regardless of who this person is
he's only 24 uh-huh which sort of makes
made it almost make more sense to be
honest but cuz you just have like mother
you know that relate you know that guy
that's like fresh out of college with
like you know angry young man situation
and he like you know I mean there are
people the same people that honestly
like originator I mean that's honestly
almost an akin to it which is the saying
like I would have changed the world and
Nader's the only way you can do it and
guess what the result of that was was
eight years of hey I was one of those
people I wasn't so yeah and look wow
that's a good point but you know what I
mean it's like these people that want to
change the world end and sometimes
they're a little like yeah and if
they're very rich they will put those
sometimes misguided thoughts dollars
into a place that well and it's more
visible and what's more public and
there's all these people talking to them
you know like if you if you know if
you're a rock musician right and
suddenly your name and your and you're
23 years old and just people say sign
this contract how would you know how
would you know how to sign a contract
who you should trust a personal manager
how would you fight another personal
manager that you could trust you would
you don't need someone that you already
trust like that is a great question like
what does your move right like you if
your move is really probably trusting
some one person first yeah right but
that one person if you know them already
and and and suddenly have two billion
dollars they're not equipped to that
person that you're trusting is equipped
to make Cartesians about what we should
be doing that that's something like no
one ever talks about and it's really an
interesting sort of thing like if you
become super fit like tomorrow something
you do you're super famous tomorrow you
got movie deals you've got booked you're
ready to go right like what do you do
how do you say you know you essentially
won the lottery right you do you call up
the one person you know who are like
maybe knows another reassignment that's
I mean that's the angle is like you
who's the most famous person you know
that's been in the situation right and
you talk to them and you and and they
maybe will say well this is what I
screwed up someone came to me and
offered xy9 I wish I knew this right I
wish on you and that's all you can do
like you're not gonna have a huge can
you read a contract when you're my age
or 20 I think someone's offering you 20
million dollars you hire a lawyer
of course like don't be an idiot of
course okay that wouldn't be part of
your yeah it's more kind it's more
complicated than a contractor sure who
is booking you who's handling your
business who's handling your investments
who gets really screwed up in a lot of
people right that's correct I did a
story about a guy who sells super
expensive hi-fi like a hundred thousand
two hundred thousand million dollar
heist and he mentioned some very very
famous nurses our version of hi-fi
absolutely is it worth it yes to the
people who buy them I guess it's all
relative so but the thing that he told
me was that when you're like at the
super famous when you're the billionaire
arrange that the people who work for you
the nannies they have their people yeah
you know you're there your people have
like a hierarchy it's like a corporation
right so like when that person is gonna
fly from New York to Chicago to do a
thing these all there's like 50 people
that go with them and they have their
people who were making the arrangements
for the hotels and there's like only one
guy is doing anything for himself right
yeah but it's like because he said so
when someone buys a million dollar hi-fi
did they come personally and he says no
he has a guy who does he's the High Line
that guy has other people who like his
assistants like his assistants for the
assistant or the assist its entourage
right who's your sister in life so
you've got your ring I know you don't
wear one no but Russ forgets it
constantly yeah I would say if you're on
your way percent success rate care or
she doesn't know she no I tell her
whenever I forget but you know she's
fought like weirdly I've mentioned this
before I think no one in her family the
men wear rings I guess like Spears why
did I take it off before I sleep so do I
I can't sleep with it it distracts me to
hear Sam's so here's why it's your dear
ones here's why it's ridiculous cuz
you're wearing a wristwatch so all you
do is what I do it's not though because
no it is cuz you take that all no but
for the last 15 years I've gone watch
wallet phone keys here's where it goes
now we add another one know when you
take off your wise you put the white put
the ring inside the watch like inside
the where the watch is sitting yeah and
you never will forget it ever it work
for you huh I've been doing it for six
years now twice I forgot my thank you
for the part time and that's because I
was going someplace more yeah single guy
on the prowl
alright let's talk about something
relevant to tech this is a great idea
you had you wrote up a story about the
new iPhone 7 yes
no well I wrote about you know are we
gonna miss the headphones right so this
was this like a dagger in your heart cuz
it was it was sort of to me it was sort
of because there's been decades and
decades and decades of incidence
millions and millions and millions of
people who bought Bose headphones with
wires and by the way Beats headphones
the company that had long wire yes right
so see all you can get this little
dongle thing but does the dongle thing
sound any good that's right so the so
you compare think so you compared the
sound coming out of the headphone jack
on an iPhone 6's verizon pair back and
forth that was super smart would you
find I found with a good headphone I
didn't have a Bose but I'm like what are
we talking about like a be like a be
yeah $200 a head front like a B&amp;amp;W yeah
there was a slight difference that the
the headphone jack sounded better than
the lightness described what are we
talking about yeah I was listening to a
string quartet okay cuz if you play
really nasty rock and roll you can't
tell so listen straight and I was like
focusing on the this the the string
players breaths yeah you can hear them
breathing right so I couldn't hear them
breathing so much where they're like if
you listen can't you are they lying
anyway I could hear their breaths Wow
and and just more of that like room that
they were using the exact same
headphones but you were using this
dongle now the question is is it the
dongle that's losing fidelity or if you
were directly connected to like if you
had had fought headphones that had a
lightning Jack connector would that be
better I guess I don't even know if that
exists apart from the ones that come in
the box yeah you know it will be I mean
there are some high-end headphones a
company called Odyssey makes headphones
with lightning connector I've been
making him for two years
did you know they actually didn't try
that because that doesn't apply to this
what is this this is that the purpose of
writing the story is if you own a nice
pair of wired headphones yes should you
think twice before you buy it yes guys
that's the point
totally so I think if you're a careful
listener if you listen to things that
have that kind of quality today
recording it's a slight difference what
I'd call it 5% of and and you're
obviously very highly attuned to that so
yeah most people you would say probably
wouldn't notice most people I would say
the man it sounds like the vast majority
of right one but I think there is a
question though about the dongle itself
okay where's the question it's it's not
very well made it is gonna fall apart
oh it is and I would it comes $9.00 it
comes me it comes with the iPhone right
I mean I had a buy one since I didn't
plan gotcha so I bought one and I don't
think it's gonna last
I think plugging like the headphone into
the things kind of weird although people
pointed out after the fact well I
wouldn't be plugging the headphone into
the dongle I'd plug the headphone in and
then just plug in the light yeah right
but so the other question I guess I have
is so you were testing on a 6s which
makes sense right but the question is is
there anything that they did to the
seven that would potentially make the
audio on the seven man yeah I'm gonna
find out next week cuz I'm gonna use
Joey's iPhone 7 and do it again it's the
same thing I think there's no like delay
nothing that's like seeing at the
plug-in it's a boy why would have to
sync it actually does because it no
because the the dango is a digital
converter
so it isn't instant mm-hmm it's I don't
know
yeah second is I'm saying it's like a
little had it plugs right
ane was a tiny handshake that happens
it's like two babies shaken yeah so I
mean I just think why though why why did
Apple have to do then to make it thinner
it doesn't everybody put cases on their
phones yes right so yeah I was reading
one story about what they said they
actually put in there right was I had
the barrack chamber no I don't know I
don't know so I mean their official
reasoning for it carries well they've
encouraged innovation so they've said
they put in another speaker where the
headphone jack is okay great
okay and so shitty speakers and second
ones and then they put in I mean there
are you know who knows at least it was
waterproof now that they couldn't be
waterproof with but no that's that can't
be true because there are Samsung
devices that have had four headphone
jacks that are okay so that can't be
true but the I mean the argument is like
well it's more space for batteries or
whatever which I mean strengthen the
flipside of that is like obviously they
own beats and and the markup on
Bluetooth is pretty significant you
actually make a lot more money selling
Bluetooth headphones and you do wired
because you can charge a pretty
significant markup for a relatively
cheap component inside right so from a
money-making standpoint it makes a lot
of sense I also sort of think it's more
about not this generation but next
year's phone which I guess potentially
the design of next year's phone might
not even allow for the thickness of a
headphone jack theoretically so that's
all really thin I mean that would be
crazy thin you're right 100% but I'm
show me this one's gonna be thinner than
an eighth of an inch I mean it would
need to be a little bit while obviously
to allow for it like you the hole needs
some edging yeah after work so I mean
who knows we might design the iPhone
eight another than a credit card it'll
fall right like they've run out of risks
I mean I think the camera stuff is kind
of
the camera stuff like that is cool I
know myself included like it's a tough
transition to make and and it's you
getting it no I'm not planning on it
you know I've messed around with one in
the office and stuff like that but you
know I might it'll be interesting next
year
I own an iPhone really just like one but
i but like I loved the Nexus 6p so much
yeah I know I know you've been gone for
a while but there's actually a new phone
you might want to look at is the note 7
it's supposed to be really good yeah for
exploding pants
do you know what the phone that's
exploded oh yeah yeah yeah honey what do
you think about that what is it like
when you were 12 years old and you were
playing we're in Brooklyn growing up so
we were like oh man in 50 years we're
gonna have part we're gonna devices in
our pockets that explode for no good
reason
yeah I wasn't thinking about that but I
was thinking about what do you think
that you your generation your generation
yeah that you were up with before
smartphones yes you make long enough to
remember what life was like so I grew up
you walk around thinking I I'm missing
out on so much I'm walking down the
street and I don't know what what email
I got just now no did you wanna sit when
I turned like 12 and I got on the
internet the second there was an
Internet I was like okay my see where
what was your handle I don't know
something like with a punk rock band
like rancid kid 15 something like that
yeah I think like I think once I knew
that there was an Internet I was like oh
this'll get faster do you know what I
don't know I don't know what my vision
of the future was like based off Back to
the Future I was like oh we'll have
flying cars double fives and we'll have
light
and we'll have like things like that
right and fax machine is clearly the the
future of communication right and and
how does that ethical to be with you
like is that what you sort of imagined
when you were 12
space travel and spying senses like that
kind of stuff you know yeah see that's
what's so weird is that kids now do not
have a future
they don't say in a hundred years and
we're gonna get to do this it's Mars but
how does a kid like hey I'm gonna go to
the moon and we're gonna do this I don't
the kids are they don't have a future
where they live in so you think like
that
we gotta find on't think about a future
I don't know about they know they have
order in the future they think I might
get an MBA or something they don't think
like technology or gonna get to do these
things that we can't do now what could
why don't do well here all say that we
can't they want to do why do you sound
so confident in knowing what the hell
twelve year olds of 2016 are thinking
about is your source like I need to ask
I know a 12 year old I'll get back to me
I'm really curious they think of the few
spaces a cousin of your old cousin I'm
gonna be like hey yeah what do you think
is gonna happen in 30 years yeah I
just don't you be able to do when you
grow up that you can't do that's the
question right what do you get that you
can't there there actually is a very
good podcast and I'm totally blanking on
the name of it but I would recommend it
it's hosted by Sidney McElroy and it's
basically her and her sister so she is
30 mid-30s and her sisters actually 15
oh and they each week talk about
like what is the situation and like this
different so I would recommend it just
search city map you see you see the
thing about the about kids especially
but even people right they don't they
don't when they think of the future they
just think of better versions of what we
have man the internet right there was no
what is that like TV for everybody it's
like people didn't say oh I wish there
was this thing well it's a bigger TV
right a bigger TV more cable channel
four channels right they is from
of what they already had not something
they didn't have yes right so the thing
that they didn't have that they sort of
had fantasies about when I was a kid was
space travel and flying things and more
energy and landing on the moon you
weren't an old man when that no no that
was extremely excited I so did not open
up the possibility and your mind like oh
maybe we'll live on the moon sit one in
in my lifetime or go to go to the moon
you but no but I'm saying when they
landed on the moon
you were you're a teenager right yeah I
was I was 19 yeah so so yeah I mean no
was a big deal right and by the way I
was on the beach in Rockaway right this
is how I celebrated it right I was on
the beach and I was looking at the moon
yeah I was with my girl like you see
them in and there's like people yeah
it's really weird
that's like you guys don't have the
experience that you can look at a thing
in the sky and say there are human
beings well I do that with planes people
in this flying steel bird that's weird
you know what I thought I really well
you I'm curious what the 12-year olds
will say yeah I I don't know lead the
conversation yes bring that back yeah I
would love to do that I'm just sorry
maybe I should record it of the future
yeah what would he go this this this
present that I'm living in with zombies
walking around the streets of New York
City looking into their phones dancing
it's just they don't walk in a straight
line they just kind of weave back and
forth okay I'm an old guy they're
slowing me down it's like get out of my
way anytime your old guy they're slowing
me down literally they are and its
really annoying then you get to a corner
you waiting for the light to change in
there yeah it was so here's the dude why
do people walk around holding their
Pokemon not when they're actually using
them they just hold I do that why do
they do that I do that because I want
change for the next five I know
now I do it because me I do it because
I'm vaping out of my father no I do it
because I want to be able to change the
next track oh no but I'd say when you're
not even using it no yeah if I'm using
it if I'm not using it it's not my
Pokemon only works when it's out it
doesn't work if it's in your pocket
that's actually all right I mean maybe
the future will working so I think a lot
of the people if you've seen it more
recently we're poor just like holding
their phones honestly I think a lot of
them probably are not looking at it no
they don't need to look at it they're
just but in the future to work in their
pocket yeah in the far-off future but
Steve I agree with you I think if
there's Wallace there is something not
right about the current state of
detachment right that's certain now it's
not just young people it's POS every
well it's all people um I noticed is
when I'm walking Dylan in his stroller
and people who all are who are also
wheeling their kids around you know
looking at their phone not paying
attention to the driving and the kids
like and now I see this when people walk
their gigantic freaking dogs right dogs
that like could easily drag them a city
block yeah and they're just like
lackadaisically just like you know
liking on Instagram yeah I have a
great problem with people interrupting
the normal flow of human traffic and yes
that's that what my frustration and I
think like because they're in their own
little world right i and some people are
courteous I I make a very self-aware
effort to do this if I am gonna look at
my phone
yeah actually sure yeah there's like a
Larry David like number of feet okay
Liam to like keep it open and do you say
when they don't say anything you say
you're welcome
no thank you
and it's so obnoxious that is such a
dick move right now come on sometimes
make a big deal about the fact that they
just donated to charity that's exactly
the you know what I do a lot
what I do a lot is the people the
zombies like you've refer to them when
they cut me off or do something really
stupid
uh-huh I'll vocally be like okay okay
we're doing this now I guess you know
something like that and they still been
on here because there still is though I
was I was on the subway I think I was
going to the airport so I had my rolling
luggage with me it was pretty heavy so I
was getting out of subway I was walking
up some stairs and a woman halfway up
the stairs of the subway all right I've
got the luggage with right and I like to
stop abruptly oh and I and I say like I
didn't even say anything I was just like
a long like huh all right one of those
and she turns around she's like what
well I was like this is not the place to
stop man yeah that's what you say she's
like uh and kept going
they have no response to that not so
whoo that is the biggest power movie
line you think she is I'm not just all
that happens all the time
I if I if people just stop in the middle
it sucks so if you run them over with
your body yeah are you held liable is it
your fault because I know if you if you
you know crash into someone's rear
bumper it's your fault that's true
that's fair it is your fault yeah it's
insane and and I know I've brought this
up again put the why did I do that to me
who ran into me yeah like a car owning a
car oh yeah and he walked into me and
said well excuse me I said you you
walked into me did you super play all
right before we go before we go we got
to talk about the $1,800 elephant in the
room yeah we're looking at a pair of
headphones that Steve brought in and
they're $1,800 you make it sound like
that's a lot of money it's a lot of
freaking money man do you know to be the
top 5% in terms of headphone price
that's gotta be like Heights up there
right nice work spent I guess we got to
do like
a listening test right like can we do
right now I don't think we really know
you can report back and I'll report back
I'm gonna play with these let's just
write but let me tell it people the
people what they are yeah what are this
so this is kind of funny that this is a
headphone company and the name of the
company is mr. speaker they're not worth
that price tag very I I admit the name
it's like not what they might as well be
called sound guys the guy who starts who
owns a company and signs everything he
used to be a speaker design it was a
freelancer so his heart was called mr.
speakers and then he sort of dabbled in
headphones for a while okay and didn't
want to like change the name and then
the headphones were doing really well
and he was doing less and less speakers
but by that point II thought it was too
late that you need a rebrand yeah I
agree
anyway this headphone is called the
ether flow see or actually ether see
flow okay see for it's a closed back
headphone gotcha and these are real
carbon fiber earpieces yeah they're
super lightweight - very lightweight
yeah really really comfortable and the
technology and the headphone is called a
planner magnetic driver so most
headphones have like a little tiny
speaker driver inside yeah essentially a
cone inside there yeah and this has a
flat piece of plastic that's coated with
conductors and then it's between two
sets of magnets so that basically the
voice coil is distributed over this
piece of plastic okay and then the
magnets are you know in a potent
opposition to that thing and then the
signal goes in and it's either attracted
to one set of mags or the other huh so
it's it's what is that bigger than like
if you had a big speaker in your house
firing directly into your ear there's no
room but but if the internals is it
essentially the same idea it's there are
there are speakers that are made with
that same technology I've just called
planar magnetic got it these are - I
feel like I shouldn't have these you
should you don't they're too good for me
I'm just joking around okay
no we the reason that Dan Clark would
design these headphones wanted you to
hear him he
because you said me specifically well
you're the games guy oh yeah
for the games he did actually yeah cuz
he said that I sent you a link to some
PC I mean some game yeah thing that said
these are amazing sounding headphones
that's why this all came up I mean could
be so what both like what about them is
good for gaming
you don't know cuz I'll try and what
gaming like a lot of the thing
incredible detail and incredible like
bass definition and power and dynamics
like when you if you want to I'm not
into advising people to play things
really loud but if you play these really
loud they just having well critical
power and for gaming and the other
important thing is is a surround sound
surround sound but they're very open
they're they're open they're stereo
speakers they're not getting this yeah
so I tried some speakers have like like
three tweeters in the well they're three
drivers yeah yeah perspective if you're
like a professional gamer they use those
all the time because you can identify
people behind you right yeah so for
these the only way to really add
accurately test them with gaming is
you'd have to use like a hundred out
like the PlayStation headphones for like
a hundred fifty bucks and then compare
those to that or I mean I'm planning on
just hooking these up up to the
DualShock for headphone jack no you
can't do that what else is that the
wireless oh you're right
yeah it's wire how do we said there was
a there was a controller though yeah
it's in the controller which wire's
versus although the new controllers are
wired they mate how about I just take
the headphone out for my receiver yeah
that's okay well oh yeah why why can't I
do that you really want you saying you
want it directly connected I want him to
use this headphone amplifier yeah I can
this oh this piece of it seems
like yeah well you got a there's a
reason why I don't do scuba-diving
I like the concept of scoob's not too
much work yes it's very the year
you and I are gonna look at this when
we're done okay um and but I'll report
back we'll figure it out I'll get it
done maybe there's no game that has like
a there's plenty of high-end game games
that have analog outputs what the
console console does no does not the
HDMI or optical audio and and even new
PlayStation 4 remove the optical audio
so it's like the HDMI going into the
receiver and then you're on your own
from there would it work without the
gaudium like it with no I could get one
that could do that but I did alright
we'll talk about it we'll figure this
way well capture they anyway anyway kids
it's mister speakers the model is ether
C flow and you have to refund the
discount code 18 bucks five dollars of
free shipping
handcrafted I better be California they
do happen to be beautiful beautiful
they're comfortable and they send I'll
check him out anything else before we go
well so when I was a kid the headphone
that really started everything was
called the sennheiser HD 440 those the
weird ones that still exist then people
still wear them know those are costs are
the cost uh yeah so anyway this dis
headphone you know and I've been
thinking about it lately like I wonder
if it's as good as I remembered it cuz
like I had mine like the mid 70s or
something so I just looked around that
eBay and was like not hard to find yeah
so I wound up buying a pair that was
from 1970 yeah and I get it the other
day and open the box I was like this
could be a really big disappointment or
they don't know isn't CEO it wasn't sale
but it was in really good condition the
guy had all the original package that's
really rare anyway so I pop them on my
hand I was like these things still sound
really really good that's great yeah
phenomenal if this guy owned them for 46
years so it's that thing that that drum
that I like to beat here if you buy
really good stuff you can laugh buy them
for life right and when it comes with a
wire that plugs into a hole yeah
and they still make those holes so
you're saying screw Apple yeah yeah yeah
get rid of my apps with the jack I mean
I'm with you man I get it
I understand you know your feeling about
this i I was upset when they got rid of
CDs for a minute it still didn't but
Saturday both CDs so dude how many CDs
were sold the United States in 2014
entwine that's the days here I have
numbers in 2014 there were 40 million
CDs I think way less I think and you're
right how many 40 40 a hundred and forty
million I'll send you the link do as a
cd-player
40 million five hundred and forty I was
off by a hundred million you know
Pinkerton just went platinum it isn't
like the other week you hereby vesti it
took them 20 years platinum they are the
Woody Allen's of the music industry
though they come out with a new record
every year yeah um did you heard about
that right Steve the Weezer album
Pinkerton oh no
just one fun go listen to it on 20 years
I'm Kyle huh so but anyway because I was
going to review this CD player right and
rather say don't yeah the you know the
name of the CD player you know the
blonde apply CD player I thought well
that's not a good headline cuz no one
will read it right this the show makes
sense a hundred and forty million CDs
and I'm telling you it's down I'm sure
if I turn that into a candy store like
there's no yeah I seen a CD in a store
in people aren't buying books right I
mean they are but they're not Barnes and
Nobles going out of business there's
only like 11 of them left east ebook
sales are down like 21% won't this year
yeah but what was that because I ebooks
are down it just and everything is that
I think that's just because there's a
lot of all-you-can-eat okay and also
like there's a lot of other
entertainments yeah well old people buy
them right but they're not gonna be
around forever they're round now so
they're around
great people still updating the hardware
like in a CD player that's the beauty of
it you could have a 1982 the year the
CDs came out it will play in any CD
player
there's no updates required there's no
like thinking spinning me like you
lating know you put it in hit play and
if the CD is not broken right and the CD
player works it will play 100% like you
put that in those thinking scanning
ejecting there's a lot of complications
update your firmware it's like the LP
you could have an original LP from 1948
plays perfect I get it you're not
there's nothing wrong point is lost like
your point is not relevant no you're not
relevant yes you're not here in this
story that 140 million were sold you may
not buy one you may not buy one but
maybe somebody's buying a more lucky
whoever whoever's buying them I don't
know who they are right yeah literally
don't know they are do you see yes all
right
oh really buy them all the time wouldn't
work why that why did you on Amazon you
ready
are you listening you got headphones I'm
honestly curious wait wait there's no
way to get a digital version of the same
song it's not as good if not better this
is not possible ACK no Flags not is no
way it would be but here's the thing I
want to concede I want to support the
artists yeah sure Otis oh my god I see
in live that's how you get by to Reno
website digital there's this band that
the tie tournament to LCD soundsystem
which you're getting back together yeah
but before they got back together in 11
years they made three album yes because
people didn't buy them so when people
don't buy them why are they all make as
many but in a successful band they have
other ways of making and then they get
old and then the guitar player drops
dead of an overdose and then they can't
tour anymore groans the minute matter
The Rolling Stones well the Beatles Paul
McCartney's still making money from
Sergeant Pepper those checks keep
rolling in right so after your two older
feeble or your band breaks up the
recorded legacy keeps making
you money not only if you're a mega
superstar like the Beatles no no no not
if only if you're that because you could
have had one hit in 1972 and that will
it's in a movie and the cash registers
really rising so yes so saying the guy
who wrote red rubber ball is still
living on the Red Robin
yes he's called Paul is Paul Paul Simon
he's still making oh that's right so I
knew that I don't know why I knew that
weird well like there's weird stuff like
that like Bruce Springsteen wrote that
Boston song more than a feeling really
something like that Ronny he wrote um
that Manfred Mann song yes yeah I know I
can't think what the hell that's correct
yeah he wrote that and that's what I
meant
oh no I said well we're not gonna settle
this right no we're not oh yeah I mean I
don't think we're in disagreement about
anything like I throw you are you don't
believe that people buy CDs clearly you
can't argue with the numbers I think
that number is tanking well yes but a
long way to go you know how many LPS all
people keep writing about the LP is back
turn people they were in that same year
9.5 million
LPS oh but eighteen times where CDs were
sold and you don't see articles in
newspapers saying this CDs are selling
really well right because because you go
to the Best Buy and you see if they turn
that they buy them on the integers on I
get it i buy them it was this amazing
story new york city other music on
fourths yeah yeah yeah and I used to buy
CDs there all the time I miss it and you
know why but them there because hey I
wanted to support the store and be
because you'd go there to define cool
bright stuff
I'm as their purpose that I miss going
to generation records yeah that store
right yeah I miss going there was on
Bleeker I think yeah I miss going there
and like seeing what was new like what
the people who worked there we're
listening to like I called Spotify
discovery No
it's called vintage vinyl in New Jersey
it's still around but I'd only get to go
there maybe once every other year or so
I understand I I long for that aesthetic
I'm still part of that but at the end of
the day like I'm not breaking my balls
when I can get a flack album do you mean
like flak still saying if you can't
touch it is it real well that's that's a
debate for what he's alone that's a
debate for another time mr. Guttenberg

machines yeah so there's this composer
Mack Rick Max Richter okay and he made a
whole CD or album for download called
