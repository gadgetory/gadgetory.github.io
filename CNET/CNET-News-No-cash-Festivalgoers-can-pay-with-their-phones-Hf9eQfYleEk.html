multiple stages at San Francisco's
three-day outside lands music festival
you don't want to miss a beat but at
some point you do need to eat some
festival goers skip the 8am lines and
never worried about digging out cash or
losing their wallets instead they use
their smartphones to pay you to bring
any cash no I never carry cash there
been times where you know I forgot to my
wallet and I still have my phone or I
don't have any cash with me I'm still
able to get whatever I want to get
without any hassle payment service
PayPal has been testing its mobile
payment app at music festivals we're
using this as an opportunity to
experiment because there's so much need
for technology to make people's festival
going easier you're here to see the
music you don't hear to deal with the
hassles once you download the paypal app
and Link a credit card and picture you
choose a nearby participating merchant
and check in confirm the order with the
cashier and get an email receipt your
financial information is never shared so
there's nothing that's that can be
hacked that goes over that goes over the
airwaves it's it's your username that's
it fifteen percent of the concession
stands accepted paypal some even
offering coupons as a vendor you know we
do most about transactions in cash
especially at a festival so it is a nice
convenience for me I don't really have
to carry thousands and thousands of
dollars in loose change around because
there's no real safe place to put that
at the festival but widespread adoption
of mobile wallets is still a ways away
Nate Pollack who owns the American
grilled cheese kitchen says they'll sell
up to 7,000 sandwiches at the festival
but only about two percent of the sales
will be through PayPal PayPal is a nice
convenience for those that want to
preserve the greens and not a stop at an
ATM every few minutes but I think it's
mostly gonna be cash here despite mobile
providers bringing in additional cell
towers connectivity can be inconsistent
that's obviously one of the one of the
biggest problems when you have a
congregation of so many people in one
vicinity we do the best we can to
mitigate that problem unfortunately we
can't make the entire vessel casos right
now due to due to connectivity other
tech companies are banking on mobile
wallets google wallet has expanded to
hundreds of thousands of stores
nationwide Verizon AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile are
backing a
all its service Amazon's wallet is
pre-installed in its new fire phone and
Apple is rumored to be developing a
mobile wallet well cash is still an
option and you can pay with your phone
festival organizers are hoping that soon
you can just pay with the wristbands
truly freeing up your hands to enjoy the
music in San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi
