introduction of a Ark it Apple changed
gaming forever what we're about to show
you is one of the world's first
competitive multiplayer games designed
to be played entirely in augmented
reality this is the machines in the game
players battle their friends in real
time either online or around the table
in the same room my friend and
co-founder Andrea is preparing a match
for us where we play the rebels against
the dominators what's really cool is
with a arcade the metal two on the new
iPhone we are able to experience games
in an entirely new way these players are
able to view the game from any angle our
content has to be incredibly detailed
with the power of the new iPhone an
unreal support for metal - we are able
to render the entire level on screen and
amazing 1.2 million polygons while also
allowing you to move in close to really
appreciate the high visual fidelity and
just look at those 4k textures it's
gorgeous
now shall we go into the game AR allows
us to use our position in the real world
to gain a tactical advantage just look
how antha is moving towards this cave
lining up his targets this is something
that would have been hard to do with
tension soon
it's like you're not just controlling
the game you're in the game another
awesome addition to the experience is
spatial audio if you go close to the
action the sound increases
and if a solid object gets between you
and the action the sound is occluded
perfectly now with the stereo speakers
on the new iPhone this is truly amazing
it looks like we're getting hit pretty
hard
yes deploy seals protect our heroes now
let's rain fire on our enemies move
closer to their base and get ready for
the fatal blow with our super weapon
oh the dropship is there you take it out
to the same time
what you just saw is an amazing
evolution in how games are played and
experience thanks to the combination of
air kit and metal - on the brand new
iPhone we can't wait for you to play it
look for the machines on the App Store
this month exclusively on iOS thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
