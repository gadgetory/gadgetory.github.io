fingerprint paying with paypal Samsung
has released its newest smartphone the
galaxy s5 trying to outsmart competitors
like the iphone 5s with new and
different features like using your
fingerprint to pay with paypal you can
now login to your paypal app you know
with your fingerprint but more
importantly you can go to millions of
mobile merchants across the world and
actually pay with your fingerprint so no
stumbling with your phone number and
typing a pin no stumbling with your pic
your email and your password you really
just hit pay with paypal you swipe your
finger print the s5 has a 16 megapixel
camera a snapdragon quad core processor
and a 5.1 inch display but it's not just
upping the ante on smartphones Samsung
is also putting pressure on Apple to
come out with a much rumored iWatch
Samsung is now selling two new smart
watches that sync with the new phone
there's tremendous amount that you can
do so with those you can get
notifications and really all the
communication that happens on your phone

screen on your wrist but Apple may not
bite and samsung may have to worry about
another tech giant google samsung is
going to face a lot of competition with
android where the operating system that
google just announced for smartwatches
even musician will.i.am says he's
created a standalone SmartWatch that's
replaced his smartphone mine's doesn't
need a phone if this is the phone but
