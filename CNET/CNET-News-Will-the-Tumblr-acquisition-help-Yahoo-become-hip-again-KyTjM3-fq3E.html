sumedh us and joining me is Dan Farber
he's an editor for Cena damn thanks for
being with us my pleasure so yahoo has
gone shopping they've bought tumblr for
the cool price of 1.1 billion dollars
why did Yahoo decide to make this
purchase well it's actually a good fit
for both yahoo is a company that's you
know seeking to revive its brand it's
older it was a pioneer on the web but
has since fallen on harder times marissa
meyer has come in as CEO over the last
year she's bought ten little companies
and mostly for engineering talent but
now she's actually buying eyeballs which
is to say tumblr has about 300 million
visitors per month 24 billion minutes
are spent on that site every month and
it has about 108 million blogs add that
all up it's a lot of content it's a lot
of users and most importantly it's a lot
of young people who are very mobile
clearly this has to be valuable in
meijer is because otherwise why would
you pay 1.1 billion dollars in a mostly
cash deal from what I understand well
it's it's it's valuable over the long
term potentially and it's kind of more
along the lines of what Meyer who is at
Google what Google has done with with
YouTube which now generates about 4
billion dollars in revenue so over time
they hope to scale it up and go from you
know a hundred million blogs to a
billion blogs or whatever it might be
but most importantly they need to
monetize it right now as of last year
the tumblr did about thirteen million
dollars they say they're going to do
closer to a hundred million this year
but it's still a kind of drop in the
bucket for a company that does five six
billion dollars there's been a promise
from meijer that they're not going to
quote unquote screw it up because there
are some very avid and ardent tumblr
users out there still we've heard
reports of people defecting over the
weekend to tumblr competitors basically
what is the sort of reassurance going to
get them the promise of not screwing it
up I mean do you think in reality that
the service will remain unchanged for
the short term
they've made a promise Myers made a
promise to David Karp who is the founder
and CEO of tumblr which which is a six
year old company compared to Yahoo's 18
years that they will leave them alone
they will be run independently that
Yahoo will help out on on
personalization and infrastructure and
monetization but they're free to
continue to do what they've been doing
over these last several years over time
you you would expect that there would be
much more integration the thing that
wasn't mentioned and this was rather
curious is that tumblr is a social
network right it has followers and and
people follow each other there was no
mention of that there were no numbers
about that it could be that they just
don't want any comparisons to Facebook
or Twitter but it may be over time that
tumblr provides a backbone for face
before for Yahoo to have its own social
network so that is one of the ways that
it could be integrated into yahoo
services in overtime well it will
primarily be integrated through search
when you search on yahoo weather on the
web or yahoo site search you'll see
tumblr results as well as through
personalization for example if you are
searching on something on fashion well
Yahoo's not really great on fashion
content tumblr is so they would be able
to understand your profile and if you're
interested in fashion bring up some
tumblr results when you're searching on
yahoo or in your personal news feed the
changes that tumblr users can expect to
see you know you said that over the
short term there probably wouldn't be
any but there's a major one that
probably a lot of users are concerned
about and that's advertising what do we
know about how advertising may play a
bigger role on tumblr because of this
acquisition well it's I think it's very
important for yahoo to to make some
money from a safe position but they have
to do without alienating the tumblr
users tumblr has already been involved
in what's called native advertising
which is advertisements that look like a
blog on tumblr but they say they're
sponsored and they're in the new
flow of what people are reading I think
that Yahoo is going to continue that and
accelerate it and perhaps to other kinds
of brand advertising and display
advertising but as Meyer likes to say
they're going to do it in a tasteful way
all right well she's a tasteful woman at
least in her appearance so hopefully
that's true dan farber thank you so much
for inside scoop im sue me does thanks
