last time I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update it's time to say
farewell to the music software Winamp
because in one month on December 20th
the software will no longer be available
to download from Winamp calm when amp
was extremely popular for playing mp3s
and digital music in the late 90s and
early 2000s AOL bought Winamp for 80
million dollars in 1999 but over time
software like iTunes just overshadowed
it the program still had a following
there's even an Android app that has
been downloaded more than 10 million
times but regardless of how many people
liked using it
AOL is pulling the plug the software
will still work after December 20th but
now is your last chance to download a
copy
Windows Phone users tend to be the last
to get popular apps but finally some big
names are hitting the windows App Store
including the traffic app Waze and the
photo sharing app Instagram vine also
arrived last week which shares very
short video clips Instagram has its own
video sharing feature but it's not yet
on the windows app so not only did
Windows users have to wait a few years
for Instagram it doesn't have all the
features yet it's still in beta other
popular apps that are coming to the
Windows Phone include the money managing
tool mint the news magazine app
Flipboard and the game Temple Run 2
Pinterest has a brand new tool instead
of just collecting links and images on a
pin board you can now tag it to a place
on a map to help you plan a trip and
highlight interesting spots these place
pins make it easy to make a to-do list
for weekend activities or travel and
pinterest partnered with services like
OpenTable Trulia and booking.com
to automatically include bits of info on
each location but it seems they may have
some first-day bugs to fix because I had
trouble getting this to work Microsoft
added new features to its SkyDrive cloud
storage app for iPads and iPhones
users can automatically backup their
photos that are taken on the iPhone to
SkyDrive this can already be done on
Windows but now iPhones get the perk as
well if
someone on your holiday shopping list
hates Google then Microsoft has just the
gift for them the Microsoft Store is now
selling anti Google gear as part of its
latest push of the screw gold campaign
stressing that Google is watching you
all the time and collecting data on you
there are coffee mugs shirts hats and
hoodies but I think you must really have
to hate Google to pay Microsoft 25 bucks
for that hoodie and of course let's just
ignore the fact that Microsoft behaves
very similar to Google and also looks at
user data to make money that's your tech
news update but you can get more details
on the show blog cnet.com slash and
