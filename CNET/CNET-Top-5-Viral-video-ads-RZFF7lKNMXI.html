considered a victory if you don't skip
their commercial they positively wet
themselves if you go out of your way to
watch one I'm Bryan Cooley with the top
five viral video ads video as you've
gone out of your way to watch millions
of times based on YouTube views and
ranking by Business Insider get ready
for the best time you'll waste all day
number five the t-mobile dance spot
about thirty four million views flash
mobs are usually associated with some
stupid pillow fight or something but
this one is an evolving dance review on
the main floor of the Liverpool train
station it reveals itself and grows in
waves until only about three people
aren't in on it and they're pretty damn
sure it's a cover for an al Qaeda attack
but they're still having a good time and
then it's over right on cue
number four is stunt cyclist at Danny
McCaskill's 2009 commercial for inspired
bicycles about 40 million views filmed
around embro Scotland it elevates the
stuff you normally swear at teens for
doing into two-wheeled ballet I mean I'm
pretty good on a bike but there's no way
I could ever try this stuff much to the
relief of my urologist
number three is the newest one on our
list it's VW's the force commercial the
one that ran in the last Superbowl and
has run again some 42 million times on
YouTube it's a great one because you
don't really have any idea where it's
going until it gets there and it's got
that John Williams score that I don't
even want to know how much VW paid to
use
number two is the perfect blend of three
simple questions number one what's cute
baby number two what's hip rapping and
number three what makes anything funny
get on rollerskates is your formula
welcome to the screwiest way ever to
sell fussy french water avions done some
fifty four million streams of this okay
our number one viral video ad should
need no introduction hello it's hetero
in its wording homoerotic and it's
casting yep
The Old Spice guy just the two main
variants of this spot have added up to
over fifty six million streams and
Counting that's about the population of
Italy the guy who is indeed on a horse
is Isaiah Mustafa summers college and
NFL ballplayer most assuredly is not
your man ladies I love these spots he
and Fabio do the mano a mano in El ba√±o
thing then I click out what's in your
head back at me I have it it's an oyster
with two tickets to that thing you love
look again the tickets are now diamonds
anything is possible when your man
smells like old spice and not a lady I'm
on a horse for more top fives like this
