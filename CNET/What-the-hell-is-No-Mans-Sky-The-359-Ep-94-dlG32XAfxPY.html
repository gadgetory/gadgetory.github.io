but you you remember when it was first
announced oh oh you don't okay cuz it
made a very significant splash it was
that an e3 that was uh so was announced
a little before in III but in 2014 they
did a demo or 15 min it may have been
that I saw and I forgot about it like
just never registered idea it the whole
high concept they never registered with
me sure I never really cared I me I
think the name popped up every once in a
while I'd see it right that what is that

32 welcome to the 359 we talk about the
top tech news of the day and all the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Rubin and with us a special
guest Jeff Bakalar hello I don't well me
free beta yes yes so we're gonna be
devoting the entire show to talking
about one topic and that's no man's sky
all right orna manski is nothing calling
well what for one thing what is no man
say we were just talking about this I
wasn't really sure what that was it's a
pretty high crazy concept that it's it's
flown around video game is a video made
by company called hello games from the
UK it is uh ps4 and PC game independent
if you want to label it like that uh hi
concept is that it was this it was
pitched as this sort of open universe
sort of procedurally generated game
which means the game can calculate
things on the fly to give you a very
complex number of possibilities while
you're exploring different planets space
travel game and the numbers are it's
like it's
the 14 Quinn I think the the numbers
like eating four trillion if that is a
thing there's thing i don't like about
that number of planets fittingly in bed
correct uh so the game until II an 18.4
quintillion which is just mind-blowing
um so yeah that that's the high-concept
the game came out this week and for a
lot of people the game sort of wound up
being a little different than what
people were expecting that doesn't mean
it was bad it just wasn't maybe the sort
of hyped up unbelievably uh do anything
explore anything and this is the last
game I'll ever play sort of thing well
it works what were people expecting to
do people are expecting that sort of
thing where it's like this game is
strictly exploration and I'm never going
to need to do anything else because I
can lose my life inside this universe
that the game people want creates they
do want in one like I said they want to
use HTC vive and you know oculus and
leave them with a little more narrow
it's a little more narrow what this game
boils down to being and I'm not saying
it's good a bit but what it boils down
to is it is a crafting survival resource
management game with space-travel sort
of peppered in a lot of minecraft yeah
well it's it's got slices of bags of
mine shades in Minecraft I think um you
know a lot of this a lot of scheme you
spend in the menus a lot of it is like
moving junk around in your inventory
crafting stuff there's a few headaches
involved in that sort of nitrous mchale
asleep I know this sounds it's not
boring okay so it's not boring you start
this game off and there are moments of
brilliance where the second you leave a
planet you can't because there's very
little loading involved yeah it is a
remarkable thing planets are the size of
planets you get to you know the
atmosphere it is mind blowing every
planet I've seen is different the
animals on the planets are different
because they're all sort of decided by
math they all ran will generate oh
they're not selling this gives a random
it's not random because there is sort of
a method to the madness meaning game
does follow an algorithm a sort of set
language that it picks and chooses
thousands of animal elements and crafts
them into a sort of presentable thing so
you're not getting these like totally
ridiculous looking AB
tars they are resembling animals the way
we understand animals to be so think
about like 50,000 animal assets in the
game sort of thing like re well its got
rhinoceros feet a chicken head and a
horse you know body my mind just blew
yeah that's what's cool it is cool so
the planets are varied some of them are
cavernous some of them are deserts some
of them constantly raining acid uh it
varying temperatures it's really cool
stuff some of them are water planets but
it's not it's not as immersive as people
expect what but it's not you know once
you see 30 planets you sort of get the
idea of like you know very for me you
know and that's the thing everyone's
gameplay experience is different right
so you see a lot of different stuff to
that the idea though and heard like if
you name a plan you discover planets
someone else can go and find the planner
that is so true so it is true I actually
five by the plan so apparently 1822
people did try and be on the same planet
at the same time which when you really
do the math how is that even possible
that somebody would find a planet that
someone else so sort of multiplayer
source single player I wouldn't call it
multiplayer all right all right well we
got a lot to pack y know more about this
well one room word about this game yes
check us out on scene at checkout has
Jeff's room his hands on I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp; I'm Jeff Bakalar
thanks for listening whew man four
minutes goes by quick I know ya RAB
though yeah does it have to talk about
yeah we didn't even get result get to
the question is it fun yeah I know like
us I come ask those born it sounded
boring yeah yeah this game is can be fun
so you go work at yeah it's like every
marriage yeah the first thing two to
three hours are short of spectacular
inexpensive like you're leaving your
you're fixing your ship you're you're
adding components to it and then you
finally take off by the way I was just
talking to our whatever intern Jacob
yeah and he said he was playing the game
yesterday and he was stuck on the planet
for two hours he never asked first one
you never got to be an intern so he is
it intern maybe he's got a like fizz
around said the drones kept killing him
and kept dying of comparison to death
that doesn't make he might not just know
how to play video games that could be
it like I don't know like I and there
nothing by this game it doesn't hold
your hand really at all right it sort of
just says like pay get off the planet
you're like all right wait does it
actually Sega like everybody tell you
there there's sort of objectives that
are in the lower right-hand corner of
the screen and it'll say like fix your
thruster yeah they're like all right you
got a ship you use it you find out that
you have to harvest elements to get
enough carbon so that you can repair
your thruster well then you gotta fuel
the thruster and that requires plutonium
so you go out in the world and you find
plutonium and you mind everything with
this laser gun that you have okay and
you shoot these like crystallize growths
out of the ground and they sort of just
suck into your face and that becomes the
things you can catch a series of
never-ending fetch quests it's a lot of
that it's a lot of harvesting um you
know would you either way is super
popular thanks to moody's but I also
think like the delicate balance of it
sounds like it could get repetitive
really quickly for sure like there
there's a delicate balance and I'm not
sure this game has the satisfying
balance that I think I that most modern
games tend to sort of have um and again
like this game is so much bigger than I
guess it was ever maybe meant to be the
game had such an unnatural response in a
positive way that it just it got away
from them it got away from the people
making it got away from Sony I don't
think anybody anticipated the audience
reaction that this game did have its
this and it's this coming to xbox at all
no it's coming sorry you see later this
what is it don't worry I'm not going
well it's comin tomorrow oh yeah all
right so look out for sobriety's Ryan do
we have any question I see some songs we
really don't rather than comment that's
fine we have it haha I see a lot of
laughter that's good we are funny I know
BOTS you got it alright well hello bot
well good night Bob John YouTube yes but
um all right i mean like i guess we
could wrap it up another sniffing last
questions about the game yeah do you
have anything else cuz i'm happy i guess
just bottom line is it is it fun yes or
no i'm gonna say yes for me it's open
I don't think it's for everybody I think
a lot of people who maybe only heard
about this game casually yeah on a
surface level will it be expecting one
thing pop it in loaded up and be like
what the f is going on right now there's
no story there's no hand-holding there's
no real narrative right there is a bit
of a sort of story all you kind of know
is that you have to get to the center of
the galaxy the center or is it the
universe center of the universe there's
like a big glowing orb in the distance
when you finally technically impossible
yeah but for the purposes of this
fictional video game okay okay with that
um and we also don't get attacked by
drones they say you're able to warp in
between star systems yeah they sort of
say hey the path to the center is if you
hop along these star systems oh so you
sort of follow that rat okay uh what
school is like you know you'll be flying
through space and you'll see a planet in
the distance it'll be like hey at this
speed it'll take you six hours to get
there but then you engage your pulse
beat up engine and it's like oh now
it'll take four minutes and then if you
go even faster you'll get there in 30
seconds so that kind of stuff is cool
but that's all things that need to be
fueled you're constantly keeping aware
of all these things rafting is upgrading
a lot of plates at the same time and
this is what I want to know yes this um
does this kind of provide some sort of
blueprint for more games like this this
is a kind of a trend that we may be
going in where it's high-concept huge
universe types of games I don't think
you'll get that on a mainstream level
this is an indie game yeah this is an in
a game it's a very small team that that
made this game but I think the notion of
procedural generation is like
mind-blowing when you really give
especially with these new updated
consoles coming out you're giving a lot
of power to the developers and the
people who are able to harness that and
use it in creative ways we'll really
start to blow people away but this is
like a great it's not the first time
anyone's done something like this but
it's a great first effort in the sort of
planetary you know building giving give
me an if I like so if I like playing the
sims and minecraft is this
my alley um maybe yeah maybe you're not
building things in mind in no man's sky
the way you are in Minecraft reporter
spores is really the only way to
describe the sort of animal generation
stuff that's going on there sure are
about halo good topic if your get a
laugh and you're probably not gonna like
no man sky affair only like Halo games
exclusively you're not gonna like no man
ski the only the only relatable part is
that you're in a spacesuit in both thumb
that's it I can you know and you'll
fight robots every now there you go
they're drones in Halo sort of Thor yeah
kind of yeah Guilty Spark that's right
oh you are a halo guy yeah you know it
oh yeah all right let's uh let's wrap
things up okay let's wrap things up for
the week alright alright been a good
week down I know if you liked anything
