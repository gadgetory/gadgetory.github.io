the mobile world congress news that
matters on this week's episode of it is
februari 29th leap day here what every
caught year leap year I am Justin
Eckhouse that is Jay Mark V V this is
Emperor Stephen Beecham good morning
everyone your highness uh welcome how's
it going good are you asking me yes I'm
asking our special guest nobody yes all
most of our team is busy doing this
little thing called Mobile World
Congress there in Spain so are we yeah
yeah yes and we'll pretend ah si si um
let's talk about what's happened in the
Spain since at least at least we could
read about it and see what our
colleagues had to say there's a lot of
interesting news there's tons of
hardware and we'll get to some of the
more interesting stuff but Google had a
lot to say the first thing that Andy
Rubin talked about was tablets and
Android tablets and how they are
doubling down on tablets to win that
market because obviously they are not
winning right now according to him they
have activated 12 million android-based
tablets so far that is sort of since the
beginning of time compared to apple who
in the fourth quarter last year sold 15
million oh the beginning of the time I
like that and they have sold about 40
million iPads overall so cool is behind
but he says that 2012 is going to be the
year that we double down and make sure
we're winning um I I mean can they do it
I want to I want to make sure did he say
that in 2011
they think they would win that 2011
would be the year that they would double
down and make sure I don't know I mean
he certainly they talked a lot about hey
we came out with honeycomb and honeycomb
is a tablet-optimized operating system
and now we have ice cream sandwich and
that unifies them right I 2011 was just
kind of laying the groundwork I think so
and you know Google so they expand on
this a bunch o the andy rubin should
have over all laid out we're going to
double down on that and then the vice
president of engineering hiroshi lock up
heimer sorry second one sorry i have to
cough maybe you can say it yeah anyway
well it's called hiroshi yes he said you
know he did an interview with pcmag and
they sort of said hey what can change
your position and he said look phones
took a while to to ramp up we launched
those in 2008 and now they're sort of
dominant and we think that tablets are
going to sort of have similar trajectory
and that they're going to continue to
invest in content so they have a video
rental store to try and spur tablet
usage they have a bookstore they're
going to continue to invest in content
to try and make a difference yeah I mean
they don't have control of features the
way you know that other company does as
far as hardware goes so yeah they're
definitely going to have to ramp up
their store and their offerings to the
people's maybe get some awesome apps in
their awesome apps yeah I mean so he
they did talk about apps they went
through a lot of different areas that
Google the Google ecosystem for tablet
has challenges with like it's hard to
find tablet based apps and he said are
you going to do something to address
that that was for the question and the
response was it's a challenge of course
how do you define what a nap the tablet
app is versus sort of a phone app and he
kind of takes the tack that there's not
a whole lot of difference that because
the way into it is architected that
they're the same thing I think that's
not quite a
great answer I think in consumers Minds
there's difference and there's clearly
differences in apps that are optimized
for tablets that are laid out that have
the graphics to support that and those
those that don't and I would love to see
the Android App Store take a similar
approach to what Apple is done and
separate them out and really call out
ones that are optimized and will give
you a much better user experience than
ones that won't right so I mean Hiroshi
if you're asking a user yeah that's what
we we'd like to see it's not I mean I
like you said i don't i'm not satisfied
with the answer that it is a challenge
and that's just something that that is
better now that the environment has ice
cream sandwich and things like that i
like what you said that with apple
things are separated a little better
tablets iphone apps you know you know
what you're looking for yeah and i think
i'm constantly on the track i'm not
looking for the apple ecosystem model
with google but i am looking for google
to be more aggressive in creating an
easier to use ecosystem easier to use
market back minimum specs i mean these
are common themes that I certainly bring
up that I think will benefit consumers I
think they Google underestimates how
confusing it is and multiple levels from
buying a phone to getting into the
market for consumer and yes it promotes
choice but there's just so much
confusion that how are they
differentiated now like app tablet apps
versus phone apps for Android how do
they have that different differentiation
in there it's a great question I haven't
spent a whole lot of time to be honest
in the app storage because it on tablets
in in the android market because I
frankly find the experience easier on an
iPad and I end up using iPad more often
as my tablet then yeah my android tablet
yeah I mean I know I know when you go in
the market there is at least an editor
curated section that's right you know
featured apps for tablets and things
like that but I'm not sure how good of a
job they do as far as promoting you know
some of the best tablet
south there right the users yeah I'd
like to see more of that curation on
their side in the market in general
spouse especially around tablets the
interview goes on to talk about ice
cream sandwich and like you know when do
you see big consumer you know basically
how can we get ice cream sandwich and
future operating systems out to
consumers quickly more quickly and his
answer is there's actually says there's
very rapid adoption of has cream
sandwich lada OEMs have announced it
here which seems kind of odd considering
that ice cream sandwich came out a
couple months ago so how could it seems
like it's only on one phone right can
you say that's rapid adoption that's
maybe maybe he's talking about the
developers or something or who I thinks
that's kind of what he's saying is that
yeah we're gonna see a bunch coming out
soon but from a consumer perspective
when you're comparison is Apple where
they're say like this OS is out and that
means it's out on all the phones no yeah
right it's big difference like consumers
who are like well this was announced a
couple months ago but I can't buy it
like I just bought a new phone and
coming with us old now we have no idea
when when we might get it you know
depending on what device we have yeah
that creates a lot of confusion and you
know I think a lot of buyers even say
like I'm going to hold off by until I
understand if it's going to come out or
it's just too confusing so I'm just
going to get you know I phone or
something that I understand how the
release cycle works right let's see what
else they talked about how they release
Nexus phones and OS is optimized for
that so google strategy is kind of when
they're coming out with a new OS like
ice cream sandwich to optimize it for
the Nexus device on the chipset which
makes it hard for other developers other
hardware manufacturers who don't release
phones with that chip set to adapt it
takes them a while and he said could you
change that strategy and the answer is
kind of the google strategy is to get
something in consumers hands as fast as
possible so if they made an OS that was
available to all the different chipsets
it would take a lot longer to get that
out
to everything at once yeah which i think
is true but I don't know that that is
necessarily a bad strategy I mean I feel
like wide availability is maybe better
than having something that comes out a
couple months sooner but it's only
available to small subsection of people
who want to buy that one device yeah I
mean you're certainly going to piss at
least a few users off by releasing it to
just one phone and then having everybody
else salivating over it right one phone
one carrier yeah you know wondering when
they're going to get it and and on top
of that I mean you still have users that
are working out the bugs on that one
phone because like he said Google you
know wants to release it as soon as
possible which is totally Google style
just to throw everything out there get
it out there as fast as possible and
then fix it lee yeah no I mean I think I
think I think it's great for a lot of
things you know but I guess we're just
pointing out the problems with that
strategy yeah I mean it's all a
balancing act here really what we're
talking about is the strategy between
this closed ecosystem where you control
everything in this open ecosystem where
everything is just a free-for-all almost
and you know both have benefits I feel
like there's probably a middle ground
that I'd love to see Android move
towards where again they say like here's
minimum hardware specs that you need to
meet to have the android market to be
called sort of an Android you know
certified device so that has a consumer
I can sort of know that when I buy a
device it has these minimum specs that
maybe that can guarantee it's going to
be upgradable to future os's for X
number of versions so I feel like I have
some security and it's not just I'm
buying this device that may be worthless
and dead and not upgradable you know two
months after it comes out right so can
someone fix that please what else there
was some news about android activations
we had you have that story we have on
that let's see this this was I think
we've seen a lot of tweets from andy
rubin this is how he typically releases
how many activations per hour yeah I'm
is accordingly according to Andy
the Android platform is now seeing over
850,000 device activations per day so I
think what was it just last month that
we heard it was 700 that was right yeah
in January yeah and so there's over 300
million devices activated to date or
device activations to date right right
and that is significant because Apple's
OS was last seen at 315 million
cumulative devices and so you know
they're probably hovering somewhere
around 330 right now which means that I
think android may be poised to overtake
them right yeah this is a pretty
interesting out at a tipping point or
something like that where they could
sort of really cross over and it's
possible that they've already overtaken
if you just look at overall Android
devices that include like the Kindle and
the nook which aren't sort of official
android market devices so i think google
is not counting those right but um and
he knows Apple there no right but Apple
is also counting devices that are phones
here like i pod touches for example all
right how many Android is too they're
counting tablets but there's not many
top of tablets and right exactly so
tipping point we will keep a watch I'm
sure we'll have more data in a month or
two that's this is really interesting
because just like a couple laker last
week cisco put out a story that says
there's going to be more mobile phones
than humans in 2012 which just blows my
mind look where are they all going
landfills writing right well what's
happening and we were just talking about
this morning actually there's a lot of
people who have multiple phones like you
see people around the office who have
their blackberries for work and their
iphones for personal use is there are
there really that many how to to
compensate for all those people out
there that don't have go look at Jessica
doll courts desk yeah yes she's not a
good thing you know what it actually is
is in other countries where there's
multiple networks and sometimes you
carry multiple phone just so you can
have coverage in different areas of a
country I know Africa as
they issue a lot yeah yeah and I know
just in the Philippines you know I've
been to the Philippines a few times I
know a lot of people have different
phones for the different carriers there
as well so yeah I think it is it's big
and it's crazy and it'd be an
interesting problem for someone to solve
that's insane I just I don't want to
believe that there are more phones out
there than human life I don't want to
believe that well there are so one last
thing before we take a break and this is
on the ongoing topic of the Google
acquisition of Motorola and so at Mobile
World Congress Andy Rubin who we didn't
mention before is sort of the head I
don't know his official title is head of
Android for google he's the head android
is they had android yeah maybe he is a
robot lady the same picture of him he's
got like a helicopter behind him i don't
know i don't know where the helicopter
comes into play it's android-powered i'm
sure honey so he sponsored the Google
take over a motorola originally however
he wants to make it clear that they have
built literally built a fire wall a wall
of fire now why fire they've literally
built a firewall between the companies
and that quote I don't even know
anything about their products their
separate from me and I'm going to
continue to do my thing he has no idea
what's going on down on her yeah which I
you know I keep calling BS on this
because I feel like what you know really
about this big company I know you
jeopardize your other relationships with
carriers if you get involved but um hi
do you think this is really true can I
really maintain this firewall um you
know I think I think to an extent he's
he's trying to keep his hands off that's
what I want to believe but as far as him
not knowing anything i'm going to say
he's overstating that firewall a little
bit um I think he's got enough something
you know or his employees it'll bump
into each other and like the cafeteria
right right at the softball game just
like hey what he
you know yeah I forget it don't tell me
I mean maybe they're different buildings
and what I'm thinking Motorola's built
based and like you'll no way or
something like that so maybe they're not
moving any of them and they won't run
into each other but i don't know maybe I
mean I mean there there's a conflict of
interest you know so there is we'll see
what happens we'll see how long this
lasts i think i had a prediction about
this yeah I'm all right we're going to
take a quick break but when we come back
we are going to tell you everything we
know about jelly beans stay with us
eddore back welcome back to the
discussion of her of one of my favorite
candies jelly beans Joey bishop I love
the jelly belly yeah you guys fans big
time they're open they're over here too
in the Bay Area too right thinking back
on the Fairfield airfield yeah it can
take a little factory tour oh yeah hmm
so we talked about rumors last week that
Google's next OS would be called jelly
beans and jelly bean this week we have a
little more hilarious reverse evidence
if you will evidence yeah so apparently
in Google's booth if you just go into
the booth at Mobile World Congress they
are giving out ice cream sandwiches but
if you go deep into the booth into the
leg press area they have a little bowl
of we have a photo here I think as well
it's actually kind of a large bowl
filled with jellybeans and androids all
around it delicious and google declined
a comment on their candy bowl but we try
to get Eric Schmidt on the phone about
it yes we have yes did uh there were no
black jellybeans in there no no um
that's it that's an Eric Schmidt's
writer actually is no black jellybeans
anyway could this be a sign could it huh
I think it is absolutely definitive
proof that the next OS is going to be
called jelly beans but that's just my
opinion that's the only way we could
take it yeah anyway that's all we got on
that it's pretty funny i think though
all right so now we're going to do a
couple little hardware things there was
a lot of hardware that came out of
Mobile World Congress if you want to
look at it all good at cnet com /
android atlas we're just going to cover
the interesting parts because you don't
want to hear us just rattle on about
those phone
two percent more cpu than that phone we
talked about last week and one extra
core yeah this is the first two and a
half core phone but we did talk last
week about the galaxy note and rumors
that there would be a galaxy note tablet
and there is da da it's the galaxy note
10.1 and it is everything you would
expect it's basically like the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 but it has the S Pen
thingamajigger TouchWiz Ice Cream
Sandwich 1.4 gigahertz dual-core 1280 by
800 it is not a phone so don't try to
make calls with it interesting but it
does have gps yeah and this is
interesting right yeah talk about this
yeah it actually comes pre-loaded with
Photoshop Touch and it's interesting
because we actually had someone what was
that an email a voicemail right i think
an email we had someone talking about
what was it a stylus enabled photoshop
app Ron on a stylist enabled tablet and
this is this is pretty much it i mean it
we know that it comes pre-loaded with
the photoshop touch app but what we
don't know is whether that photoshop
touch app is optimized for use with a
stylus but yeah you know i'm going to go
ahead and assume that it is because it
does come pre-loaded on i'm sure it does
or at least works well yeah and that app
is the comes pre-loaded here otherwise
it's ten bucks which is for photoshop
which is normally like seven hundred
dollars is a pretty good deal right yeah
i mean i've actually played with the app
a little bit oh um it's i mean i just i
used my finger i didn't have a stylist
at my disposal finger is the best
possible stylist stylist who's than that
then some of these jobs okay but i might
have to disagree when it comes to this
photoshop app because it was very hard
for me to trace objects on the photoshop
app with my finger so i'm i'm kind of
excited to see what that might be like
with the
stylist yeah I think it'd be kind of
cool um anyway I'd like to check this
out with Photoshop that'd be cool
totally uh we will so we solve someone's
problem where we didn't yeah all right
adobe and Samsung solve someone's
problem but we let them know about it
right that's it that's our job so we'll
take a little bit of credit yes all
right this next one so we have two more
pieces of hardware here that I find
pretty interesting ene that's awesome
I'd never buy that kind of way the
PadFone may we can take a look at this
video while we talk about this but so
you're gonna walk us through this is
this a phone is a tablet as a computer
what is it so it's a phone it's a phone
but it's got a wait there's more it's
got a docking station that is not
actually docking station it's a tablet
so what you do is you slide the phone
into the back of the tablet and today
you now have a tablet I'm not sure what
the specs are oh wait inches if that's
not good enough that is yeah if that's
not good enough there is yet another
contraption to be added on which is a
keyboard that folds into that tablet
making it look somewhat like a notebook
well I'm ultimate so it's very much like
I mean so this is from a sous it's
similar to the transformer prime right
right except that the phone is the base
rather than a tablet being the base of
your operations there and so the phone
stores all the data you know so you can
just take that off and you have
everything and it seems to be a pretty
nice phone even without all the mumbo
jumbo 4.3 inch AMOLED display ice cream
sandwich but I guess it's kind of I know
it's cool there's no pricing I mean it
hi I'm if i could pay like maybe 200
bucks and get all that extra stuff maybe
that's worth it but may feel like this
is gonna be like a six hundred dollar
investment on top of the phone right i
mean if it's if it's not expensive you
might want to just get a kindle fire or
something in addition to your phone
right you know funds for just a netbook
or something yeah
I mean a lot of the phones you can just
actually plug an hdmi cable in and use
you know a bluetooth keyboard with now
yeah so behind this is specific hardware
for this specific phone that when you
upgrade your phone is potentially
worthless as you know they're not going
to keep the same form factor yeah and
then and then without the phone these
add-ons are then useless right yeah I
mean if you had a separate tablet then
you can actually use two things you know
exactly and that this does have a pen as
well so following up on the note orejas
a pen which doubles as a bluetooth
headset that I don't understand but I
mean I did see that there's a button on
there that allows you to answer the
phone right you just kind of click it
right James bond-style exactly this does
seem something like you would invent
right uh anyway cool are you gonna buy
that I'm not gonna buy that but i might
play with one if one ends up somewhere
in the office and you'll ruin aw i will
this next thing is something that i
would want I don't want this phone but I
do like this idea a lot it is the
Samsung Galaxy Beam and it is a samsung
galaxy phone which is not super powered
it's a 1 gigahertz dual-core phone with
a 1.3 megapixel camera blah blah blah
only running android 2.3 but it has a
pico projector which basically is just a
small little projector that is handheld
built in so you can project I don't know
exactly what you can project but
potentially anything you're seeing on
the screen just on the nearest wall to
you yeah I think you might actually be
able to project your just your phone's
desktop which would be cool but also
just so if you think about how you would
use this like how many times are you
showing people photos on your phone and
everyone's gathered around and you're
like swiped by five and then they have
bad breath and they smell and you're
like a backup always and you don't want
them to touch your phone because it
greasy exactly so this solves the
problem like just project your photos on
the nearest wall swipe swipe swipe
through that
yeah it's pretty awesome yeah I mean I
think for me I would probably use it to
show people some YouTube videos because
i find myself pulling up youtube videos
all the time you know it's a friends
showing on paint check this out it's
hilarious right but now everybody can
see it at the same time on the wall I
don't know how good the speakers are in
this though yeah I mean that's a good
question and this is it's 15 lumens what
up which I don't think it's super bright
but maybe it's really bright for a pico
projector I don't really know how those
are rated but anyway I think it's cool I
really I wit by phone with this I don't
know if a I would pay a whole lot extra
maybe like 50 bucks extra but more
importantly I don't know if I would
compromise on specs like would I buy a
slower phone just to get the projector
piece or a phone like how it's got
gingerbread right it got gingerbread and
it looks a little beefy like it doesn't
I mean it has to be pretty much right
yeah have a rejecter on there but there
was a camera that came out and if you
guys remember this may be last year at
CES or something like that that projects
from the actual camera yeah i think i
saw that which is pretty cool but people
don't really use cameras anymore they
just use phones yeah so this makes a lot
of sense but uh we'll see where this
goes yeah I'd like to see more phones
come out yes I think HTC made a phone
like this for the projector built in ico
really I think so like a long time ago I
remember seeing commercials about a long
time ago interesting we'll check into
hath school idea um alright gonna go
through this touch note app of the week
real quick yeah should we have am I
wrote a little how-to on it basically
you can use your phone to send actual
printed postcards to friends anywhere
around the world for a dollar forty I
pretty cool price you just you know take
a photo of whatever you want to take of
whatever you want to send and then you
can you can add your message to the back
of it and the address and everything I
mean we have a video
in a world where agreeing and facebook
likes are the norm why not show a friend
you really care by sending him a
postcard I'm Jay marker BB with cnet com
and today I'm going to show you how to
use your mobile device to send an actual
printed postcard to your friends hey man
hey hey I just want to let you know that
I really care about you look oh cool
yeah so I'm gonna send you a postcard
okay all right I really care about you
with touch note for Android or iOS you
can take a photo with your phone or
tablet have it printed on a glossy
postcard and mail it anywhere in the
world for a dollar 49 to get started
download and install the free touch note
app from the android market or the
itunes app store next fire it up and
pick a photo to use for the front of
your postcard you can take a new photo
pull one off of your facebook account or
pick one from your gallery once you've
made your pic pinch and drag to control
the zoom and placement of your photo or
do a two finger twist to rotate it next
flip the card over to enter a
destination address and your message the
app doesn't offer any custom style
options but the default is pretty clean
and classy when you're done with your
message it's time to make your payment
touch note sells postcard credits for a
dollar 49 each or impacts and it accepts
paypal or credit card just sent you're
gonna love it man good for the fridge
cool I need some personal space yeah I
really care about you and that's pretty
much it cards usually arrive within two
to five days in the US and UK or within
three weeks anywhere else I'm jmar
cabebe with cnet com and i've just shown
you how to be a better friend re all i
really care about you so it's sense of
physical physical it does yeah and i
actually sent i sent one to myself it's
glossy it's it's well printed i should
say and it is as I said perfect for the
fridge yeah cool so I want a quick
update on the projector phone samsung
actually did in 2009 release a projector
phone which it held this yeah samsung
show which didn't work out very well
apparently and then there was also a
windows phone-based one from LG but just
I never heard windows mobile 6.5 so I'm
sure that did great yeah two big major
hits oh right terrible let's do some
email uh first email from Martin we had
talked last week about why Korean
manufacturers might be really same pen
based phone with huge screens right and
to Martin wrote in and said hey you
wondered if it was a cultural reason why
Koreans would want a phone with a stylus
well one reason might be their alphabet
it's a lot easier to write with a pen
then with the roundabout way it can be
done with qwerty keyboard the same would
be true for quite a few other Asian
languages and I was sort of speculating
because of you know the symbol based
languages where there's potentially
thousands of characters that it could be
hard to type and obviously I've never
done this because I don't know those
languages right on a regular keyboard or
maybe just writing out the characters
would be simpler yeah and I think we're
made well we're making the assumption
that in these countries in Korea saying
the device would also come with a korean
keyboard
preinstalled right yeah but what you're
saying is that for languages that have
maybe you know a thousand characters
that might be difficult right yeah i
mean i can just imagine that on a
keyboard having a hit multiple option

doing a good job and I still needed to
raise my volume yet again but we chose
not to believe him we did not yeah so
