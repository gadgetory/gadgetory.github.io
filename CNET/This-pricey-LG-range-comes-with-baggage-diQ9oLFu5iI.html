CNN appliances back with another oven
review this time we're looking at the LG
LS RG 3 0 9 s T this is a 1999 dollar
oven so that's a little bit pricier than
the other models we've been looking at
recently I really like the way this
model looks it has a nice display the
touch screen is easy to use it has five
burners like most gas models we've
looked at but it has one distinguishing
feature that is that its large burner
has 19,000 BTUs so it's gonna be faster
at boiling a large pot of water than
most of the other models we've looked at
so far it also comes with a ton of
accessories and when I say a ton of
accessories I really mean it not
literally but pretty close it comes with
so many different racks and accessories
and some of them are really odd and
don't have an obvious immediate use and
that brings me to my main problem with
this range it is actually a very very
good range but it doesn't offer a lot
more for the inflated price of 1999
dollars you can get Samsung's
NX 5 8f 5700 for 1699 bucks it had
better performance and more features it
just didn't have all of those odd
accessories that I don't know what
exactly to do work anyway that said I
had a lot of fun testing this range I
fried up some hot dogs on the included
griddle I made hamburgers I roasted a
pork tenderloin everything tasted good
and I have no doubt that you would be
able to make good food with this model
but it just kind of comes back to the
issue of value and whether or not it's
worth it to spend an extra 300 bucks for
something that you could get for less
thanks for watching this review of the
LG LS RG 3 0 9 s T be sure to check out
