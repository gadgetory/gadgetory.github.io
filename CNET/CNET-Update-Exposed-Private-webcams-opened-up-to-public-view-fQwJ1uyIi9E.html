webcam passwords I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update you should
never be using the default password that
comes with a device and that includes
your video security system one creepy
website is proof why passwords matter
Innis camco is streaming footage of more
than 73,000 webcams from around the
world without the knowledge of the
owners the site was able to access these
security surveillance feeds because the
owners used default admin passwords or
something very basic like one two three
four five if you use a default password
on your webcam then your living room or
your child's bedroom may be on this
website there are more than 11,000
camera feeds coming from the US and if
that wasn't awful enough the video feeds
also show location some security camera
companies such as Foscam Linksys and
Panasonic offer these pre-programmed
simple logins during setup foscam has
responded by requiring users to change
their passwords right away so no one can
use a default anymore let's move on to
another tech headache
anyone who has switched from using an
iPhone to Android usually has to deal
with a big problem missing text messages
Apple's iMessage is often the culprit
but Apple has come out with a solution
to help cut a phone number free from eye
messages here's what tends to go wrong
when you have an iPhone your phone
number is signed up for iMessage that
sends your text to other iPhone owners
over data networks and Wi-Fi but if you
switch your phone number to Android
Windows or Blackberry well you have to
turn iMessage off or Apple thinks your
phone number is still tied to an iPhone
and message is sent to you from other
iPhone users get stuck in some sort of
Apple limbo never making it to your new
phone sometimes turning iMessage off
doesn't work and Apple has been sued
over this bug but to fix it Apple now
has a website where you can deregister
your phone number from iMessage even if
you don't have that iPhone with you
anymore
speaking of bugs sony has released a fix
to a major bug in the latest
PlayStation 4 system update it prevented
consoles from waking up after going into
standby mode downloading the latest
update should fix it but users are
discovering a new problem that isn't a
glitch game publishers are able to block
the share play feature on the ps4 which
is supposed to let friends share games
over the internet with share play to ps4
owners can play a single copy of one
game but call a duty advanced warfare
blocks AllShare Play functionality
Activision which makes Call of Duty says
it's still evaluating if it'll support
the feature that's your tech news update
there's always more at sea Netcom from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
