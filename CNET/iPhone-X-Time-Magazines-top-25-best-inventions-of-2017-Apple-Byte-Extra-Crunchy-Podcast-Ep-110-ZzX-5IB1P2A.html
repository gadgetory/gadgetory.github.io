where you are on the planet earth my
name is Steven Beach a producer for the
Apple byte extra country podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tom welcome to the
show welcome it is Apple byte extra
crunchy extra money we are here with
episode 110 it is the basically a week
after we posted our Apple byte version
of the iPhone 10 review tons of stuff
coming in here but again this show is
all about you all so you know how to be
a part of the show guess what all you
got to do is call us the number magic
number is 1-866-376-8255
I've found it for a video so yeah so
it's this kind of robot but it has this
head that swivels it looks like
something from you know a Pixar movie it
has expressions and gestures that move
sure you're like I'm not gonna pay 899
dollars for one of these things but what
makes it special is kind of like how
they're starting to add these human-like
gestures that we can relate to like you
know it
twerk it it kind of Bob's its head or
swivels it it kind of reminds you of
like stuff that bb-8 did where you saw
an Android type robot droid have
movements like that I thought that was a
cool one another cool one
the ember mug have you seen this thing
bro no no I gotta check it out
the ember bug is 7995 it's a ceramic mug
with this base that's a heater it's a
smart mug so they always talk about like
look your coffee all you coffee lovers
out there for Raj Mathai is still
watching with this I know he takes his
coffee but you know what you your
coffees gonna taste different whether
it's super hot or super cold so this mug
heats it just right you can set it
anywhere from 120 degrees to 45 degrees
Fahrenheit and it is like the sweet spot
it's 7995 for this mug this might be
like pensive yeah but dude it keeps your
we're it we're first of all problems
these days it keeps your coffee like
perfect look I think there's a lot of
Craig Wright people that gonna go for
that so that's just a couple things that
were fun obviously the iPhone 10 is on
that list
I had nothing but overall you know I
have my own criticisms of it but at the
end of the day if you want to get this
product you're kind of you know that
there's not gonna be a headphone jack
you know that there's not going to be a
home button there's gonna be no touch ID
but if you're you're really mean ready
to jump on kind of this is Apple's
concept car of the future and you're
okay with that I think you're really
gonna love it if you're not and you're
not ready to that's fine but that's who
they're kind of catering to the hardcore
gadget people the hardcore iPhone fans
and really the hardcore Apple fans but
we know that this phone is selling
bonkers I think I think the wait time
right now is 2 to 3 weeks if you order
in the US or Canada so iPhone 10 made
times top 25 best inventions of this
year I just recorded one thing on this
list the portable wearable breast pump
that's that's pretty interesting I think
we did a review with them but I I wasn't
able to be used as a test subject for
obvious reasons well I mean I could have
but I don't know if it would work
I don't think I would begin a minute
giving it a proper review dude yeah the
legit review for that one alright so we
will talk more about currents things
happening around the world of iPhone 10
but we're gonna jump into a couple url'
a couple kind of like let's look way
down the road and talk about iPhone 10
in 2018 are you are you guys do you want
to hear about this Beach I do yeah do
okay check this out
KGI securities and well-known analyst
slash supply chain slash rumor gaming
chi quo his latest report says Apple
will launch a trio of new iPhone models
in 2018 so here we go two of those
models will be OLED screen based you'll
have your current 5.8 inch iPhone with
an OLED screen then a larger 6.5 inch
screen with an OLED and then a third
model that falls in between with a 6.1
inch screen that is going to be an LCD
based screen Wow
so yeah this is a lot the the report
according to Kuo he expects the 5.8 inch
model to have the same pixel per inch
density that's power 458 that the
current iPhone does he also suggests
that the 6.5 inch model that will be
larger in size will have a slightly
higher pixel per inch density which
would be at somewhere between 480 and
500 pixel pixels per inch and then the
6.1 inch LCD based model will have a
pixel density of 320 the 330 I like to
call that model the iPhone blurry
because you're gonna be like this is not
as sharp as like we're used to seeing
but they're trying to target basically
this mid-range so bleep saying this out
loud is silly a mid-range to low range
market with the LCD based 6.1 inch
iPhone that's that's what he believes
the two OLED screens actually all three
phones across the board are expected to
get the true depth camera sensor the
top-notch phone design and that's gonna
that is what is right now reported
what will we can expect to see for the
new iPhone 10 iPhone 11 iPhone 10 are
they gonna give me an iPhone 10 plus
they're gonna give me the iPhone dos a
keys I mean they'll probably stick with
something like an iPhone 10 plus for the
big one we'll see what they call it but
10s sounds weird don't you think tennis
looks yeah tennis like like tennis
it'll be like iPhone XS it'll be like
iPhone extra small come on mister vide
it in our chat room is saying the notch
on every phone no there's a notch on
every one of these phones here or at
least four of them we know we've we've
said it before notch my iPhone please
this is not my knife so then another
person in the chatroom I'm sorry to keep
referring to jump in it but they're
buying is d B DX in the YouTube chat
says Brian is OLED really the future I
love my ex but I've been told they don't
last very long well historically OLED
does have image retention and burnin
issues over a long period of time I
think what'll be interesting to see is
we saw those issues creep up on the
pixel to Excel screen Apple has said
because the thing that's maybe different
with Apple screen is that not only is it
an OLED screen they they have special
chips that also aid in the performance
of the screen that is why it was rated
the best screen ever on a smartphone by
display mate it's both Samsung hardware
and Apple's chips working together and
then Apple has made it a point that
they've optimized software so that it
reduces the potential chance for burn in
at least after week one and a half week
two we are not seeing reports of any
major image retention from the iPhone
tens yet now that could change right I
in a day we all of a sudden it could be
like um ya know we're starting to see
burnin but up to this point we haven't
seen any so it's gonna be really up to
how Apple is trying to minimize that but
over the course of time we know even in
TV sets it happens so it's always
important not to just keep it on the
same thing order you don't you just want
to leave a single image like if you're
on a video game and you pause your
console and you leave your screen on
that in that same spot you're probably
gonna get a little bit of it there's
ways to reduce that but
we'll see how it fares out for the
iPhone 10 I mean the main advantage of
OLED is the deepest darkest inky as'
blacks which give you the best image
quality possible and give you the widest
contrast ratio largest contrast ratio
that you can see on a screen and that's
why it looks so good
so we'll see we'll see how it plays out
it's one of those things that you just
kind of gotta wait but I'm all for the
OLED movement we haven't we've had
Samsung screens with Oh LEDs for years
they have exhibited some burning over
time but guess what the sad and sick
thing about it is we typically get rid
of these phones after two years or even
one year now yeah you know what I'm
saying yeah yeah yeah totally so we'll
see how we'll see how that all plays out
another story coming out to us from
Bloomberg is that Apple is targeting to
have a rear-facing 3d sensor for 2019
iPhone so we know we have the true depth
sensor on the front Apple's looking to
put its own 3d sensing camera or sensor
on the back side for 2019 what makes
this interesting is it's using different
technology so we know that the chewed-up
sensor that scans your face it basically
shoots a light on your face it projects
a pattern of 30,000 laser dots and then
kind of measures the change and
distortion that's how face ID really
builds that image of your face but with
this new rear sensor that they're hoping
to look for they're gonna be using a
different method it pretty much they
call it a time-of-flight approach and
what that means is if you have lasers
that are shooting out and kind of like
with a laser focusing system on the LG
phones this time of flight calculates
the time it takes for a laser to bounce
off something so if it has a laser
shooting in different directions it
ultimately it'll be able to scan and
build a rough 3d environment from your
phone and it gives you that kind of
sense of okay this is an entire room
what we have found is with a our kit on
the Apple iPhone 10 is that it can do
some really great augmented reality
things it does typically Excel when
you're talking about putting things on a
tabletop surface there's like a game
called a
I don't know if it's called my pet
dragon but it's something like that I've
goofed around with it you know it can do
measurements really nicely we've seen
examples where tabletops work well I can
see a table but when it comes to
vertical surfaces like walls and doors
it's not it's not really there yet it's
not nearly as accurate it can't see that
and so that's why they would need
something like this laser time a flight
sensor on the backside and this is
Apple's push 2 right now I would
arguably say they're the leading
consumer augmented reality device out
there on the market they want to make an
even bigger leap by putting a rear
sensor on there as well so according to
Bloomberg this is what they are looking
for in targeting 2019 for this will not
affect anything with the true that
sensor on the front facing camera this
is all new technology for the rear side
nice so they've even there's even
examples of like how there's things
where you could place like a tiger on a
stand on a floor in this article but
when you have like a pole in the way it
doesn't really see the pole it just
really sees the floor so those are those
type of you know augmented reality
things that are in the way but augmented
reality still has major potential we're
gonna see it really come to fruition
once developers get their hands on the
iPhone 10 I would say maybe three or
four months we're gonna start seeing
some crazy stuff a year later we're
gonna see even more crazier stuff more
crazier it's time in a word we're gonna
see crazier stuff so it's just get the
tools get the hardware get the software
into these amazing developers hands and
let them go to town and we're gonna be
able to reap the benefits of that so I
feel like if there's the sensor on the
front and the back it's gonna be able to
do weird things like measure a room or
you know there's so many other potential
potential you know things that it could
do that I'm just popping into my head
right now like measure a room or you
know just measure like an object or
something and and then allow for like
spatial augmented reality games or you
know we're where there's a border or
something in a room does that make sense
yeah well what if you just sat in your
living room and it mapped out the room
and then all of a sudden you're in this
like one first-person shooter where
creatures are coming out on the walls
but you're just sitting on the couch in
your room right it just becomes like
those gallery type shooters like that's
the type of stuff that we know people
are working on and it's just gonna keep
on getting better and better better yeah
really
that sounds pretty exciting but I mean
also you know it's scary that there's
laser shooting out of my phone measuring
my whereabouts you know freaking lasers
lasers all right we know that the iPhone
10 and every phone that comes out is not
without some of their obstacles and
issues that that do affect it and the
iPhone has its bumps and bruises no
doubt it's still a great phone that
guess what the pixel 2 XL has bumps and
bruises I still think it's a great phone
some people say it's not as great
whatever that's you could you could you
could figure that out between yourselves
but the current iPhone 10 right remember
when they launched face ID they kind of
put out this beacon to say like hey face
ideas really secure one in a million
faces can crack it you can't work on
photos it doesn't work on masks this is
the most secure kind of security sensor
for your phone well that was just like
hey to the world try and break it so
guess what people broke it and this is
this is a cool little story from a
Vietnamese developer called be CAV and
they basically tricked the iPhone TENS
face ID with a mask and what they did is
they pretty much cobbled together a
composite mask made up of 3d printed
plastic silicone makeup and some simple
paper cutouts which in combination
tricked the iPhone into unlocking their
phone now there the video clip in that
article Beach they just show them like
kind of talking about and how it works
but this demonstration so far it's been
shown off it has not been confirmed
publicly by any like third-party source
but there's some interesting stuff about
this the actual developers they found it
wasn't as hard as they thought it would
be to actually hack face Aidid there the
quote that be CAV wrote was the
recognition mechanism is not as strict
as you think we just need half a face to
create the mask it was even simpler than
we ourselves
had thought so I'm watching this video
it's funny he's got like the paper he
put a piece of paper over his eye which
is like just a picture of an eye you
know yeah it's this is really weird man
so they've shown it where they reset the
face ID versus you know an accurate and
then put it against a model
they've been clearly they haven't talked
about it as well they aren't kind of
exposing all of exactly what is but
maybe it's not capturing as much data as
we think and this might lean towards
what that color last week asked about
about the kind of the face ID conspiracy
theory like did it make it less secure
you know we will never know but if you
can actually trick it by only having
certain features it's not look no one's
gonna do this anytime soon it's not like
you have to worry about someone making a
copy of your face but clearly if you
could do it on like someone model maybe
if someone's a little more high-profile
it's an issue but you know it's all
mission impossible I worry about people
making copy of my face and using it for
evil so and you too Brian
but then they'd have to copy your hair
too and that Bobby remember face Aidid
adapts with haircuts oh that's right
that's right it does you know what one
thing that people don't talk about like
people aren't see this the thing why
when we do our iPhone 10 reviews it
should be more experience you know one
time where face ID never works with me
is when I have my toothbrush in my mouth
oh really huh because it's like this
firm like hanging out here and it it
must cover or just not give a complete
face profile and it immediately kills it
sometimes when I have my sunglasses
hanging off of my cheeks and it's like
down here
it won't detect either so there's
there's always these different like
examples of when and when it will work
or when it won't huh that's funny
like yeah I could see myself using my
phone while brushing my picture myself
doing that so I don't know first of all
you don't have to worry about it man you
got a phone with an actual home button
10 baby yeah and that's something we're
cheering about for many people honestly
you should be you should be cheering
about that
look at this beautiful iOS right here oh
yeah I'm just kidding I'm just playing
oh yeah there's no bugs 3d touch works
alright uh if you didn't think that
you're worried about someone making a
mask out of your face check this out
this is kind of the I don't know might
be the fun video of the week an iPhone
10 was with face ID was unlocked by a 10
year old kid who was able to take his
mom's phone that had her face ID profile
put into it and then it was unlocked so
the mom shows like hey my face ID is
working here I'm gonna stare it and I'm
gonna lock it she then later hands over
the phone to her son and then he just
stares at it and the phone completely
unlocks and so it's kind of interesting
because it raises the question Apple
hasn't responded to anything about this
but it's like okay how secure is this
phone now we're seeing that it works
with people of not only not twins or
brothers and sisters we're talking about
different ages different genders and it
works that's funny because they do they
do kind of look alike too very similar
you did it right away man no problem and
then he dabs you got it I mean when
you're 10 years old you got a DAB why
wouldn't you dab that's funny man
it's totally not played out to dab I
know my kids wouldn't be able to unlock
my phone cuz they don't they don't look
like me very much they look more like
their mom but the I mean that's a
problem because you don't want your kids
being able to unlock your phone and like
get in and do weird stuff and look at
videos or you know so that is a problem
I don't know buddy nobody wants that in
another face IDs story this came out
from the Nikkei Asian DK review we
talked about face ID in the phone
according to their reports this is again
way down the road Apple may be working
to include its face ID technology in the
home pod by 2019 now that I thought this
was interesting because remember way
back I think sometime in May April or
May of last year there were rumblings
that Apple's actual home pod would have
a video camera that would feature some
kind of facial recognition there were
actual
ports about that back in may now
obviously it didn't make it for this
first generation home pod but clearly
its they've been thinking about they
probably more most likely have been
testing it and oh you know why is that
advantageous if a device knows who you
are and you have different settings
different accounts different music
playlists preferences you know contacts
it needs to know who you are
so that it can serve that information
now with Google it learns your voice
which is awesome and can distinguish
between different members of the family
but at least Apple is trying to
potentially taking this facial
recognition approach to distinguish
between different users nice it's cool
but app but voice being able to detect a
voice is way better it's faster you
don't have to look at anything yeah
definitely I think it's way better and
just detective voice you also have to be
in the line of sight of the camera and
this and that so like walk up to it I
don't wanna walk up to it I wanna walk
and look at it just like nobody got no
time for that all right
should we take a little breather and
give some love to our sponsor this week
let's do it man I'll get some music
going here let's set the mode this
episode ladies and gentlemen is brought

all right shall we keep on rolling let's
keep it going
or iPhone 10 issues I'm sorry to break
your hearts y'all but it happens the
iPhone 10 what do you what do you think
about cold weather is it gonna be able
to hang in the cold this this is don't
bum me out right now cuz I take my
iphone snowboarding I make video take
pictures this is all bum me out right
now at the moment some users have
complained that the handset screen
becomes unresponsive in cooler outside
temperatures Apple said Thursday which
would be I think it was last week
Thursday that it's working on a software
fix for complaints because the phone
does indeed become unresponsive in some
cold weather yeah so I'm wondering you
know people have complained about this
I've got imagine if you're in a really
cool cold if you're living in a cold
city like during this Christmas break
they have not fixed the issue yet I mean
you spend a thousand bucks on your phone
and it's not working on the cold
NIC's that's that's like three months of
the year you're not gonna be able to use
your phone properly unless you're
indoors or something that's
better up they better update that they
better update that that's all I'm saying
like get on that now the also the other
issue affecting some phones it doesn't
seem to be too widespread but it is
enough where look this is a visual thing
you maybe you guys and gals have seen
the Greenline I don't want to call it
the green line of death but it's the
green line it comes down on the side of
some of these phones and one of the
beliefs is that basically TechCrunch
reported that the iPhone 10 display uses
this new what they call a diamond sub
pixel pattern and so it could be the
fact that there's an electrical fault
causing voltage to flow to all of the
green subpixels creating a line like
that and you know laughing man I'm just
laughing at this beach or so sensitive
line you can't use the letter I can't
use it in the cold your kids can unlock
it what else man what else I'm sorry you
don't need to be sorry right oh man
track him eat you're hella cracking me
up right now
oh that's too funny too funny anyways
check it out this is an issue that can't
really be resolved by yourself you got
to go take it in to Apple care whether
it's mail it in or go to a store nearby
or a service provider but you're not
gonna be able to fix this one um but
there's one thing you can fix the not
the damn notch I love this I'm looking
at this right now this is wonderful
check it out it's called it's a free app
available on the App Store from Apple
it's called
a notch remover and what I like about it
is it allows you to basically through
this app for free
take a photo that you have and then put
it you basically have to have it in your
photo album on your phone and you can
select a photo it'll frame it for you
and then it removes that notch on the
top again this is only gonna work for
like your homescreen and your lock
screen but the notch no more with the
knot remover app there's also another
cool website if you want to play with it
yourself um it's called NOx lists
space that I was sent they have some
really cool wallpapers already in there
that you can download but then they also
offer up their tool basically their
template in Photoshop so that you can
build and create your own wallpapers if
you don't want to use the app so just
kind of some different ways for all you
it's a really like I said on my review
it's a really divisive thing some people
love it some people don't
I'm in the camp that I feel like it's
unnecessary so I kind of make it
disappear but hold on
I did I did embrace it though I had I
had to get on board with this own I had
get on board wonderful I mean it just
makes me laugh and reminds me how like
silly it is it's like that's it hey yeah
people in the chatroom are seeing an
update came out today for the I think
it's the Green Line really yeah
someone's saying in OP chat room that
came out today and uh and they know what
it is since we'll do this real time just
chat us with what version of iOS is it
like eleven point one point two or
something cuz they just released eleven
point one point one to take care of the
letter is U which was funny because it
was the letter I and was like iiiii
point one point two people are saying
okay that's good and then someone else
also said that there's another app
called nacho which is gets rid of the
notch in but it costs a dollar well I
didn't recommend nacho because not only
does it cost a dollar if you want to get
rid of the nacho watermark they ask you
to pay two more bucks that's baloney
oh and this this update also covers the
Green Line and the cold
non-responsiveness well this is why we
do this real time man thank you guys
cute the community is part of the show
I'm telling you like we don't know
everything at every moment so we got to
do it like that love it thank you bye
Apple byte nation you guys rock all
right um this is a cool thing in the
latest beta for iOS 11.2 has revealed
that the beta adds support for faster
7.5 watt charging wireless charging on
the iPhone 10 and 8 so when that first
came out the phones support
up to five watts there are actual
charging pads like belkin's that go up
to 15 Apple said they would release an
update later to give you faster wireless
charging so at least in this 11.2 update
it does support 7.5 watts here's the
other thing though 9 to 5 Mac actually
ran their own test to see ok how much
faster is it is it because technically
and they're saying oh we're gonna give
you 70 50 percent more juice early
testing shows it's a little faster but
it's not that fast if you can again you
do have to have charging mats
according to Apple that are partners
with them at that support this that are
kind of support their cheese standard
and basically apples flavor although see
how true that really is sometimes they
just like to say that just like you
shouldn't buy a third-party charging
cable but the Belkin and Mophie wireless
charging pads are the two that are
compatible with this right now again
this is in the eleven point two beta but
according to nine-to-five Mac after an
hour the seven point five watt charger
was only slightly ahead at the end of a
two hour period the iPhone 8 Plus that
they had on iOS 11 not 11.2 reached a
forty percent battery life while a same
phone running eleven point two using the
new seven point five speeds based on
software hit forty seven percent so it's
a little faster it's not like you're
getting 50 percent faster you're just
getting a little faster so faster is
better yeah no matter what it's better
or just directly plug that thing in a
USB C charger that you have to pay for
because Apple makes you want to buy it
and it cost you like 70 more bucks what
yeah you know you don't get you don't
get the fast USB C charging when you buy
your phone you got to pay for that
premium don't you love it
premium stuff right premium um if you're
wondering everyone is trying to come up
with a I phone killer if you're
wondering what the iPhone killer is it's
actually an iPhone okay
so what lets you know everyone is trying
to take down Apple and the funny thing
about the iPhone killer's actually an
iPhone so this is what we're talking
about the iPhone 10 has been obviously
very successful so successful that it's
coming at the expense of the iPhone 8
there were reports about that but
according to the latest analysts notes
Apple is expected to cut iPhone 8
production by 50 to 60 percent from
December to March because the demand is
just hardly there since all this demand
has shifted over to the iPhone 10 Wow
that's crazy
so the iPhone 10 it's kind of killing
the iPhone 8 so we have our first iPhone
killer the iPhone 10 so they're able to
measure that pretty quickly just yeah
just been like a couple months and
they're like whoa we need to slow down
on the eights you got to slow your roll
so based on inventory levels they can
they can adjust that pretty quickly so
that is what's going on with that I'm
gonna jump ahead to just some iPad news
we talked about how the iPad is expected
to get faced ID and it's also expected
to get kind of that slim almost bezel
list design right there's concept pieces
out there from Benjamin guessed skin
that just show off like there's gonna be
guess what if you don't want a bezel on
your other devices this is going to be
bezel this as well so the iPad pro 2018
model will get that all new design but
also it's expected to have a fast
octa-core an 8 core a 11 X Bionic chip
so there would be like the next
evolution of the chip that's inside the
iPhone which is already insanely and
ridiculously fast and hasn't even been
utilized to its full potential so the I
the iPad pro 2018 will get all kind of
basically get all the goodies that the
iPhone 10 has but on an iPad pro design
which is pretty cool and then it's gonna
make me want to buy one nice special
especial especially yeah well the bezel
is bezel this guy dude again this iPad
dude again for me
bezel is better this way
bezel especially bezel as presently
specialist unless better left to the
left
bezel s bezel especially present less
better less pitiless better okay
drop in the beatbox all right so we have
that iPad and then kind of the story
before we get to our calls that closes
things up the stories like it's funny to
me
Microsoft CEO was walking into in India
spotted two journalists with iPads and
he wasn't all that impressed now he did
say this lightheartedly for the record
but he told them cheerfully according to
the report you need to get a real
computer my friend that's like the
punchline Microsoft CEO walks into a bar
sees a couple iPad users tells them you
need to get a real computer my friend I
need a laugh track for that it's you he
was trying to be funny it's it's just
another CEO doing little digs doing
little digs but I will admit the surface
pro is not as easy to use but it's a
full-fledged computer compared to the
iPad pro I love my iPad pro but that
surface pro can do everything you want
to try that joke one more time
which one oh you want me to say okay so
like Sachin adela walks into like a
press room and he sees two reporters
with the iPads and what does he say to
them he says you need to get a real
computer my friend okay that wasn't the
one I was looking for
oh yeah that's not the one either anyway
I messed that up my bad I was like what
why is the devil laughing all of a
sudden oh wait this is what I was
looking for
okay that's better out of applause round
of applause all right should we get to
the the phone calls yeah thank you guys
all for calling we got a lot of good
calls this week and we got some bad
calls this week but we're gonna be yeah
we're gonna play them all we're gonna
play them all okay here I'm gonna tease
it again yeah before you play it I'm
just gonna tease it 1-866 two six three
eight that's how you call that's how
you're part of the show oh yeah okay
here comes number one
okay hey beat song it's Tyler from
Charlotte so my question is whether or
what you think about Samsung and Apple
as far as have they reached the ceiling
with innovation and technology in the
cell phones you know before I could see
where they were going but you know now I
still think they have a lot more room
for improvement now it's a wonder what
your thoughts were all right thank you
for a great day I think there is always
room for improvement I think that there
will always be something new that we
didn't even think about five years from
now that is just gonna hit just because
look as an actual functional device for
what we do every day you know you can
say that these products have plateaued I
don't if you're looking for something
game-changing from a phone I don't know
if we're gonna see it anytime soon is is
a are going to be that next
game-changing thing I think it's going
to change how we do things and maybe
look at information through our phones
see things as in a heads-up displays and
to me I've said it for a while I think
the next big thing is gonna be whatever
these whoever cracks the code for the
augmented reality glasses that will see
years down the road but from a phone
standpoint is innovations not dead I
look these can get a lot slimmer they
can get more responsive they can get
bigger they can get foldable 3d touch is
still severely underutilized which I've
said for years so I think and 3d touch
was something that came out of nowhere
no one expected 3d touch to happen so
unfortunately Apple hasn't utilized it
as well as I wish they did so I think
there's always gonna be innovations and
things that happen is it gonna transform
our lives like the first iPhone did no
because these are is
iterations on the device but there will
be another device that does that I would
say the most transformative device that
we've had so far in the past three years
has been the whole home smart speaker
personal assistant and there will be
something else after that so there's
always innovation my friend that's why
we love this yeah like we are kind of
stuck in this form factor of but just
the rectangular foam but that could
change you know and what the phones do
obviously so so cool all right let's go
to the next call here we go anyone has
seen the letter I in there emoji
keyboard so I'm seeing it when looking
my frequently used which is kind of
weird but uh yeah I just wanted to know
if anyone else in it thank I think he
needs to get iOS eleven point one point
one there is that isn't there's that
there's that like an old-school looking
eye that appears on there as well
Oh is there sometimes I've seen it but I
wouldn't freak out I mean just update
the phone mang doesn't want either it's
like it got moved to from the emoji for
you know from the regular keyboard to
the emoji keyboard yeah yes funny okay
next call what's up Steven Brian Garrett
from Phoenix Arizona I just got my hands
on the iPhone 10 and I absolutely love
it I think it's a remarkable phone with
this OLED and HDR display my only gripe
that I have though is the small
indicators over the top of the phone I
cannot stand that there's no battery
percentage or that let me know that I
bluetooth on I have to I have to go down
to notifications to get that kind of
information I can't stand it you think
there'll be an update that just lets you
customize what kind of indicators you
have up at the top of the phone thank
you guys love your show have a great day
fine wait did you say Apple and
customized let me get that last back
that's the devil laughs you know what
that this is one of my biggest
complaints why I feel like look you have
the notch make it a solid bar I put in
my review put the utilities right below
the bar and then give us the ability to
see all of them that's what I've been is
they could have easily fitted in there
they didn't do it and they haven't even
I even wish they could just change the
icon of the battery so that it's a
little bigger and then you could just
see in numbers inside of it just do
something to show us that give us that
option when you actually charge your
phone in on iOS 11 on the iPhone 10 for
those first few moments the actual
battery icon kind of grows for a second
and then it shrinks back down so why not
keep it a little larger put a little
give us the option to see a percentage
in there that's not that's not that hard
[Laughter]
so bad at you so bad at oh man
yeah so at Apple okay let's do the got
two more calls here we go
this one's real quick I think Beach Tom
quick question for you I'm interested in
maybe getting an Apple watch but I don't
like big watch bases and prefer the
smaller size is it like okay for guys to
wear the smaller one or is that really
just intended for a lady I mean oh okay
this is one of the best calls ever
because our friend calling in is been
keeping it real like that's like an
honest it's just so hilarious like yep I
would honestly say I've seen I put I
don't have the biggest wrists and that
doesn't correlate to any other parts of
my body let me let you all know that but
I don't have the biggest wrist and I
don't know why I'm like why do I even
have to bring that up I don't know why
cuz I know the comments I already know
what people are gonna say I think it's
it's not even as a dude I actually
prefer the larger watch yeah I just
think it look though and you know guess
what the easiest way to do it is try
them on the store if you like the
smaller watch then dude do it cuz ain't
no shame in my game I wear a lot of
things that people question like yeah I
would actually prefer the smaller one
cuz I don't know I might watch right now
is a little too big you know just feels
kind of clunky on my hand so I
I'd prefer the smaller one so you just
move faster and just feel like a little
more compact I don't know I would say I
mean I don't think I've said this in
this show specifically but the Apple
watch series 3 is an amazing device now
with watch OS 4 and the speed of it and
the LTE version I can do so many things
with it that make it actually a device
that again Apple's kind of started to
figure this out that stands on its own
oh I'm really enjoying my iPhone series
3 LTE I was not the biggest fan of the
Apple watch but once it gets to the
point where I'm like yes it's legit now
like absolutely I'm gonna be like
cheering about it and the Apple watch
series 3lt is worth like being like this
is it like if if you held out the past
two years this is the one I get for sure
for sure yeah you've been kind of
selling it to me on the last few show so
I'm gonna add that to my Santa Christmas
list it's only like a three nine 399 for
the LTE version I mean you do have to
pay two more bucks but dude I'm working
out and streaming like content like come
on that's on my wrist and then text
messaging and taking calls oh my god
it's like it's crazy it honestly is
pretty badass and I don't take a look
it's a firt it's like again you need to
be that person that wants to use it at
the gym like that or workout but if you
do it's awesome it's awesome cool first
world first world problems first world
we got one more call yeah we got one
more call he has a little gripe okay and
then he's also has a plug for himself so
we might stop it before the plug all
right we're gonna stop it
hey um Brian and Tom I called last week
because it was my birthday and I said
that one of my gifts was in Apple watch
TV without failures can I ask you if you
thought that over time we'll watch get
out dating and stuff for an update yeah
a little disappointed they did play my
call but hopefully we can play this week
and please follow me on Instagram yeah
you know what he called us did you hear
what he called this beach Brian and Tom
yeah Brian and Tommy clearly is a fan
hey Brian hey dawg
nice to meet you nice to meet you
sorry sorry we didn't play your birthday
call and your Instagram URL I think
we're good without it I think we're okay
but he did he got that he got the watch
and he wants to know if he'll be updated
eventually to include LTE I believe is
that I think that was his question uh
watch I'm not I'm getting confused by
what he was asking you mean I play it
one more time just the beginning oh my
god I called last week because it was my
birthday and I said that one of my gifts
was in Apple watch TV without failures
can I ask that over time we'll watch get
out dating reporting update yeah yeah I
think he wants to know it was without
cellular and then I think he wants to
know federal oh to be able to do that
with the speed of this watch this watch
is gonna at least last you two years and
it sounds like two years but yeah you
know most Apple devices the way that
they run the hardware and the software
together and they they say they optimize
it once your device is like after that
one year and a half two year window it
performs significantly less with the
latest software so you know if you get
to the two-year point I really do
recommend most people stick with the OS
that is on that phone instead of going
for the next one it it just i've we've
seen it enough times where just like for
example someone on an iPhone 6 and 6s I
oh s 10 works better on it than iOS 11
it's just the fact so that's my that's
that's my advice to you stay thirsty my
friends all right well that's it man all
right all right we are done so remember
again everybody be a part of the show we
want to hear from you I you know I think
more of you have started to get your
iPhone tenzin I want to hear what you
think of it just what you like and what
you don't and yeah maybe just one thing
you like and one thing you don't because
we want to get through all y'all call us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
