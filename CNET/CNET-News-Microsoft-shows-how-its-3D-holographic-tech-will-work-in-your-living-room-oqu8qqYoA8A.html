unveiling the windows holographic
platform focus on you the dreamers the
creators the windows developers so let's
get started by taking a tour of Windows
holographic now before we start let me
explain the setup a little bit
Darrin is wearing at hololens and he
sees this globe oh we showed you in
January ride in his world now we also
have this custom camera rig over here so
that you can see the Holograms up on
these screens as if the camera is
wearing a hololens now when we
introduced Windows holographic the globe
was just a slide today Darren is
experiencing it as a universal Windows
app and guess what it's running on
Windows 10 welcome to Windows
holographic this is life with Holograms
and as you can see Darren has customized
his space instead of digging through
menus everything is right where he wants
it yeah whether it's Microsoft edge
photos or video apps these are simply
Universal windows apps though we've
placed as Holograms so whether it's a
slate on the wall or something a little
bit more dimensional like my loyal
companion Fang here hey buddy you can
customize your space the way you want it
now I want to add something to my space
so I'm going to pull up my holographic
Start menu and I'm going to open up
Skype I'm the worst at keeping in touch
so I'm going to take the people that
matter most to me and I'm going to pin
them to this wall right here that way
every time I walk into this room
I'll see their smiling faces and be
inspired to reach out to them we're all
creatures of habit and we do different
things in different spaces in our homes
this stage as an example is modeled
after Darren's apartment yeah and this
is where I'd hang out in my apartment
and surround myself with the
applications that I want to axe
yes or or just check out for example I'm
planning a trip to Hawaii in a couple
weeks so I placed this awesome weather
app over here so when I'm moving around
I can easily glance at at reference it
and understand what the weather's going
to be like when I get there
hopefully still hot then if I look up
here on the wall to my left I've got a
video player I simply reach out err tap
and I'm right in the action know what if
Darren has things to do around the house
he shouldn't get confined to watching
just on one wall you should be able to
take his entertainment with him anywhere
and remain hands-free as he does it yeah
so all I need to say is follow me now
wherever I go in my house my
entertainment tags along
all right and where it gets where I'm
going I simply place it and I can scale
it as big as I want now that's not
something just a video player does every
single Universal windows apps has the
same capabilities for example I placed a
calendar over here because as Alex will
tell you I'm late for pretty much every
meeting so this makes it a guy like me
makes a lot easier for me to just check
in and see what I've got coming up next
we're discovering uses for Holograms
every day we know with all you hear at
Bill putting your minds towards it we're
going to be discovering new uses every
second I hope you have a news Farr
anytime it build will see you out there
Thank You Darren</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
