15 seconds that is configured to light
then nine eight seven six
my record
launching flight operations
as you just saw Falcon 9 has
successfully cleared the pad and is now
on its ascent with a test spacecraft and
it's bearing
now coming up here shortly you're going
to hear three big events happening in
rapid succession the first is Miko that
stands for main engine cutoff that is
where all nine of the first agencies are
going to shut down that's in preparation
for the next step which is stage set for
stage separation later stage one will
separate from stage to stage one will
make its way back down to the drone ship
stage two will continue on with tests to
its orbit and then you're going to hear
second engine start that is the ignition
of the second stage engine
we go
wait and as you just saw we had a
successful stage separation and in
successful ignition of that second stage
engine as you heard stage one is
transonic we're about ten seconds away
from that landing landing burn note that
the drone ship is situated approximately
300 kilometers off the coast of Florida
and you can see that when e1 started
let's see if we can catch it
in the video
we landed on of course I still love you
this marks the 24th successful landing
of a falcon 9 first stage
we'll be getting acquisition of signal
as we pass over a ground station here
shortly and ideally we're on the screen
and there we go
and just under a minute here we'll be
seeing the spacecraft separate from
Falcon 9
that beautiful image of the earth behind
us there
it's one of the planets test is going to
look at in its lifetime and as you can
see there we have had successful
separation of the test spacecraft and
it's going on on its beautiful mission
to look at thousands of planets outside
of our solar system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
