report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week the
mystery missile that wasn't big bonuses
at Google and accidental international
incidents but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
Samsung continuum it's the latest
samsung galaxy s phone and it does a
neat little trick it has two displays
one is a nice big 4.3 inch Super AMOLED
display and the other is a little 1.8
inch ticker at the bottom which can show
you a customized stream of real time
information like news sports weather
Twitter and Facebook updates plus it can
be a mobile hotspot for up to five
devices there's a 5-megapixel camera one
gigahertz processor on the other hand it
will be preloaded with Bing and bings
maps and verizon's crap we're out the
wazoo when it hits stores November
eighteenth so buyer beware and now for
the news google is reportedly giving
every single employee a
one-thousand-dollar bonus and a
10-percent race now this follows earlier
reports that Google was handing out huge
cash counter offers to keep employees
from leaving for facebook so either
Google is a really really super awesome
place to work or it's an increasingly
terrible place to work and they're
trying to beg people to stay with cold
hard cash instead of actual efforts to
boost morale I'm not really sure which
one's true but I went ahead and
submitted my resume just in case
investigative journalism microsoft
launched windows phone 7 this week with
the not really like a bang more like a
quiet hum early reports said first-day
sales were probably around 40,000 units
although that may have been the result
of supply shortages in some places
either way Microsoft is planning on
playing a long game with Windows Phone 7
hey oh may be part of their strategy is
to let Verizon ruin perfectly good
android phones with Bing and tons of
other crap where and then drive them
into the arms of windows phone 7 instead
devious oh alright cheap shot at Bing
let's give Google a turn apparently an
error in Google Maps cause Nicaraguan
troops to accidentally invade Costa Rica
I could tell you what happened but
in this case I think I prefer dramatic
reenactments ah bienvenidas are costa
rica costa rica what are you talking
about you need to clear out doesn't make
a wrong go man no that's Nicaragua this
is Costa Rica I know this is Nicaragua
look can't you see I got eco-tourists
behind me that's Costa Rica can't you
see my google map it says this is
Nicaragua you get out of here look at
the sign says no no you get out I go you
go you go I'm not going come on yeah
oops also a potential oops this supposed
missile launch off the coast of
California this week a CBS news
helicopter captured images that look a
lot like a vertical contrail potentially
from a missile launch now some experts
said it could be from a plane a former
NATO ambassador said it could be in
underwater ICBM shot off as a show of
force to Asia while Obama's in Indonesia
the Pentagon said it couldn't figure out
what was going on at all and the Federal
Aviation Administration didn't have any
answers either the Defense Department
then went on to suggest that maybe it
was just an optical illusion really this
is the competence level of the United
States government no one can tell you
what that thing in the sky was so they
start suggesting that maybe it was never
there at all no no no my guess it's
totally the Nicaraguans damn you google
maps okay let's pacify the masses with a
little clogging the tubes shall we
internet memes collide with the kitty
that says um nome no check it out
see missile what missile and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching
