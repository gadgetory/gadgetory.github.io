appliances and this is a review of the
ball fresh tech automatic home canning
system this handy little appliance sells
for 299 dollars it is designed for folks
who want to use the water bath canning
method that really works best for foods
that are higher in acidity so that will
kind of limit what you're able to make
with this gadget a recipe book does come
with this though and it has quite a few
options for things you can make
I wouldn't recommend this for expert
Kanner's because you can't deviate from
the recipes very much if you do you can
risk your health this is probably gonna
be best for novices or anyone that's
looking to kind of stick with the basic
recipes apart from that though I think
it's a great little appliance it's cute
it's not too big it won't take up too
much space on your counter but it's big
enough to fit pretty nice sized batches
for each recipe I had never canned
anything in my life but I was able to
make strawberry jam apple sauce and
salsa all in one day and it was really
easy and I had fun doing it there is
still a lot of prep work but I actually
do think it cuts down on time because
you won't have to stand over a stove you
don't have to watch it every second it
really takes care of everything it
factors in altitude the time and the
temperature based on the recipe that you
select i canned nearly a dozen cans and
only one of them didn't seal properly so
I think that's pretty good
for a first-timer thanks for watching
