upgraded to the latest iOS 4 but if you
aren't really happy because your phone
seems more sluggish or you aren't
getting the benefit of multitasking
anyways you probably wish you could go
back I'm Brian Chong from C Netcom and
I'll show you how to downgrade your
iPhone 3G back to iPhone OS 3.1.3 now
big thanks to life hacker for showing me
how to complete the downgrade process
this method has worked consistently for
iPhone 3G users but as always proceed
with caution now to get started
we'll need to have a few things in place
first up get the restore file for the
iPhone OS 3.13
now it still might be on your computer's
hard drive from previous updates so on a
Mac look for it here and for Windows
users you can find it at this location
on your hard drive if you can't find it
head on over to I clarified website
where all the software updates have been
archived and look for this specific file
you'll need one more piece of software
called wreck boot it's mac and windows
compatible and you can download it from
this location it's a utility that will
help us finish the downgrade process
alright let's get to it the first thing
you want to do is connect your phone to
your computer and then power it down by
holding the power sleep button and
sliding to power off once it's off hold
the power button and the home button
together for 10 seconds then remove just
your finger from the power button and
remain holding down just the home button
for 10 more seconds this will put the
phone into device firmware update mode
now if you did it correctly iTunes will
show a prompt that it sees a phone in
recovery mode and you can press ok
you'll see your phone in the devices
sidebar in itunes and make sure you
click on it then to initiate the
downgrade process on a Mac hold the
option key on your keyboard and press
the restore button with your mouse from
Windows users hold down the shift button
while you click restore now you'll have
to locate the iPhone OS 3.13 firmware
file and select it as the one you want
to restore your phone with the restore
process will start and it takes about
ten minutes once it's done you'll
probably see an error message like this
one and your phone will show a connect
to itunes screen but don't worry guys
this is totally normal now open up the
wreck boot app we downloaded and click
exit
recovery mode you're gonna want to wait
a few seconds and your phone will then
get out of recovery mode and will now be
ready to sync with iTunes with the
previous iPhone OS 3.13 installed now I
want to emphasize this is specifically
for the iPhone 3G this does not involve
any jailbreaking
and you might have different results but
this worked for us but that's how you
downgrade your iPhone 3G from iOS 4 to
oh s 3.13 use it wisely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
