find even more uses for ipad to use it
in places they never imagined in manners
they never have before I think we can
tell by your excitement you know what
this is this is ipad mini and what can
you do with an ipad mini that you can't
already do with the amazing
fourth-generation ipad well this you can
hold it in one hand now this just isn't
a shrunken down ipad it's an entirely
new design with a beautiful aluminum and
glass enclosure where every detail is
finely crafted in may just exquisite and
the process by which they're
manufactured or at a level of tarts is
unseen in our industry there is nothing
as amazing as this this incredibly thin
and beautiful iPad Mini beautiful from
every angle incredibly thin and light
we'd like to see one in person this is
iPad
self in that is amazing here let me tell
you a lot more about it so this iPad
Mini is just 7.2 millimeters thin that's
about a quarter thinner than the
fourth-generation iPad put in context
it's as thin as a pencil that's there it
weighs just point six eight pounds
that's over fifty percent lighter than
the previous ipad 4th generation so in
context what can you compare that to
it's as light as a pad of paper we were
going to say a book but books are much
heavier so we came out with a pad of
paper comes in black and white the white
with silver the black with a slate back
it's beautiful on both sides I think one
of the biggest questions people wonder
is what screen size that we pick and why
and the team worked really hard thinking
about this we want an ipad that's
capable of running all that amazing
software written for ipad thought
developers having to do any work we
wanted to be smaller such that it could
be thinner and lighter as you can see
but not so small that it stops being
incredibly usable because the ipad is
the most usable of all these devices so
let's look at it side-by-side here's
current ipad 2 next to the ipad mini the
ipad 2 is nine point seven inches on the
diagonal ipad mini 7.9 so that's easy to
remember right 9.7 7.9
and the pixels are even easier to
remember because they're exactly the
same the original iPad the iPad 2 are
1024 x 768 a new iPad Mini is 1024 x 768
that means all of the software created
for iPad all works on the ipad mini
unchanged and it's great to use in both
the portrait and landscape position
which our customers love to use it in
both manners so it's great for reading
your email and responding to your email
and surfing the web it's great for
managing all your photos and sharing
them with friends and family it's
fantastic for kicking back and reading a
magazine or a book on it is amazing to
sit there and hold it and do a facetime
HD phone call and something so thin in
life it's great for all of your I work
applications keynote Pages Numbers it's
fantastic for all the ilife applications
iPhoto iMovie GarageBand I mean it is so
much fun to sit there and play multi
touch software instruments in garage
band on this thin and light ipad and all
of those applications work wonderfully
on it so if you're a customer who likes
to use facebook all day long you're
going to love using facebook on the new
ipad if you love creating content with
applications like paper an amazing
drawing application and love doing that
on ipad mini if you love playing games
playing incredibly amazing games like
real racing 2 are incredible on the new
ipad in fact i could sit there here and
do 275,000 examples for you and i would
love to but we don't have enough time
they work amazing on ipad mini no one
else can say that with their tablets in
fact others have tried to make tablets
small on the ipad and they failed
miserably these are not great
experiences well why let me give you an
example so here we have ipad mini on the
right and an android tablet on the left
this is the latest greatest most favored
reviewed new device so let's compare
them well first let's just look at the
bezels around the display ours the iPad
Mini is made of
aluminum we've worked hard to make it
thin so it's comfortable to hold the
news with one hand there's made of
plastic it's thicker in fact the entire
product that Android product is thicker
and heavier than ipad mini even though
it has a smaller display so let's look
at those displays on the diagonal
there's a seven inches the iPad Mini is
7.9 that doesn't sound like a lot more
does it well that's on a diagonal the
actual area of the display 21.9 square
inches for the android tablet 29.6 for
the ipad mini the ipad mini is actually
over a third larger display area thirty
five percent that's a huge difference
and it doesn't stop there what's the
number one thing people do on their
iPads surf the web we love to surf the
web on our iPads so here's surfing the
web this is a popular museum the
Guggenheim Museum and visiting it in
both browsers but you can see there's
things around the browser there's tabs
android has some software controls in
the bottom of the display so let's
remove all that noise and just look at
the web pages you can see a huge
difference the ipad mini it's about
fifty percent larger for surfing the web
holding your portrait orientation that
is a gigantic difference if the ipad
mini is thinner and lighter i said many
customers also like to use it in the
landscape orientation so let's turn them
sideways so remove all the noise or on
it here's your web pages the ipad mini
is two-thirds larger to surf the web
there is a gigantic difference in these
products and it doesn't stop there
there's all those third-party
applications as Tim told you we have
these amazing applications for iPad
users we've learned we have over 700,000
applications that can run an iPad but
customers love the ones written for iPad
designed for that screen over 275,000 of
them what does the other platform have
they have phone applications stretched
up not tablet applications so for
example if you like to hang with your
friends and yell you get a great
experience on ipad mini you get a
scaled-up phone experience on that other
product
is a big difference if you like to shop
on ebay a huge difference between what
you can do on an ipad on these other
products like to listen to music and
pandora the difference is a night and
day like to go search for videos to
watch in vimeo a great experience not
great experience like to plan your trip
on tripadvisor an incredible experience
and ipad mini well you know right so you
go on and on
let's talk a little bit more about
what's inside ipad mini it is a great
ipad in fact the technologies inside are
equal to or better than the ipad 2 in
every way there's an amazing set of
technology that make this just in a
great ipad first there's an apple a5
chip a dual-core a5 chip that has more
than a power to drive this incredible
mini display and give you great
performance for all your applications
and games it has a FaceTime camera now
better than what we had an ipad 2 a
facetime HD front side camera and even
bigger difference on the camera on the
back side a 5-megapixel isight camera so
you can take beautiful 5 megapixel
photos or 1080p HD video that's far in
advance what we had on ipad to the
wireless has advanced greatly to it has
the same LTE capabilities that you see
in our new fourth-generation ipad LTE
wireless we have the faster Wi-Fi as
well 802 11 ABG n and n at 2.4 and 5
gigahertz for twice as fast Wi-Fi we
felt in that lightning connector so it's
compatible with the accessories being
created for iphone 5 the fourth
generation ipad ipod touch and ipod nano
and all of this technology all this
incredible capability in such a thin and
light device the team has worked really
hard to get you the same battery life 10
hours of battery life just like the
fourth-generation iPad so hopefully iPad
Mini is every inch and iPad as you saw
it comes with a great line of
accessories including these optional
smart covers that come in blue green
pink light gray dark gray and even a
great product red one as well they're
smart so they work with the software
intelligently and they're great to use
in every angle they really complement
this incredible new iPad Mini the ipad
mini starts with a full 16 gigabytes of
memory and the Wi-Fi configuration we
priced at 329
horse
that is the lowest price yet for an iPad
helping us to reach even more customers
so this is the ipad lineup I've had many
it starts at 329 ipad 2 or 3 99 ipad 4th
generation with the retina display at
499 of course there are many
configurations of memory you can choose
from so there those are the Wi-Fi
configurations and then of course
cellular configurations so there's
something in a wide range of price for
everyone in each most amazing best iPad
or tablet device that anyone anyone is
offered now if you want to get your
hands on one how are you going to do
that well both ipad mini and the
fourth-generation ipad be able to start
