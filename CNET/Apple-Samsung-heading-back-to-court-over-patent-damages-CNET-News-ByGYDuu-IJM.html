Samsung are heading back to court again
over patent damages and yes this is the
same lawsuit that has been stretching on
since 2012 when Samsung was ordered to
pay Apple for infringing three phone
design patents while drama was around
how Galaxy phones looked like iPhones
with their rounded corners and colorful
grid of app icons back in 2012 samsung
was originally ordered to pay Apple more
than 1 billion dollars but that amount
has been whittled down over the years as
Samsung's lawyers continue to fight over
how much is spare to pay the issue went
to the Supreme Court last year and in a
victory for Samsung the court said the
cost of damages could be based on just
the part of the device that infringed a
patent not necessarily based on the
total profits made from an entire phone
so now a u.s. district judge in
California issued an order to have a new
trial to recalculate how much Samsung
should pay Apple for copying the look of
the iPhone the big question of course is
I can calculate a percentage of the
profits made from just a few pieces of a
phone's design Apple and Samsung have
until Wednesday to set a new date for
the trial I'm Bridget Carey for more
