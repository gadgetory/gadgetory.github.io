playing metal gear solid 5 the phantom
pain it is the first game in the series
to go into a massive open world rather
than small little contained levels and
that totally changes the way the game
plays so I've been playing this iOS game
called prune and it's about sort of
growing a bonsai tree and slicing it so
that it can grow and gain power from the
Sun to grow a collar so all week I've
been playing until dawn just this creepy
horror adventure game about a group of
kids in a cabin or being stalked by
someone and people are getting picked
off one by one this week I'm playing a
game called universe sandbox too and it
lets you play around with all the
planets in the solar system or other
planets and you can sort of play around
with the gravitational forces and it's
also got a lot of great cutscenes that
seem to have been born from kojima's
love a film and he's adopted a lot of
those techniques that we see in modern
cinema and apply those to the game and
just an excellent experience and I gave
it a 10 because I think it's a game
every
if you're like me and just like to watch
you know planets explode and stuff it's
kind of soothing in this weird relaxing
end of the universe sort of way so go
check it out so the choices that you
make dynamically change the way the game
is played so for example maybe if you
snoop in someone's bag or if you hit a
bird with a snowball it can actually
change the course of events that lead to
a different character either dying or
living I've been trying to kill as many
as possible because I think that's the
way horror games are meant to be played
and it's just a very calming kind of Zen
experience it's nice to be able to play
something that is just like meditative
and very soothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
