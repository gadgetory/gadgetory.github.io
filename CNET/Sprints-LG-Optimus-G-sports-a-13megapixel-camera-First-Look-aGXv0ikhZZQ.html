here with the LG optimus G for sprint
now if you think you're seeing deja vu
don't worry we already took a look at
the AT&amp;amp;T version of the Optimus G before
both models have a lot of the same key
features like the Zippy Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core CPU which
makes gameplay a breeze and general
phone usage a snap they also have the
same thin 4.7 inch true HD IPS touch
screen that displays vivid colors crisp
text and bright images other
similarities include the gorilla glass 2
point 0 back panels NFC capabilities
quickmemo a 2.1 ampere hour battery and
the Android for pointing system overlaid
with LG's own Optimus three point 0 user
interface however what sets the sprint
version apart is its eyebrow-raising 13
megapixel camera which you can see is
physically different too and while we
did notice a slight difference in how
much information was gathered when the
photos were zoomed in and how much light
was captured the biggest disparity we
saw was in the colors and white balance
photos on the AT&amp;amp;T model had more Pop
and were more saturated while Sprint's
camera captures colors that were more
true-to-life other differences include a
few software features like Sprint ID the
lack of a microSD card slot and inherit
Network differences like a less robust
4G LTE network ultimately though it's up
to you to decide what carrier is best if
you're considering the Optimus G if you
live in an area where Sprint's 4G LTE
network is better than 18 TS or vice
versa then that's something to consider
another thing to keep in mind is that
even though Sprint's camera has more
megapixels the device is going to have
the same one 9999 price tag as the 18
tiver ssion and both are being offered
in early November again I'm Lynn and
this has been Sprint's quad-core LG
optimus G
