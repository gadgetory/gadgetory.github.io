this is the new controller for wii u
it's different from anything you've
played before to begin explaining let's
take a little quick peek at wii u in
action
up until now on console game have to
occupy the TV screen in order to be
played but the new controller for wii u
with 6.2 inch screen built-in means you
won't need to give up your game play
when someone else comes into the room
and wants to watch a TV program of
course it's backward compatible so only
games wii remote controllers and other
accessories such as the wii balance
board can be used for example to weigh
yourself with with it there is no need
to use the big screen TV it includes two
analog circuit pads a plus control pad
as well as both dl and the out buttons
and the addition of LM our products also
it enables the rambo future but that's
not all the wii u controller also
includes a touchscreen a microphone
speakers and accelerometers a gyroscope
and an inward facing camera the images
displayed on the new controller are
generated only by wheel their eyes
wirelessly transmitted without latency
issues you can play in a number of ways
connect with an HDTV in the traditional
way and you can enjoy the most
up-to-date high quality HD images even
without using the screen in your hands
or you can place the new controller by
itself
on a table and play without the need for
a TV at all or games can be structure to
use to screen at the same time the
example you saw on the video area such a
playing baseball golf using the new
Zappa are only a few of the
possibilities we decided on this new
structure for Wii U because we want to
create a strong bond between games your
TV and the Internet this can include web
browsing using the big screen for
sharing the photos or videos you found
online or in joining video chat on the
Wii U controller even while watching a
TV program it's a new structure for home
entertainment
