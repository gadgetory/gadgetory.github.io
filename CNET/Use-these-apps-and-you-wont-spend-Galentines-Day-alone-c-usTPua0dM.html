is a holiday its galentine's day a day
for women to celebrate their gal pals
born out of NBC comedy Parks and
Recreation February 13th my lady friends
and I leave her husband's and her
boyfriends at home and we just come and
kick it breakfast style but if your girl
gang is a little meager these days you
can find new friends the way that you
might also find a date by using an app
we're both big readers we both have some
interest in spirituality yeah she was
just weird in all the ways that I'm
married so perfect
Rachel and Natalie met with the help of
hey Venus an app just for women looking
for female friends people make profiles
and swipe left or right depending on if
they want to meet up or not and if they
match they can message each other
I built this app because I found it so
challenging when I moved to San
Francisco to meet other women like me
founder Olivia June created Vina
after realizing dating app seemed to be
better at predicting compatibility than
romantic chemistry and if you're only
looking for friendship that's really all
you need I would try so many things from
volunteering to going to events but it
was really hard to find my people some
people are really lucky and the first
person that they match with it actually
can become their best friend and
sometimes it's like dating where you
don't click with every person that you
meet right away
there's also bumble BFF which is a
feature of dating app bumble in much the
same way instead of looking for a date
you're looking for female friends and if
swiping isn't your style
there's present an app for building and
joining all women groups called circles
for both career and social interests so
lhomme and Vanessa met there she was
posting all sorts of good content and I
thought wow you know she seems
interesting
probably creeped her on other social
media for her and the direct messaged we
think that it's important to get to know
each other through conversation and
common interests in a group setting
that's more natural way of connecting
with people versus swiping on profiles
or doing a more one
one chat no matter how you meet at
founders say it's important to meet in
person Rachel and Natalie went to a yoga
class and grabbed the food after we got
the milkshakes and we were just talking
and she just laughed at my stupidity you
know didn't judge me for it and I was
like this is gonna work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
