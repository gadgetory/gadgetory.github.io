hyundai ladder competing with the Honda
Fit Ford Fiestas Toyota Yaris Nissan
Versa not an easy room so is this where
Hyundai's recent ascendancy is going to
flatten out let's drive the 2012 Hyundai
Accent se and check the tech used to be
you drove a car like an accent because
you arrived here coming off a pricey
degree program a personal bankruptcy or
a nasty divorce but this kind of car has
moved from the must drive to the must
drive category but along the road to
becoming a nice car the accent also
picked up a nasty habit 3400 of them in
fact added to the MSRP it has to earn
that
okay now Hyundai Accent has the accent
on the word simple which isn't in the
name but it should be because there's
not a lot in this car not a lot of you
can get here is the head unit we're in
an SC so we have a fairly good array of
sources first of all that little screen
which if obviously is monochrome is also
non touch your controller interface is
this knob here you rotate and push to
select it's just that simple now the
stuff you control with that is pretty
simple you've got your optical slot up
here your CD AM and FM radio no HD radio
on this guy satellite radio is XM
although nowadays that Sirius XM but
unday still calls it XM under CD aux
you've got a couple of choices you've
got the CD Drive I just showed you and
the aux jack is this one down here which
is the classic Hyundai Kia where you've
got an aux the USB and combined together
with their cable it also becomes an iPod
jack and with my ipod touch plugged in
let's see how the interface works it's a
little spare a little compact nice quick
response by the way as I go through
tracks I don't lose it it stays right
with me these are little things you live
with everyday in a basic car that'll
drive you nuts if they don't work and
they basically work here the audio
system sounds like crap it doesn't sound
good you're going to want to go and do a
little bit of upgrading on this vehicle
and you buy it get some better speakers
go to Crutchfield or somewhere and find
some better add-on amps or processors to
bring this up keep the head unit it's
fine but do something
better on the output side would be my
advice that won't cost you much we do
not have bluetooth a2dp stereo streaming
here not on the accent this is the
bottom car they got to save something
for the better rides we do have power
base though which just kind of sounds
badly thunderous not elegant I left it
off speaking of interface we do have
steering wheel controls I believe that's
an SE trim thing so you've got your
volume and media controls for mode seek
track up and down your cruise control
here on the right your voice command
that is for the phone system only not
for driving media or navigation since
there isn't any and then your hands-free
buttons are over here as I mentioned no
navigation I mean no navigation you
can't option it if you want option
navigation on this it's going to involve
a suction cup or it's going to involve
juggling your smartphone that's how you
option navigation in an accident over
all the materials on this car are good
kind of a rubbery hard plastic there a
different hard plastic over here good
stuff on the wheel nothing smells stinky
which I can't say about all cars that
are inexpensive no leather available in
this car which is just fine by me
oh and above the seats no moonroof not
even optional that's unusual especially
in the high trim model which this is on
the accent line but no matter what you
do it's always a 10 top now our gear
shift here as you can see is a manual
6-speed this is your stock gearbox on an
accent spend a thousand more and you get
a six-speed automatic which in my
experience is going to be a
well-functioning gearbox that also
brings in some new logic what they call
active eco so the car can then take part
in making you drive as less of a lead
foot but obviously with a manual there's
kind of no place for that logic so that
feature doesn't get rolled in with this
transmission this to accent for 2012 is
dramatically better looking than the
little dough ball that replaces
and more than one person walked up to me
and said oh so that's the new Ford whew
no it's a Hyundai for what it's worth
Ford got there first if you're wondering
who inspired whom I know the engine this
guy is nothing too remarkable but kind
of high powered or its class in line for
1.6 liter front-wheel drive sitting
sidesaddle you've seen it a thousand
times before 138 horsepower 123
foot-pounds of torque that's kind of on
the burly side for this classic cars
zero to 60 is about in the low 90s right
around there while delivering 30/40 MPG
now note that the next car up the
Hyundai Elantra which is substantially
nicer than this one also gets 3040 so
you're not buying this car to get the
better mpg in the line you're buying it
to get the lower MSRP oh it is direct
injection which is kind of impressive
for a low cost car with a low
displacement engine
now the accent is a simple car in its
underpinnings its power plants its
everything well this car has to do is be
civilized and it's a win in this price
class and it's more than that it's
actually quite smooth
there's no nasty engine vibration which
is more than I can say for some other
cars in its class where you feel the
engine gnashing its teeth when you step
on it to merge or pass the handling
swallowing most importantly this car
does the everyday stuff right it's as
responsive as it can be for the limited
amount of power it has it's smooth and
non fatiguing and doesn't feel like it's
going to be coming apart ok this price
fits 2012 Hyundai Accent now the accents
on cheap 16 5 for this guy delivered and
this is the top trim the SE you still
got the GS below this and the GLS below
that the GLS by the way only available
as an ungainly looking sedan yeah
doesn't work for me this and the model
below it are only available as
hatchbacks now your options on this se
are pretty simple thousand bucks for the
automatic with that eco drive mode take
it or leave it
and 35 bucks for an iPod cable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
