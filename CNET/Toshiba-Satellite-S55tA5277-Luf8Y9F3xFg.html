a look at the toshiba satellite s 55 t
this laptop here comes so close to
something I've been looking for for a
long time that it's really frustrating
that it misses it on just one or two
points let me explain if you want a
laptop that can play games usually I
have to get a big bulky desktop
replacement or you have to make do it
with very simple games you can play on a
smaller laptop very few people make a
reasonably slimmest mid sized mid-price
laptop that has a discrete graphics card
and a touchscreen you very very very
rarely see a graphic card and a
touchscreen in the same system even in
the Windows 8 era so right here we have
got for $9.99 an Intel Core i7 CPU one
of the new generation of Haswell CPUs so
that's great you've got an NVIDIA
GeForce 740 and graphics card which is
pretty good especially for a smaller
laptop you got a lot of RAM we got a big
1 terabyte hard drive and of course you
have a touchscreen so you have pretty
much everything I'm looking for here's
where we go off the rails a little bit
the screen here even though it's a
pretty big 15.6 inch screen only has a
1366 by 768 native resolution that's
usually what you'll find a much smaller
11 inch or maybe 13 inch laptops and
even then only on the more budget side
to get right around $1000 and ask people
to settle for that lower screen
resolution I don't think it's really
gonna work out for a lot of people
especially if you're using the high end
CPU and the mid-range GPU to play games
then you're restricted to paying it on
this low resolution screen that's a
little bit of a deal killer if you're
interested in PC games I thought the
problem a little bit by outputting via
the HDMI plug in here to a bigger
display that was a full 1920 by 1080
display and I could play some games that
way but as a portable gaming or even a
multimedia system because it's not even
full 1080 P HP HD you know this is a
case where you have great components a
reasonable body it reasonable price but
one thing that screen is really holding
it back I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the
