at CES 2014 where Samsung stands taking
a look at this
it's the WB 2200 F camera and it has two
counts of two hand grips this camera has
a 60 times optical zoom for capturing
those really far-off subjects it's got a
16 megapixel sensor and it's got a built
in flash as well those things are
interesting but they're not the most
interesting thing about the camera
obviously that's the dual handle control
now that means you can hold it like
normal to take landscape photos or you
can flip it on its side and hold it like
this which is good for taking portraits
Samsung is even thought to add an extra
zoom control and an extra wheel on here
so that when you're taking those
portrait photos you don't have to reach
around the camera to get to those
controls now you're probably thinking
hang on when I hold it in landscape mode
aren't I going to accidentally start
zooming in using the other control when
my pinky finger touches it by mistake
but don't worry because there's a lock
down here to stop that happening
it's got NFC and Wi-Fi direct powers and
you can use samsung's Smart camera app
which is available on iOS and Android to
turn your phone or tablet into a remote
viewfinder expect to see it on sale
within the next few months there's no
word on pricing yet though in the
meantime why don't you let me know what
you think of the to handle system on the
Westway for CNET's here at CES 2014 go
to CES or cnet.com for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
