it's Friday februari 26 it's time for
the 404 show I am Jeff Bakalar I'm Russ
fresh there you certain is that what
we're doing now I don't know what I
don't know if you were to certain about
that well we don't generally like a
formal introduction we don't either of
us know we don't know you don't know you
just when I'm here we're changing things
though usually we do it at the end so we
are changing it up just for you Steve
they were changing things up because
we're in the presence of greatness mr.
Steve Guttenberg hey AKA spear yes
what's up man I'm here thank you some
comes in today he goes up to me and he
goes Jeff how many how many days old do
you think I am and I did like quick math
in my head and I said like 18,000 and he
goes no no I'm what 24,000 actually
24,000 90 well in may actually being
there a couple of hundred something like
that so then my other thing is like
whatever who cares right like what do
you do with that if it was yes i can add
62 times 365 that's how that works yeah
so why are you so fascinated with that
it's just interesting it's like another
day another day this is the is the best
one you know is the best one yet
potentially a really good one whoa yeah
I know certain things happen to that I
can't discuss right now all right so 24
thousand days and change how many of
those days have been like good ones I
can carry on one hand no I would just
say good versus bad makeup i nary oh oh
what's the breakdown well how do you
define good that's your definition my
definition yeah a good day is one where
I'm not bored where I'm not in emotional
physical or mental pain or um and I'm
I'm busy and how we don't like not like
what percentage of those days are good
days of my whole life yeah I'd say maybe
a quarter that's a drag yeah that's like
25 percent your daddy I want to it or
very jewy perspective I'd like every
week that goes by you get like a day and
a half a good address and and for this
week this will be the day although it's
possible his standards are too high yeah
me that's what it is maybe the bars say
a little too high for your nebbish
sensibilities I remember thinking in my
first marriage you know like how many
days were good versus how many days were
bad wait so does the first marriage mean
like all those days were been a lot of
lunia not he started out really good
yeah and we met as those were like you
know when I % how many years before when
it started to shift I'd say two years in
okay was it was definitely in the
negative okay overwhelmingly negative
that's uh that's a drag that's a bummer
I'm sorry we've got things off to say
anyway but we wait dark so dark I'll do
a Segway okay I do a Segway sure by all
means the best thing that came out of
being married the first time yeah was
that I became a movie theater
projections okay so there you go I
wouldn't have done it if I wasn't
married just worked out though is it
just because you were she banging we
were both projections Oh team projection
is that the same did you meet it the
convention I got imagine there is one
there might just be like meeting I'm
sure that don't you have meetings yes
yeah I got union meeting what are those
months about yelling like everything in
focusing news guys that was a common
phrase use guys and now it's just an
empty room no it's and it's only digital
now right well they're dying breed just
computers facing each other it's it's
just a bunch of robots talking to each
other uh so so that if you're 24,000
that means Russ and I are roughly 12
yeah that's pretty good pretty good can
daddy up yeah yes that's depressing yeah
it's like Groundhog Day do you ever
think like is it like the same day over
and over sometimes nope i have a pretty
firm grasp on reality see woody want
firm grass I think so if I can't like
guess what's gonna happen it's probably
a different day right yeah I can't go
like birds like literally little dog no
it's not literally like round talk oh
it's not literally but it's a question
when you're not doing the show cuz you
know that today is februari 26 but are
there many days where you don't actually
know the date no I have a no that's a
reasonable question I
I think not for people in New York I
think of people in New York there's so
much structure and calendar based sort
of like day-to-day stuff for me
personally I have like a tiny
fascination with like the day and date
and calendars okay that so for me
personally I always kind of know what
day really like when you're on vacation
you would know if it's thursday or
wednesday i would but i would like maybe
lose the number you know i would know
the name of the day of the week but i
would lose like is this the 23rd of the
22nd I I that I know for sure I fast but
that was very rarely am I like yeah what
day is it is it to use that is I don't
go like is it feels like that that's
because you're working but if we're
you're not because things would have to
be there or not be there right like my
my retired in laws don't know where or
when because the second you lose that
day-to-day structure yeah it all just
fall doesn't matter it falls apart cuz
it doesn't matter cuz what's difference
between Sunday and Tuesday survivor on
tonight yeah but you I was gonna say
taped it people still say tape that is
so weird I say to an ipod kiss is kind
of weird to write this like odds yeah a
little bit what is a pod I was ipod I
know right its but more but now it's
kind of irrelevant right but whatever
you call then what would you call them
have a cast fine yours your objective
for the rest of the show is to invent a
better word drk DRP digital radio
program wha DRP ain't bad DRP is right
I'm into it okay how can i make money on
I just you know I can't that I 21st
century I want to know but I really
think I kind of always have hated the
word podcast yeah I think there's this
inherent stigma attached to it yeah it's
yeah it's just the same it's just it's a
disposition is not as weird actually
ipod was not attractive I meant when I
said that's terrible yeah pont de board
pod you guys are idiots clearly they
knew what they were doing marketing wise
they were okay well you're saying it now
but it was all in 2007 sold massively in
2007 to that product did not live or die
by the name no not an issue though not
initially it didn't sell well now they
have a whole brand with the eyes they do
but they got rid of the pod that's true
that's gun pods gone yeah yet you see
you say I pahuch I think they still saw
that they do but that's come on in do
you tape shows I do I say a tape or film
like film that mm-hmm you know yeah I'm
not weird it is weird I yeah it's
completely irrelevant terminology but I
guess get some people say they DVR it I
I'm trying to correct myself I'm trying
to evolve as a human okay and say that
kind of stuff right even what my parents
say like oh I DVR'd it I'm like that's
what I mean like a like hang up the
phone is still a thing so I know but
hanging up like the button on my phone
says hang up it does yeah because you
are hanging up telling about fiscal
acting singing some Hey Ya Ya in the
call that guy so um alright so we got a
lot to talk about obviously when Steve's
here it's a it's a cluster f um not in a
good way oh yeah he's gonna tell us
about how much he loves Donald Trump Oh
morning and then um but first i wanna i
want to let like russ have the stage for
a second cuz roses roses found himself
in a very it's a it's a dye see you in a
pickle I'm it is I mean I'm no well yes
I am in a pickle yes and I do way to
describe and I just want to preface this
and saying like we should all be very
grateful and appreciative of Russ
opening the door to his is sort of like
a private life a little burger we're
gonna get a little personal yeah I feel
free to skip ahead to the more fun stuff
but right but interesting it's
interesting cuz I've never been in this
situation before sure okay take it away
so my dad died like a year or a little
bit ago I've talked briefly about on the
show but that's just sort of a
background information my mom has been
living in this house up in Westchester
we've I mean it's my childhood house so
we were there for 30 years she's um you
know they've owned the house for 30
years and it's gotten to the point where
the house is too big and it's ridiculous
that she's living there and she wants to
move into the city great um I've always
known that my mom has a lot of stuff
specifically like dolls but not just
dolls like she loves toys old toy
is that sort of thing and it's always
been a thing in the background it was
like cute when we were growing up and
she'd you know as I got older she would
like try to buy me stuff and I'd be like
I don't really have room for I'm an
apartment whatever and I'd be nice about
it but but clearly saying like it's not
really for me and also i'm not a clutter
II kind of guy like my apartments pretty
relatively sparse my fiancee lives like
that as well so it just doesn't really
jive with our life so we need to get the
house on the market because there's this
whole tax thing regarding like a death
in the family and if you sell the asset
with him Sir Matt time is a huge tax
break and you know it's money for her
retirement so it's very important that
like we secure this so the house needs
to be sold in a very quick amount of
time I was up there two weeks ago and I
walk into the house and it's like a bomb
went off it's like mercifully it's not
like it's not like on hoarders when you
watch it and there's like rotting
rotting food or a dead cat underneath a
bunch of stuff not unhealthy it's not
unhealthy but it's I would argue
mentally unhealthy potentially but like
that's sort of whatever um and you know
we'd been talking or a while about you
know getting the house ready and stuff
like that and she's been uh kind of
resistant to doing the work because it's
very overwhelming I don't blame her it's
a lot of work and it's also if you're
kind of a collector it's tough to get
rid of stuff mm-hmm sort of got to a
point where we were talking to her you
know me and my brother were talking to
her on a day-to-day basis saying like
hey what can we do is there anything we
can do and she was giving like a lot of
pushback and we sort of guts the point
where we didn't really know how to
handle the situation so she so I don't
interrupt a chair she understood that
the house needed to be ready to be shown
yes we were we repeatedly get kept
giving her dates so so when you would
say hey mom the house in its current
state right cannot be shown what was her
spot that they couldn't show the house
in its current state but she's like well
we've got you know we basically made a
very hard date at the end of March and
um there was really no progress being
made towards that much and whenever we'd
bring it up should get very defensive
and like be very push back on it okay so
it sort of got to a point where things
were reaching this like oh it's never
going to get done but you know we need
to sell the house in the spring ish
because that's when people move in
because it's for the school districts
and stuff like that so we know that my
mom is taking a vacation actually this
week right now as we recording it she's
in Florida right now my brother and I I
think we see where this is going my
brother and I decide really the only way
that this problem can be solved in an
expeditious manner is to hire a company
and be there while it gets cleaned out
so so you basically packed up to take
all these toys and dolls and seven put
them in box right well that's part of it
so so the other part of it is like so
half of it is like she buys these nice
dolls that are in boxes and she buys
them on ebay with the intention of
selling them that whether that happens
or not is neither here nor there but she
has like a lot of nice boxes she also we
have like a basement and the basement
has just like nothing's been thrown out
in 30 years so there was like I found a
six-foot-tall coca-cola bottle with like
pennies in it know that you would like
that you would see in a store as like it
would be filled with bottles of coke and
rice like I was just sitting in the
basement right like it like the burger
joint would have or we had like giant
stuffed animals from our like it was
like a Bugs Bunny from one of our bar
mitzvahs yeah that was sitting in there
but so imagine that spread across i
would say probably a thousand square
feet wow that's a lot pretty it's just
like a lot of just a lot of so
so some of it a lot of it really needed
to just be thrown out yeah so I spoke to
a lot of companies I'm like searching
online like organizers not really doing
it I spoke to some organizers like
that's gonna take three to four weeks Oh
because the problem is they're dealing
with these people that that don't want
to give anything away because it's like
a big part of whatever so you need to
let their light that's sort of the like
hand-holding like what does this mean to
you what is it like is
it's an important thing that you're
going to use and we just didn't have
time for that so I found this company
I'm going to give them a plug they
obviously haven't paid us but they were
tremendous called address our mess you
can google it there in a bunch of states
actually and the guys that came were
tremendous but essentially I mean the
whole house had cause it's filled to the
brim with stuff not to mention the
basement we filled so this started on
monday and it i didn't monday tuesday
wednesday and i was commuting in aliens
it took like two hours to get there and
back you know two hours back and we
filled 325 by 8-foot dumpsters Wow build
build felt so you but you didn't throw
everything away no so that's just what
we threw out that show you Wow yeah so
you threw out three dumpsters worth of
crap yes and then that was just the
stuff that was like the crash didn't
want yes nothing too had no value no
doubt you're worth okay Wow like think
about that perception like it'sit's
tough full-size on the street dumpster
yeah build now one of them had some
exercise like a treadmill okay go by
large but that was it and dance of like
we weren't throwing our furniture it was
just stopped off stuff and then I spine
my house tiles of like rugs with tags
still on them just like sitting there I
it was was there anything you you're
like you pulled out for yourself so I
did you're right yeah so I'm doing this
work and I'm like well I might see some
things that so I three things out of the
three dumpsters here's what I said
here's what I took ready yeah a wrapped
untouched ironing board because I need
an ironing board oks useful person a um
a nutribullet like blender sure okay
which was again in a box in a box and um
a set of sheets for when guests come
over so what about that was also like I
said what about the address your mess
people you're like you guys can take
whatever you want to yes oh I told me
they can take whatever they wanted that
got yes oh but they didn't I mean there
wasn't as I'm saying like yeah it was
like kids toys as the finality hook
but most of it was not why goods that I
was like just junk here's this Doug doll
from 1995 yeah I sent you a picture of
who was it uh Jessica rascal rap which I
hope you held I did not throw it out but
I might throw it out now will say Stacey
really wants um so uh yeah so it was the
most harrowing like three days it was
you know ten hours a day of just like
bringing stuff down these three guys
three guys were great there were
tremendous but it was such a like an
intense experience and it's not done yet
cuz like we're ever and I are gonna go
off this is just a basement no this is
the way it's done relatively done what
but it's like clean yeah oh sorry i
should say it's clean it looks like a
normal house now it doesn't look like
it's not like we rob the place in its
barren um but on Monday she gets back so
my brother and I are gonna go up there
we're gonna read their own treat her and
the hope is like look you know it's
obviously going to be intense experience
or but my hope is that she can focus on
the like a the amount of effort that we
put in be the concern that we had right
and seeing the practicality and the
practicality of it like she no longer
has to worry about this thing she can
move right to the city it's taken care
of it's done now now you that you talked
with of you threw away but yes stuff you
did you are keeping a lot of the dolls
yeah so so anything in boxes was saved
and put into the basement in boxes there
are about so you didn't get like a
storage unit or some like that I got a
storage unit as well so this so there
was some stuff that was like in the
basement I wasn't sure about so that was
moved into a storage unit and then all
the boxed dolls are in the basement
large boxes i would say 3 x 4 x 4
whatever large boxes um there's about 40
of them what Jordie of just boxed
outline blood nah me I was mad blown
away wow I do want to say though I was
talking to one of the guys that was
working it and I wrote this down just so
I wouldn't forget um I asked him because
they do this for a living I asked him
how many cats have they found uh-huh
dead cats dead cats and he said I don't
want to make up a number nothing that's
a big know that I would I could say
would be would sound realistic
essentially Wow nothing I could say with
general so
they deal with like hoarders and yeah so
that's their typical I asked them what's
like three dumpster seems like a lot
what's the most you've done they've done
11 dumpsters on a house that was
considerably smaller than my house and
most of that was just the garage it was
like three dumpsters just from the
garage of just like stuff and that's the
thing like you like the situation
because I had seen your house the
situation there was not would you see on
hoarders where it's all right oh my god
is a hazardous I mean it been cleaned up
that you know that yeah I'd been clean
up a little bit but I but it was all in
cause it's yeah behind closed doors
amazing but like when you're selling a
house you need to open a closet and it
can't be pouring out a stuff so it
needed to happen but it wow I can't wait
to hear about so they're going to hear
the reaction next week you need to give
her like xanax or something but you you
might get her flowers and worried that
again like it's gonna be it's gonna be
focusing on it's gonna be intense we're
just gonna focus on the positive
elements of it like hey man using and
I've spoken to the neighbors and
hopefully they're coming over well it's
just you know it'll be a really intense
experience oh and hopefully it works out
you're very brave man does your mom have
like a best friend yeah she can we get
her yeah get her on the show no get her
to Wells often it yeah so I've already
spoken her oh you did yeah yeah she said
she react but she was she said have you
done right exactly she said you know she
definitely agreed it needed to happen
that house looks great and very
supportive but she also i think realizes
um what what is the potential reaction
yeah uncle did you do any like before
and after photos I know I problem i have
some after obviously but whatever um
okay yeah it's uh best of luck to see
how it goes yeah I hope it all works out
on monday i want you to text me
regardless yeah it'll be late yeah it's
gonna be a late night but i will
definitely let you know your brain you
are brave and but your good side you did
a good thing yeah hopefully we're dead
yeah Wow alright everyone everyone got
that digesting they are
I want to tell you that's the only thing
my wife and I argue about is getting rid
of stuff right she tends towards
hoarding and I'm like get rid of things
are you in an apartment yeah that's the
thing you need to like there's like in
seeing all that stuff like house like
mine said an apartment online said it's
like totally different because if you
live in an apartment chances are
whatever you have is going to be visible
right it's it's there you can is nowhere
like magic like zone where you just drop
stuff and it's gone right and for me
yeah I don't wanna be staring it junk or
whatever it is not junk but like clutter
style lots of clutter I can deal with
clutter yeah yeah you know I'll just
look at and say you know you like we
look at our closet yash's the whole
thing is like this big remain her right
yes which is like five feet wide it is
like maybe two thirds of better stuff
yeah yeah no one can see that that's bad
but it was like but you don't wear like
a third or maybe even hats how it goes
man stuff yes how it goes I can't get
you know my things in and out cuz it's
so tight in there and I said now when I
see stuff in my closet I'm never gonna
wear I tossed me toss it yeah it's uh
stuff i have like shoes we did his thing
on shoes a long time ago on the four
idea about how many shoes we did i'm in
'have I have a house living mentality in
my apartment like that is what I know
but we actually do have a considerable
considerable of storage well introducing
the baby to the whole brain has been
that's that's a lot harder but uh but
we're making it work yeah um yeah that's
that's that's intense it's a lot of
stuff to consider it's a heavy yeah it's
it's weird my general mindset is like
that mentality of like I might be able
to use this at some point like this
might have value at some point you just
have looted divorce yourself from that
right I would much rather pay a premium
on the five percent chance of having to
rebuy something I threw out thanks then
just save every make sense yeah it may
but different store visit miss you know
some people it's an emotional thing yeah
absolutely makes perfect and I get that
I i like i love getting rid of things
yes all I lard it for you right it's
it's liberating yeah that's great yeah
it's good stuff i like that i'm glad i
hope that all works
misty and rail we're gonna pivot over to
Steve you told us you want to talk all
about Donald Trump right what was that
yeah you know I'm a big supporter right
and I'm gonna do my hair like him I want
to do that I want to see if I can cuz
it's very complicated yeah it looks like
that like a magician a lot of his
apartment right hand as he let people
touch it I don't think so but he wears
that cap when he's out son you want to
see the wind blowing I thought so I saw
someone wearing that cap at a hockey
game like a makeup make America great
yeah and I was like I didn't want to go
up to them because I don't trust anyone
who supports Valjean and I and I wanna
like go up and be like is this ironic is
this a joke cuz like you live in New
York you you don't like it's not what we
use you know what I do not find the
thing that maybe this is all just a
secret plot to elect Heller I would love
I mean a lot to be honest I'm gonna be
honest I'm in terms of the like the
Democratic candidates I will fully admit
both of them have their issues I'd like
bernie is a guy but there's issues
certainly there and I you know Hillary
again certainly issues like there's I
would vote 15 times if it meant
preventing Trump of course like but you
know that you know the the the man who's
behind the curtain right now who's yet
to visit you know be visible and resist
right who's that who's that Bloomberg oh
you really think that the other billion
what does that mean that the thing
absolutely positively wait when Hillary
what do you sectors you think belong is
going to pop out apps and what let into
what he's gonna be the next present and
destroy the election yes no he'll be the
next president because you know what
election this election well he's not
gonna be waiting for that an independent
yes is an independent so you telling me
people are gonna vote for it when
Hillary falters yeah if Hillary's bogged
down in court if Hillary starts losing
primaries Mike will pop out
mathematically she has a very good shot
at being the camp yeah but if if the
well the kids hit the fan is she won't
be the next president right I guess when
Mike pops out are all right he's a
billionaire too I know matter fact he's
a much bigger billion yeah
and our anymore for a more successful
and run the toughest city in the world
yeah for 12 sure sure so it is I don't
you know the char yeah I don't
necessarily have an opinion on Bloomberg
so but you're in terms of like a real
bombs honestly I kind of just wanted I
kind of just brought this up because I
wanted you to just like make fun haha
sorry i was sitting up hard to make my
stay away from politics on the erica you
think he's gonna so you're saying he's
gonna get the nomination and then be
like vote for Hillary JK yeah I think so
he destroyed the part that would
be like the ultimate reality TV play
where he liked and he would be
remembered forever for forever and huge
and that's what he wanted he would go
down as a hero yeah right you good as a
year but the thing is is like I don't
like doing politics on the shines right
but they're I draw a line when it
comes to someone like Donald Trump where
it's like it I'll care if I it's so off
the chart it's so on the chart it's like
you know the thing I've lived twenty
four thousand days yeah I can't you
can't fathom this is this is like a
reality show and that Republican debate
last night was it last yeah damn I think
you can't believe what you're seeing
it's like what yeah yeah these are
people who want to be the president of
the United States but and they have the
guy with the suitcase with the button
and yet all right you can't what one of
these people you can't believe how your
 it's it's really it's literally if
someone a year ago tell you I'm gonna
tell you what's gonna happen and you get
so daddy that's an awesome Ronald rages
the actor the actor no yeah except it's
that kind of Lunas and naturally not
believe it's unbelievable this is all a
bad dream man is this embarrassing like
it is so good and it's only embarrassing
if he does well he's doing great yeah
but he's doing well among a bunch of
he's he's up against people that no one
likes right even Republicans don't like
the candidates like the options so him
doing well in the Republican primaries
fine if he does well in the general
that's even if he doesn't win but he
still gets like a sizeable vote that's
impetus its ups it I don't again I won't
get into too deep into it but i like i
said i'll draw the line when it comes to
this guy because if
if we are insulting your political
tendencies with them too I'm sorry just
turn this off and never come back I
don't want you I don't want you here
you're not welcome you're not welcome
that I'm actually gonna I'm gonna play
this game you're not welcome here get
out get out get out um build a wall
digital long uh so yeah man what do you
got for us today so I may have mentioned
this in the past that I'm writing my
autobiography not about all 24,000 days
just the 25 years of me being a movie
theater projections which is a sizable
in that as a sizable chunk yes and a lot
of things happen do you have a give a
crazy story share with us well he's got
plenty of stories a story I'm sure draw
a projection is like protection stories
sure yeah well I'll tell you that I'll
tell you the one if I'm going to limit
it to one I'll start with this one and
is you can tell me if this I've actually
told us right this is a great story yeah
so um Steven Spielberg rented my theater
a baronet clarinet which dollar exists
on Third Avenue across from blooming
where Bloomingdale's I think we may have
heard this but let's let's let's do it
that's good yeah so this was maybe a
month or six weeks before Schindler's
List I had premiered and he had a
benefit screening and there were a
thousand seats and each seat was a
thousand dollar so he raised a million
dollars pretty good show and you know
it's a really big deal so that morning
so the theater was going to be open that
day I think I was going to do screenings
or something for people during the day
and then have the big premiere at night
so that morning when I arrived at the
theater there were the cans with the
film it was a 70 millimeter film in a
man standing next to the cans and he
introduced himself to me and he said
that he was Steven Spielberg's editor
his personal to editor okay okay and he
edited Schindler's List and he edited
Schindler's List and he only he could
touch this print his print was
Spielberg's personal sure and only he
could touch it mee-mah I couldn't touch
it right are you could ob's you can load
it you can load it he wouldn't listen
projector right but that's all I could
touch so I said oh I don't care and do
my job fine yeah do it myself out so you
know we spent in a day together and that
the film is on reels at any trail is
about 20 minutes long and the movie is 3
hours and 15 minutes or so you have to
splice all these reels together so we're
you know working he's splicing the reels
together and then it loads on one
gigantic reloads on a platter which is
an aluminum disc that's five feet in
diameter oh my god spins from the center
and the film comes out of the center
goes up cross rollers over to the
projector through the projector
backcross rollers and to another platter
on this this spinning table oh yeah
that's way better than hd- a its analog
I get it but come on it's higher red I
get it but you may I know it's way
higher res but is it worth way beyond 4k
it's so yeah yeah what hella Quentin
Tarantino yeah d-did 70 millimeter
hateful eight right ya know what it cut
about half way and no one saw that movie
shoulda done it 45 millimeters I like
Quentin Tarantino half the time but his
heart why do you think he did such a
hard thing I mean I understand he has a
love for old time in a cinema yeah boy
did he miss you don't want to make
movies he wants to make film but I said
it better be mad no no that's fine but I
saw revenant like two days after that
talked about as good I couldn't tell
different well I don't want to get this
into the into this conversation but uh I
used to be the first guy to be like new
no digital visual digital
nothing is as good as film essentially
that's technically true mm-hmm but there
comes a point where like you you
couldn't pick this out of the lineup if
your life depended on it right well I'm
sure an expert could but I don't know
most be like what is that a point 0 0 1
percent of the population take it I saw
it properly I guess you know anyway and
these day this was before danger so the
things is a five-foot diameter real it's
loading up and and everything's going
all right yeah and actually I just take
one little sidestep yeah there's two
theaters one theaters on top of the
other okay when
and I'm showing in both theaters so when
we started the one in the top theater
which is the bigger theater the editor
and I were in the bottom theater okay
preparing for that show and someone runs
in this is during the day we were doing
like a screening for press press or
whatever and they say the pictures off
the screen upstairs so we run upstairs
and the film had broke one of his
splices Spielberg for editor spices and
she made that heat what I never talk
you're not allowed to touch anything so
what the guy do to yell you known as I
go I are screwed so he fixes it we
start the show and we go back down to
the other thing so then we fast-forward
to eight o'clock that night excreting
the million-dollar screening and though
I had asked for there to be two
projectionists for this very very very
important show you one downstairs and
went upstairs they said no you can't do
that they meaning who owned owners of
owners of here ok so the show starts I'm
in the upstairs the big booth and guess
what happened oh and this was something
he loaded and is the same thing helo dry
again and it broke oh you can front of
that during the millions of birds in the
audience all the mean carrot well the
actors in the o people of what their
Schindler his list and the movie ends
with the Nazis winning and she's
terribly I'm sitting there with him in
the film breaks and instantly you know
there's you know what kinds of people
run into the yelling at me I've get it
back on the screen new son of a bitch I
and I look at him and think I touch it
now yeah is it okay now I do my job can
I do and would he go and he said
basically no oh he said it's guys drive
me crazy was gonna thread the platter
that big desk at home he was gonna hand
it to me I was gonna thread the
projector I was going to hand it back to
him and then we'd start mmm a nice
phases well it wasn't any time to
discuss
we did this yeah and I start the
projector put the picture back on the
screen and I look over at the platter
which is supposed to be turning feeding
film to the projector yeah and it's
standing so whoa I run over to the
platter now I should stop for a second
and tell you that 70 millimeter film is
very heavy yes every of the 35
millimeter film I would imagine twice
and now well more than twice as heavy
okay definitely that's why I don't tell
you why later okay but and it is three
hours of it on the platter and that
weighs about 150 pounds okay so I go
over to platter with this hundred and
fifty pounds of film on it and I start
turning it with my hand man you pushing
against this platter right feed film to
the projector it was about to break
because it didn't feed it would
detention you tend to feel my way so I
look and I see that he had miss threaded
it so it wouldn't feed and I said to him
we got a problem we got a big problem
and he said it's at on the screen now
and I said it's on the screen now for
now but this 150-pound weight which is
going to get lighter and lighter as the
film goes through um we got it we gotta
stop you have to break the film rethread
the platter part splice it and then we
can continue and he said no no no no no
we can't do that yeah I said okay trust
so what we're going to do then is you
and I for the next three al gonna push
this we're going to push this this metal
disc and by the way you have to push it
at pretty much a very precise right if
you push it to slow the film gift too
tight break you push it too fast as in
the dome will fall off the roller yes
and then it'll break so you know that
the chances of it breaking over the next
three hours are really really high as
one of those two things is likely to
have so what happened and he said know
what we're gonna we're going to go for
the for the manual push and i said
here's what we're going to do we're
going to take five minute turns i'm
going to turn it for five minutes and
then i'm gonna rest cuz it's hard yeah
it's heavy it's not like you're picking
it up and now it's a heavy thing to push
and push you know an exact speed and
then i'm going to take you know i'll
take a break
you do it for five minutes and the other
and that's what we did for the next
three hours and it didn't and it didn't
break Wow good video as all this is
going down yeah I said to him now when
this is all over you're going to tell
steven spielberg and everybody else at
whatever movie company that was did it
was your fault that it bro yeah and goes
no I'll give you 20 grand if I devil cuz
I said if you say it was my fault yeah
I'm gonna get fired right right and I'm
gonna be pissed and he knows because I
was my job and I'm never gonna get
another job right even at that point
getting another steady job at a movie
theater was a really difficult thing to
do yeah so so would so did he offer to
buy you off like what did he do it over
tomorrow so no he he said don't worry
inand in fact that's what happened is he
told I never got any crap for it okay
but it was I didn't know that at that
time you know right my heart was like
pounding through the whole thing did you
meet Steven Spielberg no I mean no I
think you deserve to meet him I think so
too well I think I don't like his movies
all right you not to say that David
that's mean yeah I i miss you owe the
pleasure to meet you hate your work hate
your work and you but pleasure to meet
you okay one that I actually Jurassic
Park Joe I know jaws yeah maybe Seminole
like it created a job close encounter
stars yeah closing I did enjoy close
encounter I think it went to your fault
up 1941 yeah coreanos now just kind of
boring yeah yeah mashed potatoes yeah oh
there's that's a movie yeah it's a great
two great stories that story she ate
yourself you can read that in the book
the book the damage on the title
Kickstarter working title yes I
projectionists you get it like I pretty
I like I regally Brian projection right
well that's the ultimate irony of it all
is that there's a legally blind action
is like that is how you pitch this yeah
it's funny that the the place tomorrow
Barnes well they don't publish but yeah
and they're kind of yeah not in a really
good place my girl say yeah exclusive
how they
do it oh they bought this book from a
blind projection is I will take a break
more 404 on the other side led by all of
Steve's Lackey chicken scratch set list
here sphere more for for after this
stick around hey we got a new sponsor on
the show this week shout out to Ruby
receptionist's they are a virtual
receptionist service that sounds pretty
cool I'm like it yes it's fascinating it
means so check it out it means you
forward your existing business phone
number to one of their receptionist's in
portland oregon and they answer it for
you so it gives you like the people
calling you the feeling like oh these
guys are legit right they've got they've
got receptionist okay interesting right
smart technology shows them details
about your business and then your
callers before they pick up the phone
they sound like they're sitting in your
office which is kind of brilliant yeah
ah but for a third of the price of a
full-time employee cuz i wanna i don't
know playful that receptionist plus
they're never sick they're never on
vacation and they're never go out to
lunch sir always there someone's always
there to pick up the call that's pretty
smart you could also provide detailed
call handling instructions for everyone
at your company as well as different
types of college they can take a message
send them to voicemail or put them right
through to something like your cell
phone most importantly Ruby
receptionist's care about connecting
with your callers and making their day
while making your business look and
sound good get started today by going to
call Ruby calm / 40 for show and receive
free activation that's a ninety five
dollar value again call Ruby calm / 40
for show hey welcome back to the show
great story from steve ells great man i
got a really quick story well hold on
cuz russ has something to ask you ok
serious question did oh now this has
been a curious it's kind of like a
dramatic series more more a steve
centric serious question ok teleporters
get invented tomorrow how many people
have to use a teleporter is it analog
digital teleporter I just matter that
should matter it shouldn't matter how
many people have to use a teleporter
whatever it is before you feel
comfortable using the teleporter well it
would be tested and approved by our
government okay but you so soon finds a
guinea pig but I don't know no I'm I
wouldn't imagine that you would ever be
the first person I would be like okay
I'm gonna use the teleporter and I don't
know if it does need to be tested by the
government I'm not sure there is
legislation in place yeah probably how
does have to be ul approved yeah I don't
think it'd be like a thing they would
kiss your flying there to invent a new
regulatory committee yeah to look at
that just for help okay well regardless
so in that sense I if it wasn't for
expensive i'd be right up there so white
because it's not safe i sees in the
world I I don't want to go because I
don't want to sit in a plane that long
so put the teleporter that's what I mean
we're New Zealand I mean well I I'm
supposed to go to Munich for something
and I really don't want it that's like
as nine hours right I got some meds dude
no sleep you would rather RIT you'd be
in the first like dozen people hey if
you could you won't go to Mars would you
go to Mars well I saw the movie it
sucked I don't like the margin though
much either golfo move but would you go
you wouldn't go to Mars if I could not
die when i went to more gonna tell a
teleport yeah your art go that's the
only thing about the teleportation thing
there's got to be a teleport he's got
another one inside and then which lay my
second question I'm glad that you're
very cavalier about using it my second
question you are cavalier ya back
teleporters essentially are you giving
an answer no no no known only a dozen
people have used it you're not a pig uh
oh no I thought I wasn't getting here in
the mercy this is guinea pig but you're
like the first person getting omelet
they don't rip it hi Savannah done Anna
and they don't have cancer a few animals
yeah one of them came out pak-rat half
now you're revealing more well I'm just
saying okay so teleporters aren't they
essentially just cloning machines in
which case like wouldn't the original
person still be there no what no
teleporters imply like we're moving at
reconstructing you really actual why do
the atoms neat the art you just copying
I think of it like it's a 3d printing my
free time exactly i don't think that is
what the idea of teleportation is its
actual movement you should just somehow
beaming it over why article by part you
just did them aren't you just digitizing
like Tron it's not yours a machine it's
not like a Xerox machine it's not a copy
it's not a copy it's it's a
transportation yeah it is a place
shifting device but that's like add so
much more work oh no what no right now
we have the technology to send data
right sure so you can basically your
body is made up what your body is an
anything it is essentially I mean it is
but it's not zeros in one yes it is no
I'm on its Billy of whatever feeling
much drama global aliens right now there
are ones you could put this organic
living breathing matter all that stuff
can be broken walking down into zeros
and ones okay wait arguably will argue
about a so it's easier to you're saying
it's easier to send all of those little
particles and everything through the air
than it is to just say oh that's what
everything's here we'll just take this
like data chunk and send it over here no
I don't like what you're like crazy
puppet really yeah I don't lie so you
think men they make two of me here look
exactly the same nobody is who said it
was a bee every time that they use a
teleporter in like Star Trek or whatever
the first guy is dying it's like the
prestige the first guy dies and then the
second guy is essentially the first guy
but is he you're just you're just taking
the plot to the prestige in like getting
nuts with it right here's what you're
doing I think it's interesting and it is
interesting people use teleport is so
cavalierly in sci-fi sci-fi all the time
should eat lots of ice agree it's a good
positive ID space but technologically I
really think that my way is the way
they're doing it no you're fine did what
does it matter then like so your image
thing because you depart eyes the world
of the original of you dies and the
clone lives on show me where it both
live on right and where does your guys
go though like it's your consciousness
that get sent with the data so then the
first one is the bum who cares he's a
dummy the vessel well no it's not like
it removes
it's just it's like a three-credit scans
issue and sends it I think you need to
read up on Jeff too yeah i think and i
realize that matter can't be created out
of nothing so we need to come from
somewhere but essentially a 3d printer
has like printing material so you would
be made from that perimeter or you're
sleeping water right you're mostly made
from like whatever's any don't read up
more on teleportation technology I've
read theory ever get back forget theory
I've read literal books on it have you
know I was like literal that's subtle no
they were teleported uh all right I
didn't know if we go down that hole but
we did we came back on the other side so
you're surprised by my answer that i I'm
so cavalier about yeah I was surprised
like within a dozen nothing to lose I've
been here twenty-four thousand days it
can go really bad it could go like your
arm is growing out of your chest Oh
Seymour is being by the way that's the
name of the show that was it fine print
and I'm blind so I just said you're
using tell where I didn't say how it go
I asked if it was tightening and I said
no it not barely anyone is destined
except on animals I thought I thought
that will rework the history of that by
the way we just need the show it's a
24,000 days with Steve gah all right
what else you got cuz I got a quick
story yeah cuz we only actually have
like 20 minutes or so okay that's a lot
of time I know but you do have a lot of
stuff that's just it's just a security
blanket I don't want to run out of thing
okay okay i just don't get worried eeks
your interest can you read that ah
decode any of the top one a behemoth
screen behind the screen behind the
screen is that Bruce Willis wrist well
us Paul McCardle and then it says 24,000
days given this is Schindler's List 1

I'm playa he's are you blind then of
course I've always been blind for all
24,000 save Steve how do you know when
the pictures in focus right like how do

your nose up to this and then I'm
the back what you see is there like a
device I have a dozen instrument that is

meanwhile let the guy the guy in the box
office sees this whole thing going down
he sees say no to Bruce was he knows it
it's Bruce well obviously obviously
knows he pops out and says oh that's a
chemistry will you please please go in
you know and then they go off and
through theater and he's like that's
really oh holy I didn't know have you do
you ever recognize celebrities like I no
not usually right cuz you would but I
have been in rooms with people that are
so distinct and he had a thing on his
head yeah cuz they kind of like I was in
a room with Woody Allen for an hour and
I know who he was okay well how wise
words la boîte what was that when did
that happen it was when Annie Hall came
out and my god and he did a talk at the
new school yeah and before the talk they
put him in a room just because he
doesn't want to be around ppl right I
get green room I could green yeah they
put him in and I was in that room and
they told me that that was likely where
they were gonna put them and when you
guys looked at each other you're like oh
we're basically the same period in the
mirror yeah right they said don't talk
to him sure don't don't talk to him
don't make I side right don't come girls
don't do that wow look at him come on
look up it's gonna make him weird or fee
me or whatever if it's a green room I
don't know green room if you're in the
same green room with someone yeah that's
her I guess if it yeah well that's you
and not me why are you why we there I
knew people that worked with the at the
new school in they told me that what he
was going to be talking so I said hey I
want to come and they said well you're
not gonna buy a ticket just hanging out
with us and you can just watch it from
you know okay like Compton there you got
like yeah and they're like just wait in
this green room yeah and then what he
comes in and it's just you and woody if
someone brings him in okay
and he had a magazine or some reading a
magazine and I pretended to read a
magazine and and look at him you know
and just wanted to breathe the same airs
oh yeah so eight so so you guys are in
the room together for an hour an hour
and I know I desperately want it enough
not a word was spoken and that's when I
really lost Woody Allen story ever
really I believe you had to deal with
that its terrorist that's that's
horrific first meeting that I ever had
with a super celebra that I couldn't
talk to oh my favorites John Lennon's
story yeah and then you really look like
you're looking in the mirror is that
because I think a young Steve Guttenberg
is a spitting it back to that I could do
that yeah i was i was like um 23 so he
was 30 or 31 yeah and i sat in a seat
next to him in my movie theater okay and
we stared at each other what we stared
at each other he we stared at me to make
me leave basically so so is it a packed
theater no was an empty theater is an
empty theater John Lennon sitting there
yo go with you oka with yoga so it's
just them two right up against the wall
up against the wall you know in a nearly
empty theater I sit one seat away from
him why did you do that why did you do
that because I wanted to get close to
John letters no like creep them out yeah
you can I great I feel really bad yeah
well you can't go around creeping out be
there's like there's a there's a middle
ground right there's a million Woody
Allen and and you're John Lennon
situation which is like you gotta know
boundaries yeah I think it's a boundary
i think you're just an obvious
projection is good be the person you'd
most want to meet in your entire life
who is this was the equivalent of john
lennon for you of all the human beings
on the planet that would be number one
for me and i was two feet away from him
45 say a word to him well he would like
turn away and whisper things to yoga oh
I don't look this cool so no he's
cruising the huh then and I think he's I
was like they can't believe I'm looking
at the movie yeah and then and then you
knew he walked in like you saw him
walking
what told me he came out they buzz me
they told me yeah and I said okay and
since they were only like five people in
the theater yeah easy to pick him you
couldn't just do binoculars from you're
like no I looked to see where he was I'm
up in the booth okay I walked in yeah I
mean he didn't know I was a
projectionist sure of course not that it
really matters but go what what are the
chances right or so I so you sat next to
him in the same one seat away and you
turned 90 degrees cog to your right yes
and just stared at him I stared I was
like I'm I'm two feet away from a beetle
the best beetle right yeah well not
morally but musically sure and whirly
I've never heard that apply to people
you know your life is a series of
dysfunctional Forrest Gump story yes
likee that's your life yes it's amazing
yeah it is it you don't you put it that
way yeah and I hate them right but you
see that movie no one hates that movie
Steve you can't did I tell you my forest
gump store oh boy yes you did I did okay
I want to repeat myself go so I just
I'll just I said I did screenings for
Forrest Gump before it came out yeah and
I used to do a lot of screenings for you
know before films came out and I
remember telling the guy from the movie
company I do the Saldana vehicle this
movie is a bomb yeah but trust me big
trusty ol it now save save yourself yeah
80 million Oscars later you know he was
originally gonna do the forest gump
voice in just normal Tom Hanks voice but
like dumber uh-huh and he decided
against that so like I don't think that
movie would like don't really know that
footage of him reading lines Forrest
Gump in normal Tom Hanks voice but just
like kind of slower wow I don't look for
that and then they cast the kid who
played young forest gump and the kid his
natural accent was this ridiculous
accent that's in the movie and he
mimicked the kids accent for the movie
would really genius do I guess he is a
genius a boring genius ha genius huh
makes isn't boring
he is so bland he is so nothing I know
money pit tommix isn't boring about
gyros volcano that's not boring Tom
Hanks come on and he seems like a nice
guy yeah good like the motion why he's
not that nice no you know when his son
wanted to make that movie about Tower
Records okay he said you could have said
hey dad give me like 50 grand to make
this movie but he didn't do that he had
to go hustle like kicks oh come on of
course the sun's not gonna just take the
money from his day he's trying to make
it a zone when Colin Hanks is doing okay
he's acting him to stare did about movie
magic cape Colin Hanks out oh well he
kind of creeped me out he told me that
he called me on it on a dial phone just
to prove we were analog but Colin Hanks
Colin Hanks you have a relationship with
dial well i did when i wrote about him
yeah that's when he needed me he needed
me he needed he needed promotion he
wasn't getting close to his kickstarter
goal yeah this is for the Tower Records
thing ya did he make it yeah thanks to
me it's a good movie I have it on my cue
but I have not yet seen it fair enough
um we don't have too much time left do
you want to do one more story so you
know what's coming next week yeah next
week the technique the return of the
technics turntable is it big this is a
big deal they've been selling turntables
forever they had been and then they
stopped hmm so this is the
reintroduction of the techniques like DJ
style turntable okay this is a big deal
all right so why don't why is it a big
deal because it's it's like it's an
iconic turntable it's like the Solar ray
Jay's use like that silver one not
anymore well not me anymore but it all
turned it well hey wish I use turntables
is fine so much but they like have these
digital ime like look like turning
social school you know DJ's it like to
play vinyl records by the way dot vinyl
the TV show yeah I was i I watched the
first episode and it was very long it's
a very long hour well I think it was two
hours but it felt like to felt like
three I didn't idea I wasn't grabbed by
the first two hours a lot of people one
no one's watching it the ratings are its
arm and I think Alex finally I would do
a trump and I would like bomb the
out of him what was I talking about the
show bomb the show you know like he's a
Pisces yeah i was president I'd like
bomb the out yeah so is the
production combination cancel the show i
legit i think people aren't watching it
I don't I I just think there's cuz I'm
part like I feel like I'm part of the
demographic who's like should be
intuitive word oh yes but I'm also part
of demographic where I'm like I don't
care about this show you don't want to
see sex drugs and rock know like their
song is it's not your like you can't
relate to it necessary and it's not so
far removed that it's quasi interesting
so like Boardwalk at least I was engaged
by like oh there's a time period I've
never seen in my life right where is
what a seventies rock and roll on paper
sounds interesting but like I can't
really relate to it I think there's
something else though because you know
on its face yeah there's the right
people involved are they're very
talented the right actors involved in
front of and behind the camera HBO
everything clicks with this but why yeah
no one watch I mean boardwalk was kind
of a slope are you asking really yeah i
just sold a 24,000 days sitting here in
this year yeah well that's my period and
it doesn't ring true its just faked out
all mrs. if ya like someone who wasn't
20 been on the planet long enough was
writing about it as if is what he
thought it was she tell you what it
capture that era absolutely ok it's
really lame when the characters are just
stock please shake yeah I that I agree
with that really really bad they're not
even two dimensional their
one-dimensional yes awful and then Nick
Jagger's son who's probably you know 65
who's the rite aid yeah but and he plays
this Punk was gonna be like this is so
that may be so he's gonna be he's gonna
be his son that's his song he looks like
I would have guessed literally that
McGee a curse on is 50 no he's like 30
so i think supposed to be like 25
prolific guy yeah Mick Jagger has many
children
I'm sure and uh that's crazy I can't
believe that almost as many children as
your mother has dolls this entire all
together will say that yeah it's weird
it's weird that it's just not popular
like people don't seem to be in to know
what's the best part of it the credits
see I don't think the first episode had
credits a credit sequence talking about
the beginning or closing of the opening
okay the opening credit is like a CGI
thing of a diamond stylist racing
through a groove mmm okay like very cool
on the actual like from like my
perspective like looking up yeah a
diamond and it's like going through the
dog who gets ass off yeah that's the
best what's the best acting haha its
most genuine it didn't seem like
Scorsese like was not me as a game what
has he done since taxi driver oh stop it
40 years no however long it's been many
days it's been a lot a lot of good he's
done somewhat good laughs yeah my party
business Lasker arms good I did you find
its 50 crew is good too Steve Steve
what's your best picture of the year ah
three days a Martian no come on can I
hate for Marsha I don't hate it but it
wasn't good rifle by the way I want to
ask you a question yeah his Matt Damon
an actor or a movie see it actor a movie
stuff he's not an actor I think he's a
movie star Jeff is sorted you sort of
made that argument right that you don't
think he's really acting I think I think
for the Martian Matt game and played
Matt Damon yeah and I don't what about
in behind the candies already started I
didn't see that in the kennel right as
machi yeah oh my god or minus rachis
boyfriend oh you'd like that people love
that I have no idea why aren't it
showing range that range just yes it
wasn't Liberace was this something I
think he's probably a good dude he makes
me laugh occasionally Damon yeah I just
don't I don't know if I'm buying what he
said not for you he's just not my god
he's a lightweight pretty case okay I
don't know I think he's better than that
and as he is he and Ben Affleck the same
person no no we aren't they like forever
tied together all right they do have
this like buddy-buddy thing but I mean
they've
they both hype i can tell the difference
I'm why do you guys even not written
anything has he been writing to do I
mean Ben Affleck has but well maybe that
that's just like the trajectory that he
didn't really find himself fallen in
wanting to do that it's easy to make a
move it into rights good like wow not
you show up you say some wine Wow look
in the camera nice things like look I've
done enough projections where I no no I
projected enough movies I know what it
takes I know cinema is in my blood it is
sprach got nothing but film and splicing
