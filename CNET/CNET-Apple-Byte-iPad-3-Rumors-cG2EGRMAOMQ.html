the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now there's
plenty of news and the Apple by team
will also help you out during this
holiday season with a special app but
first of the stories the ipad 3 news
rumors keep ratcheting up and a display
search analyst recently told CNET a QX
ga 2048 x 1536 resolution panel has
started production and the three
suppliers are Samsung sharpen LGD now
three suppliers is more than normal and
it shows the challenge of manufacturing
enough of these high res screens at high
quantities the report says the displays
will not be AMOLED screens and app will
be using the same IPS technology that's
used in the current ipad now ilounge
reports that the third gen ipad will be
0 point seven millimeters thicker to
accommodate the twin light bar system
needed for its higher res display as
well see this article also says Apple's
interested in making a seven point eight
five inch tablet if the market also
shows there's a demand for it so how
much demand is there really in this
market for tablets there's a lot of hype
surrounding the 7-inch kindle fire but
NPD paints a picture that doesn't look
so pretty for any other competitor not
named ipad at the moment in the first 10
months of 2011 the total number of non
ipad tablet sold in the US was 1.2
million units and the company that came
out on top was the HP touchpad which
managed to take seventeen percent of non
ipad tablet sales with its $99 fire sale
Samsung was second was sixteen percent
and a sous was third at ten in
comparison although apple doesn't reveal
regional numbers they sold 11.2 million
iPads worldwide in the last quarter
alone doubling the previous quarter with
a lot more explosive growth expected
this holiday season and speaking of the
holidays you're all probably looking for
some killer deals on Apple's hardware
the big a tease it's black friday sale
for friday last year they offered 101
dollars off imax macbook pros and airs
and discounts from 11 to 41 dollars off
of ipods and ipads so you can expect
similar discounts but nothing like a buy
one or get one free now your best bet
really is to check out third-party app
resellers like mac mall mac connection
and best buy whether it's before or
after Thanksgiving all right let's keep
things in the holiday spirit and check
out our app of the week you're with your
friends food is on the table but
Thanksgiving isn't always the most
pleasant experience hey guys guys it's
the signature dish of the night it's yam
time look at that smell yams again
Thanksgivings rolls in Charlie help me
up a bite what should I do the app of
the week is Chows thanksgiving dinner
coach and it's free it will get you set
up with eight surefire hit recipes we'll
build a shopping list for you to take
with you on the go and it includes a
schedule and cooking instructions for
each dish so Brian let's try that again
hey guys check it out it's the signature
dish of the night it's yam time look at
this oh my gosh here one for you one for
you and one for you what would I do
without you thank you ciao anksgiving
dinner coach way to go tong way to give
it your all kind of done without coach
all right onto the quick bites we've
talked on the show about how the iphone
4 was the most popular camera phone on
flickr it still holds that title with
the new kid on the block the iphone 4s
has now moved on up and has claimed the
number two spot with a 3g and 3gs
trailing behind it also Apple is one
control of several domain names after
filing a complaint with the world
intellectual property organization to
claim URL names that use the word iPhone
and then forwarded them to naughty parts
sites so that prank won't work on your
friends anymore and believe it or not a
nationwide study by metric o wireless
shows that AT&amp;amp;T has the fastest iphone
4s data speeds for both upload and
download and I can tell you in San
Francisco that's absolutely the case as
well although sprint had the best voice
quality it was also found to have the
most dropped calls based on their tests
and finally check out this cool photo
lens dial case from photojojo for the
iPhone 4 and 4s it has three lenses a
wide angle fisheye and telephoto lens
that you can rotate and two tripod
mounts
now this thing looks amazing but it will
also cost you two hundred and forty nine
bucks but it's one of those cool
accessories that we wanted to show you
all right that's going to do it for this
week's show send us your emails to the
Apple by to cnet com i'm brian Tong
