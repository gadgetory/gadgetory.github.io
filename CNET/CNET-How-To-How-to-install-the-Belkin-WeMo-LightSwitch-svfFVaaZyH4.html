is the Belkin Wemo light switch today
I'm going to show you how to install it
and get it set up in your home first
things first
safety make sure you go to your circuit
breaker and flip off the electricity to
this switch now you're ready to install
your Belkin Wemo light switch the box is
really simple it comes with 4 wire
connectors the switch itself and the
faceplate which is right here
that's all you're really going to need
which is great as for supplies you'll
need on hand make sure that you have
pliers to make the wires straight a
screwdriver and a voltage tester also
before you get started you're going to
want to make sure that you have a
neutral wire in my case it's the white
wire here they're not always white but
you got to make sure you have it or you
can't install on this switch alright now
you're ready to get started start with
one of the switch wires that's the black
wire here and pair it up to another one
of the black wires in your wall mount
take a wire connector
and screw it on to make sure it's
connected just tug on the wires then you
do the same thing with the other black
wire the last step is to pair up your
neutral wire and that's really it for
the wiring part this green wire here is
the ground wire and it's an optional
wire for me the hardest part of this
installation was getting all of these
wires back inside the wall so that I
could fit the light switch here goes
alright once your wires are inside you
can use your screwdriver to screw it
into the wall the last step is just to
pop this on top of the light switch I'm
Megan Fullerton Pristina and this was
how to install your Belkin Wemo light
switch
