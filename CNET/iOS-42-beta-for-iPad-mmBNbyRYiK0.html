and Apple's iOS 4.2 beta that specific
to the ipad was recently released so we
wanted to show off some of the major
improvements and some of the more subtle
ones as well the Vegas edition is
multitasking and it works just like it
has on an iPhone double click the home
button and you'll see apps that are
currently running in portrait mode
you'll see six apps at a time and in
landscape mode you'll see seven now
what's great about this is that I've
been dying for Pandora to have
multitasking on the iPad and it looks
like the app was built already with that
in mind so it works like a charm I can
listen to my pandora stream while
checking out a recipe for dinner or
surfing the web now just like an iOS 4.1
once you've accessed the multitasking
feature you can swipe to the right to
reveal the music controls and more a new
change is that the screen orientation
lock is now accessible here so you can
lock the ipad to portrait or landscape
mode the physical button on the right
hand side that used to be the screen
lock is now a mute switch but I'm not
sure if I like that change it and the
biggest addition that I love the ability
to control the brightness of the screen
with this slider without jumping into
the preferences thank you now folders is
here on the iPad and you can put up to
20 icons / folder compared to only 12 on
the iPhone airprint makes its debut and
the wireless printing option is
integrated into the apps so if I'm in
the mail app it will show up here and
I'll be able to select a printer it sees
and choose how many copies I want you'll
also find printing in the photo app and
Safari airplay is Apple's wireless
streaming feature that streams to the
new Apple TV or other compatible devices
you'll be able to access it in the ipod
app movie app and youtube app now let's
show you a few other features in 4.2
game centers here on the ipad and it's
pretty much what we've seen in iOS 4.1
mail now has a unified mailbox for your
multiple accounts and you can also
organize your emails by threads which I
love Safari has an updated icon that now
shows you how many Safari pages you have
open in the background and closing them
feels snappier than before now all of
you fans of the Notes app will now be
getting a few other fonts that you can
change in the settings instead of just
marker felt so you guys can rejoice and
if you're using the ipad 3g with the
cellular data option turned on you now
have the ability to toggle between 3g
and edge if you want to reduce the drain
on your battery even if it means slower
download speeds i'm brian Tong for cnet
com and
this is the beta and there's sure to be
more improvements on the way before it's
November release but we wanted to give
you a sneak peek at iOS 4.2 in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
