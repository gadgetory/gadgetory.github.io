the best deal yet for people who want to
cut the cable TV cord and stream their
live shows over the Internet the cost
just 35 bucks a month for more than 100
channels of live TV that's more channels
than competitors like sling TV and
PlayStation view for a temptingly low
price if you live in a major city you
can also get live feeds of ABC Fox and
NBC and if you don't their shows are
available on demand you also get access
to some regional sports like our yes
Network for Yankees and Nets games here
in New York to use DirecTV now you'll
need a supported video device at launch
it works with Android and Apple phones
and tablets computer web browsers and TV
devices including chromecast Amazon fire
TV and Apple TV on the Apple TV I tested
it feels a little bit like Netflix to
use but with live TV the main home
screen list shows on now lets you
continue watching on-demand shows you
started previously and services other
categories to browse I like it's big
thumbnail images and show centric layout
better than a standard grid guide but if
you want DirecTV now has one of those to
complete with the ability to add
favorite channels if you select a show
that isn't airing now you'll be taken to
the on-demand section it was pretty
sparse in my initial tests only listing
a few episodes at many shows but DirecTV
says we'll add more on demand shows soon
since there's no cloud DVR however you
can't accumulate a bunch of shows to
watch later on your own time the list of
channels includes most you'd expect from
a basic cable service with one big
exception
there's no CBS available you can add HBO
and Cinemax for just five bucks a month
but can't add Showtime at all and the
biggest exception that $35 price is good
for a limited time only on the hunter
channel package overall DirecTV now is
easy to use and satisfying if your main
goal is watching live TV but it has a
lot of strings attached that said many
cord cutters will want to at least check
out the free 7-day trial since there's
no contract you don't have anything to
lose I'm David Katz my foresee net and
that was a quick look at DirecTV now
