welcome to Google it's just for
everything Google you can think of now
the goog has released the final
developer preview of Android 8.1 and you
can get it now if you're enrolled in the
Android beta developer program it's a
free sign up now eight point one's
biggest improvement is finally enabling
the pixel visual core Google's first
custom-designed coprocessor for image
processing and machine learning now any
apps using the Android camera API will
now be able to capture hdr+ shots with
the update the final build also includes
improvements to the neural networks API
for fast on device machine learning and
other enhancements and tweaks now the
general consumer release for 8.1 is
expected sometime in December Google
also recently rolled out a feature to
pixel phones called smart battery that
will give users better estimates on what
to expect from their battery throughout
the day with smart battery pixel phones
learn from your overall usage habits
instead of giving you an estimate based
on how you use your phone for about the
last hour I know it's a subtle change
but really handy with a chart that will
even show you how you will most likely
use your phone throughout the day and
the last thing I want to hear about is
another pixel to issue according to
reports and forum posts some pixel 2 &amp;amp; 2
XL owners have been noticing their
phones are randomly rebooting and it
appears to be linked to the LTE modem
some have found switching a 3G
alleviates the problem which isn't ideal
but Android police reports the modem is
causing a kernel panic when the device
is in LTE mode but it's not clear
exactly what triggers it now even if the
early builds of Android point 1 don't
entirely solve it we're just gonna have
to wait for a real fix if this is
affecting you and the razor phone we
know about this one it's been out for
over a week now and it's the fruits of
razors acquisition of next bit
now it's another solid Android phone but
you've got to have at least one feature
that makes you stand out for razor it's
their screen and if you've never seen a
120 Hertz refresh rate on a phone it's
like butter and you'll be begging for it
if you don't already have the new razor
phone it also brings dual speaker
designs with Dolby Atmos compatibility
for a legit sounding phone there's no
water protection here and it also
follows the trend of removing a
headphone jack razor CEOs
it wasn't an easy decision but the
reason for the move was to fit in extra
500 milliamp e'er hours of battery juice
and improve the thermals for performance
they also include a headphone jack
adapter that has a 24-bit digital audio
converter for improved audio performance
and I kind of like the fact that we're
getting some real transparency here the
phone benefited from this move you know
at least that's what they're telling us
unlike a certain fruit company that said
they took it away because it took
courage the razor phone also even went
through jerry-rigged everything's been
test and this metal clad phone fared
pretty well it survived it was still
working which is more than we can say
about the previous/next bit Robin that I
look it pretty much snapped like a twig
dude does he work out and Android
authority reports a number of its
readers have been sent a survey from
Google asking about a potential YouTube
Edition smartphone with exclusive
features this doesn't mean they're
actually doing it but one of the
features asked about was a live
lockscreen that would allow you to tune
into live streams while the phone was
locked and another feature called
you twist which would allow users to
rotate the phone in landscape and
instantly access videos you might want
to watch a low res image was included
with this survey that showed a small
bezel and red buttons around a white
frame with a six inch display 2.2
gigahertz processor dual cameras and a
rear fingerprint sensor again this
project could be dead already but Google
is exploring its options and doing it
very publicly and we wrap things up with
a fun patent from Google discovered back
in 2013 that has now been approved
Google has been granted a patent for a
motorized laptop hinge that can auto
align with a user's face now we could
see something like this come to a future
pixel book maybe it's a fun idea where
there would need to be an area on the
outside of the computer to detect the
presence of a person when it's touched
and then once it did that it would be
able to open up but also continuously
adjust the angle and position of the lid
to keep it aligned with the user's face
for optimum viewing position like I
wouldn't count on a motorized hinge any
time soon
but if they were able to get self-lacing
shoes last year this is nothing compared
to that alright that's it for this week
you can email me at Google it's at see
Netcom or tweet me at brian tom thanks
so much for watching we'll catch you all
next time
some more of that google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
