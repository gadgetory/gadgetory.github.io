cool I've read a lot of your guys's
stuff you it's sort of like a different
i guess a different approach may be a
little different we're trying to give
people more than just the straight like
this is what happens in the game that's
right you shoot this guy we're trying to
get a little
personal speak the developers directly
about like what kind of people they are
which is a little weird but i think i
got it tries to give a little more color
into like the games that people will
make sense you get in the minds of the
developer then maybe the games that they
make make a little more sense but we're
also doing the other stuff too we're
right you know we're trying to hit it
from all angles for sure are you guys
doing your own gaming podcast as well we

you know do you feel 30 how can anyone
feel like an age that they not argue
that they aren't yet but you know like
people like oh you know what does it at
the janitor and third I understand I
don't ask me a third it feels natural
yeah like it doesn't feel weird that
doesn't that doesn't fly do you own a
few
30 of course not because no one can know
what it feels like to be an age they are
really having a funny because radio wait
let you go off for a while saying like
how could you feel a certain age you
know you are what you are birthdays are
stupid i like to have more years behind
you then you have a head well that's the
truth because there's no way i'm making
it the 60 this is not happening no it's
fine I've done what I've wanted to got a
good life you know my bucket list is
it's a short one now right and that's it
survive is your next when I look back on
my life I'd like to think that I've
accomplished what I've wanted to
accomplish yeah a mediocre show spent
five years on a mediocre podcast I mean
these are the achievements we take a
night let's just move on please that's
great someone side saluting there
is--there all right uh we have r us on
the show women speaking about the Mass
Effect controversy all week Bioware is
now sort of almost out of control I feel
like they're having a tough time doing
damage control in the way that they're
presenting their side of the story so I
want to get russ's insight on this
everyone knows that the mess nerds have
have sort of convened and raised like
seventy five thousand dollars worth of
charity it's charity so you know good
for them I'm fine that we were saying
that little maniac but it is a little
maniacal arm where do you stand on the
whole thing do you think uh it makes
gamers seem spoiled do you think
Bioware's doing the right thing in
entertaining / flirting with the idea of
changing the ending and what's actually
happening i'm also really curious before
you answer like is the ending really
that bad you know as someone who doesn't
play video games myself I could imagine
if it was horrible I'd be frustrated
that I have a great okay and to that
point you should mention that i have no
injured we're not gonna spoil an idea
right but what we can do is maybe we
just replace the names of character you
know I was havin eyes deceive a minced
let's compare it to another
disappointing ending in in film or game
day like they have another ending that
was
equally as i see i don't i think it's
would you think compared to like
Sopranos i think i actually think the
ending is brent is good i agree with you
i enjoyed the ending to soprano is it
like a dallas type thing who knows how
Dallas yeah this guy would grandpa first
of all I was only 15 now ah i'm trying
to think of something that we can all
relate to we're the thing that i've been
using over and over again i don't think
it does it justice because i don't think
they're on the same level is the ending
to back to the future three were sort of
just like meow but i think there's an
analog right necessarily that basically
without spoiling anything to the
complaint that everyone has with the
ending which i completely agree with is
that the whole series about making
decisions right making the decisions
that embed that are supposed to impact
something along Roger and what ends up
happening is that throughout mass effect
3 you these decisions do come up and
they do sort of effect like who you're
meeting a new you're working with right
but at the very end probably the last
three hours of the game is almost a
hundred percent static right ignoring
any decision it all sort of uh comes to
a head it all like funnels in right to
this bottle necked story which I'm okay
with that though like I'm I that's
invited it it bothers me that like you
said the entire trilogy focuses so much
on the concept of choice making and
giving you empowering the player but at
the same time I think these sort of you
know epic stories as you know as as
varied as they can be in in your
experience I think there is something to
be said for the fact that it should have
a finite conclusion that everyone sort
of experiences at the same time maybe
the path to the which you get there is
different but I do think it's okay that
there's one ending that everyone sort of
sees so I'll give you an example of a
situation of a game where there's lots
of player choice and there is sort of a
finite ending but you also see the
impact of your player choice in the
ending okay let me specify that I don't
think that like I'm not saying like damn
you by where for not doing this but this
is
what they could have okay is the 43 any
of the fallout games really right so all
those games have like this main
overarching story and then there's side
missions and like optional stuff you
could befriend people and at the very
end of the game this ron perlman
actually comes on right little voiceover
thing and explains to you basically what
happened because you did this thing
right or because you did that right so
like the best of both worlds right yeah
I'm again I'm not in a position to say
this is what Bioware should have done it
is 100-percent their decision and how
they should end the game personally I
would have found that a little more
rewarding of course but it is what it is
it is what it is I don't think it's fair
to almost harass them to the point where
they just seem like they need to keep
the the gang happy they need to keep
that sort of like horde of angry gamers
happy by giving in to their demands I
don't think that's cool I was very
surprised very surprised because they
released something before that Casey
Hudson who's like the series manager
yeah released a statement before that
saying like mo mass effect 3 the entire
game is meant to be the conclusion sure
and then like three days later the one
of the two studio co-founders
co-founders a bioware came out with the
statement saying yeah we're gonna we're
taking all the feedback and we're
potentially going to look at how to
flesh out whatever so it's it's amazed
they folded in seven well here's the
thing and I think what's not totally
been said is that I think this might be
a bit of a like a marketing twist
because we all know one hundred percent
they were planning on doing deals of
course it was definitely coming corso
for all we know they're gonna they're
DLC plan remains one hundred percent the
same yeah and it obviously would flesh
out the story somewhat because it was
going to do that anyway so now all
they're doing is framing it in a way
that's like oh and we're trying to help
out the fans that weren't happy there's
just a reframing of what they're gonna
do it so you're proposing that I'm not
saying that's true but right but you're
proposing that the DLC that was always
planning any journalist will tell you
they've been talking about this forever
right everyone knew this is going to
happen you're saying they're just sort
of like framing it in a way that oh okay
we've heard your cries and we've heard
your complaints maybe will pacify you
with this DLC
always planning this whole time right
exact all right I like that I think it's
I think it's smart because that's how
you you know it's like how do you keep
an idiot busy you know that sort of
thing I appreciate that but then you'll
see stuff is that going to be extra
content I can be an alternate ending you
neither know I know you'll do a tooth
it'll be like uh after admission yeah
and maybe providing more insight do you
think that will say shade the people
that are complaining about the ending
think half of them might be okay it
doesn't matter anyway it doesn't matter
they're gonna but that's the thing
that's why you're probably right because
who's not gonna buy this now you're not
getting a full story unless you buy this
play interesting interesting Lee enough
for three did the same thing they did
and they actually ended up well changing
the ending right like made you what does
it say what's your stance on that cuz I
asked you i was actually frustrating i
thought they did it really well hold up
there a unique exception to the rule i
feel like that fallout 3 was just as
close to perfection as you can really
get I think I still remains my favorite
fallout game out of this new vegas tough
I wasn't a huge fan if I know you liked
it I liked it yeah Oh more class saya
diehard new vegas guy i loved one and
two yeah I was I mean I it's been too
long um alright I want to move on in the
game world talking with you um here's
sort of an interesting topic that you
and I are exposed to on a seemingly
weekly basis in terms of the way game
reviewers are treated by PR companies
and by developers and whatnot kotaku and
this is we actually heard about this and
then our body Marlin from Trinidad sent
this in and said hey when Russ is on the
show make sure you talk about this with
them because it's a big hit and Trinidad
your dude you're huge you're on their
money um from kotaku and this goes back
to March thirteenth it says maybe video
game reviewers are con men maybe well
basically what it is it's sort of like a
whistleblower who goes by the name on
YouTube investigative journalism and
sort of provide some insight to the
whole debacle and maybe you know
controversy of whether or not video game
reviewers are in fact treated in a way
that they are persuaded quote unquote
bought for their good reviews obviously
this week with CBS interactive acquiring
giant bomb that came right into the
forefront because of the whole Jeff
Gerstmann incident with what happened at
gamespot stop spot a couple years ago
that was a big deal when I went down um
I mean you know it's a it's a really
delicate situation but we don't shy away
from stuff like that we want to tell you
I want to throw down the open what are
your thoughts on this the the the movie
that plays and it's long it's like 11
minutes and we encourage everyone to
watch a watch this rights it's it's an
interesting sort of situation it calls
out things remember after Duke Nukem got
the bad reviews their PR people came out
more like all we're gonna reevaluate how
we distribute condoms one guy was one
guy but it's you know it's it's a it's a
bigger picture sort of thing like that
what are your thoughts on this the the
the peace brings up interesting things
like we are essentially wined and dined
a little bit um you know when when
review packets come along and a game
review comes out there's a very
occasionally there's a very strict code
of conduct how you should cover a game
what chapters should not be revealed
right what spoilers you can't talk about
what do you what's your thoughts on this
so we'll take a few things first of all
this so obviously we go to like preview
events to check out games Jeff and I
were at one yesterday there's going to
be you know they'll be like snacks and
like drinks sure want it so there's that
I mean that's sort of a PR standard
thing for right sure and I want to
reiterate and especially if PPR people
are less I know some some of our friends
in this redo listen yeah we were cool
that yeah and that doesn't sway a
journalist either way that happens in
the editorials I have seen it for a
better word he's right its appeal is
worth doing this on the board are like
straight very very strict with
themselves about that where they won't
even take water yeah I think it's a
little changing review over a dyke
exactly and not only that it's all to me
you should be doing that you should be
providing stuff like that people are
taking time out of their schedule to
come to you it's sort of like of just a
gesture a nice gesture okay so that's
that um what were you talking about what
was the second one that you brought up
 um
the I guess that's the wining and dining
sort of aspect um talking about
guidelines for reviews oh yeah okay so
whenever there's guidelines for reviews
for example what you were talking about
where you can't talk about level 4 or
something like that yeah this is always
a situation where these reviews the
embargoes lifts before the game comes
out and from out from a publication
standpoint we have a decision to make we
can either take the early copy that they
send and run the review whenever the
embargo lifts like a week before the
game comes out and stick to their
guidelines because the reason we have to
stick the other guidelines is because
we're you know they sent it to his early
right or we can make a decision like we
don't want to limit ourselves what we're
covering and hold the review until the
game comes out day of launch right you
can say whatever you want right is that
is the reason why they restrict you from
reviewing those certain levels because
it's a pre-release game and it's not
gonna be the same one the customers will
get no no I think it's it's a spoiler is
this what you want to boil that in the
way you would make sense you would want
to do that finding a lot of embargoes
are lifting day of now anyway that's
true that's not noticing yeah that's
have been happening more yeah it's I've
never been in a situation where it's
like we don't want you to well sorry
that's not totally true there have been
situations will the in and when they
send a review copy that'll be like okay
so this thing is not working great but
we've got a day one patch coming so we
don't want you to focus that on that in
the right and that's when the alarm
bells right that's when I red flags
raised it almost always like a problem
that never gets fixed and so so when it
comes to a spoiler thing I personally
agree i don't think spoilers should be
of course of course but unless you're
telling me about the giver right but
yeah exactly yeah but if there are
gameplay elements that are a broken
share a major problem they need to be in
there and if that means you know the
only way they can be in there is holding
the review I think we owe it to the
readers to hold the review and whole
launch day do you think there's a
certain oh I I know there is and I know
you'll agree with me but let's talk
about the almost psychology of it all
the way that certain things maybe are
presented that sort of maybe steer you
in a direction that a PR person is sort
of
you know they were like the the mass
behind the people who represent the game
are sort of leading you towards maybe it
what do you mean saying like oh don't
like you said don't play chapter for
both because chapter 4 is kind of broken
stuff like that without actually coming
out and saying stuff like that do you
know what I mean I certainly come up
yeah because I mean we're playing
through the entire sure it's not like a
a lot of that stuff is marketing where
they like say like this is the best
multiplayer experience ever so they're
sort of saying ignore the Singapore is
not so good right sometimes you know
that might be the case so do you get the
impression and I do I want to know if
you do as well do you ever get the
impression that the games that the PR
people know our bed do you ever get the
impression that's they sort of handle
those games differently yeah well a lot
of publishers won't spend or tell their
PR people to spend as much time focusing
on them right right so they're yeah
they're handled differently sometimes
they're there are terrible games that yo
PR people will go you know nuts over for
sure because that's again it's what
their bosses are telling them to do all
right I don't want to spend too much
time on this it's very Insider E but I
feel like it provides insight that a lot
of people don't really know much about
what are you happy with the current
state of like the pr journalists
relationship do you think something
needs to change do you see any trends
happening that are like okay you know
what I could go without having this
happen again I so I don't want to make
any broad statements because the pr
journalist relationship is very singular
to the person that you're dealing with
greed and especially for publication to
publication um I just majority of them
are great people yeah what's that but i
want to say i do think there is an
element at which when you get to the
smaller sites are much more prone to
influenced by PR because they like a lot
of the reason they're making these sites
they're not making any money off of it
but they want the games so when you hear
stories about the duke nukem thing
that's sort of pushing those sites into
a situation where it's like okay well
you know we're you're not going to get
games anymore and that's like death to
them so you know that stuff's
unfortunate i wish that wouldn't happen
but for the bigger site it's a casualty
of the industry i think it's just the
way it works there that's PR firm
one that one there's 10,000 video game
review sites yeah you know all clamoring
for the same thing that's something that
this article talks about as well as uh
publishers threatening to pull
advertising dollars from smaller
websites or not giving pre-release
copies to those smaller size sure and
and if you're a smaller set that could
mean like you have to shut down weenies
get stuff on the hardware side without
insurance training not to send seen it
did not get an ipad early right everyone
not that early or li na cannot or
sometimes they won't send an invite to a
keynote event right that's that's good
or they'll send me one instead of seven
right there's a lot of stuff we could
all right a poster on you um alright
cool this is very insightful I
appreciate you opening up to us like
that your things little therapeutic made
was chronic let's take a break when we
come back much more with Russ rustic on
the 404 and we'll try and get some calls
a lot more fun with our good buddy Russ
fresh dick stick around more after this
this is the 404 mr effers the show where
we all sing songs
welcome back to the 404 an interesting
talk during the break you know it blows
my mind that draw something story it's
pretty remarkable something draw
something yeah I know iOS games so
you're familiar with the game yeah yeah
I have the game I play it what's the
story behind really you're playing games
they look at yeah yeah I know weird
right and this all leads to another
conversation but okay draw something the
the company that makes draw something is
OMG pop which of course i think is the
greatest name for a company great a
great if it's 2002 they'd be right yeah
73 kindergarteners what we should name
our company right we took the most
popular response and they're just
purchased purchased by zynga the mobile
social mobile gaming giant for 180
million dollars 200 plus 30 million for
employee retention and they have like 20
employees are like 40 whatever they're
bigger they're all disgustingly rich now
yeah I don't know how long it took them
to develop that game but it's not
exactly well made pictionary game is a
good game but I feel like it's a one
trick pony right i mean yeah aren't all
iowa games won't respond yeah and that's
part of the prompt do you think it's I
mean I we were just getting we were just
shocked at the value and in and who
decides that value well it's interesting
because the company that made World
words with friends yeah was is that was
Inga publishing go well think about them
as well right for like 65 million right
and then and that was like the most
popular thing yeah that was huge draw
something rose to popularity quicker
perhaps well yeah it was also you know
after everyone saw the growth of words
with friends suddenly the draw something
people could like have leveraged as for
more money yeah I ok I guy I can
understand that I was shocked well how
much it was I thought there was a
misprint I thought it was like 8 million
eyes I got that that's a nice just
change but no 180 million yeah but I i
don't get it i just don't understand
like where that value is or all I mean
and in these these free games with their
ads like are they really are are they
worth well that games that free ya know
Joe something's free it's free buddies
in Reverse you can purchase the air but
just means free game and most of the I
would
the majority people have the free
version no they don't surprisingly a
majority of my friends actually had the
papers have new colors right put that
what you're drawing maybe when I draw
like a peacock sure that's something I
want to be able to do but is I'm but I'm
curious though I feel like are the
numbers out on how many people get the
free one verse the paid one I'm not sure
I can't see that probably is very
interesting free is free i think more
interesting is the fact that Zynga has a
bit of a reputation when it comes to
seeing really cool ideas and then maybe
just taking them for themselves that ass
say it they've done it a few times most
recently with 30 tower tiny tower so uh
but interestingly enough there Tiny
Tower game i think was called dream
heights it last i checked on the app
store it was like rated like one or two
stars so people that was there was
enough bad PR for them that people were
actually aware of it right they've done
before were no one even noticed right
fill me in here what is tiny town tiny
tower was not is a popular iOS game it's
free it's like sim tower basically okay
and this tiny developer out in San Diego
made it and it was a huge success and
Zynga basically changed the graphics of
it but the gameplay is exactly the same
okay and that legally that is fine
you're allowed to do that because you
can't a copyright gameplay mechanics but
it's shady and not cool and think is
sort of notorious for doing stuff like
that right there also notorious for
suing other people when other people
steal their games which is just life is
the motor background I just it's it
really is in SE anyway it's it's just
interesting to see them actually pony up
the dough for this company right for
draw something right there's a lot of
money and it just shows you how much
money they just got sitting around
pretty staggering I mean I know they're
alive investigating pictionary game
right it's staggering I'm interested to
see what they do next what are their
connects but do you think and this leads
into something else that we're talking
about on yahoo games written by Chris
MRSA jury this is the video game
industry apples next victim I think it's
stuff like this that will give the
common you know Joe and Jane you know
iphone user that impression that yes
because think about it I mean I know a
blockbuster game I hate using it as an
example but modern warfare 3 that game
didn't cost 180 million dollars to make
probably lost like 60 like when all was
said and done but it made a hell of a
lot more money but you talked about that
once you're in those hundreds of
millions it's it's sort of people don't
see anything because the article is
basically saying that like there won't
be console games will just be iOS games
the article is basically uh is really
saying the same thing we've talked about
Amelia right like always talk about so
we do talk about this a lot but this is
a recent story and it's gotten so much
attention just because and and then this
whole draw something just feeds right
into it but we've never really gotten
russ's take on it so that's what I want
to know and I know you are a big fan of
mobile game but you love your console
gaming as well and by your gamerscore
everyone would know that so what do you
think in reality now I know yes you
cannot talk about mobile gaming or
gaming at all without mentioning stuff
like ipad and iphone games right but
where do you see it in the big picture
where do you see it when I it's
definitely not going away doors and
it'll only get bigger do you think the
video game industry is apple's next
victim do you think apple is gonna is
hiding something up their sleeve or
they're just going to put the xboxes and
playstations out of business I wouldn't
be surprised if when Apple puts the
apple TV out it had iOS games like like
downloadable straight to the Apple I'm
definitely going to happen and it's and
I also wouldn't be surprised if they
sold a controller with it that's to me
that's the big thing and I know they do
that's a console that being said do I
think that there's room for more than
Apple in the gaming industry oh
absolutely for sure this definitely they
can't take it over well look at what
when Xbox and Playstation when all those
consoles came out and 0 5 and 0 6 the
whole mentality behind all that was
we're taking over your effing living
room yeah and we're becoming the hub of
your living room area now it's not about
that it's like oh I'm on the run I'm
mobile I'm playing I think it's still
about like I still my xbox is the hub of
my like chick flicks and and whatever
I'm doing almost always involves my xbox
so it's still to a certain extent true
but there's this whole other part but I
don't think they're mutually exclusive
like I think there's always going to be
the mobile aspect cuz you're not your
house all the time course and then
you're in your house and when you're in
your house you don't necessarily want to
play mobile games right sit on it and
see something on the big screen that's
the point I want to make it as I think
that Apple is catering to a new type of
customers like someone like me that
would never play console games but is
still liking to be entertained when he's
on the toilet you know like that kind of
a better question is is Apple killing
portable gaming which is I think the
answer to that is yes I don't think
there's really any way you can get
around with it I know it's the short
answer no but I don't necessarily agree
i mean this 3d s is a had a tough time
it's still a tough time and Vita
obviously you know uh you know is gonna
have a tough time and the thing is
though is that the feet is good yeah
it's a great is a great sister it's an
awesome system the games on that some of
the games were really impressive um I
also 50 times more expensive than
tackling him and you know I had to beat
as much bigger exactly it's it's a
bigger piece of equipment to carry
around with you and I've said this
before like back in back in october i
was like no I've i wrote i got a little
bit of heat for it i said no there's no
room for anything other than phone
gaming on your phone i said all the 3ds
the vita vita wasn't even out yet I was
like go away get out of here at the end
of the day I know it's a short of
jumping to conclusions sort of situation
but it's kind of the reality of it all
if I have an iPad okay that already
takes out everything that I need to
carry what else do I need to carry
besides a phone right and now I'm going
to have a phone and iPad and a 3ds that
needs to be charged every four hours or
Vita that needs to be charged over five
hours or whatever the hell it is you
know it's just how many bags do I need
to carry her you know and that's I don't
know it's it's sad to say because Vita
and 3ds games are better than I picking
yep and you agree with that uh not
necessarily some are and some aren't but
you but don't you think there are
experiences found on the Vita and the
3ds that the ipad will never be able to
touch absolutely and I think vice versa
really what so excuse idolized for
because i don't think the Vita and 3ds
or design
and for short like if I'm playing a game
in the elevator for two minutes right
can okay of course that I will do this
like I said that it's it satisfies that
15 to 25 minutes you're in the waiting
room right that's what it's there for
and it's on your phone in the battery
lasts for a while yeah man oh man what's
gonna happen you just pull the polyps
you think they just pull the plug on it
all just like it's always like why
didn't Xbox ever you know come out with
something portable maybe they maybe they
see the writing on the wall with that
well I don't know you're still seeing
windows 8 gaming phones no so personally
do you guys use portable gaming devices
or you just go out with your phones uh
yeah I'm almost exclusively with my
phone Oh what I'm doing reviews they
find out maybe the ticket there yes
that's the funniest thing when do you
use your portable gaming console will
want to have to do a review of yeah I
mean you guys work in this industry you
have all of them I don't ever use I
don't bring mine around maybe if I want
to train for a long time I've been
flying a lot recently I brought them on
that it's really it oh man what's
happening to the world we're living
right p I don't know uh it's time for
calls in the public let's get to a few
before we gotta say goodbye time to show
the love a jig 6404 cnet
keep them in the vein of mobile gaming I
said yesterday I got a friend who cheats
at words with friends it's very obvious
have you ever come across somebody
that's like clearly cheating yes I can't
stand that these people should be
arrested and thrown in jail I wish there
was a way to like test yeah like you can
see like what their normal words are
again when they pull out something there
needs to be like a punkbuster for words
with friends um so let's hear about this
be4 for this is Suffolk from Stephen I
just listen to episode and I here at
mark talking about why you cheat where
the friends where scramble trying
whatever one he's exact reason we cheat
we do it just so people get butt hurt
that's all keeping butter all you know I
blow it out your ass talk about being
butthurt I don't you trade for you you
cheated words a friend you do it so do
people get butthurt yet not that's not
why I'm a troll it is not a reason and
hooch in like what other games do you
really cheat at is there like everyone
that cheats it like counter-strike with
like her mom or was like act that's the
same reason I understand but that's the
mess with you I remember in college that
it was getting tough to cheetah
counter-strike like it was you know what
I mean people find a way people find a
way and that's for a game that's a
little more involved where it's kind of
worth it yeah you can have more fun but
why would you cheat with the disposable
game weird exactly you're totally right
Justin it's a game where it's just quick
and easy and hey I'm passing time and
I'm gonna cheated this is like cheating
it's like if you could somehow cheated
tic-tac-toe yeah we're like
rock-paper-scissors get a life like
you're eating a five-year-old yeah it's
like taking candy from a baby is it what
it really is a spec a lot of my friends
are cheating at Draw Something to just
watching a stylist have you guys noticed
pace to jpg and yeah well I've ever had
someone write it out to me oh don't get
doing way to find out is it what would
you do that I want to get up to 48 turns
shut up yeah you loser I'm sorry call
your listeners boozers I'm just saying
if you cheat it's the only thing cheated
work with friends to me you're a loser
and that as what is 48 turns like an
accomplishment oh I don't know if you're
cheating if you if like you get to 50
does your phone spit out a hundred
dollars
where's the incentive if you could about
myself no you don't okay aha I just
started becoming a chromogen already I'm
just sayin of who would disagree with
that and get off my lawn I'm like Andy
Rooney are ya unbelievable um we got to
talk about this before we hit before we
gotta say goodbye Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles we've been on it all week can I
get your impression really what do you
think about the whole like amazing the
ninja turtle gate you think I think it's
a train wreck I think it's a travesty I
think it's last day as far away from
that French as possible I mean it's like
unbelievable it's not unbelievable I you
know considering every movie really but
the first one well I guess the secret of
the users kind of educating to the first
two were great okay but everyone after
that was terrible right and I mean so
like how long has it been set the
franchise was anything worth noting I
don't know you're right decades it's
unbelievable I read something so funny
other day like oh they're going to take
the mutant out of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles so we're taking the n out of
TMNT Oh Michael Bay TNT boom dynamite I
get it I think that's pretty funny why
why don't get it uh I don't get it I
spoke too fast no I I heard what do you
say we already have to do glow shins
like it like lotions it looks better on
reddit or added this out after yeah
it'll be fine let's talk about you guys
I've been catching up on your show and I
just have a few things that I wanted to
say first for the Ninja Turtles the
original comic was a parody of some of
the big other comics of the day like
daredevil in fact the original or
original origin story is that the booze
is in a traffic accident and it hits a
young boy cool before it seeps into the
sewers with the turtles and that young
boy is daredevil the foot is named after
when daredevil fights the hands and
there's many other references to that so
I think if they need a movie they should
actually include some of those
references and really kind of make it
more of a pop culture thing like you're
no chronic what all right there's a lot
of information to digest their first of
all how is the ooze in a traffic
accident was driving next it does their
chance for news on a motorcycle it just
doesn't fly the booze is like self-aware
they're all right well fine so a truck
carrying the news Ross to how dare you
take that literally up I didn't know
that did you know any of that now I've
never heard of any that have you know I
certainly didn't know that it hit a
blind kid named Matt Murdock who was
eventually gonna be daredevil is what's
been years but I didn't I thought
Daredevils rise to becoming daredevil
had nothing to do with I don't I think
it's like know it you're right another
but i think it's like this was like a
retailer alternate history sort of thing
that's the daredevil was unaffected i
guess by the use is what they're saying
it like just bounced off of him roll
down sewers and then data fact with easy
they're Devils with his power is just
the heightened sense of like a way I
didn't even need any magic powers it was
just because he was blind he just had a
super-sensitive center right man I don't
know yeah I mean maybe in this alternate
universe a little bit of those leaked
into his eyeballs and that it created a
sensitive right and do that and if I so
yeah that would be really funny yeah uh
would but when they actually do that
though but that's the thing imagine they
retold the story and incorporated
Daredevils a lot to take in it is odd to
take him but I think there's something
sort of intriguing about incorporating
daredevil into the TMNT etymology yeah I
mean yeah I would I would watch that
more than I'm going to not watch this
Michael Davers right also why was there
a rat hanging with turtles in the
beginning well okay we went over this
there's two versions there's a comic
version that says that uh I'm so now I
said that splinter uh came over as a rat
with his ninja master and then with no
and ros exposed to the use expose their
wrote expose these is I think what it is
is the first movie is actually quite
accurate to what the original comic was
it was the cartoon that had some freedom
with it and in the cartoon i can confirm
for sure cuz i remember it was like a
person that got turned to a rat right
yeah you sensei yeah I got turned red
every sin the movies is super dark too
and that's what the are we had a bunch
of colleges week saying the real Ninja
Turtles is like god it's like very
different see more like Raphael's like
in the tub ya ali ya do that let me get
started dark place because you guys ever
that yeah it's kind of Sydnor like
crying there's a lot of crimes like REM
playing in the background really
everybody hurts yeah they were playing
songs that weren't written yet that's
amazing though I gotta get rewatch that
tub see it's pretty deep it's like then
like April to drawing him yeah really we
just see where someone's drawing someone
else it's like heightened emotion yeah i
mean like super deep ninja turtle stuff
yeah you know they're there they're
mutants but they've got feelings they're
real people young little emo turtles I'm
