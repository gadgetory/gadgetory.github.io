and it's partnering with Lenovo to do it
take a look at this screen this isn't a
tablet per se this is a smart display
specifically this one's called the
Lenovo smart display this will come in
10 inch varieties which is what you're
looking at here as well as an 8 inch
variety it's due out this summer and it
responds to your voice commands just
like a Google home think of it like a
Google home with a screen attached so
different from a tablet this has
far-field microphones so it'll be able
to hear you from anywhere different from
Google home this thing will use the
screen to illustrate the answers you can
ask for directions and it'll pull up a
map you can ask for suggestions of a
bakery and it'll show you a number of
examples you can ask it to show you the
kids room and it'll pull up that video
on the nest cam unlike a tablet there's
no web browser you can't download your
own apps per se this is meant to be more
a simplified experience that combines a
screen to help get you the information
you need for your voice queries and make
full use of the Google assistant the
cooking instructions in particular are
pretty cool not only is it going to show
you step-by-step directions than the
ingredient list but you can say if you
don't know how to prepare one of your
ingredients you can actually ask for
additional help and it'll pull up a
video and guide you otherwise you can
expect all of the same skills you'd find
on Google assistant on your Google home
and Google's rolling out new
functionality along with this called
routines but on this not only can you
control multiple smart home devices but
it'll play your news for the day it'll
show you your calendar it'll take you
through the information you need to know
for your day or for whichever routine
you want to set up this one has a nice
bamboo background the other one has what
I'm told is called soft touch grey and
it looks really
cool there's lots of questions remaining
one is it gonna be able to beat the
Amazon echo - how is the Lenovo smart
display in particular gonna stand out
we're seeing lots of them here at CES
still I'm excited to have a Google
assistant that can not only hear me but
can respond to my questions visually and
this Lenovo smart display has a lot of
nice touches and even a few Easter eggs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
