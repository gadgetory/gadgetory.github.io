with the US government to the garden of
Google Google finally headed over to the
Senate for a hearing by sending over its
chief privacy officer Keith Enright in a
prepared statement he said we
acknowledge that we have made mistakes
in the past from which we have learned
and improved our robust privacy program
and read confirmed that there is a
project dragonfly he also said we are
not close to launching a search product
in China Reuters reports that Google CEO
sundar Pichai will appear before the US
House of Representatives he'll be
discussing privacy issues and concerns
that Google is biased against
conservatives the hearing will occur in
November but chai will also meet with
the president remember that change to
Chrome you know the one when you would
log into a Google owned site you'd be
logged into the browser as well yeah
that didn't sit too well with people
Google put up a post on his blog saying
changes are coming
beginning in chrome version 70 there
will be a new option in settings it
looks like this it says by turning this
off you can sign into Google Sites like
Gmail without signing into Chrome so
that means that if you do not toggle
this option guess what when you log into
a Google site you will be logged into
Chrome you got that the post reiterated
at the very beginning that the change in
chrome 69 was not all super evil quote
we want to be clear that this change to
sign-in does not mean chrome sync gets
turned on meaning your data wasn't sent
back to Google servers onward to uptown
updates
Google Maps has some new tricks first up
group planning you can create a list of
places by long-pressing each location in
the Google Maps app this list is then
shareable using any messaging app each
member of the group can add or delete
places they can also vote on a place
secondly Maps is replacing the driving
and transit tabs with a commute tab and
third music playback can be controlled
in Google Maps
during turn-by-turn navigation Google
revamped its Search app as well remember
that newsfeed thing on the left it had a
house as an icon well now it's getting a
new name discover with an amazing
asterisk logo there new where OS is

megabits per second let's talk about
that smart home gadget finally Google's
got a new device that's going through
the FCC it's listed as the interactive
video streaming device this most likely
is Google's rumored home hub my smart
price published images of what it says
is the home hub the device is similar to
the Lenovo smart display with a 7 inch
screen when it comes to styling it looks
googly white rounded kind of dull
looking also just recently Best Buy sold
a Reddit user what looks to be the new
version of the Google chromecast take a
look at the picture the new chromecast
looks to have a matte finish with a
Google G instead of the chrome logo so
it looks like we might get a new
chromecast at Google's October 9th event
speaking of that let's head on over to
pixel Park

pixel 3xl leaks anymore there's yet
another hands-on with what could be the
three excel on YouTube in the video the
pixel to excel is compared with the
three excel take a look
I'll wait okay my smart price also
published a video it says this is the
official Google pixel 3 excel marketing
vid in it you see all kinds of ways to
interact with the phone just just so
many leaks and there's one more thing a
Google teaser video this one's official
it shows people touching other things
and squeezing then ever tangle object is
squeezed in the hand it's probably
active edge we've call-up assistant by
squeezing but I want to believe that the
next pixel is transparent yeah let's go
with that too comment Cove this is the
part of the show will be shining a
spotlight on the most amazing audience
in the world
you guys friend of the show Luke Taylor
says YouTube music still has an
incredibly long way to go before I
consider switching from Google Play
Music feature parity has to be completed
before I'll trust the new system also if
you want more Chrome OS news look at the
latest info about Nocturne and Atlas
that have been floating around this past
week looking pretty good thanks Luke
there's a report of a new Chrome OS
tablet by Google it's reportedly
codenamed Nocturne and may be officially
called the Google pixel slate we might
see it very soon Mac says that was a
very brief mention of the new dark
pattern slash behavior of chrome 69
login without consent also please report
about the manipulation while deleting
cookies ads of chrome 69 deleting
cookies does not affect Google web
services cookies as they always persist
allowing continuous tracking thanks for
the info max I'll have to do some
research before I speak on the matter a
little further Dominic says well what
did you seriously not dive into Google
collaborating with a totalitarian regime
well Dominic we've covered dragonfly a
number of times on this program so
discussing it at length each time seems
repetitive Thanks to everyone for
