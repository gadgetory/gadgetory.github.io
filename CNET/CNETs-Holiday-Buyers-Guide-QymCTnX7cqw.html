fantastic little robot thingies scare
your dog with all we have to do is
follow us on Twitter we are at seen it
on Twitter and tweet at us with the
hashtag see net holiday that's one word
now here's a little bit of legalese for
you we can only offer this if you're
based in the US and Canada you've got to
be 18 years or older there's no purchase
necessary but why would there it's
Twitter and if you love reading fine
print go check out the rules at scenic
dot C ou slash holiday rules okay mister
Rick let's get to the deals what do you
have for us right now sure right let's
start with some audio so I'm the
cheapskate okay I'm not gonna spend
three four hundred dollars on a pair of
beats of course not not gonna happen
okay now at the other end you get the
twenty thirty dollar earbuds that you
know not really great they're okay but
we need something in the middle right
something that's affordable but also
sounds really good and that's what I've
got here these are made by one more and
these are called the triple driver
earbuds and they kind of occupy that
special place in between beats and dirt
cheap so huge
well it doesn't break it is a big so
normally these are a triple driver which
is better is good you will driver again
that's two and this is three normally
these are a hundred bucks viewers today
can get these for 75 with code
CNET 25 and actually that code will work
on everything on the one more site so
there's actually a quad driver version
of this normally 200 150 with the code
and you know I got a chance to listen to
these earlier and you know again I'm not
a fidelity guy I really don't really
care that much but they sound terrific
they've got the in line my senior year
staying here here they come with like
ten different sets of ear tips including
the the foam ones that give you that
really good seal comes with a splitter
over the box do you what do you prefer
normally I just go for like the kind of
silicone ones yeah if you really want to
block out that sound yeah you get like
that like like an ear plug would give
you yeah so it comes with those as well
sounds like this like this lot
oh yeah what about on air anything
because I'm not about the ear buds like
nothing fits at night right so you know
what's your with you guys general
preference like you go in Iran ear in
the ear hole okay in the hole well
mostly what I see are people the kids
nowadays they like the on ear headphones
and again there's always a huge price
range with these but today we've got
these discs in dh3 on your headphones on
my laptop here there we go so look they
look really nice they're very stylish
very comfortable and normally they're 50
bucks which is actually kind of a great
deal already
but today you can get them for just 25
bucks with the code
CNET love let's drop those down to 25
yeah and these are so these are
bluetooth but they also are corded so if
you preview
we don't want that loss of fidelity from
here bluetooth compression you can jack
in assuming you have a headphone jack to
plug them into actually I think because
of everything with the changes of them
of the adapters and the whatnot that
everyone's kind of putting headphones on
their list higher than they were before
absolutely absolutely so for 25 bucks
this is this is really a great gift item
you looks like you spent a lot more than
you did that's the best part of gift
giving make it look like you're way more
thoughtful absolutely cheapskate trick
ha ha
do we have one more are we gonna move on
right now let's do one more so Bridget
you promised you'd model me okay I've
been waiting for this yeah so these are
doesn't matter which so this looks like
yeah an ordinary wintertime cap but it's
actually a bluetooth headphone it's
embedded right yes all right now that
okay like I feel like sorry ladies it's
cool married wait a minute first off I'm
glad we got that right second of all
what are their speakers they're just
speakers like blessings meters right in
this resting it's like roads fabric here
but can I see what's interesting is like
invisible okay I got you so this is just
a hat that happens to be a Bluetooth
hello to speaker hat okay yeah what's
the sound quality like this yeah
nevermind guys okay the idea here is
that you know you're you're out walking
the dog right and you just want to be
able to listen to some music podcast or
whatever different I like a different
ear thingies for different situations
yeah my biggest concern is like the
music bleeding out and you know everyone
around everybody flip them up cuz they
pointed at your ears unless you just
flip it Rick
better hidden feature and a chair now
they're speakers so I want I want to
look like Parappa the rapper there you
go
so the actual deal is you can actually
get a 2-pack of these at home one for
yourself one to give away whatever from
uke stir I think it's the charger is
like can you wash these things I
wouldn't you can take out the speaker
part Oh Lord everything you can't
actually watch this cool yeah so
normally it's
thirty bucks for a two pack I ordered a
guess how much they were I'm sorry
so the coupon code is seen at ten and
that drops it down to 1997 so it's
literally ten bucks a piece and you know
Secret Santa you know Yankee Swap great
little gift item totally yeah I'm
impressed so far I don't have really
anything to make fun with that I never
seen that hat with Bluetooth I have not
I saw like this crazy Atari hat with
speakers on it that made me kind of
rethink everything but that's okay so I
walked around town New York City last
night with that on just kind of test it
out and I mean let's be realistic if
it's noisy you know they're not super
loud sure but just you know you're when
I'm walking around the neighborhood and
I'm walking the dog whatever it's nice
and peaceful that's great great
excellent
all right let's pivot and turn to
Twitter see what people are talking
about again if you want to be part of
the conversation all you need to do is
use the hashtag see that live okay here
are some coming in right now we'll see
we'll see what we can do with this well
I want to like we haven't been able to
do a lot of gift giving advice on all
these deals on mobile phones right but
we can definitely give advice on a or B
like maybe what phone you should get a
question that just came in from Julio is
hey everybody I have a question should I
get an LG V 30 or an S 8 plus these are
two Android phones kind of feel like for
me the SA plus it's probably the way to
go I know a lot of people have problems
with the lg screens the LGP 30 use of
the same screen as the pixel 2xl and say
have you ever seen those reviews for the
screen it can get pretty gritty and
Samsung makes the best OLED things for
phones so maybe they have an inside
track on that so if you care about
screen quality take this as a guy who
owned and returned a pixel to excel
because of this screen and a couple
other features that kind of stunk I
would go Samsung there yeah I feel like
that's the kind of movement just just to
play it safe I mean you know that's a
very highly rated phone on the CNET
website so if we're just sort of judging
things for what they are out of the box
maybe you side with the Samsung phones
these are phones that cost more than
$100 right yeah
really yes they're not friend they don't
flip or claim so they're not you can try
to clamshell them but only make it a
flutter let's see what else we got on
Twitter there's some really interesting
questions that probably deal with a more
personal family issue but nevertheless
we'll get right to it
Richard wants to know what kind of gift
could I give my dad to secretly tell him
I don't like him very much this is
actually a funny question because it's
deep it's like a it's like a price point
what kind of tech gift would you give
somebody to maybe undercut like I don't
think very highly of you I know the
Bluetooth hat sounds pretty was a few
years back I would say Microsoft Zune
yeah that's that's yep assail totally
like what would you get somebody to just
be like oh I would thought of you and
when I thought of you it was I don't
like you so samsung note seven oh yeah
let me collect it as a term I guess the
reissued version I guess you could get
him something that you clamp has voice
activation on it so anything you go oh
you just you just talk to it the pairing
and you're like hat pair yeah pair hats
yeah and then okay but then you're gonna
get a call is gotta be a stupid hat it
doesn't work with the voice control and
scene all right thank you for being a
part of our live interaction portion on
the program please keep it coming
we're gonna take a quick break but when
we come back we'll have many more
exclusive deals and we'll also discuss

what is the big techies are over six
foot two
hey welcome back to see Matt's holiday
buyer's guide we are live we are in New
York City my name is Jeff Bakalar next
to me is Bridget Carey Aya's Akhtar and
the CNET legend known only as mr.
cheapskate himself the good dr. Rick
broiler how are you chef
yeah he's a doctor a doctor deals yeah
sorcerer I'll take it ah we want you to
help us give you advice help us help you
you have a question for us let us know
on twitter using the hashtag
CNET live and we'll try and get you a
reply but first right now we want to
talk to mr. I is Akhtar hello let's talk
about all of the things related to smart
home tech what are some really solid
holiday considerations that you have for
the world of smart home gadget tree no
he's no in that question yet I'm just
waiting for it it's still trickling okay
so smart home stuff okay I'm a big fan
of the Amazon echo dot now this thing's
like 50 bucks you get for $30 refurb
it's really get the refresh $30 now they
still have it on sale I get a five pack
if you want anyway so it's week I'm not
even making that it's not gone well you
can get it anyway so it's really cheap
it's got tons of voice apps which Amazon
calls skills and the dot itself can play
music from Amazon Prime music or Amazon
music unlimited Spotify so you're not
stuck to Amazon if you don't want to be
the dot isn't the best with audio
quality so if you want you can hook it
up to an external speaker or you can
just get like the larger echo because
that's got pretty good audio and those
things come in really handy the dot the
Alexa devices come in really handy if
you have smart home accessories like the
Philips hue bulbs which I really love
yes know about these things I've heard
of them tell us about thank you but the
hue bulbs are just a great way to get
into small room stuff they're controlled
by a hub it can be dimmed at using an
app there's also hue bulbs that change
colors so if you like mood lighting if
you want to match your your wall to
chair horror movie you're watching you
know you're watching Nightmare on Elm
Street you can turn it to red it's
really pretty cool and you can attach it
to a Lexus you can tell it to change
colors and lastly my favorite smart
gadgets really more of an accessory it
is the Logitech Harmony companion
this thing is a universal remote control
so if you've got like more than one
device attached to your television like
a Roku TV or you have a Roku you have an
Apple TV chromecast whatever if you got
all these things attached to your TV
this thing makes it way easier to switch
from activity to activity it works with
pretty much every device you can think
of and it turns every iOS and Android
device you have into a remote so if you
want you lose the remote just find
another device there it goes and it also
integrates with Google home and Amazon
echo so you can start talking to it I'd
like to personally endorse that as well
I've been using Harmony remote I know
well you were like why did you use stuff
no yeah I have been using a Harmony
remote for like a 10 years or so and
they're fantastic and if this is your
first chance to get one highly recommend
doing it I've got a lot of consoles and
a lot of like jong-kook up to my my TV
and I've you know it's kind of a pain in
the butt to like explain it to people
when they come over you're like well
it's just one remote they're like
looking for like where's your volume
where's it no it's everything you know
consolidated into one I I'm a fan so I
can talk to it to like another thing to
talk to yeah I mean you know they've
they've evolved in a direction but
there's the the main core functionality
what it really does the kind of like
magic about it
that's the best part I mean do you have
one or well I have all that stuff so at
home my smart apartment anyway yeah I
usually get sidetracked so I'll set up
something on television I'm ready to go
I go to the kitchen start making a snack
and then I really realized - left the
television on so I'll doesn't yell out
you know Alexa tell harmony to pause it
pauses get to do what I'm doing then I
go back and sit down and then go gosh we
got to turn the lights off I go well
exit turn off the lights turn that to
red I get to sit be lazy I work really
hard to be lazy and smart-home stuff you
know just take a little bit of setup but
it's really fun when you get to sit
there and enjoy if you like sitting I
definitely I mean let's be honest Mart
home Tech is designed for the lazy man
yes that's its raison d'être and also
be able to just talk to your TV or talk
to your balls and like not like running
around like in the old days these Stone
Age days we're like flicking switches
angrily yeah Oh son I told you turn off
that light like no son Alexis
it's tough to show anger in those kind
of situations all thoughtful exit
doesn't hear you yeah you can hear that
my son will yell at Alexa go Alexa turn
off my room so you know what I just
found out I just found out you can
change the Alexa trigger words to
computer that is way cooler
it's very start like computer and play
this song for me or like computer what's
the weather then you find out that you
use the word computer a lot more than
you realize yeah but my I have a dot and
my dot miss here's me all the time I'm
saying something that sounds like Alexa
I guess but I haven't quite figured that
one out every other TV commercial to it
so it's for you
definitely so I mean would you recommend
an Alexa over a home it depends if you
want to ask random weird enquiries Alexa
stinks at that okay if you want to have
the the device that has the most skills
Alexa just been there for a long time
locals really play catch-up apples got
their device coming up I wouldn't
recommend that I don't think $400 right
you'd buy one of those go go home max
yeah home at home max is $40 as well the
home is live about 130 and the menus
about 20 I would say get a dot if you
don't have to pick one of the two right
now because they're just so cheap yeah
work pretty well I think and they're
connected to the most accessories right
now cheapskate approved yeah time oh
yeah because so cheap 30 bucks I know
you can't go wrong I feel like they're
basically free if this just about cuz
you know we're all gonna have listening
devices in our home so might as well
just give them away and you know right
don't think too much about that yeah and
every time I do it hurts my my head I as
you you featured the light bulb stuff go
into that a little bit because this is
something I've yet to get on board with
I'm not convinced I need to speak to my
lights so why should I invest it okay so
like I said I have an apartment and so
painting things is probably not the best
idea now some of these color light bulbs
I've pointed at walls yeah so if I want
to I can change the white walls to
different colors
now that's way cheaper than hiring a
painter or losing my security deposit or
painting it myself because I'm not
painting it but but why but why life is
more color in your life I don't know I
guess we're like good here can you give
me
period okay so like dimming lights yeah
that's about to normally don't dam also
they're all LED basically cause that
much money to run sure talking to them
more in particular if I'm doing like
podcasts from home if I want the lights
to dim by 50% instead of messing with
dimmers like literally can just ask it
to do it come on those lights turn on
can you program it to say set the mood I
think there's a couple of ways to do
that so if you want to get really weird
with it you can yeah just haven't named
the room something weird like you know
turn the boudoir to do where you go to
do you have a boudoir I'm playing do do
apartments have a studio in my partner
no I was the I was I was joking about
that so what about like so what was the
last product you talked about up in the
Harmony we talked to the homeowner that
harmony is just it's just hard now all
three things that you've talked about
you could probably string together in a
series of voice commands yeah and the
weird thing is if you don't have a dot
you can use the Harmony to control hue
light bulbs at this point or you can
just use your phone and control those
two things you don't need to have a dot
it's really if you just want to speak to
these things and if you have a Google
home you can actually use Google
assistant on your phone you can just
talk to it instead of like yelling out
hey Google or type to it because you
don't might not want to talk you're not
a very talkative person when it comes to
speaking to your home are you know in
fact you don't have any of these in my
house because of like worries that the
government will somehow use it against
us sometimes but now I like playing with
them though here yeah I before we move
on to Twitter stuff I find it very kind
of soothing to just you know play games
with Alexa and sort of just like you
know see what kind of a rabbit hole you
can dig yourself into you're not about
that jeopardy on Alexa there's there's
some fun to be had you've got jeopardy
you could say inspire me you know give
like an inspirational quote it's is
there's like like I said thousands maybe
like tens of thousands of skills that
allow say like you're talking about mind
games though you're you're trying to
play other kind of game oh yeah I'm also
trying to like constantly and see if
like Alexa is like sentient sort of can
she tell you the meaning of life right
right always and like secretly like also
you know
trying to manipulate her at the same
time the worst thing is when you call it
by the wrong name I'll say hey Google
and I'm like I'm talking to the echo oh
no oh wait you have so you have both I
have way too many of these things Wow
well my brother gave me a bunch for
gifts so here's a bunch of dots oh my
god I don't need three dots in my
apartment means 600 square feet they can
all hear me but the dot and the Google
home devices they also have the ability
that the nearest one will answer you
know they're not all answering you which
would we radnik yeah that'd be
absolutely insane Oh a multi-room audio
don't forget that too
uh Emma's on finally added that yeah
right but does the Google home do that
to Google home did multi-room audio from
day one I want to say okay
so you're talking about different
streams coming from different rooms so
if you wanted to say hey play this song
on all the Google home device gotcha
you could do that in Amazon I think you
have to go to the Alexa app group them
it has one thing and then you could say
play music in this group and it'll do
that that was something that's like kind
of that taking on Sonos right but it's I
don't still don't know if it does
easier Sonos but to get into a
multi-room audio either ones a good
stuff so cheap
all right bridge is gonna take us back
to twitter in just a second last thing i
just want to say if you go into the
Alexa app on your phone you can listen
to every time you've spoken to Alexa
that will freak you right out anyway
take it away with Twitter stuff yeah
let's see for wondering um Oh game
question this isn't going pretty well I
can do that lay it on me the ps4 slim
yeah alright is this gonna be something
that's gonna be good for the next four
years or better to go with the ps4 Pro I
guess that that thought of paying a
little more for the for the future
proofing that's a good question
surprisingly no ke yeah four years is
like kind of like the you know weird
spot right because I think for I mean if
for years there'll be another
PlayStation but I think if you're
looking at investing in a PlayStation 4
slim for the specific time frame of four
years that's probably not going to do it
for you yeah especially if you're gonna
own a 4k television at some point in
your life I mean III don't think all
that stuff is sort of cracked up you
know worth it at this point but
there is a lot of content that's coming
out in 4k on PlayStation 4 Pro some of
it actually looks pretty damn good so if
you think a 4k TV is going to be in your
future and you know you're sort of like
weighing the pros and cons I would maybe
wait a little bit for a pro purchase
maybe when it gets down to maybe $400
I'm sorry at $300 even because it's it's
for right now but during the holidays
right now you could probably add up
around 350 so yeah I think the slim is
maybe not the the choice for right now I
mean it is very cheap you can get a lot
of mileage out of that but maybe you
know you have a lot more to think about
if you're specifically aiming for that
4-year kind of sweet spot so the VR work
with the slim as well it will yeah the
VR works with all the consoles and if
you use it with the pro there are a
couple of sort of you know fidelity
improvement advantages you'll get
they're less more obvious than than what
you get on the actual pro with standard
games so that is something to consider
as well okay another gaming question oh
let's do it very generic they're just
like I get a gaming PC or do over my
console I guess the eternal question
well it depends on what you're looking
for I mean if you get a if you're
spending you know a couple hundred bucks
on a gaming PC you have a very large and
seemingly infinite library of games to
be able to play at your disposal I'm
more sales right now on laptops and PCs
- yeah I mean I wouldn't necessarily buy
a laptop for gaming but if you wanted to
build like a thousand dollar PC you will
probably be very well served for you
know I'd say the next three to five
years so you're gonna get a lot more
mileage out of that when you buy a
console you are locking yourself into a
very kind of closed platform
I think ps4 does a better job of opening
its arms for for more variety and games
and whatnot but yeah I mean for me I
kind of play everything I
and on PC so that hopefully answered the
question yeah there's another question I
don't know Rick if you've seen any deals
on Mac books I know Black Friday Cyber
Monday there was like so much but people
are wondering it's now a good time to
buy a mac book but MacBook desktop is
what they wrote I think they know I know
yeah I think I think that's what they
mean yeah the MacBook desktop but even
so like I don't even know if any Apple
sales are hitting your it's a tough one
you know anytime I write about any Apple
product at all the response I get is and
you call yourself a cheapskate
you know true yeah they don't really go
hand-in-hand
yeah so the one thing I do advise people
always when you're shopping for Apple
anything is to look for refurbs
and I mean specifically on the Apple
site in there barely you can find it at
the bottom and a little tiny length the
clearance page where they sell
refurbished gear the beauty of that from
Apple is that everything you buy
refurbished from them has a full
one-year warranty same as new if it's a
tablet or a phone they give you a new
battery new outer casing the whole thing
so it's literally as good as new but
very often for 10 15 even 20 percent
less than new so that that's almost
always going to be your best bet for
anything Apple all right excellent thank
you very much that is mediocre
acceptable it's just it's a very tough
it's a very tough thing to talk about
because when you talk about Apple and
sale you're talking about oil and
vinegar it's just not really the thing
that that meshes all right we have all
of our top picks in our holiday buying
guide that's up on the site please go
check that out for now we're gonna take
another break but when we come back
we'll have more exclusives from Rick

an expert in what's called trial science
I studied the juries behavioural
patterns we know what they're thinking
from the beginning everything my team
learns allows us to assemble a mirror
jury that's scary and it's predictive
efficiency well know what - Terry's
gonna bring back well no because that's
what we do
Michael Weatherly is bull CBS Tuesday's

just cool it
hey welcome back to CNET's holiday
buyer's guide I'm Jeff Bakalar joined by
Bridget Carey eyes Akhtar and the only
guy cheaper than my great-uncle Milton
mr. Rick Roy - we're taking your
questions live just use the hashtag seen
it live on Twitter and remember if you
want a chance to potentially be possibly
impossibly statistically speaking one of
the ten sparrow mini robot winners that
we're giving away follow us on Twitter
and tweet out at us using the hashtag
seen it holiday that's one word there's
no purchase necessary but you need to
check out the rules at sea net dot cos
slash holiday rule don't worry I'll
tattoo it on my forehead for you so you
can see the URL that is commitment right
there but you that's how I get no I
can't it hurts only have one time yeah
do that everyone gets one all right
let's let's pivot over tires you got
yeah Rick I gotta ask you some more
questions here it's like well more like
one question you got any more exclusive
deals that we could check out as a
matter of fact I do
good otherwise we're screwed yeah we
need to fill this I got a lot actually
we can really need to cram some in here
so uh first let's talk audio uh whose
Spotify Spotify user Bob yeah yeah okay
so what is it you know Spotify you get
it for free what does that mean just
because I steal doesn't mean you're
gonna drag my laundry I'm a Google Play
guy okay weirdo alright well most people
get Spotify and pay for it
yeah and if you're a Spotify user here's
something you gotta have okay does this
remind you of anything
Oh an iPod iPod shuffle a blessed memory
uh uh so this is called the mighty and
this is actually a standalone
disconnected although it does connect
but it's a standalone Spotify player
oh just Bob what do you always modify
yeah only all of the music ever oh I
still use Pandora
oh there's Spotify now
that's adorable but no for grown-ups we
didn't sell euros so the mighty sinks
with your with your Spotify account and
all your playlists and everything I
think it holds up to like a thousand
songs and so you sink it over and then
now you take it with you to the gym or
you take it with you wherever and it's
got a little clip just like the shuffle
did and simple controls and bluetooth so
it can pair wirelessly but it also has a
headphone jack because some people like
that and so the deal normally the mighty
sells for 86 bucks but there's a special
link that will appear somewhere
hopefully right here maybe if not it's
on cheapskate post you can find the link
to this it is 73 bucks and you just
click through to that special mighty
landing page and you'll get it for 73
bucks
great gift particularly roses like if
you go to the gym that falls on the
treadmill you don't mind that falling if
I'm following you're like exactly it's
the Spotify experience without your
phone basically alright I have nothing
bad as that sounds actually very like
I'm waiting for something no I think
it's good actually I've been talking
about everyone's talking about gifting
Spotify like gifting subscription
services now because they don't know
what else to give people they're like
well I can enhance your life and maybe
if I wants to give to me a Spotify
subscription clearly it's true
thoughtfulness is I'm giving you we can
only give away subscription service I
don't know the Spotify user who has
everything yeah
mighty there you go which is also the
URL by the way get mighty alright what
else is there okay so let's stop we were
talking bout the PlayStation so let's
talk about a blu-ray player because a
thing still apparently and alone blu-ray
player and this is an LG up8 70 and it's
being offered by buydig it's normally
110 bucks but you can get it for let's
see what do we want to be giving that
away for today for 80 bucks with coupon
code blu-ray Rick because why not you
can got your own I got my own code and
now there's another one coming so what's
unique about
this particular blu-ray player is that
it supports 4k so you bought a 4k TV
you're like we're going to get content
for this thing now you can get some 4k
blu-ray discs yeah it's got a Mac it's
got a back it's got a front and a back
and two sides what and if it needs to
make a phone call it's okay my joke is
you're trying to have some fun over my
head you know I don't I don't still deal
with physical media myself you guys do
but like apparently there's a lot of
people out there who still like their
discs know that you know it is I think
like we were having this conversation on
a podcast couple days ago I think there
are still enough people for whatever
reason like blu-ray is kind of resonated
maybe not in the same way DVD did but
like people want to own like The
Criterion and they want to own like
their special feature the highest
resolution possible and it's better than
streaming quality for the most part it
has two different times there's content
you can't get streaming like I'm right I
got the tick the 90 series on DVD is a
gift and I'm like how do I play this
because it's on disc and it might put it
in my blu-ray player and it died gives a
PlayStation 3 which I never goes oh it's
that how to buy a blu-ray player that's
a good deal and of course the
PlayStation is a blu-ray player yeah
right yes 1 X will do 4k right but if
appeal gets warm not to 4k so you need a
4k blu-ray player here's a chance to get
one for 80 bucks good yeah again two for
two
well really like six minutes yeah yeah
alright one more before we uh before we
got to get to toys and Bridget alright
so let's talk about power everybody
needs a charger when they're on the road
right so this one from Ralph's power
it's the Tower of Power right it kind of
looks like sort of a chunky mobile
charger but this one has a special
feature OS outlet built in so this can
actually like a twenty thousand milliamp
charger which is surprisingly compact
and surprisingly light and it can
actually power small appliances so you
really actually plug just about your
refrigerator small oh it looks like a
thermos
yeah and so it also has a regular smart
USB port of course and a USB C so if you
have a type C laptop yeah and charging
it from that it does quick charging does
quick right just does all the things and
this is actually kind of a growing
category now I'm sorry I see a lot more
mobile chargers that have an outlet
built in because sometimes you just
don't have the right cord when I heard
this is like great for people who are
like doing outdoor like like things or
even just like like storm prep oh you
know you could take a camping with you
honestly and you know like you need to
plug in a little fan a little light some
sort of you know smart ever yeah yeah
the color-changing kind it's a bit gonna
like you know be out there at least make
it look good yeah absolutely so normally
this so this is brand new and actually
normally this is this is 80 bucks which
is so yeah a little pricey for a mobile
charger but again outlet and with code
Ric code that's just like a trick code
it's $70 so it's not a huge savings but
it's something and you know okay pretty
cool for a gift if you know somebody who
is always looking for an outlet yeah I
mean that's the thing the outlet is
really like the deal maker right here
that is so freaking cool alright
excellent bridget is it metering let's
talk about toys your desk started to
look like I fell short so you might as
well see what you have to hear about
some of the coolest gifts for kids this
holiday so yeah I've been kind of
digging the whole like tech toy beat I
gotta say and have you seen these guys
no hottest toy yeah that's not how to
store the air right here that's it it's
called the fingerlings it's the it's a
monkey I've even seen knockoffs already
at the mall just like random monkey for
your finger like potato fingerlings and
yeah there you have all these motion
sensors in them and every kid's going
crazy for them there that they retail
for 15 bucks it has sensors for like set
like hearing you talk to it or kiss it I
just turned it off to him it doesn't go
crazy but um I feel like all the tech
toys now or I'll pass this along are all
about sensing your sound your motion so
you talk to them and I'm getting rid of
like the whole iPad
an iPhone connected thing yeah you can
turn them on the backers will switch and
I mean if I get too wild if I start yeah
yeah if you flip them and I go cute does
it make me to like bet that license that
there's no way yeah and well there's all
okay so there's another one I love Abela
I don't have you seen this
babydoll robot but it's a little bit on
the low side I don't I mean some girl
might say creepy yeah but like so many
ways to move and talk so it remember how
the fur bait Furby learned you know the
more you played with it the same thing
starts talking more English than where
you play with it senses all the
accessories that you're gonna lose like
the baby bottle like a pacifier knows
when you bring it to her lips and and I
was like five different places to tickle
her so yeah now it's all about like
making it more and more realistic no no
freaking demon bear gift for the gift
you want to give somebody you hate yeah
demon baby
it doesn't stop talking a lot of these
stories will just keep I was like at
least there's an off button and I'm
telling you you take the batteries out
of that thing it's still working
[Laughter]
it's been around I don't like how it's
always surprised at everything that was
bothering my great gift we burn that
footage so another one that is like a
classic 80s toy that came back this year
everyone's kind of going a little crazy
with this one I've seen it even sold for
more on from eBay for people just trying
to find it man yeah it's normally a
hundred but they took the same exact
stories from when I remember having
Teddy and of course they made them
lighter cuz there's a cassette player
you don't want but in any put animated
eyes on them and now everyone who you
know was a kid back then and has a kid
again is like I got a habit for my kid
and I kind of fell in you know in that
trap a little bit myself but yeah Teddy
Teddy thousand dollars and Teddy's back
yeah I didn't you probably presses pause
and saying he's got some big eyes
yeah lots of why you're scary I didn't
realize just like horror toys
I just turned them off out there there
you go there's a little bit narrow his
eyes are all done I've never had a toy
with empty eyes before but there you go
that's that's the future for you um a
little more fun now all right last one
this is one of my favorites though it is
the new r2d2 from Spiro and it's
normally like a hundred and eighty but
like it's a hundred dollars now on the
web away so what you do is you connect
it with your phone and this thing if you
if you can get it on the on the table
here it is so realistic with all the
sounds if I just kind of go on oh you're
gonna go yeah and the even does one
where if I think this is the one we're
like he kind of has a flip-out moment
yeah it's got the little leg that comes
out I mean everyone everyone is gonna
love this thing okay we'll be back for a
sequel I bet that's fine he's seen worse
he's seen much worse oh I think that was
another holiday that's for sure with the
movie I guess he just wasn't liking the
live show that much we have to take one
last break I promise it's the last break
but when we get back we'll share a few
more exclusive deals and announce more
winners and give that little guy some
CPR we'll be right back
my daddy was always saying to me if you
want things to change get out there and
be the change
if anyone can bridge the gap between
that community in the police it's here
we've got this together
SWAT Thursdays were streaming live on
demand we just saved a woman from being
tortured it's okay
I'd call it a good night's work
you can hide
you make it back home make it back home
to us we got this
CBS Sundays I have created the hub where
people can submit and dissect evidence
when it comes to crime solving we vet
any evidence and then put it up with the
stroke of a key Oh minimize real-time
crowd-sourced crime solving are better
than one to uses have you seen this man
people want to be a part of something
meaningful they're doing it on their own
wisdom of the crowd CBS Sundays
Thursday's the brains behind the Big
Bang Theory boldly go where they've
never gone before everybody excited to
start school I am high schools a haven
for higher learning no dear God when
you're a nine-year-old genius oh dear
yeah oh yeah this is an exact science
I saw one boy with a t-shirt that said
yeah that's terrible
young Zelda new comedy CBS Thursdays
all right thanks for sticking with us
this is the last block of our live show
thanks for being a part of this whole
magic day my name is Jeff Bakalar along
with Bridget Carey Aya's Akhtar and seen
its original cheapskate the man who has
literally never paid for anything his
entire life mr. Rick Broyden that's a
big accomplishment mr. Broder okay all
right so we're gonna want to announce
the potential winners soon but first
we've got some deals I think let's crank
the okay we got lots of bonus deal who's
a big bonus deal day so let's just let's
just get to these so you talked about
the echo dot earlier and if you pair it
with a speaker now the dot is suddenly
like like a full size it's the whole
smart-home thing so one speaker I have
that would make a good match with the
echo dot is this one from damson audio
and damson is actually based in the UK
and they make some of the some of the
finer audio gear out there and so this
is a portable Bluetooth speaker and as
you can see it's kind of space-age it's
it's very nice-looking I think and this
would be just as home as this would be
just as at home on a bookshelf is it
would be like something you take with
you someplace because it's portable
right and the deal on the speaker
normally it's $90 but you can get it for
a code that is TBD I do not have the
code I'm trying to say you gotta get you
gonna it's Rick something I'm sure it
will be that's right
cnet.com slash 50 will be the price for
this $90 little speaker so again a great
match with the echo dot nice gift item
oh speaking of code I just gotta say
sorry to Lewis on Twitter at chief gut
master he says and during the show we
keep activating his dodge I apologize no
Alexa buy everything you sell sorry
cancel dad's all order angry
else coming okay what else you got okay
so Bridget earlier you were talking
about your phone and particularly what
happens to your phone over the course of
a given day life with a one and a half
year old is very interesting when you
have a smartphone
I just keep mine in a ziploc bag yeah so
as we've probably all heard or at least
read you know your phone picks up quite
a lot of germs and other nasty stuff
oh it's Philip ooh yeah everyone has poo
particles in all their life they don't
even realize it oh that's different than
like full of food I wonder how many
angry things we'll get for that I'm just
saying look it up look it up it's
science so what do you have on poo
as you should be this is called the
phone soap and actually yep best one for
laughs okay so this was actually a shark
tank thing actually so this is a UV
coffin for your phone and put your phone
in and index it in just ten minutes
no your phone soap device will kill all
germs on your phone I guess it's UV
light just UV light and you put it on
you can charge basically give it a tan
it's like it's handing bed for your
phone that would be so cool okay I'm
gonna drain it comes out a different
color
all right so normally the phone slope
runs $60 and with code seen at 3:00
excuse me seen at 10:00 you can get it
for $42 so it's pretty substantial
discount and actually that code works
site-wide so it's 30% off everything
that phones hope offers right now and
you know if you're concerned about germs
and this time of year for the flu it's
going around put your phone in the phone
soap and clean it no I I would use it
okay yeah you would you I would well I
actually disinfect my phone every day
wow it sounds it sounds like I'm a
germaphobe but my kid like is always
putting her mouth on and grabbing it I
want to make sure she doesn't get sick
so I just a little spray alcohol I
this is all for like a good cause right
like you're getting your phone clean and
whatnot I just is there like a phone
germ epidemic I guess are people like
getting sick the world is great I know
that is all the time like your keyboard
is is dirtier than your toilet seat and
your phone and the same thing that's the
trick it sounds gross if you have an
immune system well we have immune system
right no you're better off doing that
than just you know leaving it in cleanse
like oh maybe I'll use it on the toilet
we all know like okay totally yeah I'm
on board you got something that whoa
where'd that come here we go all right
I'm not really a tech item but you know
I got I didn't use a cup of coffee right
about now so if you like a single serve
cup and you're not wild about the whole
Couric thing with the pods and the waste
and all of that this is a ninja single
serve coffee maker it's the C f-111 I
believe and over at where who doesn't
have this sorry this is daily steals
this is a hundred bucks I think it's
actually priced even higher than that
most other places but they have it for
$70 with code ds5 and it will do just
has a permanent filter you just put in a
scoop of coffee put your mug down you
get your coffee frapps the little man it
has a milk frother Wickle you know what
I had never frothed
any milk before but my wife has actually
made me a convert like you put some
frosting really yeah it's the thing and
the froth or it's cool yeah and it looks
cool two knobs and buttons and which is
we know indicative of a good prop of
course yeah so what are we looking at
how much so that's so it's just 70 bucks
with the Internet hang on seven am i
right seventy bucks less but for a
little bit time $69.99 just for you with
code ds5 over it daily steals
sideways with that no pod waste no pod
wave that is a huge epidemic yeah it is
do we have time for one more will you
tell me yes we have time for one more
deal okay let's let's talk home security
a little bit okay all right so these are
these are going nuts right now everybody
seems to want the home security camera
the Wi-Fi camera and this this is one of
them this is actually from a company
called fuss scam and this is the amcrest
Wi-Fi
home security camera and it tilts and it
pivots and it zooms and it does the
whole thing and it can be controlled by
your phone it send a live feed to your
phone or your tablet or your computer or
what have you and normally this guy is
60 bucks but with the code that again
will appear online because it's too
weird for me to see the log and lots of
letters and numbers in knocks it down to
50 bucks okay so a little bit of a
savings here and again the the key
takeaway here is that these cameras used
to cost 100 150 200 dollars and a lot of
them still do but you know we can detect
motion it can notify you if it senses
anything it can save video to the cloud
kind of does all the things it's 50
bucks so does it play them around the
house you know like everyone's going
crazy with how cheap Amazon made it made
there the little cloud cam right this
was cheaper than that cool thanks Rick
