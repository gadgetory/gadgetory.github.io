appliances and right now we're taking a
first look at the Samsung slide in
induction chef collection range with
Flex duo oven so what sets this range
apart is its induction cooktop it uses
induction technology which uses magnetic
fields to get the pans hot but the
surface of the cooktop remains
relatively cool induction offers high
performance cooking so you can turn the
dial for the burners you will get a
pretty quick response in the performance
of how hot the burner is or how cold the
burner is now outside of the stove
making strange noises there's not much
going on that you can tell
Samsung tries to address this issue by
ringing partially the edges of the
burners here with LED lights that glow
with a blue light that it kind of
replicates the look of a blue gas flame
and it also looks very handsome I have
to say Samsung also includes what it
calls a flex duo oven technology
essentially it's a divider that goes
inside of the oven which is essentially
one big cavity but you can actually
split the oven into two cooking zones so
you can have bacon up top and muffins
down below or fish on one part and maybe
something that's more delicate on the
bottom so it offers a lot of flexibility
and control over what you can make in
your kitchen now there are drawbacks to
the Samsung induction range it's
expensive going to cost close to $3,700
that's a lot of cash to drop on a small
cooktop it also only has four burners on
the top for cook zones on its induction
cooktop up here so the Samsung slide in
induction chef collection range
certainly packs a lot of really nice
features in a very compact package
that's attractive and easy to use it is
very expensive though so you have to
bear that in mind you can get other
induction ranges of similar size from GE
say for five hundred dollars less but it
doesn't have some of the other advanced
that Samsung offers like the ability to
split the oven into two cavities that
you can control separately be sure to
