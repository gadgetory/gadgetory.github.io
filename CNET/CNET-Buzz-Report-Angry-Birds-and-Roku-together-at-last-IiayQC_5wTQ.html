buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
anonymous targets Facebook and I'm not
having it blackberry just wants to be
left alone and the coolest smuggling
ring ever but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
Roku 2 XS which we are calling the best
streaming media device under a hundred
bucks actually that's what we call the
last 12 but now you can buy a version
that includes a video gaming remote and
it has angry birds on it Angry Birds
Roku and angry birds my two favorite
things together at last plus more
content smaller size blah blah blah go
get one you'll love it and now for the
news the hacktivists at anonymous have
announced their next target facebook
they say they're going to destroy
Facebook in fact on November fifth 2011
which is guy fawkes day now anonymous
says that Facebook needs to be destroyed
because it's turning over personal
information to the government and spying
on us which I know I mean I guess that's
bad but what about my spying I need
facebook to find out if that one chick
went to that one party and flirted with
that one guy I like and I need to know
who got fat from high school and what
about my scrabble games anonymous and
where am I gonna post pictures of my
food Molly you think that's bad November
fifth is my birthday how is anyone going
to know Duke that's my birthday too
happy birthday yeah oh yeah that's
really bad that hurts anonymous can't
you just stick to like banks and evil
governments I mean we already knew that
Facebook was bad when we signed up
moving on in the news whenever there are
riots as there were in London all this
past week there also has to be a story
about how social media helped organize
the riots but in this case police found
that London's riders were using
blackberry messenger to coordinate their
looting partly because the service is
private rather than public like Twitter
but also because something like thirty
seven percent of the youth in England
use blackberrys who knew research in
motion then issued a statement saying
it was trying to help the police find
the looters but then hackers defaced to
the blackberry blog with a very
threatening letter talking about seeking
revenge even on rim employees over rim
cooperating with police meanwhile you
know those poor executives over a trim
are sitting there like come on okay you
just leave us out of this we have enough
problems right now I mean have you seen
iOS 5 mango even score one for Apple and
the great Apple Samsung pissing contest
of 2011 a judge in Germany says Samsung
cannot keep selling the galaxy tab 10.1
anywhere in Europe well except the
Netherlands for some reason and then
Apple got so excited by that ridiculous
ruling in it's ridiculous patent lawsuit
that they're also suing motorola over
the design of the xoom tablet the design
bite me Apple and another Apple related
news it's time for my favorite segment
the balls on China Chinese police shut
down a smuggling operation that was
sneaking iPads and iPhones across the
border from Hong Kong how well this is
the balls Park allow me to demonstrate
first the smuggler shot a crossbow from
Hong Kong into shenzhen province then
they zip-lined bags with apple stuff
across the border so they wouldn't have
to pay import taxes authorities caught
the smugglers after a sting operation
and they say they don't know how long
the zip line scheme was active no matter
how long it was active it was awesome
and finally the return of another
favorite segment of mine definitely take
a break from worrying about the stock
market and the global economy in the
erosion of every safety net America ever
promised anyone won't you the Sun is
coming to kill all our tech sometime
between now and 2013 a solar flare
Tuesday was the strongest one since 2006
but luckily it was facing away from
Earth so we didn't see much impact but
scientists say solar activity is
increasing and it will peak around 2013
and if the flares get strong enough they
can mess with GPS
cell towers make electricity go haywire
or if they're as strong as the
carrington super flare of 1859 they
could lead to a geomagnetic storm that
does who knows what to our tech he'll
probably just brick it all and leave us
in the technological Dark Ages see you
feel better about the economy already
right or something and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone i'm molly
wood and thank you for watching just oh
just bounce so hug more no hoes I'm just
kind of look away I said high-five
high-five hug look down yeah I just
thought I said high five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
