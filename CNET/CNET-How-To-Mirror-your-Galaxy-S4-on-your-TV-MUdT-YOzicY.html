mirror your phone screen onto your TV
and when it's set up everything you see
here will be duplicated on the TV it's
great for playing media like Netflix or
firing up a playlist there are two ways
to do mirroring wired or wireless
depending on which accessories you use
for the fastest cheapest and most
reliable set up wired mirroring is your
best bet of course it means your phone
will be tethered to your TV but you'll
get super smooth playback for this
you'll need Samsung's MHL to HDMI
adapter which is about 40 bucks it's a
proprietary accessory that lets you
output audio and video from your s4 but
before that gets hooked up grab your
phone and go to settings my device
accessory and scroll down to output
audio make sure surround sound is
selected then just plug an HDMI cable
into your TV that goes in the MHL
adapter and this microUSB side goes into
your phone finally you'll need to hook
up your wall charger here so your phone
stays juice to power the setup now just
switch the TV to that HDMI input and you
should see your phone show up and
anything you see here and do on your
phone will appear on the big screen but
as soon as you put your phone in
landscape mode you'll see it fill the
screen because of all of this wiring
it's not ideal for browsing through a
lot of short videos like YouTube videos
but it is the best choice for streaming
a longer movie or music playlist
wireless mirroring like Apple AirPlay is
a little more complicated later on in
2013 samsung will release TVs that are
compatible with the s4 and let you do
wireless mirroring but if you don't want
to buy a new TV to get mirroring check
out the samsung AllShare cast dongle
which hooks up to any TV to add wireless
mirroring all right if you have any
questions along the way hit me up on
