nicely grilled food but if you're not
that confident in the kitchen the
prospect of cooking your own meat and
poultry is a little intimidating the 180
dollar t-fal optigrill is an electric
appliance designed to work on your
countertop and it automatically will
grill food to the precise level of
doneness that you prefer automatically
the optical senses the thickness of your
food automatically and it matches that
with the preset that you've selected for
the type of food you're going to cook
with that information it will enable you
to cook food automatically and without
hardly any input from you that means you
can reach a certain level of doneness
say you like medium well medium rare
medium even just rare you can have it
set and stop at that particular point in
the cooking process it automatically
calculates the degree of doneness and
communicates this through a color
shifting LED light on the front of the
appliance I certainly don't like that
this grill tends to overcook the meat
that you cook on it essentially does not
assume that you're going to let it rest
and let the juices kind of redistribute
inside the piece of meat and it zooms
that are going to cut into it right away
and to me that's a bad idea also I find
that interface a little confusing
because you really don't know what's
happening with the cooking process
because the color may be the beginning
of the medium cycle or the end of it or
the beginning of the rare point in the
cooking or the end of it it's really
hard to really know where you are unless
you just sit there and watch the whole
thing as it's going so if you lack lots
of home kitchen experience you may have
already saved a spot on your kitchen
counter for the optigrill those who have
no fear of grilling up a storm at home
though can save a bundle going with a
basic indoor grill without all the fancy
electronics
