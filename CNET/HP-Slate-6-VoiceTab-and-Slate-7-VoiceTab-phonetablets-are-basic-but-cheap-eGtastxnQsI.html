heads here at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona taking a look at two phone /
tablet hybrids it's the HP Slate six
voice tab and the slate 7 voice tab so
both of these devices are very large
phones or kind of medium small-sized
tablets depending on how you look at it
they're pretty similar they've each got
a quad-core processor
the main difference as you can see is
the size so this one has a six inch
display and that has a 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution whereas the larger 7-inch one
has a 1280 by 800 pixel resolution on
the front of both is a two megapixel
forward facing camera for taking lovely
selfies or doing Skype chats and on the
back there's a 5 megapixel camera -
these devices I'm holding right here are
running Android version 4.2 however I'm
assured by HP that by the time they go
on sale in May they'll be running at the
latest version 4.4 KitKat
they're coming to a host of European
countries in May although I'm told there
are no plans for us release date just
yet quite bizarrely the smaller one is
actually a little bit more expensive the
6-inch model costs 249 euros while the 7
inch offering is going to be 229 euros
neither of these devices is really that
complicated but that's not a bad thing
it's just quite a simple phone / tablet
basically and if you're looking to save
money by not buying one of each then
this could be something worth
considering
