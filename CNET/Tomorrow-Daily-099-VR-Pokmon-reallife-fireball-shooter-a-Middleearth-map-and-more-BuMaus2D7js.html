childhood dreams come true you can now
train Pokemon a glove that lets you
shoot real fireballs from your hand
where does the lighter fluid come from a
fully interactive experience of Middle
earth and it just keeps getting better
you're not Ashley that's been done
before it's tomorrow daily
hello welcome back to tomorrow daily the
best kekeke talk show in the known
universe already flubs I did will come
on that's my first time all right I'm
kill anonymous and with me not as always
with me is producer Logan on this side
of the camera yeah I feel real weird
this does feel like bizarro tomorrow
daily but I think we're gonna get
through it yeah ashley is sick she's
either at home in bed treating her
illness or she's stuck in front of the
TV playing Captain toads treasure
tracker yeah either no she's playing
video games but she's like half awake oh
right but that's how we all did it is
sick kids like we you know it's just a
day to play video games but that's
recovery yeah i played bioshock infinite
while i was sick but enough about us
being sick let's get into our headlines
why don't we Logan you may never be on
the show but being in the soundboard you
know that i love vr i love virtual
virtual reality and anything that's
that's coming up because it's just
there's always something new and this
goes hand in hand with something i love
a lot which is pokemon okay yeah you're
just happy it's working exactly i'm that
it's like pokemon story which is all i
care about well what we have here today
for you is a mash-up of two of the vr
technologies that we've seen before
which is oculus and leap motion this is
first person Pokemon and we're going to
take a look at it right now or the lower
third Freo look at the lower right what
i'm really excited about is I've always
wanted a console version of pokemon and
this seems like it's coming pretty close
here it is it's it's a VR experience
they've tried that sort of like you know
experience but this in this one you pick
up the pokeball and you throw it so it's
just like in the cartoon and then you
give them voice commands and they'll do
it so you say like you say Pikachu you
use Thunderbolt oh it's a little just
kind of slips out of his and we'll look
it's a little wonky and let me explain
why this is actually my favorite part of
the story beyond the fact that you can
act like you're ash ketchum this is all
of this this video was made by uploaded
by someone named mr. bun bun it uses of
oculus and leap motion which is the one
that lets you control your hand as
well as a software called voice attack
now what I really like about where this
video came from is it came from a jam
like it came from a VR leap motion 3d
jam so it is one of many contestants in
this contest that's going on and there's
tons of really cool things this is all
sponsored by IndieCade and it's in the
voting process right now there's one
where you write a dragon there's a VR
touch experience for Windows and there's
one where you control a portal and you
like open it up and look inside of a
different world oh but yeah the one that
came out right here Pokemon uses not
only the oculus and not only leap motion
but also this voice attack software
we've seen we've seen technology use
both oculus and leap motion together
before we covered on the show the strip
but this is actually putting it in
something that we can have like
perspective on yeah and we've all played
pokemon so we can kind of like it's
making something come true and that's
always really exciting so and I feel
like if anybody's gonna get on the VR
train the best first it's going to be a
Nintendo yep Playstations kind of
involved with it already but I think
Nintendo's gonna be the first one to
actually make it fun right I mean yeah I
mean everyone's gonna have the headsets
but yeah so there you go you can you can
train your own pokemon cyl waki but you
know we'll see what happens moving
forward yeah all right so what do you
got for us today alright have you ever
wanted to shoot fireballs out of your
hand like super mario yes I never leave
every single day well now it's a
possibility just buy something you
strapped onto your wrist that's scary um
this is called this is a it's called the
pyro fire fire shooter and it's
available through illusionist it uses
for nitrocellulose charges to shoot out
these little fireballs so you have four
before your before you have to reload it
only four I'm sorry Kim yeah and it's
and it's very discreet it's black and it
has like it looks like a wristwatch and
it hides up your sleeves so all you have
to do is point in the direction you want
fire to go yeah it will go there and you
don't have to light it it's like
self-contained right ya know the the
flash charges contain flash paper and
cotton and they're in each each flash
charge is good for sixty uses oh okay
you get four before reloading so 4 times
60 as we know is 240 so with this with
the starter kit you get essentially 240
uses
fireballs that you can shoot they shoot
about 10 feet before they start to burn
up so you can't do any fireball sniping
but you can get very close range
fireball if you like somebody cigarette
from across the room exactly so that's
kind of neat yeah that's a good little
bar trick to just like let me get that
for you oh my god your hair but that's
so it is so what you're saying is it
launches out a paper is it was lighting
a paper as well that's the paper is what
kind of is the ignition and it's
shooting out nitrocellulose cellulous to
fuel the flames okay so yeah flash paper
and cotton to kind of ignite it and are
you ready to know how much you can have
this fire shooter for ya yes 174 dollars
okay not not terribly expensive super
expensive but if you're into illusions
then this might be something you want
and you can really freak out some from
probably screw with it for like a week
and then that's it yeah like and then
and then I'd be worried about like
getting caught with it what this and
with any kind of toy that requires you
to buy refills and probably through the
manufacturer I we couldn't find any
information about whether or not you can
just put your own nitrocellulose if it's
even available to the general public
yeah but what with this is the problem
with this kind of a toy along with
anything like like spider-man web
shooters where you have like silly
string canisters is you have to buy the
refills through the company that sells
them and they're pretty much fitted for
those devices right so I'm always it's
hard to feel cool when you're like
reserving it yes alright that's it for
today let's get one more tomorrow I'm
not gonna do it he do that thing no no
no can't yeah I can but I'm not gonna
and in that companies out of business
there so like I could never do anymore
yeah you're but it's really cool like I
think it'd make a group for cosplay
beyond really it'd be really awesome but
uh that brings us to today's hashtag of
the day oookay what is that it is
hashtag TD pyro and what we want to know
is what kind of special cool ability
would you like to equip into a glove
type of device like the like the fire
shooter okay you start I want to be able
to shoot ice like Iceman from x-men
because I wanna be able to like glide
around on my own little ramps and stuff
like that right I've always thought that
I was really cool and that was my
favorite x-men
yeah I would um I think I would just
wanted I think I wanted to blow like
just to go there then cool because I
wouldn't have to like buy refills for
that yeah or maybe if you did it just be
like those tiny little co2 canisters
that you can just put in like a click I
would imagine like somebody's holding a
paper and just blow it out of their hand
there you know like just like uh you
know if someone has candles and birthday
parties blow them out by you have a
single I'm just trolling yeah I used to
have a similar toy it was like an air
cannon that you can snipe people with
air from far away up to like 20 feet
away did you say I'm gonna and it's
nobody but yeah exactly right I'm all
about that though as i told you from my
grand theft auto experiences i'm all
about just messing with people yep and
it's just a couple of your water control
vision exactly okay so this next one is
another geek fantasy come true and it is
basically an interactive like
exploration map for middle earth and its
really detailed and even better it's
made by google so i mean like how could
it possibly be bad right google doesn't
put their name on everything away the
kind of do but that's all the stuff i
want but anyway so what's the reason why
we're reporting on today cuz it's it's
been around for like a little while not
a whole long how long a lot of time but
now they've added fighting to it now you
can like go into any part of the map and
play as an orc or you know like a hero
and fight your friends are like fight
just random people online right it's
it's really cool you can play it on your
computer your tablet your phone as long
as you have you know one of the more
updated would you can't play it on your
iPhone to you have to play it on a
chrome browser though okay on the phone
you use I saw you yeah you should be
playing it on Chrome browser exactly so
if you're using an iPhone or an iPad you
have to download the Chrome browser app
and then play with their i tried to use
safari but it didn't work that a good
idea but this is obviously like a
promotion for you know the hobbit coming
up did you get a website as middle
middle dash earth dot the hobbit calm so
i think it's an advertisement for the
hobbit i did get to play it i only got
in one match i played as an orc because
it was like are you evil and i click
that faster than i even knew i could and
then ya got on one match only the
training one actually i didn't actually
get a match
I was not able to successfully connect
to a server although I waited like a
minute or two to try but I did a really
cool thing shooting bow and arrows okay
so that was that was pretty cool uh it
is it's like a turn-based game you know
you you do your attack and then they
take a turn but again it's all free it's
online and it's it's pretty impressive
for a browser-based game some of it
reminded me of Diablo like where your
it's like an overhead map of the
character and your kind of choosing
which way he walks who he's gonna fight
and use your special abilities and all
that it might mean yeah yeah it's uh and
i think there's like an upgrading system
too because you like add people to your
tiraste more enemies so yeah so yeah no
but definitely check that out it's a
it's a lot of fun so all right so that's
that's it for our news next up we're
gonna do new releases yeah I made
through I was a little nervous but we
got halfway through let's see how the
other half goes yeah let's let's go
welcome on back to the show welcome back
to tomorrow daily it is Tuesday today
which means that there are new releases
new releases for you to take your wallet
out and buy for the holidays or for
yourself so and without further ado the
best bumper because of the music new
releases
it really it really is the best one some
good some good releases I think it's the
best new release of this week I totally
agree alright so we're starting off with
a game we've got we've got a game some
tech and some movies so start off with
the game first one off is a laura croft
and the Temple of Osiris what do you
know about this one I know it's a it's a
new it's the second in a line of laura
croft games that are unlike the Tomb
Raider series that's right no more of
that like platform you stuff so to speak
is a top-down game it's kind of like
smash TV in a lot of ways if you if you
remember that retro game it's very
arcade okay like like it plays like an
arcade game but what's being hailed
about this game is that it is four
player co-op you need all of you to work
together to accomplish your tasks but
apparently it's pretty good the
developers have said it's pretty good
yeah and some of the earlier views are
looking pretty good too it's supposed to
kind of be a nod to the old laura croft
the more lighthearted smirky type of
Laura Crawford Oh dark broody one that
we see now yeah and then this place like
did you ever play the halo Spartans game
where it was a lot like this and we're
top down and you're kind of just running
through with with co-op people and
getting in a direction it's very similar
to this in fact it's a it was very there
was another laura croft game just like
this like i said earlier called a
political and the guardian of light
laura croft in the game well this is a
sequel to that yes so here are the two
best things about this before we move on
it's on ps4 xbox one and pc so
everything and its twenty dollars so you
get a $20 with you and your friends
eighty bucks they're so good by all of
them there's some good cheap games out
there on those PSA yes that's a co-op
game so it's extra special I love it all
right coming up next we have the Samsung
VR gear gear VR for those of you that
have been waiting for a consumer
affordable VR this is it is the one you
just you you pop it in that little
headset and you have 3d on the go it's
was for the note for right you have to
have a note for right in order to use
this there was one other phone but
Ashley would know I I'm obviously that's
why I'm usually on the other side of
this camp
yeah I don't have that kind of recall no
for we actually I'd not a hundred
percent sure usually I know all about
the VR but I'm not on a percent sure
what uh what games or like what is
available to use with this but I'm sure
Samsung has some things that they're
gonna release yeah it says they have
some movies and games variance is
supposed to be like you're at the
theater watching the movie you can look
at there's like seats and stuff like
that I wish we had one you get a 96
degree viewing angle so it takes up more
than or takes up a good amount of your
of your sight it comes it comes with an
accelerometer gyro meter geomagnetic and
proximity sensors and I did it does it
have your buds uh I don't believe so but
it for navigation does have a touchpad
back button and volume keys alright so
actually has a volume keys what's what's
the baby they say the you know the price
oh god be good vid oh crap all right
well there's no there's no we don't know
the price I'm sorry that's that's one
that we missed one thing we're gonna say
it's 14 95 so there you go just go out
and pick one up with the any pocket
change moving on to movie things they
actually know about two movies that are
coming out this weekend one of which is
top five yeah this is the written and
directed by film from Chris Rock yep
where he plays a person like Chris Rock
not named Chris Rock yeah but he is
playing a comedian that was a turn
dramatic actor and that's not
necessarily Chris Rock but it's
something similar to wanna be a lot of
the types of people that we've seen in
the media like a Kanye West type of
person not not he's a comedian by that
he marries a reality star and is kind of
going through the troubles of dealing
with that and trying to just kind of
reinvent his image in the way yeah and
there's a it's this is also a
star-studded cast as well oh yeah I tell
Adam Sandler's it makes makes an
appearance and he's like top build on
IMDb so I was surprised to see that
there's JB Smoove Kevin Hart's in it
which I'm not too much of a fan but ya
know I mean it's getting good reviews
it's i think it was like eighty-six
percent on rotten tomatoes less fitty
cent fitty cent is it okay for the
accident so the Tracy Morgan I really
had to bring that up yeah that's just a
little downer just uh just so moving on
to the next movie
that would be inherent vice I'm so
excited about in heron by Paul WS
Anderson film command Paul Thomas
Anderson pulp PT Anderson is it pti PT
Anderson you wouldn't want it to be Paul
W no no in it's a PT Anderson it seems
to be kind of a return to form for PT
Anderson because his last movie the
master I'll let you take this one you're
right about PT Anderson's a brilliant
filmmaker he's made there will be blood
he's made boogie night masters uh-huh
the master which was his most recent one
before this and this is why i think that
inherent vice is a return to form for
him because the master although i
thought it was a good movie i don't know
if i liked it necessarily because yeah I
don't I didn't quite understand it it
was very good and visually really cool
but not not very relatable or not very
like not very much of a movie you can
really enjoy but you cannot deny that
you saw it oh yeah that's how I felt
leaving the theaters like well I saw the
master and I completely remember it
which is a great sign yeah I always
think like a bad sign of a movie is one
I don't remember two weeks from that
from when i saw it which is a lot of
movies but the master sticks with me
sometimes you remember bad movies yeah
that's true and those are the ones that
are worth like cracking open a beer and
enjoy with your friends you didn't get
it to check exactly alright so there you
go those are your new releases other
than coming out this week don't forget
that the last two were coming out on
Friday so don't go to the theater and I
tried to see them that brings us to one
of our favorite parts which is use your
feedback who's controlling the show if
you're here well I put my clone in there
his name is room Kincaid um he is a
wonderful video producer like myself and
he's helping us out today well Ashley's
oh oh yeah she sounds like a very nice
lady she who Rueter couture Ashley well
this room lady you're talking about yeah
she's pretty cool oh that's cool alright
well thank you ruin um alright so the
user feedback we had a hashtag which was
TD wait titty game weights and so we've
got some responses from you and this is
basically we asked you before you
crushers we had an article in which you
could play pong with someone as you're
waiting across the street and so we
asked you which game you would want to
play well we didn't cross the street
with
someone on the other side guess what the
first one was it's pretty related to say
story Joshua says Pokemon yeah I agree
that yeah it's a good one if you get to
pick your Pokemon that would be much
yeah and that's a little bit of a
difficult one because you get really
into pokemon soul those games where you
end up stuck at the crosswalk all day
playing pokemon plus nobody beats me at
Pokemon so that would be like I'm right
but Pokemon is a great game to just pick
up and play for a little bit and then
head out only if there was a way for
them to do saved games at those cross
lights to be perfect I go I'd go walk to
the grocery to save card yeah that's
that's too much technology alright next
one comes from Matt and he says dr.
mario nintendo rules it's a great choice
also a great chili dr. mark dr. mario is
probably reason I got into video games
not because I played it but my mom
played it and got me into and gotten any
s because of it it's funny that your
daughter started you on that our next
one comes from Dylan he says I'd like to
see a versus of pac-man while waiting at
a crosswalk pac-man be pretty good yeah
yeah another another one you can just
pick up and play nice to say games ring
in retro back okay next one comes from
Alec there's our last one the sims 4
create-a-sim demo or in a shopping or
any shopping district there could be
other game demos near game stores for
advertising he's trying to help him out
yeah a sanitary crosswalks in the
billboards yeah I do like the I do like
the Create a Sim thing that's that's
pretty good yeah definitely anything
like any kind of game where you can
create something like just a quick
little drawing or something like that
that'd be pretty cool yeah like well I
can't draw so that'd be useless to me
well no one really knows how to draw on
like ms paint you said no one really
knows no there's young people that know
how to drive you and there's many people
those are good somebody will send in an
MS Paint that'll change your mind
