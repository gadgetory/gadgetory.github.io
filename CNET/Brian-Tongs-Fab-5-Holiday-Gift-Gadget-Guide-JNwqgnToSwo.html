tongues fab 5 gift gadget guide or what
i like to call me 2 z's FF GGG okay so
what these are these are the top gifts
this holiday season in my mind and they
really fall across the different themes
that are really hot in text so let's
just start off from the top my number
one gift to get this season right here
on my left side this is the NES classic
system it's a mini console it's
throwback retro it has old classic games
like Super Mario Brothers Donkey Kong
Legend of Zelda all in this one piece
for 59 bucks and it's just a killer way
to bridge you know the past with the
current generation just enjoy it with
your family friends this has gotta be
one of the must haves it's hard to get
but again put this at the top of your
list now the other thing that you guys
should really look at my second gift is
the artificial intelligence home
assistant we're talking about the Amazon
echo dot now why do I recommend this
this is not the full size echo that's
one hundred eighty dollars this is a $49
puck it still has a speaker it really
connects all the things you're smart
home lights thermostats switches plugs
and it gives you all of that artificial
intelligence for the home a great way to
just try something out like this the
voice recognition is on point and it's
really one of my favorite things that
has changed how I use things in my
household so check it out forty nine
dollars for the Amazon echo dot now the
third thing is on my wrist this is the
fitbit charge to what I love about it is
it's designed it's only $149 you can
beat it up it does everything like track
your exercise activity your heart rate
and also your sleep patterns without
even having to change into a specific
mode it's my favorite fitness device of
the year just for a variety of those
reasons and it's not complicated you
just basically pop it on sync at your
phone and you're good to go into it
comes into a variety of stylish colors
so if there's really one fitness device
that I love the most this year
specifically it's the Fitbit charge too
okay then when we talk about virtual
reality a big theme here for 2016
there's a lot of ways you can go you can
go to oculus you can go to acc but
what's the most affordable one that
still gives you a great VR experience
it's going to be the sony playstation vr
most of us already have a sony
playstation but this will enable
you to really try new game and
experiences they've never had in your
home it only costs anywhere starting
price from 399 to 499 that's really
nothing much to get a VR experience when
a standalone setup from oculus or HTC
costs around two thousand dollars and
higher so if you're into gaming and you
want to experience some really cool
stuff the sony PS vr is the once again
and finally my favorite gift out of all
these quite honestly that i use almost
every day these are the bose
quietcomfort 35 s why do I love these so
much I've been a big fan of bose
headphones from the start I travel a lot
I listened a lot of music and watch
movies but these are special because
they have noise canceling that hears the
sound outside of you there's an actually
a microphone in these and then it sends
a reverse signal that dead-ends that
sound so you're really kind of locked
into your own world they're super comfy
super soft really the best headphones
they are 349 and I never thought any
headphone was worth three hundred forty
nine dollars until I tried these and
this is something again that I use all
the time so there you go when you look
at this collection of different things
these are going to serve different
people different needs in your house but
we have it here the NES classic system
the Amazon echo dot the fitbit charge to
the PlayStation VR headset and yes the
bose quietcomfort 35 s this is my bt's
these fat five give gadget guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
