240 wagon of the 1970s the design now is
much curvier more modern let's take a
look at it in the 2013 volvo xc60 the
xc60 is a midsize SUV volvo has one
bigger
vexy 90 but this is the smallest SUV in
their lineup standard is the city safety
feature they got some cameras mounted up
here in a pod inside the windshield
those look forward seeing cars and
pedestrians at slow speeds 20 miles an
hour or less the city safety system will
actually bring the car to a complete
stop if it's about to hit something at
higher speeds 2530 miles an hour the
system will still hit the brakes but
it'll probably still hit whatever it is
in front although the system will
mitigate that collision Volvo makes a
few other driver assistance features
available on the xc60 one is adaptive
cruise control which puts a little radar
sensor out in front and the grill
there's also a blind spot monitoring
system which when you have a car to
either side of the Volvo back in the
blind spot the light of an icon in the
side view mirror so you can see if
there's a car in that blind spot without
turning your head around
and the cabin Volvo has your basic cabin
text suite we've got a navigation system
that's based on flash memories we've got
a Bluetooth phone system and we've got
some digital audio sources with a USB
port in the console here I like the
looks of the maps in the navigation
system it's a really clean design and
you kind of expect that from Volvo but
this whole interface here these buttons
and dials it's a little bizarre to
figure out you know you don't really
know where to start there's a dial over
here with a menu button on top so you
hit that and it suddenly brings you to
your navigation menu which gives you
your destination options so if I roll it
around choose the menu item for set
destination I get more options here I
get address let me do that and then I
get a selection of city street number
and so if I try to put in a city here I
get this rotary input thing and it's
really kind of tedious to use you have
to roll this dial around each letter
navigation go to address you'll also use
voice command to enter in a destination
but then you actually have to say each
the city the street and the number each
separately is a separate component
that's a little tedious too but it is
faster than using this dial and I've got
a USB Drive full of music plugged into
the USB port here so I'm seeing the
current track that's playing on this
screen but how do I select music how do
I get to my folder list from that USB
Drive now if I had a iOS device plugged
into that USB port it actually show a
music library with album artist genre
that sort of thing which is a better
interface it doesn't do that for USB
Drive Volvo does put HD radio in here
which is nice and with the navigation
function we also get traffic on here
that traffic comes through FM radio so
you don't have to pay for like a
satellite radio subscription to get that
information
it'll also actively route around bad
traffic problems so that that's
convenient it's a good basic cabin text
suite but what does it take it beyond
that you kind of expect more in this
premium car category and it also has
bluetooth streaming so I could just keep
my phone in my pocket and have the music
stream to the stereo that stereo of
course you see the PS label here that
means premium sound in this platinum
trim xc60 we have this upgraded sounds
650 watts pretty good sound clean sound
I like it it's it's very enjoyable has
good separation good distinction I would
say it's the best I've ever heard but
it's a good value for the money now
amongst all these buttons on the
interface here we also have this cam
button has nothing to do with the engine
by press that it activates the rear view
camera so you can manually activate the
rear view camera or just put it in
Reverse which is also bring up the rear
view and you see we have trajectory
lines on here which is cool and distance
lines as well overhead we have this
panoramic sunroof that is a standard
feature in that platinum trim it reaches
back over the rear seats which is nice
but only the first three quarters but
opens up what we have under the hood
here is kind of a miracle of packaging
this is a three liter 6-cylinder engine
but it's inline so all the cylinders are
one after another and it's also
transverse sideways but it still fits
within this compartment it's got a
pretty big turbo on it that turbo helps
it make 300 horsepower and 325
pound-feet of torque the fuel economy
numbers are 17 city 23 highway which is
not great but in driving I've seen it
averaged around 21 22 which is pretty
good this xc60 drives pretty easily
because of the turbos it generally gives
decent power takes a little moment to
kick in but then it starts
there's a bit of travel in the
suspension you feel that is it goes
around corners because you really feel
the load shift back and forth in normal
roads it works pretty well to dampen out
the plumps gives you really smooth ride
as soon as I put it in its sport mode it
is a whole different experience puts the
power on tap at a much lower throttle
point because of the fact that the sport
button also doesn't make the suspension
any better it it's an interesting
sensation that makes this car a little
harder to control
so let's price out our 2013 volvo xc60
bass is 40,000 650 but bring it up to
the Platinum package forty-five thousand
two hundred fifty dollars you get all
the cabin electronics standard Plus that
rear view camera now to even bring it
further CNET style you get the depth
whose control is part of a technology
package for twenty one hundred dollars
and you can add the blind spot
information system for another seven
hundred dollars it still doesn't have
some of the really advanced tech that we
see in out ease or BMWs but overall a
very nice driver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
