I'm Bridget Carey and this is your Cena
update the review is in for the new
microsoft surface pro microsoft's second
computer is the company's attempt at
being that bridge between a tablet and a
laptop and unlike the previous surface
RT tablet this pro gives you a complete
windows 8 experience all packed into a
10-inch tablet it's even got a better
screen and it's comfortable to type on
so it could be a laptop replacement but
oh the pro is not perfect her battery
life is limited she's a bit heavier than
most tablets on the market today and
you'll wish she had more ports there's a
64 gig model but the operating system
takes up so much space that it barely
has any free storage left for you so
you're going to need to get the 128 gig
version and if you're serious about
working you got to have the keyboard
type cover which costs extra and that
leaves you spending almost twelve
hundred dollars for the pro that costs
more than most new laptops cnet reviewer
scott Stein says this is not the perfect
laptop killer yet you can check out his
full review at cnet and we also have a
list of some hybrid laptops and tablet
machines that you may want to also
consider many of which costs less and
I'm all about that for those of you
waiting patiently for a new smartphone
it looks like the Samsung Galaxy s4
could be announced at an event on March
fifteenth and it would go on sale in
April but that's according to the
Samsung rumor site Sam mobile but what's
not a rumor is the delay of the
blackberry q10 that's the blackberry
with the physical keyboard the company's
CEO so the q10 will launch in the US
about 8 to 10 weeks after the all
touchscreen z10 model eight to ten weeks
puts it at around May or June and if any
group has been waiting for blackberry
it's people who want to upgrade to a
model with a keyboard and that weight
just keeps getting longer and longer and
in case you weren't distracted enough at
work with Facebook Twitter and Pinterest
Instagram now let's review a feeder your
friends photos on its website before you
could only see the feed from the app
today we're keeping our eye out for the
new Skylanders game swap force the
popular franchise has a new twist this
time the playable figures have swappable
tops and bottoms so
can mix and match the halves to create
up to 256 different types of playable
characters in the game if you haven't
played Skylanders you put your physical
toy on the sensor called the power
portal and then a virtual version of
that character enters the game swap
force comes out this fall and this
concept of collectible toys that work
with a video game is something Disney is
also working on with a new game called
infinity coming out in June that's your
tech news update you can find more
details on these stories at cnet com /
