a lot like the previous model but
Samsung has made several subtle design
changes one of which makes the device
much more difficult to disassemble than
previous notes I'm Bill Detweiler and
this is cracking open with nearly every
phone maker including Apple now offering
an oversized phone the Galaxy Note 4
can't really compete on sheer size alone
luckily it has some pretty nice hardware
to go along with it's beautiful 5.7 inch
515 pixel per inch Super AMOLED screen
now such as a 2.7 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 processor or a 1.9
gigahertz octa-core exynos 54:33 chip
three gigs of ram 32 gigs of internal
storage a 16 megapixel rear facing
camera 3220 milliamp hour battery and of
course the phone's signature feature the
s-pen along with all the hardware
upgrades Samsung made several design
changes inside the phone so let's get
cracking
after removing the back cover battery
and stylus we can turn our attention to
the dozen or so Phillips screws inside
the phone now once they're out we can
separate the internal cover from the
front panel and frame assembly there's
also a thin ribbon of adhesive that runs
along the edge so a little heat can make
the process a bit easier with the cover
removed we get our first real look
inside the phone attached to the cover
is the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
external speaker the circuit boards
cameras vibration motor and other
components are attached to the frame and
front panel assembly after removing a
single screw and detaching several
cables and connectors we can gently lift
out the mainboard and the attached
components I'm going to leave the USB
charging board earpiece speaker
vibration motor and the button contacts
attached to the frame I'm also going to
leave the front panel and display alone
I want to put this phone back together
in working order and these components
could be damaged
during removal so turning our attention
back to the main circuit board we can
detach the rear camera the front camera
assembly and finally the board's metal
shields with that our teardown is
complete as I mentioned at the beginning
of the show the Galaxy Note 4's
design isn't radically different from
that of the previous model but Samsung
did make several subtle design changes
and one big one now the major change is
to the front panel and frame assembly
the phone's metal Ram is part of the
internal cover instead of the frame as
it was on the note 3 there's also a thin
adhesive seal between the front panel
and the internal cover which wasn't
present in the older model now this
design element makes the device just a
tad bit harder to crack open and
reassemble than previous notes the
smaller changes include things like a
redesign circuit board repositioned sim
and microSD card slots and a headphone
jack that's attached to the internal
cover not the front panel and frame
assembly along with all these changes
like I mentioned there's also plenty of
hardware improvements such as a better
display faster processor better camera
and a much improved s-pen now for more
information on the Galaxy Note 4
including real world tests and pricing
