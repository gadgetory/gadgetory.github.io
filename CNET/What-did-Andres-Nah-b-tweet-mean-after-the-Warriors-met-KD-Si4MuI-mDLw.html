sub tweets let's be real yes people
though can you explain to people what is
this sub tweet I do I do well on Twitter
so when I tweet something it usually
means the opposite of what you're
reading or it has it has it's usually a
movie yeah quote or it's inside joke no
one would give about two people in the
world I just like having fun with it cuz
now I get a lot of responses and a lot
of replies few people have gotten tell
them no they're pretty good the movie
wants starting to understand like fans
are starting to understand okay that's
the movie from this one and then you're
taking it to this and then you just have
it in the game they put two and two
together they get smarter I got I got
your bamboo and salt one yeah that was
Dave Chappelle when you guys went to the
Hamptons to do the Katy visit you put
out a sub tweet that said Nobby what was
it what was that one what was actually
that related to that it had nothing to
do with Katy
I don't forgot what they had to do with
does everyone is freaking out because
you were like no I was mad like I think
I was in the airport some happen in the
airport and there's like this thing with
four black men sitting first class yeah
right when when when they say first
class the board the plane I always get
that can I see your porno plan you did
ask for nobody else's boarding pass so
it has some do that and somebody asked
me a question and I was in my hair like
no I'll be like just leave me alone like
I don't wanna sign autographs on one do
nothing cuz I was just so mad at it's
probably the airliner something happened
so sometimes I do that like if I have an
interaction with somebody and they just
don't understand what's going on at the
moment whatever I'm thinking I'll just
tweet it but no and that's like weird
things like that so that was that it was
like perfect timing though right yeah it
just thought I realized that I wasn't
thinking about that because I was on my
way back home and then I was flying
somewhere else
cuz I find like Katy sign I was on a
plane you didn't know until you landed
no I had Wi-Fi on the plane I'm sitting
next to my wife and I was like we got
Katy
like that's how I found out so like I
was flying all over the place so it was
just a lot going on I mean it was
literally like perfectly fine
you're the only one in that meeting that
had said anything was radio silent right
everyone did the world's whatever and be
a world is on pins and needles it's like
Bobby yeah oh you know what that
could've been I don't know I forgot why
I said nah be you and then do a Katy
don't um which leads me to like you said
you know everyone's like freaking out
about it like with social media I mean
obviously it's a powerful tool it's also
fun right it also can get crazy like
come on we know like fans trolls they
can get really really nasty on their
your fans sometimes care about this
stuff more than the players
I shouldn't say you care more about the
players just that we're channeling all
your energy like as a player you know we
prepare ourselves to the best of our
ability everything we do outside of the
game of basketball is for the game of
basketball you know so our lives are
just wrapped up in this like you know
what I eat sleep training you know how I
carry myself how address everything that
I do in life it's basically revolved
around trying to help myself be a better
basketball players I mean you don't have
too many guys like that but a good
amount you know not everybody has to say
but a good amount our intention is to
try to play the best we can and win
every single game like that's our life
you know and then when fans you know
sometimes a fan may go overboard and
it's like you know all my energy was
just meant out here I'm sorry I don't
have the same passion you have at this
exact moment because I left it on the
court so I think that's where you
misunderstood at times it's like it's
not that we don't care just out right
now I don't care it I'm tired because I
just spent a lot my whole life is trying
to figure it out out there and that's
where that's where it's at you know me
me on the court that's where my passion
is right now you know but there's only
400 guys that can have that passion at
any given moment because that's how many
guys are in the lead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
