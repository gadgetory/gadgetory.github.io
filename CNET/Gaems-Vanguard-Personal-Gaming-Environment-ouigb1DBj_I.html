taking a look at the games Vanguard
personal gaming environment look at this
thing
alright so I know the first thing you're
thinking what in the hell is this it's
ok I've gotten that reaction plenty of
times before the way I best describe it
this is like an Xbox suitcase basically
that's all it is the company games
they've built an LED TV into one end of
this case and then on the other end is a
padded section that you can sit a
console now this is only going to work
with an Xbox 360 or a slim version of
the PlayStation 3 you might be able to
get away with using the newest slim ps3
but because there's these velcro straps
up here you might run into a problem
when you're sliding back and forth the
disc tray anyway these straps keep the
console in place when you're traveling
and that's about it it's kind of
self-explanatory what you're getting
right here now games that's G a EMS
that's the company's name to make two
versions of these personal gaming
environments or pges for short this is
the larger one it's a special edition
version that has halo licensing so
there's all these UNC s branding on this
this goes for three hundred and fifty
dollars for the 19 inch screen they make
a lower end model called the century and
that's 15 point five inches and that's
going to cost two hundred and fifty
dollars now each one of these comes with
a small HDMI cable that hooks the
console up to the built-in screen it
also includes a small remote control but
you're probably never going to use it
because you're going to be so close to
this thing that's how I imagine most
people will play it now if you look up
front there's dual headphone jacks which
is actually pretty awesome if you're
playing with a friend and you can share
the audio now this thing is faa-approved
you can bring it on a plane it packs up
quickly
it sets up pretty quick all you need is
two outlets power for the console
obviously and power for the screen
there's no battery packs or anything
like
this now while this is a great way to
transport your console it's tough to
play it on a bus or plane you need about
three square feet of space to make it
comfortable so you're better off just
waiting until you arrive at your
destination to play carrying this thing
is about 20 pounds when all the
accessories and the console is loaded in
without a console it's about nine pounds
now there's two foam sleeves that come
included they sit on either side of the
console when traveling you're going to
put your wires in here you're going to
put a controller in here and that's
about it you don't want to over pack
these because you risk damaging the
screen when this is all closed up
there's only a few inches of room in
between the screen and the sleeves so
you got to be careful now when you're
playing you have the option to make use
of this kickstand around back that's
going to change the viewing angle from
about a hundred and two degrees to 90
degrees now the screen looks pretty good
as you can see for the most part but
there's a lot of light leakage around
the perimeter of the screen when you're
playing a dark game you'll actually
really notice it a lot especially if
you're also in a dark room it kind of
sucks but it's not a deal-breaker also
there's a bunch of blue LEDs that sort
of flank the screen they're kind of
annoying as well but that's nothing a
little electrical tape can't cure now
these products are hit with pro gamers
also military members who are away for a
long period of time and don't have
access to consoles the way you and I do
now it might not be the best gift for a
casual gamer I mean let's be honest you
need to be a pretty dedicated player to
own one of these contraptions but at the
end of the day this PG is probably the
most practical solution to making a home
console something it's not intended to
be and that's a portable device that's
going to do it for me make sure you read
the rest of the review for a much more
in-depth take this has been the games
