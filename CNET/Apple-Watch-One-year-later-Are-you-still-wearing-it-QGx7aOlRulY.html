you
I wear the Apple watch every day no I do
not know I wear my Apple watch pretty
much every day
it's kind of my everyday thing I don't
really leave the house without it not
anymore it just didn't make any sense
for me I probably wore it for about six
months straight but I don't wear it
anymore because it just doesn't do
enough for me I probably wear my Apple
watch every day for the first three or
four months but unfortunately the lack
of strap options really prevents me from
doing that to me it is mostly useless it
turned out that for just about
everything it was faster to pull the
phone out of the pocket
where am I on my left wrist it's on my
wrist it's sitting in my drawer at my
desk in my office ready to get sold on
eBay yeah
I sold it on Craigslist actually made a
slight profit on it buzzes my wrist
whenever I get an important email easy
access to things like my messages and
saying sports scores I loved how it
looked I like that I can glance at it
see the time without pulling out my
phone my wife jokes that it saved our
marriage and I don't think it's that
much of a joke because I'm no longer
checking my my phone all the time I
tried using it in every way possible
I just didn't enhance my life in any way
shape or form the apps are really not
that interesting it was complicated
I think the software's really lacking
you cannot rely on it to come on when
you bring it up to your face and so I'd
find myself doing this twice just to
check the time
I'm wearing my Marc Ecko bling bling see
that blamele thing I'm wearing a pebble
time steel now usually when I don't wear
my Apple watch it's because I want to
wear a pretty bracelet I prefer my Timex
of indica that's about it I think the
Apple watch is really great for specific
people people who are incredibly plugged
in the reality is you're gonna spend
over $300 on this thing but they might
not use every day if they want it
because it's they're hardcore Apple I
say go for it it's not gonna change your
life you're interested in it they'll
probably be better ones coming out later
I will give the Apple watch a second
chance once it has a killer feature that
no SmartWatch has wait for version 2.0
just because I think it can only get
better from here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
