app 14 textures I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update 14 reports that
snapchat has agreed to acquire bid
strips
that's the toronto company behind those
cartoony personalized emoji expressions
called bitmoji z' the companies have not
formally announced the deal yet so we
don't know if this means that moji will
be featured inside of snapchat or if
there will be some other type of
partnership but when a fortune sources
says the deal is valued at 100 million
dollars yeah that's right little
cartoons with your hair and skin color
that you text your friends are worth a
hundred million dollars every week users
get new bitmoji expressions in their
likeness and sometimes it's tied to pop
culture moments or tied to holidays but
there are also ones themed to promote
movies and TV shows and there are some
that cost money to send like a pack
called bling moji so you can flock to
your friends that you made smart life
choices by spending one dollar on text
message cartoons yeah so as snapchat may
be expanding into more apps Apple is
also venturing into new app territory
but not in a way you would expect Apple
announced that created its first
original TV series and the show is all
about apps it sounds like I may be one
big ad for the App Store as it features
stories on how apps are developed and
created one of the producers of the show
is musician will.i.am who certainly has
his own experience with sad tech
failures like his pulse SmartWatch that
went nowhere so it'll be a nice change
for him to talk about tech success
stories and speaking of shows to stream
if you've ever tried streaming netflix
video on an 18 T or Verizon Wireless
connection well you're not getting the
best picture quality and Netflix has now
admitted that it throttles your video
quality down for your own good at first
wireless carriers were being blamed for
throttling video speeds on their
networks but Netflix says it is the ones
slowing down video to various carriers
around the world and it's been doing
this for the past five years including
slowing down video for anyone on Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T in order to protect consumers
from going past their mobile data caps
so why not slow down t-mobile or sprint
well that's because Netflix says
customers of those companies don't
typically get hit with extra charges
when they go over their monthly data
limits Netflix is now saying that it's
gonna launch a feature in the app to let
you choose to stream higher or lower
video quality that does it for this tech
news roundup but there's always more at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
