air pumps they ran more air into the
intake portion of the engine and when
more air goes in that means the engine
can combine more fuel with it to get
what's called a bigger charge that's the
air and fuel before it's ignited by
putting more air into the intake portion
of the engine that also means it's other
components will combine more fuel with
that air you've got to do that to
maintain the charge that may sound piggy
like so what more gas more power what's
magic about that but because you're
doing it under pressure and using modern
valve timing ignition timing and fuel
metering in a high-tech fuel injection
system you increase what's called
volumetric and thermal efficiency that
means you can scale the power of the
engine more efficiently than you scale
it's fuel consumption how those two
pumps do that though is different and
very interesting
first off let's meet the turbocharger
that's this apparatus sitting right here
let's see how it works this is the
exhaust manifold the exhaust gases are
coming off a cylinder here which would
normally go out to your tailpipe the
turbo sits here and intercepts those
gases that it blows by this this is
called the impeller spins that thing
really fast on the other end of its
shaft is this little part that's the
compressor cold air comes in here this
compresses it and sends it up the
plumbing to the intake to ram more into
the engine
the beauty of this system is it's using
otherwise wasted energy exhaust that
otherwise just goes out into the air
it's getting something out of that
the downside is turbo lag and because
those exhaust gases are created at the
late part of each cylinders cycle it
takes this kind of system a moment or
two to spool up as they say that's where
you get turbo lag you step on the gas
now a moment or two later this thing
really spins up to the demand you want
now the supercharged is a whole
different animal there's one on top of a
Mustang engine it's this big apparatus
you see right here note the difference
with a supercharger it's not driven by
exhaust gases it's driven by a
mechanical connection to the engine in
this case a bill that's running off
other pulleys and the crank
so that pulley turns these gears those
operate these impeller blades hear the
turn compress the air and then Ram it
down into the intake here therefore it
is always turning and always on if you
will geared to engine rpm unlike a turbo
that has all those lag issues so that's
a bonus here on the downside this guy's
got parasitic losses it's another big
old rotating accessory that is hung off
the engine so these tend to be used more
to create additional brute horsepower
than to create efficiency or really high
mpg in everyday cars okay the last part
of the turbo and supercharger story is
intercooling here's the thing when you
compress air in either of those
technologies it gets hot the molecules
want to expand fewer oxygen molecules in
a given space the engine doesn't like
that it wants the most oxygen molecules
in a given cubic inch if you will as
they go into the cylinder that way it
combines more efficiently with fuel like
we were talking about earlier to do that
you cool the air and your cooling look
down here in this engine for example
that's basically a radiator it's kind of
hard to see the structure but this is a
chiller if you will the compressed air
goes through here first that makes it
more dense more oxygen molecules in a
given space as the temperature drops and
then you can combine it more efficiently
with fuel both turbos and superchargers
typically use one of these
okay bottom line is you go shopping for
a car you're pretty unlikely to find
many that have super chargers and they
tend to be rarefied and extremely high
performance so let's talk turbos how to
shop for one take the car out for a test
drive and notice the turbo lag
that's the delay between stepping on the
gas and feeling that whoosh of power
from the turbo that we talked about
secondly notice the additional torque
turbocharged engines tend to have a lot
of torque compared to the amount of
horsepower they have and torques the fun
stuff it's what really gets you off the
line and get you going and third notice
the price turbocharged engine options
tend to cost more take that price factor
it against any fuel efficiency gains and
couple the rough amortization schedule
if you will or if there's not a big game
come up with a personal feeling of how
much more fun it's gonna be to have a
turbo with all this additional torque
times the cost you got to pay to get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
