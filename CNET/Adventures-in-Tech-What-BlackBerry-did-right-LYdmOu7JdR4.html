on the rocks our wants vast smartphone
empire now facing druid but believe it
or not there are some things that
Blackberry did right
the BlackBerry was one of the first
proper smartphones and popularized the
idea of taking your online world with
you that all started with BlackBerry's
first great idea decent mobile emails
from 1999 to primitive blackberry 850 to
the core capable 6210 blackberry then
known as Research In Motion was
pioneering the power to push new emails
to a portable gadget this tech was
adored by businesses who saw a way to be
in touch with employees 24/7 yes Hans
boobie yes let's talk business
by 2005 blackberry had nearly four
million subscribers who also had access
to a pro for synced calendar and could
open all manner of documents blackberry
was addictive with Webster's making
CrackBerry it's word of the year in 2006
one year later Steve Jobs revealed the
first iPhone making fun of Mobile's like
the blackberry and calling them hard to
use but Apple built its own phone
standing on the shoulders of giants no
blackberry no iPhone and probably no
android either the iPhone rocked the
technology world but even as rivals
appeared one thing kept blackberry fans
loyal the physical keyboard try and
ignore the fact that it looks like the
thousand teeth of some monstrous spider
when it comes to texting or email
blackberry fans will insist the slippery
surface of a touchscreen is a poor
substitute for a contoured QWERTY keypad
the excitement around accessories like
typos which prompted a swift lawsuit
from blackberry proves there are still
those out there who yearn for real life
buttons and the power to send a text
without looking as great Android phones
became cheaper BlackBerry's Hardware
began to feel very old-fashioned it was
clear that the BlackBerry dream was
dying but one of its finest features
endured blackberry messenger launched in
2005 bbm let you've chats with other
BlackBerry owners without incurring the
cost of sending a text while its group
chat features made the BlackBerry a
surprise hit with the younger crowd in
2013 blackberry opened up bbm to Android
and iOS
10 million downloads in its first 24
hours but perhaps removing the last
reason to actually buy a blackberry
today apps like whatsapp or viber are
all the rage but let's not forget the
company that was doing I am from phones
way before it was cool and will probably
be doing it way after it's cool to
finally blackberry has one more trick up
its sleeve one that could provide a clue
as to the company's future blackberry is
famous for one feature that big
businesses are absolutely crazy for
security sorry mate you're not getting
in
seriously nuke
yes Luke yeah he's doing it again
blackberry encrypts communication
between your phone and its servers which
is reassuring for organisations who
worry about information leaking out so
for all governments have even supplied
their workers with BlackBerry's while
others have threatened to ban them over
fears that citizens messages can't be
unscrambled alright this stuff is pretty
boring but it's what BlackBerry does
best if you want a possible vision of
BlackBerry's future imagine this
security software humming quietly away
deep in the server farm of some enormous
corporation today blackberry has been
outperformed and outmaneuvered by Apple
and Google it will be remembered as the
company that got the smartphone ball
rolling and then couldn't keep up but
that doesn't make its contributions any
less valuable here's to you blackberry
and the good ideas you did have is there
anything else you think blackberry
deserves credit for let me know and
check back next time for another
adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
