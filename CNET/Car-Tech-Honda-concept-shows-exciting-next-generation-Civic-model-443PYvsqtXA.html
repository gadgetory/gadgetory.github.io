since 1972 in that time it's been a
family car a sports car and many
people's first car here at the 2015 New
York Auto Show Honda is showing us the
next generation of this car in concept
form behind me is this green concept
design for this 10th generation of the
Honda Civic really cool-looking much
sporty-er looking in the current car so
this is gonna be an exciting launch we
expect to see it later this year
Honda says this car will come with a 1.5
liter engine but it'll have direct
injection and turbo charging so it
should have plenty of power that engine
will be mated to either a continuously
variable transmission or a 6-speed
manual with short throws that's probably
in the SI edition we'll also get a full
suite of driver assistance features such
as adaptive cruise control rear view
camera a lot of things that you don't
generally debt in this segment when the
Civic comes out in production it'll have
the current trim levels and si trim
level little sportier and then Honda
tells us we'll get a type R version
that's really exciting because that is a
high performance car they've just
released one in Europe with over 345
horsepower so that'll be a really fast
one and to get it in the US is just
phenomenal we should see the production
version of this car at the LA Auto Show
later this year at least I'm hoping I'm
Wayne cutting them here at the 2015 New
York Auto Show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
