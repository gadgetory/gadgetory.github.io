lightweight on-ear wireless Bluetooth
sports headphone that retails for $119
and comes in multiple color options the
headphone is a few things going for it
first it sits on your head securely
making it suitable for running or gym
use and is fairly comfortable for an
on-ear headphone though it's a good idea
to work it in a bit so it doesn't clamp
down on your ears to firmly it also has
touch controls on the right ear cup that
work well with a swipe of your finger
you can raise and lower volume skip
tracks forward and back and pause and
play your music as well as answer and
end calls yes the headphone has a
built-in microphone another plus is that
you can easily remove the ear pads and
the headband and wash them by sticking
them in the washing machine a washing
bag is included along with a USB
charging cable and battery life is good
at 14 hours and finally the sound is
decent I like their sound better than
urban ears platon Wireless which looks
similar but has a different design and
cost twenty dollars less I wouldn't say
the Hellas sound great there's a touch
of harshness in the treble but the sound
is definitely a step up from an
entry-level bluetooth headphone what's
not so great
well the headphone looks a little cheap
and plasticky you look at a headphone
like this and think it should cost less
if you can overlook that small gripe
this is an appealing workout headphone
can also be used for running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
