rewards you for reviewing restaurants I
am Bridget Carey this is your see net
update facebook says it's going to
activate its safety check tool in times
of crisis that go beyond natural
disasters Facebook turned on the tool
for people in Paris during Friday's
terrorist attacks but many have
criticized the network for not doing
this sooner for other attacks most
notably the bombings that occurred one
day earlier in Beirut the capital of
Lebanon safety check is a way to tell
everyone you know on Facebook that
you're safe during a disaster if you're
located in the vicinity of an ongoing
event Facebook pops up a message asking
if you're safe you hit yes and your
friends all get notified that you're
okay so could Facebook have turned this
on sooner yeah of course and it probably
should have but it took the disaster in
Paris for Facebook to have the
conversation about it with its employees
on the ground and so for the first time
safety check was used for something
other than a natural disaster the
feature began back in 2011 during the
Fukushima nuclear disaster and tsunami
in Tokyo it's also been used for areas
hit by major earthquakes and storms many
Facebook users we're also sharing
concerns over the new option to change
your profile picture to show the French
flag people were doing this as a symbol
of solidarity for the country it's the
social media equivalent of wearing a
ribbon or wristband but we have not seen
such options on Facebook to support
other countries going through turmoil it
makes it seem to some like Facebook is
selective and what it cares about and
out of touch with other countries in the
meantime there are tools to do this
affect yourself one free tool is through
the website Luna pick calm you can
select multiple flags as filters over
your photo and another Facebook news the
social network is starting to test the
waters with paid stickers you know how
you can send those little cartoon
drawings to express your feelings well
stickers on Facebook and messenger have
always been free but now there's a new
add-on app to messenger it's called Pico
candy and some of its sticker packs cost
a dollar or two but seriously you do not
need to resort to paying for anything if
you want to add something unique to your
messages just use an animated gift
search tool they're always free and fun
you can find lots of these at
in the more options button meanwhile
Google is offering one terabyte of free
online drive storage space as an
incentive to people who want to write
restaurant reviews and make other
contributions to Google Maps to start
getting perks you have to sign up as a
local guide reviewer a terabyte of space
on Google normally cost $10 a month
however you would have to review about
40 locations a month to even earn that
free storage and that's a lot of eating
out that's it for this tech news update
and there's more as cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
