but there is a box of old printed photos
collecting dust I'm also guessing you do
most of your reminiscing on sites like
Facebook and Flickr after all that's
where everyone seems to be uploading
their photos these days if you have a
stack of photos you want to digitize and
don't have a scanner an appropriately
named app called shoebox lets you scan
old photos with your iPhone or Android
once you have the app downloaded you'll
want to set up your assembly line
so here are a few tips first the phone
you're using should have a good camera
like the one on my iPhone 4s then grab a
microfiber cloth and clean the lens
you'll want to make sure you're getting
super crisp scans and finally choose a
spot with plenty of light otherwise
you'll get grainy photos as a result of
your camera trying to compensate for the
shadows now you're ready to scan your
photos launch shoebox and hit scan
position the phone parallel to the photo
set your focus hold still and then
capture the app will automatically try
to find the corners of the photo for
cropping but if it's off you can
readjust it by dragging just like this
at this point compare what's on the
screen with the original photo
if the coloring is off you can adjust it
with this option here and if you need to
adjust the brightness you can do that
too finally hit next and you'll see that
the app will ask you to create a shoebox
these are like albums that you can use
to organize your photos you don't have
to create one but it does make it easier
to find your photos later hit next and
add some info if you want and the photo
will get saved to your phone and it will
get uploaded to the shoebox site where
you can view all of your scans the link
to your shoebox account is shown here at
the bottom now you can share your photos
on Facebook email them to a relative or
just sleep well knowing that if you ever
lose your printed photos there's a
digital copy waiting for you online if
you have any questions hit me up on
Twitter and subscribe
