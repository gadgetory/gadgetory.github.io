appliance testing floor to show you the
neck sia bridge from nexia home
intelligence the neck sia bridge is like
the mothership for home automation in
your house any product or device that's
compatible with it can be automated
through the next app or website
basically the nexia bridge is like a
router if you take a look at it here
it's got two ports one for the power
cable and one for the ethernet cable so
right now this white cable is connecting
us to the router here our CNET office
and with that we're able to connect our
appliances to it using different devices
and automate them from the nexia app and
website so if i pull up the next the app
here on my phone i can use it just to
turn this lamp on I can dim it I can
make it nice and soft I can control it
however I want it's really easy to do
and it's very quick to respond as well
as so we like this app quite a bit now
of course I can't just in the lamp using
the bridge itself I have to plug the
lamp into a dimmer module that's nexia
compatible so if you don't have any
nexia compatible devices you're gonna
need to buy those separately the good
news here though is that there are over
200 nexia compatible devices available
for purchase so you've got a lot of
options another key strengths of the
nexia bridge is its range it uses the
z-wave wireless network and that's a
network designed exclusively for home
automation that gives it a range of
about 60 feet to 100 feet so we wanted
to test that out
we built the door right in the middle of
our test floor right back there right
now it's about 90 feet away it's got a
z-wave touchscreen deadbolt built right
into it so we can control it from the
neck seal so I've pulled my app now and
if I press the unlock button right here
the door opens even from 90 feet away
one of the next best selling points is
its website once you log in you'll have
access to a whole array of features that
are designed to give you complete
control over your home automation needs
you've got this list of recent events
which are all the things you triggered
all the lights going on and doors
opening and closing you also have this
automation Center and this is where you
can create different automation setups
where if the door opens the light comes
on if you've used IFFT before if this
than that it's a lot like that if this
thing happens then that thing happens
unfortunately you can't create these
automated setups on the app it has to be
on the website and that's one of my big
critiques here is that the app to be a
little more powerful
next you charge is nine dollars a month
to use their services if you're looking
to automate only one light or one
appliance probably not worth it to spend
nine dollars a month so there's a neck
seal right for you well if you want to
get into home automation and you feel a
little overwhelmed it's a really good
option at 59.99 it makes it very easy
and accessible to automate a lot of
different things at once all from one
app thanks for watching I'm right chris
