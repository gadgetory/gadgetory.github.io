this whirlpool front load washing
machine when I first looked at it it's
fairly basic looking the dials are kind
of standard there's really nothing new
modern or fresh about it like we've seen
with some other models and it's
performance was just so-so
it did okay with stain removal it did
okay with wear and tear but it didn't do
great and didn't do terrible so I was
feeling like it was kind of
middle-of-the-road and a little bit
boring but then when you take a look at
its features it offers a little bit more
than your standard 1349 dollar washing
machine so for starters it has a load
and go feature basically it's an insert
that goes inside the detergent reservoir
and it can hold up to 12 loads of
detergent for a typical 8 pound load so
it's not a huge load but also not a
small load it's basically the standard
size for typical household in the United
States and it also has a fan fresh
feature this is my favorite so my
husband and I are always forgetting to
take stuff out of the washer and put it
into the dryer but with fan fresh it'll
actually fan and circulate your clothes
around for up to 12 hours if you forget
that step so it'll keep them fresh or at
least a little more fresh so you don't
have to wash them all over again so if
those features sound pretty good to you
I would definitely take a look at this
washer although do keep in mind that it
doesn't do anything new in terms of
design and it doesn't have great
performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
