looking up at history to get closer I
wave a magic wand it's all because I'm
wearing a headset that unlocks a secret
power inside my phone
this is daydream by Google until today
there were only two real ways to turn
your phone into a doorway to another
world this cheap piece of cardboard and
a big plastic headset that only worked
with Samsung phones now there's the
daydream view compared to Samsung's gear
VR it's lighter made a breathable fabric
and Google wants every smartphone maker
to hop on board also it costs just 80 US
dollars and unlike most game focused VR
headsets daydream let's see teleport
around the world type in any address in
Google Street View saying your parents
old house and your their record a 360
degree photo with Google's cardboard
camera app and the daydream headset will
make it feel like you stepped into a
memory it's also a private theater for
all of YouTube and any movie you rent
from Google Play including YouTube
videos that say teleport you underwater
to swim with dolphins or into the
kitchen with your favorite YouTube
celebs I wasn't kidding about that magic
wand it comes with a tiny we like remote
that lets you point where you want to go
tap out text on a virtual keyboard or
anything else
developers dream up it's way better than
having to tap your temple to get things
done but that just isn't a lot else to
do in daydream right now it's just a
handful of apps today compared to four
hundred plus experiences you can find on
Samsung and unless you have a Google
pixel the only phone that works with
daydream right now there's no point in
rushing out to buy one but do yourself a
favor starting today when you go on
vacation use that cardboard camera amp
to take some 360 degree photos you may
regret not doing it if daydream catches
on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
