welcome to everything Google that we can
think of this week it's still the
biggest story in the smartphone world
and it's the latest on the galaxy note 7
now you've all been waiting to see how
Samsung's updated Galaxy Note 7 refresh
is going but it may not look that good
that's after a report from the South
Korean TV news network
that says a growing number of complaints
are now claiming the updated phones are
still having battery issues this time
they are accelerated battery drain or
difficulty charging when plugged in now
one example of battery drain was jumping
from 75 percent to 49 percent in just 39
minutes or gaining only a 10 percent
charge through an entire night of
charging so far these incidents are
limited to South Korea and Samsung is
claiming these are also isolated
incidents so we'll have to wait and see
but it's really all about a preview to
Google's October 4th event next week
Tuesday after a Google released a tweet
last week it's never been explicitly
said but the announcement of their new
Google pixel phone is a sure thing and
they have been blasting the marketing on
this like no other Google phone that
we've seen in the past now leaks have
showcased blurred-out models of the
pixel and pixel XL with its glass and
aluminum construction but reports by
Android police claimed they will come in
silly colour names such as very silver
white black and the third alleged colour
really blue and we're being serious also
Android police reports that Google will
have final pricing for the anticipated
Amazon echo rival Google home and it
will retail for 129 which is $40 less
than the standard Amazon echo Google
Wi-Fi will also sell for $129 according
to the reports and will be able to
connect to multiple Google Wi-Fi access
points to create a big single one and
the chromecast ultra 4k renders have
been released for their newest 4k video
streaming dongle that will sell for $69
according to reports with a newer
slightly sleeker design but there's
still more coming in the future from
Google an exclusive report from 9 to 5
Google's claims
Google plans to launch the anticipated
and dromeda Android and Chrome hybrid OS
on two devices including a Huawei Nexus
tablet and a convertible laptop that
Android police also
operated now Huawei tablets could be the
one Evan blast tweeted out a few weeks
ago but reports also confirmed Google is
testing out Andromeda on the Nexus 9
tablet as well timelines could be a lot
further down but the huawei tablet is
starting to be ready before the end of
the year and the new pixel convertible
laptop could be ready by the third
quarter of 2017 and finally and what
looks like the worst Google self-driving
car accident to date you can see the
damage to the cars right door site and
the crushed windows but reports say that
this was in fact a civilian driver at
fault that ran a red light and collided
with the Google car whose green light
was on for at least six seconds Google
added that human error has played a part
in 94% of crashes reported to date all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show you can always email me at Google
issues at cnet.com or to me at brian tom
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you next time for some more of that
Google issues do you Ganesh's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
