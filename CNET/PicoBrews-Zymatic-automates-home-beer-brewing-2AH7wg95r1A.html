2015 at the Pico brew booth but to check
out their brand new Pico brews I'm
addict automatic home brewing machine
they just come out of a successful
Kickstarter is the second most
successful food Kickstarter campaign of
all time so the idea behind the Pico
brews I'm addict is that you buy kits of
grain hops all the ingredients to make
beer at home you by the automatic
brewing machine that can regulate the
temperature the water and then you get a
keg that comes with it you can download
recipes off of pico brew site including
recipes for all the different craft
brews out there and then set it to go
make your beer automatically there is
still the traditional hanging or
bottling process that you have to go
through but as far as making the initial
beer run that all happens in this
machine it's a much cleaner process
theoretically than what though normal
home brewer might do it's also easier in
that there's one compartment you load
all the stuff in set the buttons and
pretty much walk away pricing for this
is definitely not cheap you have to
really want to make craft beer at home
the Kickstarter campaign ended it's
about 1,800 bucks for a pre-order they
say after CES the price is going to go
up to two thousand dollars so you've
really got to be into it but there are
certainly enough craft brewers out there
who are so we actually have a test unit
of a Pico brews I'm addict coming to the
cnet review lab we're really excited to
test it out hopefully we'll have that
reveal for the next few weeks until then
I'm rich brown here at CES 2015 here's
the Pico bruised I'm at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
