car and what does this have to do with
the cnet smart oh well there are ways of
integrating your car into your smart
home so this week we're taking a look at
automatic this $99 gadget plugs into
your car's obd2 port and contract
diagnostic data like miles driven and
gas used and when you finally pull into
your garage at the end of long commute
and turn your car off it'll trigger your
lights and adjust your temperature
automatic even has some integrations
with the Amazon echo which has become
the center of the scene on smartone
alexa ask automatic where's my car 5402
Shepherdsville Road ask automatic how
much I drove last week you drove 82
miles over 4.0 hours last week and
that's pretty much it automatic doesn't
do much else it only sends if commands
when your ignition goes on or off either
forever or only in an area you specify
or when the check engine light comes on
or off it doesn't have geofencing so it
can't automate the opening of your
garage door as you approach your house
and the echo integrations while cool are
kind of thin so in short by automatic
for its ability to track the data from
your obd2 port and not for its smart
home integrations for our part it's the
best option available for getting your
car to work with your smart home there
are other devices like automatic but
they don't have Alexis skills which is a
no-go for us so while we aren't thrilled
with its smartphone functionality
automatic is our pick for a way to
integrate a car with the sea not smart
