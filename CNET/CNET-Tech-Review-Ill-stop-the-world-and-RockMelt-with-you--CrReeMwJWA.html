RockMelt your facebook off with the new
browser this Samsung continuum doubles
down on touchscreens best tube downloads
youtube to your phone and brian cooley
picks a fight with iphone fans it's all
coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and of course offer that
unique tech wisdom in the form of the
bottom line let's get started with the
good the internet was abuzz this week
about rockmelt it's a new web browser
that aims to help you manage all of your
social networking needs here's Seth
Rosenblatt to show you how it works
while rumors of a facebook phone persist
one company has gone ahead and created
an unofficial Facebook browser RockMelt
backed by mosaic founder Mark Anderson
among others is so tied to Facebook that
at the time of the browser's release you
couldn't even get an invite to download
it without having a Facebook account
rockmelt is more of a competitor for the
social networking friendly flock browser
than anything else but if that's what
you're looking for you're really going
to like rock mountain it takes the
sidebar which interestingly made its
chromium debut in flock 3 and mirrors it
creating dual narrow sidebars the left
side bar called the friends edge is
dedicated to your Facebook friends
showing who's online filter or bowl by
favorites and a show all friends button
the right sidebar the app edge is where
you can toggle social networks providing
one-click access to your facebook news
feed your Facebook profile and your
Twitter account an indicator will tell
you when you've got new updates Chrome
extensions that you install will also
live here although they don't always
work RockMelt has a few neat tricks up
its sleeve there's a share button at the
right edge of the URL bar from which you
can quickly share a link to Facebook or
Twitter with a note also when you land
on a page with an RSS feed RockMelt will
auto-detect it and provide a one click
button for subscribing besides the
sidebars sorry edges there are two
design changes in Rockville worth noting
the first is that the unified options
menu has been shifted to the left of the
browser mimicking designs seen an opera
and the upcoming Firefox for the edges
can be toggled here in the options menu
or by hotkey but rockmelt also
resurrects the
dedicated search box since the location
bar here possesses the same Omni powers
that it does in chromium as well as
facebook friend searching it's not
entirely clear why the browser has
sacrificed the screen real estate note
that it won't search your Twitter
contacts given the premium that the
sidebars force on open screen space I
can't say that this was a good idea more
importantly rockmelt unabashedly forces
you to login to your facebook account
and share your friends list with it
before you can use the browser the
company says that it doesn't share your
data with anyone and I'm inclined to
take them at face value simply because
these social networking features require
a trade off if you're not comfortable
sacrificing that level of privacy she
was a different browser at the time of
its release in November 2010 rock
mountain is also a security risk it's
built on version 6 of chromium while the
stable build of chrome is already well
into version 7 and is expected to hit
version 8 before 2011 given the hyper
social privacy busting behavior that
rock mount encourages running without
the most up-to-date security patches
poses a massive potential security risk
to users RockMelt is an encouraging take
on the social networking browser
phenomenon presenting an interesting
alternative to flock it still has
numerous kinks and bugs to be worked out
but if you live and die by Facebook and
Twitter this might just be the browser
for you it's currently available on cnet
download.com the first look at RockMelt
I'm Seth Rosenbaum man that whole
security thing is just kind of a buzz
kill isn't it mean like Twitter or
protect my bank information I guess
maybe just launched chrome for banking
rock melts really fun though now
remember when just having a touch screen
on your phone was a big deal well if the
new Samsung continuum catches on having
only one touch screen will just be kind
of sad
hi I'm Bonnie class senior editor at
cnet com and we're here in New York
where Samsung and Verizon different
unveiled the Samsung continuum this is
Samsung's latest galaxy s phone and its
unique and then it has two displays we
have a three point four inch Super
AMOLED display here as well as a Super
AMOLED ticker display down here the
ticker display acts as a notification
bar for your news feeds as well as
social networking updates it will also
alert you to new messages and voicemail
and such you can also use it to control
your music player the phone also has
grips and for technology so if the main
screen is off you can actually just
touch the bottom here and it will
activate the ticker display so you can
just see your updates without having to
re wake your phone as far as the other
parts of the design it's very much like
the other galaxy s PA just nice and thin
and lightweight a little bit plasticky
in which I've said bit more but not too
bad it's running android 2.1 but will be
upgradable to android 2.2 as a 1 Giga
for coming word processor as well as a 5
megapixel camera with HD video capture
like
unfortunately being is going to be the
default search engine as well as mapping
application on here what overall looks
like a very nice phone we're looking
forward to checking out the ticker
display the thief is really useful or
just a novelty feature the same company
will be available for pre-order on
November 11 and in stores on November 18
and the cost is one 9999 with the
two-year contract and after $100 mail-in
rebate I'm Bonnie ton this has been your
first look at the samsung continuum or
verizon wireless you know the continuum
is also the gadget of the week over on
my other show the buzz report just in
case you haven't seen it on this show we
talked a lot about sexy smart phones and
flashy tablets and even burly muscle
cars but there are also plenty of
digital cameras and monitors and even
printers that never get a chance to
shine so here's a look at a few of these
sometimes overlooked products
everyone America Franklin from cnet com
and today we're taking a first look at
the samsung syncmaster FX 2490 HD the FX
is sleek and stylish looking with a very
thin profile and unique looking chrome
foots 10 when knock from the sides the
foot stand does a good job of keeping
the monitor from falling over but the
panel still wobbles a lot when knocked
the panel tilts back 10 degrees and
swivels right and left 30 degrees but no
other ergonomic options are included the
connection options include two hdmi
ports component and composite ports a
coaxial antenna N and up to audio out
port a headphone jack a USB port and an
e x-linked port the FX includes a
samsung TV like remote and is the
preferred way of navigating the OSD
picture options include typical controls
like brightness contrast sharpness and
some custom presets also there's a color
temperature option and an option to
adjust in red green and blue values
individually in movies the samsung
Display dark detail just as well as on
the Samsung px 2370 will sit out most
was the apparent green push noticeable
in character faces making them appear
sickly compared to the healthy looking
faces of the PX 2370 however we were
able to make some color adjustments in
the settings and things improved greatly
we found games to deliver a vibrant
image with no hint of that green color
tint problem after calibration at least
in power consumption the FX would cost
nine dot 53 cents per year to run
compared with the PX 2377 dot 65 cents
per year the FX has performance that
rivals the PX 2370 it also has some of
the best movie and games performance
we've seen recently as a near full
assortment HD TV connection options
still for 419 dollars Samsung offers
essentially a 24-inch television at a
very appealing price once again this is
eric franklin and this has been the
first look at the samsung syncmaster FX
2498
hi I'm Josh Goldman senior editor with
Cena and this is a look at the canon
powershot SD 4500 is it's the company's
smallest Compact magazine featuring a
10x optical zoom though the lens isn't
wide-angle so it's not as flexible as
some of competing models similarly it
has a 3 inch LCD on back but it's a
standard 233,000 dot resolution instead
of a higher resolution screen that we're
seeing on other high-end compact mega
zooms overall though it's a nice design
if you're looking for a simple easy to
use compact mega zoom that's small
enough to fit in a shirt pocket the SD
4500 is the second power shot with a
high sensitivity 10 megapixel backside
illuminated CMOS sensor now that sensor
mainly improves low-light photo quality
but it also allows for some speedy burst
shooting getting up to 3.6 frames per
second there are faster compacts but
they usually make you wait while the
camera stores the photos and the Canon
doesn't however the rest of its shooting
performance is average bordering on slow
it's photo quality is overall very good
thanks to generally excellent colour but
like most cameras in this category
subjects look soft and benefit from a
little sharpening the SD 4500 is also
capable of recording nice-looking movies
and resolutions up to full HD 1080p at
24 frames per second and there's a
stereo mic in front and use of the
optical zoom while recording there's
also a super slow motion mode that
records video at 240 frames per second
and a resolution of 320 x 240 so really
only suitable for viewing on a small
screen but it's fun nonetheless all of
these features and its small size seem
to come at the cost of battery life
though the little rechargeable pack is
only rated for a hundred and five
two shots and using any of the burst or
movie modes put real hurt on on battery
life but if frequent recharging doesn't
bother you or you're willing to buy an
extra battery the camera is certainly a
compact magazine worth considering I'm
Josh Goldman and that's the canon
powershot SD 4500 is hi I'm Justin you
associate editor for cnet.com with a
first look at the oki be 431 DN
monochrome laser printer so it's boxy
shape and generic aesthetic may be
easily confused with other printers but
this one deserves your extra attention
the appeal of the three hundred and
fifty dollar be 431 DN lies in its
simple setup ease of use and extra
features like an auto duplexer for
double-sided printing and an ethernet
networking that lets multiple users
print at the same time all controls live
on top of the unit here and you get your
standard array of buttons and two line
LCD which is really all you need for a
simple monochrome we're also big fans of
the dual paper inputs as well the main
tray pulls out of the bottom and fits
250 sheets of paper but there's also a
multi-purpose tray above it that can fit
another 100 sheets most printers only
giving you 250 so if you're looking for
an efficient printer for simple jobs
like business documents and text pages
the B 431 DN won't disappoint it printed
faster than all four of our competitive
printers at an impressive 33.86 pages
per minute and it also has the quality
to match for its modern features
affordable price tag and fast output
speed the oki be 431 DN exceeds our
expectations for a small business
printer and it's well deserving of our
cnet editors choice award so I'm Justin
you this is the oki be 431 DN and that
sounds good
sounds good to me too Justin but enough
of that for right now we'll get back to
the cool phones and apps right after
this quick break when the cnet tech
review continues
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good have you ever
tried to show somebody a hilarious
youtube video on your phone only to find
out that you can't get a signal I know
bummer well thanks to a new app called
best tube you'll be able to play your
favorite videos wherever you are hey
guys welcome to tap that app i'm brian
Tong and this is the show where we cover
the hottest apps in the mobile space now
we all love watching youtube videos on
the go but what if you want to save
those videos to your phone so you can
watch the high quality versions anytime
check out the free app in the android
market place called best tube by jared w
smith for android phones the app
showcases the most popular and top rated
videos but you can also search for a
video that you're looking for once
you've found it you'll have the option
to preview it or download it directly to
your phone's SD card you want to make
sure you're on Wi-Fi when you use this
app because the quality of the file will
depend on your phone's current bandwidth
an edge or 3g can be iffy now once it's
downloaded you can view your favorite
YouTube videos whenever and wherever you
want and if you use a long press you'll
also have other options to save the file
as an mp3 or copy and rename it it's a
free app but one negative is the ad
banner that appears over each downloaded
video if you click on it once it'll take
you to another screen but it will never
show up again now there aren't any apps
like this available through the iphone
palm or blackberries official app store
so it makes best tube unique and easy to
set up if you're looking to save those
youtube videos you just can't get enough
of then go with best tube and best of
all it's free now if you guys have any
other apps or dance moves you'd like to
see send us along an email to tap that
app at cnet com i'm brian Tong thanks
for watching and we'll see you guys next
week the show
finally I can watch the bed intruder
song any time I want which is pretty
often you know that one right magix hide
your wife hide your kids hide your wife
cause they rapin errbody on you and I
hope that made you feel good because now
it's time for the bad sometimes it's
hard to find a product that qualifies as
bad for the show because most of the
things we review have at least some
redeeming qualities but that is hardly
the case with this new cell phone for
metropcs I'm jessica's all court with
cnet com looking at the ZTE agent for
metropcs now unfortunately this is one
of those phones that has little to
recommend it it's tall and slim with the
soft touch back cover that makes it grip
well and feel comfortable in the hand
and it can slip into almost any pocket
the screen is also nice and large for
the phone's height and fairly sharp and
clear looking however we did find that
the navigation buttons below the screen
are a bit constricted and you can see
how tall and narrow the talk and hang
keys are and the circular toggle here
it's a bit too small to make navigation
very finger friendly we do like the
shortcut to the music player will give
it that and we also enjoyed that the
dial pad buttons are almost scaled so
that typing in a phone number was no
problem on the back is a 1.3 megapixel
camera and camcorder plus a vanity
mirror inside there's a slew of metropcs
branded apps including a navigator plus
all of your usual organizer tools like
the calendar there's instant messaging
and the metra web browser plus some
other preloaded apps like loopt we do
have to say that call quality was pretty
poor in our tests so to bring it all
together the agent is a prepaid phone
that will cost you $69 that's a typical
price for a not too fancy phone you buy
without a contract but frankly you can
get better phones with metropcs for less
or for a few dollars more we'd recommend
you keep shopping around this is Jessica
doll court from cnet looking at the ZTE
agent for metropcs
okay so I guess if you like wasting
money on phones that don't really do
much then I guess this could be the
phone for you and also I want to meet
you because why would you do that now
let's see what we've got in this week's
bottom line the battle between the
iphone and android phones is raging and
both sides of the fight have their own
upsides and downsides so leave it to
brian cooley in this week's top 5 to
draw a line in the sand
okay I gotta get my gear on for this one
not sure what's going to get winged at
me for this bit of sacrilege it's top 5
reasons android is better than iphone as
laid out by the team at cnet's android
atlas weekly podcast yeah I know that
sounds like we're comparing an OS to a
product line but you get it we're going
to compare the universe's here OS
devices apps and carriers between the
two hottest smartphone platforms in the
world here we go number five android is
open source the folks behind it don't
care if you hack the phone you paid for
and they don't play games trying to
outfox the way you did it instead they
have lives and the android marketplace
that's pretty much the jezebel of apps
welcoming one and all with wide open
listings add in the alternate android
market places and it all adds up to apt
democracy now yes that does mean you can
get some lousy buggy scammy apps but you
and developers are treated like a bunch
of grown-ups in the Android world not
like you're going to a daycare number
for real multitasking yes iOS does
multitasking now but not to the true
degree android does apps there are free
to do their thing like programs on a
personal computer and yes as with a
computer it means you can run into some
conflicts but see note 1 above about
daycare number three Adobe's Flash
android phones support it Apple's don't
and won't it means your Android phone
can hit the web all of it with a browser
not a custom app for each website you
want to run well on your phone website
apps aren't always cool innovation
sometimes they're just baggage and with
Android you don't have to use them
number two handsets lots of them there's
something like 80 android phones and
Counting Apple has to really one and a
half simplicity's worked well for them
but then again there's that choice thing
android has choice of features through
all those handsets features you want
features you don't choice of a real
keyboard or just a pretty
one on the screen choice of a device
with removable battery memory expansion
slot you get the idea as we see everyone
adopting smartphones can one or one and
a half devices really fit all before we
check out the number one reason Android
makes iPhone look like the phone for
sheeple let's look at why we're even
talking about this androids on fire in
the US market it outsold iPhone in q3 of
2010 to grab forty-four percent of
smartphone shipments against apple's
twenty-six percent that comparison
unthinkable a year ago globally Android
shipments are up thirteen hundred
percent in a year 220 million worldwide
Apple still dominates in the number of
apps available but where do you think
that trend lines gonna be going and
finally the number one reason Android is
better than iphone really is carriers
that pesky choice thing again android
phones are on a bunch of carriers iphone
is and always has been just on AT&amp;amp;T and
even if you're one of the six people
who've never heard the constant
complaints about eight TNT's network you
still might not want to move to it maybe
you just like your carrier well they've
probably got a good android phone
waiting for you so if you're now
thinking Apple might be more 1984 than
not you'll want to check out cnet's
Android Atlas weekly podcast hosted by
just a neck house and a variety of other
experts he plucks from around cnet every
week just head to cnet com / live and
for more top 5 goodness its top 5 cnet
com I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
the bottom line this week oh yes he did
I would not want to be opening Brian's
mail this week but we look forward to
your unbiased and well thought-out
comments and of course if you don't
agree with Brian's list keep an eye out
for the top five reasons why I phone is
better than Android in the coming weeks
okay folks with that it is time for me
to go join us next week for a brand-new
cnet tech review and until then there
are tons of great videos available every
day at cnet TV com I'll see you next
time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
