the alpha x for all the good and bad
inside the world of apple right now I'm
in Korea so uh I work on my korean won
i'm out there but this week we're gonna
set you up with everything we expect to
see at WWDC 2013 and if you're hoping
that app will release one of their next
game changers you're gonna be a little
disappointed instead Tim Cook recently
said that WWDC will showcase the future
of iOS 7 and OS 10 a new hardware will
be coming in the fall now I'm excited
because we finally see if the Cupertino
kids in Johnny I've have created a
completely new look and feel for Apple's
mobile OS with its rumored flattered you
I there's no denying that's fallen
behind Android and they need something
badly now the rumor mills have been
pretty quiet and we haven't seen any
screenshot leaks yet and the same goes
for OS 10 we know both iOS and OS 10
have shown up in website logs and are
being tested but Apple has done a great
job keeping them under wraps so the plan
is to show off iOS get it into
developers hands so they can update
their apps and incorporate new features
and then release it publicly with the
new iphone that we expect to see some
time around September which is what
they've historically done in the past
and hopefully we get OS 10 I'm still
sticking to the Hello Kitty name we also
expect it to look a little flatter and
release sometime around mid to late july
now one service we might finally see is
the premiere of apples i radio service
cnet reports that apple's reached a deal
with warner music group the world's
number three major music label they've
already locked down a deal with the big
kahuna universal music with Sony being
their final big label to lock down now
the timing of the Warner deal suggests
Apple is pushing hard to try to unveil
their service for WWDC so I'm gonna give
this a 50-50 chance that we see it but
if they close the deal with Sony in time
we'll definitely see it at the worldwide
developers conference now we told you we
don't expect to see any of apple's
rumored new shiny toys like the Apple TV
TV or the iWatch but we do expect to see
a hardware refresh for the macbook pros
and macbook airs at WWDC now getting
Intel's latest Haswell chip said that
dramatic
reduce power consumption is pretty much
a given but a KGI Securities analyst
expects a slightly slimmer form factor
with the retina macbook pro 13 and
improved FaceTime cameras that will
support full 1080p video now on the
macbook air line KGI also expects to see
dual built-in microphones for better
FaceTime and voip audio quality we'll
see how it shakes out but either way if
you bought a macbook pro a few days ago
you're probably crying right now alright
WWDC could also be a great time to show
off the new Mac Pro that Tim Cook
promised will come out later this year
but my gut says we still won't see them
I could be wrong but we haven't heard a
peep about Apple's revamp pro desktops
yet now the small hardware update we did
recently see was the lower-priced ipod
touch at 229 the now comes in a 16 gig
capacity loses the rear camera and the
biggest thing I'm sad about the loss of
the loop attachment I just wanted to
give it the moment of silence it
deserves but this points to Apple Lily
looking at bringing a scaled-down
version of a current product at a
cheaper price and points to a stronger
possibility the Apple might bring two
different iphone models later in the
fall so I don't know about you guys but
I'm honestly excited about WWDC I've
always been a fan of OS updates well
except for last year's when Apple
basically kept it the same and added new
features that I barely used but this is
a make-it-or-break-it year for them and
it will trickle down to all their new
products in 2013 now you the Apple
biters can also watch our live coverage
of WWDC 2013 on june the 10th starting
at 9am i'll be hosting a live pre-show

tweets and pick my small tiny brain will

then have a live post show and you can
find it all at cnet com on Monday June

apple byte at cnet com and your tweets
