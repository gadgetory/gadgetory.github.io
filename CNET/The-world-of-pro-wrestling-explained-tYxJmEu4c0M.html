from Brooklyn to Beijing last year it
raked in over seven hundred and twenty
million dollars millions of people watch
it on a weekly basis and in April 19th
and packed out AT&amp;amp;T Stadium for
Wrestlemania but those are just numbers
we're here to explain why we - totally
normal adults love watching effects for
it
well the starters it's not fake and
secondly it's not a sport on the surface
Pro Wrestling can look like some of the
most unsophisticated entertainment there
is and in fairness the over-the-top
theatrics childish gimmicks and
flamboyant costumes don't help I was
liking with my cousin about this one
time and I said that wrestling's art he
said that wrestling's are not in the
same way that burping the alphabets are
not the problem is that non fans treated
as a sport but the fans it's like a soap
opera with fight scenes this is one
basic story everyone wants to get the
belt and be champ what wrestling comes
down to is how any given character tries
to win it they're heroes and villains
with promos and backstage antics
designed to get the audience excited to
see their favorite good guys face off
against the dastardly bad guys stories
unfold over weeks and months and there
are lots of drama unfolds through
interviews locker room brawls and verbal
showdowns it all comes down to every
story getting resolved with a big
climactic confrontation let's get this
out of the way a lot of the fights are
scripted but most of the slams the
strikes the falls do hurt there is a
difference between getting injured and
getting hurt and wrestlers always get
hurt it's their job to throw themselves
at the ground and take punches and kicks
to the face for your enjoyment when I
was growing up dad would tell me
Russell's don't get hurt because they
know how to break a fall how was that
that is called taking a bob six-time
world champion Chris Jericho says the
shock to the body is like any a bucket
water to the face this is the same Chris
Jericho who's jumped off a cage and even
been slammed onto thumbtacks and that's
just the type of pain wrestlers feel
when everything is going to plan that
doesn't take into account the accidents
which do happen like when Steve Austin
had his neck broken because he was
slightly out of position or when Randy
Orton was thrown out of the ring fell
wrong and broke his collarbone everybody
knows it's not real
but to struggle to pinpoint exactly
where showmanship ends and reality
begins is part of why it's so fun
check out goldberg military pressing a
300 pound brock lesner
or Cesaro swinging the gigantic 7-foot 3
great colleague here's John Cena lifting
two men over his shoulders that's 700
pounds of sweaty sweaty dude no they're
not real fighters but they are real
lifts throws and burly men being tossed
around
it's impressive stuff that's why fans
will tell you it's not fake it's
predetermined so you're probably
thinking wrestling is here on the
rediculous scale and TV and movies is
about here well wrestling is actually
here but let's look at zombie hordes and
Dragons and going back in time to flirt
with your mother stuff is ridiculous
but it's embracing that ridiculousness
and the reality of it that makes it fun
and that's another thing WWE can be
quite wacky and silly but that doesn't
mean all wrestling is like that all the
time you'd have a totally different
perception of wrestling if you watch New
Japan Pro Wrestling wear something
called strong styles famous imagine a
vicious combo pro wrestling in MMA where
strikes are hard and Submission holds
our fears don't get us wrong a lot of
wrestling is really really dumb but when
it's good it is so good you see things
you didn't think we're possible live and
you get invested in a way you didn't
think you could still not a soap opera
though rope opera
