have been screaming for us since Toyota
first invented this car now it's here in
production form let's plug in to the
2012 Prius plug-in and check the tech
well here it is 2012 production Prius
plug-in we drove a prototype a few
months ago but this is the real deal
available now only in the west coast and
Northeast states why do you get a
plug-in Prius people ask me this
question all the time here is the
difference it's got a bigger battery
that you charge both by driving like an
irregular Prius and also by plugging it
in when you can that's different than a
standard Prius the reason you go to all
this trouble and put this bigger battery
in is to get more electric range a
standard Prius can go a mile or two on
battery only at low speeds this car can
go 11 to 16 miles on battery only at up
to 62 miles per hour it behaves like an
electric car if you just use it around
town in fact you might never put gas in
this car if you have like a ten-mile
commute each way that doesn't go beyond
sixty miles an hour
okay the plug-in hybrid doesn't have
anything different in the cabin than a
standard Prius we've got this head unit
which I call in tune light it's the
smaller screen at this point in history
it only has Pandora and Bing from the
Entune app suite later in 2012 they'll
be adding things like movie tickets calm
and open table if you upgrade this card
to what's called the advanced model you
get the better head unit we've seen
before which is more Lexus like and that
already has all the apps in it plus a
bunch of other features come in that
package now here's where you see your
various energy monitors again those are
also found on the Prius but you're going
to see numbers here you're never going
to see on a standard Prius like that one
at the bottom middle consumption
averaged over more than 300 miles 61
miles per gallon that's what a bigger
battery is going to get you and like the
current third gen Prius you can also
look at all kinds of historical averages
and you can enter the average
consumption of your other car so this
guy will always remind you how much
you're saving by driving it versus the
one in the garage and all these Prius
plugins are nicely equipped they don't
make a stripped one which is part of why
the price is a little steep we'll get to
that in a minute your sources are going
to include am/fm HD radio satellite
radio should you choose to activate it
and of course you've got an optical
drive up here a 2 DP bluetooth streaming
and of course Bluetooth hands-free for
telephony on a standard outlet this
battery takes three hours to charge from
dead flat or an hour and a half if you
get a level 2 charger Fotis sells you a
level 2 charger with their partner
Leviton for about a grand installed at
your house and of course when you drive
you're also trickle charging the battery
but you need to plug it in once in a
while to get the full benefit
when you lift the hood on the Prius
you're getting into a very different
world the motor is not that different
from the standard Prius the battery is
and the numbers that come out of it are
also different so for example the
battery in a standard Prius is nickel
metal hydride 1.3 kilowatt-hours this
guy has a more advanced lithium ion
battery kind of a giant version of
what's in your phone or laptop but 4.4
kilowatt hours more than three times the
capacity and a different charging and
discharging a view higher performance in
combination with this 1.8 liter
lean-burn gas engine like a standard
Prius you get 95 mpg equivalent while
driving in electric mode that means an
equivalent amount of energy as gallons
of gas turns into 95 mpg it's this
tortured EPA calculation or if you're
running in hybrid mode like a regular
Prius you get the same 50 mpg average
134 horsepower by the way torque who
cares the bottom line is this car is not
about performance though it is slower
than a standard Prius something around
11 seconds versus under 10 for the
standard Prius partly due to a heavier
battery 123 more pounds of weight on
this guy but none of this really matters
till we get inside see how it rides and
drives and see what kind of consumption
figures show up on that dash
now driving the Prius plug-in you're
just very aware that the engines not
kicking and that's the main difference
between this and a standard Prius the
ride quality seems about the same I
thought it was harsher when I first was
driving the car today I don't think so
not noticeably so anyway but you're
seeing that easy mode light there on the
eyebrow - on all the time instead of for
behalf a mile or a quarter mile to go
and you can get into the throttle and it
doesn't kick into the gas engine it
stays electric like I said up to 62
miles per hour this button right here
though will let you become a standard
hybrid by pressing it so you have HV or
evey mode then of course there's eco
mode and power mode which operate the
same as they do on other hybrids
including the Prius now in spite of the
fact that I've got a bigger battery and
more electricity available this is not a
more performance oriented Prius it could
be but the battery is not used that way
they ring all the range out of it they
can not all the torque out of it they
can like let's say a Tesla Roadster
Dennis so people ask me all the time
what's the payoff time on this car and
we already know that a hybrid takes a
certain number of years to earn back the
hybrid premium what about this one it's
an even harder calculation because if
you're driving type is that which you
almost never use gas that's one entire
calculation if you run this car down a
lot and kick in two hybrid mode that's a
completely different calculation okay
let's price our Prius plug-in 32,000
bass compare that to the least expensive
standard Prius at 24,000 pretty big
difference but the price on the most
comparable equipped Prius is more like
26 so that narrows it down to a little
over $6,000 difference for the plug-in
model on top of that though I'm going to
add seventy one hundred dollars to go
seen that style on this car I'm gonna
get what they call the advanced trim
that gets you the head-up display
adaptive cruise hard drive nav JBL audio
system all kinds of improvements
including LED headlights it makes a big
difference in terms of technology and
the price seems fair if you're
interested otherwise get one that's base
drive it relatively short distances and
you
not even know what a gas station is in a
few years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
