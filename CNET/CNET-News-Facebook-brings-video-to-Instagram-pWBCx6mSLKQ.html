Instagram hasn't changed we have our
feed here I'm going to walk through a
demo now what we've done is make
Instagram better so first you tap on the
capture button in the middle of the tab
bar and let's say we were at blue bottle
coffee in the city and we wanted to
record a moment there now what you'll
notice is it's the same screen but now
you've got a video icon on the bottom
right everyone's trying to see I love it
we'll move that up next time so you tap
the video icon and all of a sudden you
go into video mode slide over you've got
a separate capture button all you have
to do is hold down that button to start
recording video so let's do that so
let's say we're at blue bottle coffee
they're using a Japanese siphon machine
to make some really beautiful coffee but
I'll tell you you can capture a lot in
15 seconds which is what we did 15
seconds of video it's the right balance
between not too short that constrains
your creativity and not too long where
you end up having to wait a lot of time
for something to download it's 15
seconds of beautiful video that you can
record very easily but not all the time
can you fit a single scene into 15
seconds without going to multiple clips
and we've heard loud and clear from the
community that's what they want so let's
go back and actually record our first
clip so we're recording our first clip
here of the Bristol bottle now we want
to add some color of pulling a shot of
espresso this is making me thirsty so we
see the next shot of pulling some
espresso and then finally let's see the
Bristol pouring a beautiful latte so
here we are pouring the beautiful latte
and i'm recording it by holding down
that button but you know what his hands
in the way and that's not good so what
we've allowed you to do is very simply
get rid of that last clip or frankly get
rid of any
it all we got to do is touch the little
delete button in the bottom left it
highlights the last clip and deletes it
so let's rerecord that last one to get a
better collage here we are with the
beautiful finished latte and let's just
focus on the latte itself now we're done
recording and this is a great video that
I want to share with my friends so I
click Next and this is where it gets
exciting as of today 13 brand-new custom
filters designed for video only so when
I click Next you'll see the preview this
is what people are going to see in the
feed it's a beautiful cover frame that
I've decided and it's a little touch
it's an Instagram touch these are the
little details that make all the
difference so as per normal I can fill
out my my caption that I want my friends
to see hashtags work just the same way
this is the same Instagram we all know
and love but it moves you can add to a
photo map you can name your location or
share it to your favorite social network
it's as simple as that and with that we
upload in the background and before you
know it it's available for all your
friends to see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
