that different from the s4 on the
outside but on the inside it's a
completely different animal there's lots
of hardware upgrades a redesigned
interior and a whole new way to open the
case I'm Bill Detweiler and this is
cracking open heavier than last year's
s4 I doubt many buyers will notice the
difference what they will likely notice
is the new hardware our AT&amp;amp;T model with
LTE has a quad-core 2.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon 801 sock on models without
LTE Samsung uses its own Exynos 54:22
sock now all versions have a 5.1 inch
1080p display two gigs of ram 16 gigs of
built-in storage a micro SD card slot a
16 megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel
front camera NFC support IR blaster and
a brand new fingerprint sensor the s5
also has an ingress protection rating of
6 7 now this is the same rating given
the s4 active which Brian Tong and I
torture tested at CES this year and it
means the phone provides complete dust
protection and limited water protection
now unlike the s4 active or the regular
s4 for that matter cracking open the s5
is a rather complicated affair to begin
remove the battery cover and the battery
then remove the three screws on the
inner cover now near one of the screws
is a small panel you'll need to remove
it and then detach the connector
underneath now this is really important
for the next step which is to remove the
front panel and display assembly so
break out your hairdryer heat gun or
other warming tool and slightly heat the
edges of the panel then gently pry it
loose be extremely careful not to
overheat the device and warp the plastic
or insert your tools too far and damage
the display or other internal hardware
now starting at the top lift the panel
away from the body but don't go too far
there's a connector here that we must
detach now remember that connector from
the back of the phone it snakes its way
through the device and it's connected to
the home button on the bottom of the
panel since we already disconnected it
you can gently push and pull it all the
way through and then completely remove
the panel and display assembly the
motherboard and other internal
components are attached to the inner
frame which is held in place with
several screws after removing the screws
we can separate the frame from the inner
cover on which the external speaker
headphone jack and buttons are located
after removing a few screws and
detaching the remaining connectors we
can lift out the motherboard as the
daughter board is glued to the internal
frame I'm going to leave it in place
finally we can detach the rear-facing
camera front-facing camera and then
remove the motherboards metal shields
with that our teardown is complete so
why did Samsung dramatically change the
phone's internal design well I reached
out to the company for an official
response but didn't hear anything back
as of this taping so I'm left to
speculate now I doubt it has anything to
do with the ingress protection rating as
the ip67 rated s4 active was built like
the original s4 and not like the s5
instead I suspect it has to do with
durability and repair ability it may
sound counterintuitive that making the
phone more complicated to open would
actually make it easier to repair but in
the s5s case it really does
you see opening the s4 case and removing
the motherboard and other internal
components was remarkably easy but
because the front panel and display were
basically fused to the internal frame it
was difficult to replace a cracked
screen on the s5 however
replacing a broken screen is relatively
simple even with the adhesive and it can
be done without removing any other
internal components having cracked open
or tested every Galaxy S model I
continue to be impressed by the
engineering effort Samsung puts into
their phones but I just wish they would
put the same effort into giving their
phones a more elegant and innovative
design for more information on the s5
including real world
