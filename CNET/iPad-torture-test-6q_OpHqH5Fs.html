exciting and potentially most painful
part of our show the torture test see
real life is hard on gadgets they get
left in cars or dropped or spilled on or
dunked they get shoved into purses with
keys all kinds of things can happen to
an iPad or a phone or a laptop so we
came up with a series of five tests to
see whether these gadgets can stand up
to real life we have heat cold dropping
and spilling Plus every gadget will get
a wild card test based in part on your
feedback the first device to go through
the gauntlet
the new iPad so we have an ice chest
here and we used our little infrared
thermometer to determine that it's 31
degrees now the iPad stated temperature
range says that you can safely use it
down to 32 we kind of want to see what
happens if we push it just a little
farther than that and you go a little
iPad
the light went off I hope not forever
we'll see what happens
find out how cold it is in here 44 it's
probably starting to heat up already
I'll tell you that back though look how
cold it is it's almost like you can see
frost on there I can draw a smiley face
39 degrees turn it on
it's actually surprisingly responsive
but it seems like the biggest problem we
have here if anything is just that the
screen keeps fogging up a car parked
outside on a hot day can get up to 120
to 140 degrees Fahrenheit on the inside
our ovens lowest temperature is 150
degrees so we're about to push our iPad
to just above its documented limit we
wrap the little guy in a towel to
protect the metal and we left it in for
30 minutes we just didn't really have
the heart to keep it in longer than that
after 30 minutes we nervously rescued
the iPad it didn't melt but you can see
a small formation of condensation we let
it rest and cool for another 30 minutes
and bit survived all right our third
generation iPad has survived the cold
test and the heat test which is pretty
impressive we're going to continue the
torture test gauntlet today we find out
if it can take a drop on our way to see
if it makes it all the way to water
alright we've devised three drop zones
for the new iPad the first is about 18
inches which I'm estimating is about the
height of a bedside table then assuming
it survives we're going to knock it off
this countertop here which seems likely
if it's left on a table or if you're
cooking with it in the kitchen
finally assuming it survives that will
drop it from standing height which on me
is a little unfair I know but you know I
don't know a guy could be holding it
okay let's get started with our 18 inch
drop let's say it was on the table it
got knocked in
okay it's fine it has some crumbs on it
no cracks good job little iPad good that
was loud
the glass is not cracked alright I'm
going to turn it off turn it back on it
seems to totally be functioning fine
okay this is kind of stressful all right
now I almost did it too soon
and then I just have a butterfingers
moment look at that iPad officially
survives the drop test in fact I think
I'm in worse shape than the iPad is
you
now incredibly the new iPad has survived
all of our drop tests which frankly I
was not expecting but now we've devised
a wildcard test so I was thinking a
thing that happens to my iPad a lot is
that I drop other things on it so we
have three items here to start with the
keys because they're kind of the
lightest in fact I don't really could be
worse here we go
I probably broke my fob that's like $500
no chips okay iPad doing good next up
the phone let's see no big deal they
both seem fine and I hope this soda can
doesn't explode all right okay
soda can and iPad are still fine and you
know what that means
iPad moves on to the water round
and I'm gonna
okay my iPads freaking out it's doing
things now the first thing you want to
do is get it out of the water turn it
off don't try to turn it back on I'm
going to dry it here the key with any
device is that once it gets wet you need
to give it time to dry before you try to
power it back on with a phone or
something which we'll show you in future
episodes you can put it in a bag of
something to try to dry it out in this
case the worst scenario probably is that
water got inside this dock but you can
see it's already come back on on its own
I'm going to turn it off though and
leave it alone for a couple days and
make sure it's still fine so far though
I had to say this is one tough iPad
tough I officially declare the new iPad
a torture test survivor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
