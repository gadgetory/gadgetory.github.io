report this week violent videos 3g
iphones and cell phones on a plate but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the new HP 2133
mini-note pc it turns out that Linux is
the new little the little a sous epc has
been such a success that hewlett-packard
is getting in the game and they've
released a little two and a half pound
notebook that can be configured with
either Linux or Windows it costs
anywhere from four hundred ninety nine
dollars to seven hundred fifty dollars
and it is tiny like purse tiny just like
the ax sous and may I just say that this
is how you win the women it's not the
pink or after it's the purse and now for
the news actually let's start with a new
thing just the headlines after a group
of Florida kids videotaped themselves
beating up another teenager the victim's
parents say that in myspace and youtube
need to do a better job of stopping kids
from uploading videos like that but see
the videos make it so much easier to
catch some bad guys Wall Street Journal
writer Walt Mossberg offhandedly
mentioned in a video interview that the
iphone would be 3g in 60 days he then
said it was a simple aside in a ballpark
estimate so take it to the bank then 3g
iphone 60 days well 54 days now Walt
knows Yahoo and Microsoft traded letters
this week with Microsoft offering Yahoo
an ultimatum and Yahoo saying that
Microsoft was being pushy and dishonest
Cod quit with the flirting and hook up
already you like those people at a party
who keep talking to everybody else about
each other it's annoying get it done and
in the week's big news the European
Union has moved one giant step closer to
allowing passengers to use their cell
phones on airplanes that's right they've
apparently either figured out or are
cheerfully ignoring the safety concerns
and we are potentially very close to
being able to make and receive calls in
flight in the EU anyway see I think this
won't turn out to be that big a deal
after we've had a while to get used to
it and we all by noise cancelling
headphones put boy the first couple of
months could be pretty rough
ladies and gentlemen capped it again
from the flight deck if every passenger
does not put their phone on vibrate
right now I'm gonna turn this thing
around and land it hmm what if you start
getting that baseball stadium effect hey
BTW where you at i hain't no no back
Tommy come back here let me wave at me
he'll be right up here 6a come here oh
you know there yeah Angie Malcolm see me
do you see me coping ya know I got extra
row man it's less you know people won't
know how to act at first
oh whoa well but eventually it'll be
fine eventually don't worry it's not
that big a deal and now for a look at
what's clogging the tubes it's postcards
from yo mama calm its outstanding it is
apparently real letters from mothers to
their children it doesn't even have to
be post cards emails count too luckily
here's a random sampling of the complete
awesomeness please clean up your
facebook sacks drugs lesbian stuff no
religion people look at that before they
hire you President Bush gets reports
about this stuff to listen to your
mother have a little common sense for
goodness sake have some Christian values
your mother I love my pudding pie beyond
compare the best thing that ever
happened to me was the day that alien
knocked on my door handed you to me and
said glar Fleur and then walked off love
you mom happy after April Fool's Day no
cat seriously call your mom tell your
lover mom's rule I'm Hollywood and this
has been the buzz report thanks for
