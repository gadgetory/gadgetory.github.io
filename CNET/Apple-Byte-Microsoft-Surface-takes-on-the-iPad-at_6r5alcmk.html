welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
now guys will announce our mophie juice
pack winners at the end of our show so
hold on for that but the news this week
is really about what's happening around
Apple and it's officially safe to say
that the tablet wars have begun with the
big boys coming to play now microsoft
unveiled their new tablet platform
called surface with Microsoft's own
hardware and software working together
the surface tablet will have a 10.6 inch
screen come in two flavors with their
flagship model featuring Windows RT it's
nine point three millimeters thin weighs
1.5 pounds it's made out of a vapor
deposited magnesium case they call vapor
mag it comes with a built-in kickstand
and their own killer touch cover that
has a multitouch keyboard on the other
side is pretty slick and so is this
promo video that makes me just want a
dubstep face just like this guy or not
now Microsoft announced no pricing or
availability but we expect to see the
surface surface in time for the holiday
season but that's not all the tablet
wars will get even hotter when Google
drops their own announcement in the
coming week and it's expected to be a
tablet of their own this would be a
Google branded tablet with reports
suggesting a sous is making the device
but it will be stock Android sold
directly by google now controlling the
hardware and the software experience is
genius where have we seen that before
but the reality is that competition is
good oh it's on like Grey Poupon believe
that and the big guns realize they need
to do the same to compete with Apple in
this still very young tablet market now
the new macbook pro with retina display
continues to get rave reviews even if it
will cost you a kidney or a pair of nike
air yeezy tues now check this out it's a
teardown by I fix it and they call it an
engineering marvel where Apple has used
the aluminum case itself as the frame
for the LCD panel and use the LCD as the
front glass now they manage to pack five
times as many pixels as the last model
in a display that's a fraction of a
millimeter smaller and since there's no
front glass on top of the LCD glare is
much less of an issue I've got one word
for
people buying this app whole care what
about the 13 inch pro microrna KCI
Securities analyst ming-chi kuo Apple
ramp up production in September for the
machine with in early October launched
to follow for a Retina Display 13-inch
macbook pro he predicted the 17 inch
model would go away in april and that
same report mentioned retina displays
for both the 15-inch and 13-inch to be
launched together but the 13 was being
held back by heat issues with the
smaller body now the discovery of an
unidentified computer labeled macbook
pro 10-2 in a battery utility app
potentially supports this too since the
15-inch retina display is designated as
macbook pro 10-1 again we'll wait to see
how this all plays out all right let's
take a break to show you our app of the
week
if you guys didn't already I'm a huge
basketball fan and to celebrate the NBA
Finals the app of the week is arcade
hoops basketball from skyworks beat the
buzzer and sink as many hoops as you can
it's free and it's easy but if you want
to be a baller and pay 99 cents you'll
get multiple modes for two point and
three-point challenges plus different
skins like space or zombie but who cares
about that when in real life you should
let your game through the talking oh

some a drink yeah yeah hey guys good job
I'm supposed to get lunch good all right
so maybe I should just stick to playing
the ipad game but you have no idea about
my sick ribble skills all right onto the
quick bites in a few hidden gems are
coming out of iOS 6 we know about the
big ones but you'll now have quicker
access to Bluetooth settings since it's
not buried under the general area you'll
be able to set the do not disturb mode
on and also set a schedule for how long
it's enabled in the notifications I can
set specific notifications for people
who I've assigned on my VIP list through
mail also the iPad gets a native clock
app with an alarm stopwatch and timer
you also don't need a password to update
apps only to purchase them and you want
to throw into the home screen every time
a new ones installed there's color bar
changes to match the app that you're
using in iOS 6 and that's actually the
number one feature I've been waiting for
now mountain lions developer preview for
has also received an automatic update
for people using it it's done through
the app store Annapolis saying it's
recommended for all users as we near
closer to the finalized version that
will be out in July and in a story that
will hit home for a lot of you according
to a survey conducted by the gadget
trade and service gazelle nearly fifteen
percent of the respondents said they'd
rather give up sex then go for one
weekend without their iphone that's two
days now the survey also found nearly
eighty five percent of respondents
report having used their phone in the
bathroom and the best fun fact by far
nearly four percent of respondents said
they use their phone while having sex
and I have no idea what they're talking
about all right um let's just announcer
