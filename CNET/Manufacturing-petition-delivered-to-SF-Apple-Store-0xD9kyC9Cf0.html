workers in China primarily who suffering
on a regular basis from suffering of the
hands suffering of legs swelling limbs
on a regular basis right the second is
this is not organized as a distributed
organizing campaign by an organization
right it's by individuals and four
continents around the country damaged
during the capacity of people to come
together on issues they care about on a
regular basis right the third what's
interesting is this is not just about
Apple right it represents a new movement
of people and consumer advocacy or
issues overall organizations and brands
you love you can immediately rapidly
respond coordinate with others and start
a movement online and off and the

lives which could directly but tens of
millions and hundreds of millions around
the world we delivered 250,000 petition
signatures from petitions on change.org
and some of us org to Apple here in San
Francisco we met with a representative
who took these two big boxes of
signatures from us and said that he
would be contacting Apple apple's
management right away and speaking with
them he also said that he would try to
get the message up to corporate and that
he would be contacting us later this
week to let us know when we can expect
to hear response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
