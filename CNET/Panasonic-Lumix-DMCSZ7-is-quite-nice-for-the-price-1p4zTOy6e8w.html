with seen it and if you're in the market
for a fast camera with some extra zoom
that can still slip in a small pocket
you'll want to check this out
it's Panasonic's lumix DMC sz7 and in a
body that's less than an inch thick it
has an ultra wide-angle lens with a 10x
optical zoom a high-res 3-inch LCD on
back and a speedy 14 megapixel sensor
now that sensor supports Full HD movie
capture at 60 I in AVC HD but it'll also
shoot mp4 format too as well as some
multi shot modes for high dynamic range
in handheld night shots
it also has Panasonic's Lightspeed AF
system which combined with its sensor
and processor let you shoot fast with
low shutter lag and shot-to-shot times
and it can burst shoot with autofocus
something you won't find on most other
cameras in its class photo quality is
very good too but I wouldn't expect to
do much enlarging or heavy cropping also
its battery life is pretty short and
it's charged by USB in camera so if you
get a second battery you'll have to plan
ahead but otherwise for its price it's
really quite nice I'm Josh Goldman and
that's the Panasonic s c7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
