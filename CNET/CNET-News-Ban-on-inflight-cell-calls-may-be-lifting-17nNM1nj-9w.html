everywhere except here on board planes
where cell usage is banned that could
soon change the Federal Communications
Commission is considering allowing
passengers to use their cell phones in
flight to make calls or use mobile data
the proposal would allow calls above
10,000 feet but still ban the use of
cell phones during takeoff and landing
the move comes on the heels of an faa
decision to allow passengers to keep
their electronic devices powered on gate
to gate i think what they will probably
do is look to see what your connectivity
will be and if you're doing it over
Wi-Fi there is no reason for anyone to
say that causes problems with the planes
the commission has gone down this road
before it considered relaxing the ban in
2004 but didn't take action after flight
attendants and others have lobbied
against it in a statement from the FCC
Chairman Tom wheeler acknowledged times
have changed saying quote modern
technologies can deliver mobile services
in the air safely and reliably and the
time is right to review our outdated and
restrictive rules the airlines will
still have to decide how much cellular
usage they will allow on their planes
and then there's the question of whether
people want to sit in a cabin full of
people making phone calls but i'm sure
that airlines will institute parts of
the plane that will be the no phone zone
and they'll be highly sought after the
FCC will introduce the item at its
December meeting and will allow public
comment on the proposal in San Francisco
