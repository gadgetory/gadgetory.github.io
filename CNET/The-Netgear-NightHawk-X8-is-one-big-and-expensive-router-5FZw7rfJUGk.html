Nighthawk x8 router from Netgear now
this thing is huge
in fact it's so big that if I take the
second one out of the box and yeah not
usual I do have two right here people
would think that I'm a big show-off
especially considering each of this one
here cost $400 anyhow the exit here is
expansive and it's big because is the
first AC 5300 router on the market and
that mean it have to fire code band each
of that cap at 2166 megabit per second
Wi-Fi speed and one 2.40 good band that
caps at 1,000 megabit per second now in
real world usage there is no way and I
mean no way you can get that kind of
speed not even close
because given the fastest client and
market like being a laptop or a tablet
they have must lower Wi-Fi kept but
welcome to speed having all those big
numbers is all way better than having
smaller ones and this router here is
future proof
now the x8 have for these external
antennas here and they are active on
tennis now to stress on the active
notion that get put an LED on each of
them as you can see you actually can
turn this light off if you want to now
on the back here the XS unlike other
router doesn't have four but actually
six LAN port all these ports are Gigabit
Ethernet meaning they can deliver up to
1000 megabit per second but this extra 2
ponyo can also work together to double
the bandwidth to two gigabit per second
and that means if you have a server that
also have a two network port this is a
great router to have now in my testing
with my out server that support portal
aggregation these two port here actually
improve is performance a great deal and
for more check out my full review se
Netcom basically this is a router for
the rich which is quite a come with this
groovy wavy thing here so you can say I
spent that much money on a sexy piece of
art
that's good for me though because I'm
more used to having those 16 things
sitting around talking about spending
money on me I like it very much and
that's because I'm dumb or this has been
done first look at the Nighthawk x8
router from Netgear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
