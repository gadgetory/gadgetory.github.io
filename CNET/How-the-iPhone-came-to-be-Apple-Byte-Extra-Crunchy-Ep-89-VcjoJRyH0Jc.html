is our complimentary show our additional
kind of piece to the puzzle of all of
our Apple byte coverage which is a
weekly podcast so what we do is we like
to dive deep into the hottest stories of
the week we give you some more stuff
that has developed over that time and
again this show is all about you all
that are watching so what you can do is

the show leave us your name where you're
from and just get to it with your
comments your questions or your bad
apples 1 800 662
thanks guys thanks guys straight from
mr. Beecham all right so let's jump it
in the show and we know that this month
is the iPhones 10th anniversary month at
least from when it went on sale and so
there's a lot of cool things that are
starting to happen around it this
article was originally posted in the
Wall Street Journal but because we don't
have a subscription to it I know we're
not going to be able to show it but we
wanted to talk about what the Wall
Street Journal did and I thought was
really fun and interesting they wanted
to chart the approximate total lifetime
sales of of a range of like the best
selling products of all time and this
kind of gives you an idea and
perspective of where the iPhone ranks so
they have this graph here and they show
they list off things like like we're
time out iconic devices right the Sony
Walkman the Barbie dolls the Zippo
lighter you had a Barbie doll hell yeah
I know you do I know how you roll ain't
no shame in his game so the Sony Walkman
topped out this is total sales lifetime
of sales topped out at a little over 200
million units it took 30 years to do
that all right too
hundred million the Zippo lighter let's
talk about this more than half a billion
sales but that and it climbed over but
that took what a period of more than 80
years you have other things like the
Rubik's Cube which looks like it hit
about what is it 400 million around the
35w 78 is year mark but look at the
iPhone okay in that chart if you're
listening it's fine it's up at the top
basically in ten years the iPhone is at
1.2 billion units sold in under 10 years
that's amazing is that ridiculous it is
ridiculous so that makes it the top
selling product of all time right that
is that is crazy it's amazing so that's
what we're talking about here this is
what we've got um just a beast of a
product and then if you won't even just
talk about how the iPhone itself
transformed Apple as a company did a
comparison and showed how Apple grew
from 2007 to you know versus when they
actually launched the actual phone so
let's say in 2016 Apple's employs 18,000
in 2016
116,000 like building space 6.8 million
square feet versus twenty nine point
three million square feet in 2016 sales
19 point 3 2 billion in 2006 two hundred
and fifteen point six four billion
dollars in sales of to that in 2016 I
mean that's just obviously explosive
growth and what is the math on that 20
billion to 215 billion that's like about
what a ten hundred percent or so yeah
yeah close to close to something like
that probably on a nine hundred percent
gain that's that's that's a little
insane but it obviously just shows you
how incredibly successful the iPhone was
right we it makes up around 66 percent
of their sales today somewhere around 60
to 70 percent so that that's gonna
that's gonna be a big deal so in
addition to that we also have some cool
stuff surrounding the 10th anniversary
iPhone now if you don't remember who's
Scott Forstall was he was the man kind
of in charge and lead iOS development he
was also the kind of the fall guy when
Apple had their whole debacle with
Maps how they are you know not only were
they at the time more inaccurate they
had like weird three renderings of
different landmarks that was just all
out of whack and so what was really cool
is the Computer History Museum in
Mountain View they did a one-on-one
interview with Scott Forstall
to talk about his time at Apple but
really to talk about the iPhone and so I
don't know if we have it queued up right
now I got it we got a baby alright so
Scott Forstall here is sitting down at
the Computer History Museum and we got
to give them props for letting us use
this video to talk about kind of some of
the origins of the actual iPhone so
check it out some out a three-minute
clip or so oops sorry I started more
time real quick here we go how did you
either find your way to the iPhone or
how did the iPhone find its way to you
ah the iPhone had a very circuitous
route by itself I mean I at that point
was running like Mac os10 tyrany to the
releases at that point and and we've
been working on a tablet project which
has a really odd beginning uh it again
because Steve hated this guy at
Microsoft that that is the actual origin
was it wasn't Bill cuz he was starting
to like go by this point uh it was a
Laureen had a friend his so Steve's wife
had a friend who's married to a guy who
worked at Microsoft every time
Steve had any social interaction that
guy who'd come back just pissed off
yeah I mean it wasn't it was not in like
Microsoft's like you know it's not good
for them that he ever saw him uh he came
back one time after seeing this guy and
that guy was talking about how Microsoft
had soul computing he solved like net uh
like a laptop computer or they were
going to do laptop or tablet computing
and they're gonna do with pens and he
just like shoved in Steve's face the way
they were going to like rule the world
with their new tablets with their pens
and Steve came in on Monday and and
there was a set of expletives uh and and
that it was like let's show them how
it's really done
it's like the first thing is they're
idiots you don't use a stylus you know
it's cumbersome you lose it you're
always like picking up and putting it
down you were born with ten styluses
style eyes so like lets me use the ones
that you don't de sel uh and and so he's
like and it's this uh time touchscreens
were resistive touch resistive requires
you to sort of deform the screen you
have to push it down so if you look at
it like text in everything looks bad
it's it's really tiring on your finger i
said we need to do capacitive touch and
asking multi-touch so we went to the
hardware team and basically said like go
do this and they started and the design
team started building designs around
this idea of multi-touch and it was
pretty interesting i remember one of the
first demos of this you walked into a
room there's a giant giant table there's
a projector on the ceiling and you can
like you see the photo or something on
on the table and you can move your
finger around the table and it would
move the photo a super cool wouldn't fit
in you know your your bathroom much less
your pocket or your your you know
baguette i guess we don't have it ah but
the moment you saw that you knew this
was the way to go like that was that was
cool awesome very cool so really right
they were thinking about the ipad before
the iphone yeah and he later on goes on
to talk about
how Hindman Steve Jobs were sitting down
at lunch and they were looking around
they realized dude everyone's using a
phone and then they also started talking
about how they didn't like how they
didn't find any pleasure or joy and
actually using a phone and so that is
the roots of how then Steve Jobs said
okay well let's take all this that we've
done double up our efforts to get this
multi-touch capacitive touch tablet
thing ready and then shrink it down into
the size of something that fits in our
pocket yeah that's that that so it's
really cool how it really it had I mean
I've known this but this is fun to hear
four stalls
accounts of it yeah I thought it was
really fascinating how he just blatantly
you know comes out blainley it was like
we started building the iPad because
Steve Jobs just hated this dude was
annoying him to death
so it's a such a SJ thing quietly it's
like you know he's angry and like we got
to show him how it's done you know but
um they were also worried right after
that where it ends right there he says
this is really cool they also were were
a lot of people know this already but
they were worried about some products
coming out cutting into the iPod sales
you know sales numbers whatever so you
know that was also a big reason to go
with the phone because they just turned
the phone into an iPod eventually which
is happen today well you know we don't
see them the iPod the iPod Classic and
iPod Touch still exist but yeah you know
they've never said that they've killed
off the iPod Touch although everyone's
like um yeah an iPod Touch kind of dead
it's kind of on the baggy it's pretty
much yeah you know it's it's not I would
be really shocked if we ever see an
update to that I would be really shocked
yeah we would surprise us yeah totally
but it's just funny how they're worried
about something is another you know
another company cutting into iPod sales
that are like we'll just kill the iPod
with our own product yeah
yep the iPhone it's good business and
it's pretty interesting but that whole
interview is great like there's other
stuff he talks about like when he's
scuba diving with sharks and he got like
a cool shot of his brother like getting
attacked by a shark and the shark
attacked him and just lots of cool stuff
like I watched the whole thing and it
was it's really fascinating go check it
out Computer History Museum
yeah they have a YouTube channel and
they also have a Facebook page where
they post the clips I'm just a lot of
stuff behind the scenes of what happened
in Apple so you know that's kind of
talking about just what is going on
around the 10th anniversary you're gonna
see a lot more things kind of pop up
just because everyone is talking about
in look there's a lot of anticipation
around the iPhone 8 aka 10th anniversary
iPhone just a quick thing about the
current iPhone or what Virgin Mobile is
doing some of you may or may not have
heard about this but virgin is offering
this kind of crazy plan specifically for
the iPhone they're calling it their
inner circle plan and basically what it
comes down to I know just listen this at
first they're offering a year of
unlimited data and calls with the
purchase of a new iPhone for $1 dude I
might do this yeah you might but then
let me break this down for you okay but
there's like a flight no hotel involved
- there's like there's basically to
sweeten the deal right you get the first
year is unlimited talk text and messages
you also get perks like a free companion
ticket for a round-trip flight to the UK
on virgin right there man that's like
the cost of an iPhone right there that's
that's pretty pretty sexy okay of course
there are going to be some there's this
is competition right this is kind of
crazy right of course there's gonna be
some caveats of this the data you'll
have like up to 23 gigs of data and then
it'll throttle down like most most users
doing that also any type of mobile video
the the caveat from what I've read is
that the streams are going to be limited
to 480p resolution for any video mobile
downloads which is kind of cool kind of
do do also this is a promo that last for
one year after that year it will be $50
per month so that'll be the plan that
you pay for your carrier plan and then
beyond that if you do get another phone
after two years of service you'll then
be able to lock in again for a six month
plan for one dollar if you buy an
upgrade to a new phone in two years but
the biggest catch about this Beecham
it's on Virgin Mobile version which is
not as good as like basically Sprint so
who knows if you're like right near a
tower and you live in an area that
is very sprint heavy I think this is a
great deal I got a look on the
Brightside 223 gig you said was their
cap yes ATT is 22 gigs so then one gig
more one point one extra gig one gig
more one gig more I'm getting $50 a
month that's about the same as an AT&amp;amp;T
carrier plan - gently - yeah mines mines
expensive I'm paying like after fees
like 80 bucks a month that's that's what
I'm paying - and that's with our with
our special special discounts corporate
discount so $50 is nice again you're
gonna have to explore this okay let's uh
we're going to blast through some of
these because they are rumors but
there's things worth mentioning in the
iPhone 8 world according to a report
from Reuters they say the iPhone 8 is
creating worldwide shortages of DRAM and
NAND chips but this is affect because of
the demand that our suppliers that have
locked in deals and Apple's buying up
all these components for their iPhone 8
launch people that have been affected
according to the report companies like
LG who have pushed up their quarterly
purchase decisions by about a month to
get ahead of this to try and get their
hands on these components for their
phones and in addition I thought this
was interesting they said the lack of
components and the component shortage in
general is directly linked to limiting
production of the Nintendo switch Oh No
if this is true no fans sorry sorry bra
like you want that switch or you want
that iPhone eight I know which one I'm
leaning towards oh yeah definitely
iPhone 8 I mean the switch is dope and
it's getting more games but come on
that's so that that's one of the reasons
for the delay they also talked about how
Sony is prioritizing orders from Apple
for their camera sensors we know that
Apple's camera guess one of the best but
I'm the pixel and the Samsung Galaxy
phones have I think they've kind of
nudged up us a little bit but if we're
talking about their portrait mode the
apples portrait mode is money so um
that's an office also their optical zoom
that's nice and other phones are going
to be doing more things like that but um
that is one of the stories that is
around the iPhone eight also there are
more leaks from the ultimately car not
in Asian leader
hey y'all is it an Asian leader it's
probably an Asian leaker linked to
Benjamin Gaskin but he posted more shots
of components and parts of the new
iPhone 8 front panel hmm I you know when
I look at this I'm this was this is
really what the phone's gonna look like
but I just from a design standpoint I
don't understand why they don't just
make that entire top bar black like on
the actual front panel they've shown
shots of like the l3 yeah right it has
like they've shown shots where it's
believed and again this is all off a
rumor that that notch on the top which
the sensors when you have your just your
wallpaper on it'll form around it but I
think it doesn't look as clean just make
it a thin black line across it you're
right it doesn't look it doesn't look
very clean like there it does kind of
give this effect though that it's like
filling in this you know it does look it
looks janky to me it's just kind of like
funny so whatever works being critical
because parts are out there that we can
see and Apple hasn't even made this
official announcement and then another
quick thing is that on Mac rumors
websites they said based on their web
analytics they have detected devices
that are most likely iPhone eights that
have just been pinging their site once
in a while not too many but that they
are under testing you know from
Cupertino locations in Sunnyvale and San
Francisco so they're there web analytics
show that they've been pinged by an
unknown device running iOS 11 nice kind
of cool so it's cool how forensic guys
can find that stuff yeah oh we leave
that up to them and then they publish
and then we find out about it so you
know we're talk about like Asian leakers
yeah and just leaks lovely okay you love
we we we would imagine we you know the
funny thing is colors haven't retaliated
yet it's just interesting yeah it's
gorgeous it's bright we're keeping it
light um leaked record so Apple recently
held held this kind of like a summit or
like a briefing with employees that was
all about you know how to not get
information out to the public they're
trying we've always heard Tim Cook
saying we're doubling down on secrecy so
the briefing that was held at Apple's
headquarters
was called stopping leakers keeping
confidential at Apple but how do we know
this the story was leaked as the story
was leaked by website the outline it was
an audio recording of the entire
briefing that details what Apple told
its employees about keeping secrets then
there had to be an Apple employee who
was in the meeting huh and they probably
got paid for it right to give up this
information but it talked about you know
the different ways that Apple is working
with intelligence agencies like the NSA
law enforcement like the FBI the Apple
with to paraphrase some of the stuff
that happened in here they did it is
said that Apple and some of their head
security execs spoke to roughly a
hundred attendees and this seminar slash
briefing was expected to be given to
other employees throughout the company
it started with videos with shots of Tim
Cook talking to Apple employees but what
is interesting some of the other details
that came out of that out of it is they
said in 2016 more leaks came from
Apple's campuses so we're talking about
maybe story or information leaks versus
parts leaks from factories like Foxconn
one more leaked and that makes if you
think about it actually does make sense
we Stussy like part leaks but how many
times do we get stories about Apple
stuff going on like every week yeah all
the time constantly everybody so Foxconn
and and the manufacturers have got the
leaks taken care of
or how about gonna block more better
better mo better mo better mo better
lockdown yeah mo better lockdown but
then in Apple's headquarters it's just a
leaky they still haven't put all the
walls on the base they'll have a lot of
Asian leakers at Apple's headquarters
for the record I've never used the term
Asian leak or definitely bTW cuz he has
because I have the right to you could
say white leakers Wensley kerza
I think like term leaker Anglo Saxon
leakers so um so that would that
happened and that basically was like the
summary was like keep secrets guys like
just don't tell them our secrets another
nugget about when you talked about
referencing Foxconn in the seminar the
BRE
it was quoted or it was said that Apple
actually the process of screening these
people that are coming in and out of
Foxconn is even more stringent than what
the TSA does oh yeah and you could
imagine that actually totally right yeah
so trade secrets are a big deal I mean
we start out with with uber like stole
trade secrets from young ghouls Wyatt
yeah the way my driving car stuff like
that's a big like that's huge a new
corporate espionage that's no joke let
ain't no joke and ain't no joke we know
Joe so anyways the keeping secrets um
keeping Apple confidential or whatever
the name of that seminar was skit that
sighs love how was leaked it was the
seminar was leaked
I smell a new skin for Apple by Apple
confidential not a movie called
something company la la College sure did
Ted you gotta have my CI do a parody now
Apple confidential confidential
who's the leaker it wasn't me it was
either not be any tapes you like tweet
there better not be any tapes my
conversation Tim Cook tweets that out
it's it's it's a done deal
all right let's talk about IMAX there's
a lot of buzz around the IMAX I you know
they they recently have started rolling
out I know they're available after um
the keynote much like the iPad pros came
out like a week later after the keynote
crap sorry okay I'm just listening cool
me all right I see autoplay is what
messes us up it's not it's in the world
people that are complaining about like
what's going on with the show it
autoplay is a pain in the butt I don't
plays the form of leaking stuff or I
want us you know
bad example haha you know actually not
an accurate example but try it
we're on the cuff guys come on so uh the
iMac Pro this is really cool
we know that big bad boy that's starting
at like $5,000 according to specs that
were released by Pike's Universal a blog
that also actually leaked out the
earlier specs of the new iMac 27-inch
based on what they believe the iMac Pro
right up to an 18 core Intel Xeon
processor we know that top of the line
Radeon Pro Vega graphics and up to 4
terabytes of store SSD storage up to 120
gigs of
serum they said that this actual
processor is most likely not going to be
powered by you know the latest skylake
processors that we expect to come but
instead intel's next-generation server
grade skylake e^x and skylight EP
processors so there we're not talking
about just the normal standard processor
you're getting in your machine server
grade processors from Intel in the new
iMac Pro which is pretty exciting and
maybe at least in some people's minds
helps justify putting down $5,000 for an
iMac Pro yeah I mean I'm actually
reading me I was just like blown away
I'm just curious about how well this
will actually sell like I actually don't
think I think it's a I think it's a
powerhouse machine we talked about how
you know just looking at the entire
picture of how they're now developing a
modular kind of tower based or you know
swappable card Mac Pro and I know that
this was really their vision of what the
Mac Pro was going to be I'm just curious
how many people will actually buy it
because there is value there but again
it's most Pro users want to have the
custom customization you know when
they're using high-end apps
yeah for sure you want to be able to put
stuff in different cards and people are
like oh whatever it's just RAM and hard
drives I'm like no we're talking about
like sound capture cards we're talking
out video cards yeah we're talking about
rendering cards like there's so many you
know raid or raise that you want to put
in your computer there's so many
different upgrades beyond just RAM and
hard drive space yeah totally but I do
see what Apple is trying to do too
because everything is going in the cloud
like Adobe Premiere cloud service and
all that stuff you know it makes sense
but you're right I mean right now people
want to be able to upgrade and put new
put cards in and all that stuff so I've
just see how it pans out $5,000 though
that's that's happy well you better be a
pro user she's gonna buy that I mean you
better not be using that for word
processing yes all I'm gonna say in
addition to Pike's Universal and they
also talked about how the iMac pro is
coming with a security Enclave processor
but why is that important that could
indicate that there could be some type
of touch ID functionality with the iMac
pros Apple didn't talk about it at the
keynote they said that these iMac pros
are coming out in December so you
obviously know lots of things could
change or be added it doesn't mean that
we'll see touch ID on the new my Mac Pro
but in the firmwares in the firmware
that they funneled through they did find
indications that so it could be maybe it
could be sure I'm just saying maybe
could be I'm in other iMac news the new
27-inch iMac that just came out with the
with the latest processors was also just
recently benchmark by Geekbench
I know that people always say all
benchmarks don't matter I like to look
at benchmarks just to get a general idea
of how products match up with others in
general I don't take them I'm not the
type of person that's like oh it has the
fastest benchmarks that means it's the
best machine or best phone that's not
what it comes down to but it gives you
an idea of how well it's improved and
how it compares to others the new
27-inch iMac pro iMac is basically has
graphics performance they've talked
about that and 80% uptick in graphics
performance compared to the previous
iMac Pro Wow because the graphics
performance on the one I have now is
amazing yeah so if it's gonna be 80%
better like I can't even imagine what
that's gonna look like that's and that's
part of it using you know are having the
option for an AMD grat Radeon card that
with discreet graphics that's going to
obviously make a difference but it
wasn't there before so even if you talk
about just kind of like general
performance and whatnot they talked
about how single core performance
increased up to nine percent compared to
the equivalent model from really 2015
multi-core performance increased up to
15% when compared to an equivalent model
so this is just overall yes it should be
a more powerful machine it is and you're
getting a huge jump in graphics
performance which helps across the board
amongst multiple apps not just like oh
how does I move seen my desktop windows
look I don't know it's way more than
that so anyways that's it that's a good
sign uh we're gonna transition a little
bit just I don't know I saw this story
earlier this week and I liked it a lot
we know about Apple's AR kit right they
showed it off at WWDC 2017 and how it
uses just all the current hardware on
your phone IKEA who has who is
doing a partnership that Tim Cook in a
recent Bloomberg article said that Apple
and IKEA have some sort of a partnership
but they didn't really go into detail
with it
IKEA then later announced that they're
doing their own dedicated AR kit app
that will roll out in the future and
what it basically does is you can see
around 500 to 600 of IKEA products and
basically superimpose them or using
augmented reality see what it might look
like at your home that's awesome with a
device you own already at home weren't
they doing this with the IKEA catalog
like a flea they have something similar
to it already
yeah but I think it's what it is just
being able to just pop it on right with
your home phone in your house and being
able that's that's pretty sick this
makes a lot of sense because I recently
read an article that IKEA like they have
these giant buildings right oh yeah
Regan's mat rat maze yeah so they're
looking to downsize like they want to
get rid of all this point floor space
again will have a smaller more boutique
shops oh and they're gonna move
everything into the cloud I mean this
whole thing with Apple is like IKEA
stores are gonna be a are with Apple you
know like yeah feels like that's the
whole move that's going so they could
save money not have to pay
air-conditioning on these giant
buildings it's a great place to go
anytime you know it's a great place to
go when it's hot and I mean come on the
Swedish meatballs
you can't go yeah come on yeah let's
let's talk let's talk about that
also yeah you're right the here in the
story it talks about how and I've never
done this but an earlier version
basically allowed users to scan pages of
an IKEA catalog to view a our furniture
not necessarily basically establish what
the room looks like in place in the spot
and rotate around they said Apple's
platform will greatly increase the
consistency and quality of the
experience so around 500 and 600
products will be available at launch
they did not give us an exact time of
when the app will come out but um it
might be coming out maybe later this
fall around the time of the phone that's
someone who just removed into an
apartment a few months ago that's
awesome that's important yes important
all right no it's even more important
emoji
we'll stop people are still listening
emoji unicode ten point O of the Unicode
standard is official now we've talked
about like a lot of different emojis and
how they like kind of preview what's
coming out they officially announce that
there will be 56 new emojis available

seeing here but some of them include
like a puke-face like a ferry both male

traditional Asian things like a takeout
box or portion cuts an American thing
yeah very good Steven very guy I know my
Asian culture he knows his Asian
persuasion so um oh the breastfeeding
emoji oh that's super important sorry
guys breastfeeding emoji so anyways
these are these aren't expected to come
are not expected to roll out immediately
with iOS 11 just because the timing of
this but we probably expect them to see
them sometime in like iOS 11 point one
or point two we've seen Apple roll out
the new emoji sets later on and honestly
everyone gets super excited so don't
just we are God can we opt out so I
don't think you can you want I'd like to
opt out I don't know what anymore modes
as there's a lot Rain Man so many nice
and even my favorites page yeah like
dude eggplant eggplant sports squirt
squirt dude I took my kids to see the
new uh on Mars movie oh yeah yeah
and they have an emoji movie and I got I
know I know I saw the billboard you want
to watch the trailer no I have the
trailer maybe after the show I I really
don't want to get mad I got really
pissed I was like are you kidding me
emojis are done emojis are know emojis
are life bro no I just don't want to see
Jaime Lerner is like the main character
of the emoji of the main emoji come on
let's just watch it roll I can't I can't
I can't no okay wait here
you had it pulled up terrible look who
just sent me Zacks daddy McAlister what
should I say just play it cool
welcome all right this is good people
that are listening people all you need
to see the hata people that are
listening have no idea what just
happened
it just wasn't via sony Columbia
Pictures emoji movie with starring TJ
Miller look there any unlike we've seen
this before any movie can be made like
quite honestly bird look transformers my
childhood the movies are not very good
but they make so much money they still
keep making them in unfortunately I'm
gonna be honestly I just don't keep
watch you know and I know they're bad
but I just want to watch him the latest
one got zero stars from Rolling Stone
why not yeah zero stars they say it's
the worst movie of all like possibly
all-time well that you know what's sad
about that though technically it should
be one of the best movies the reason
being is it's the first movie ever to
use IMAX 3d cameras so they basically
created this is just inside baseball but
I know you nerds love this
they created a camera rig specifically
of two IMAX cameras Wow
so yeah stereos yes max that's so all
the particles and all that stuff are
true to the camera so I thought that was
very really honestly the only reason why
I wanted to see it is see does it really
make that much of difference because an
IMAX 3d like Marlon in IMAX 3d oh my
gosh I so excited I can't contain myself
contain it alright I'm back on to a few
other things in the show this is kind of
crazy this is cool Chicago they're
opening a new Apple Store and what do
you think the roof is gonna look like
how about it's gonna look like a MacBook
Pro on the roof is according to DNA info
who's taken some exterior shots of this
store that is still under construction
this is now going to be located in
Pioneer Court at 401 North Michigan
Avenue it literally looks like a laptop
which
slapped on top of the store it has the
Apple logo on it I've got to imagine
that logos gonna glow oh here's here's
the video all day they put up a video
clip as well well do that like it's its
street that looks like a macbook air lay
it kind of looks like a toad or a mac
yeah like a macbook air yeah so anyways
it's on the top of the store it's gonna
be really interesting I'm very curious
to see what this was gonna look like I
haven't been in Chicago in a long time
but I'd like to go back now because
there's a MacBook on top of the store
it'd be cool if they turn that into a
helicopter pad so you know Steve junco
didn't pick flies in and lands on the
top yeah it would be nice that's pretty
cool what they got to make that sticker
light up though they should you know
animation I'm telling you that's got if
it was a focused beam that like shot
directly into the sky like a spotlight
that would be crazy yeah so every plane
and helicopter fly but it's not gonna be
there's apples yeah it's not gonna be it
would be like the Apple signal like
friggin we don't need the bat signal
we got the Apple signal we got the Tim
Cook signal I would not want to go there
and be like hey Tim cooked you know what
you know what I have occasionally can I
go on from this you know it's kind of
disappointing or disheartening for me is
every time I see Tim Cook the way he
talks about Apple products yeah it's
like a Salesman that doesn't really
isn't part of the process of the product
yes like this is the always it's like
this is the most amazing thing yeah he's
getting reading it's like you're he's
reading a cue card the way he says it
you have never seen anything like this
like you pretty much practices well I'm
serious I'm sure it just does not come
off as authentic I'm like come on bro
like and I don't have anything against
him personally I really don't but it
just does not sound believable and when
I watched the WWDC keynote and you watch
it over again pay attention to his parts
his part seemed like the most scripted
most you know he's phoning it in he's I
phoning in it now I don't want to say
it's inauthentic but the delivery did I
don't feel the heart how about this
there's no heart in it there's no soul
yeah there's a lot of people say that a
lot of people in the comments say that
like you know it just doesn't have the
same vibe there's no soul in it it's
just that's the best way to put it you
know it's like these other people that
are building the products that I and
can't do are putting their heart in it
right you gotta get someone that is
closer to it that can talk about that
can make us be like yeah you're right
like this will Steve Steve like sit down
unlike a couch with the phone to be like
Chucky's got check this out guys you
look really ill in it he's he like be
doing any be like oh watch this watch
this he's feeling it like have you go on
stage and talk about the iPad pro you
don't have to pay me I'll be like this
is for sure up to this point the best
Apple product of 2017 without a doubt
the iPad pro is the best Apple product
in 2017 I need a cheering track like a
clout a crowd track for you let me do
that we can reenact there I'm just
saying like and everyone who talks about
the iPad pro like people are like
skeptical about it it's the new iPad pro
the screen is bonkers and until you see
it and use it you just won't understand
you're gonna hate on it but I think if
you try it out you're gonna then go okay
they were right they were they're right
and every review you know I was very up
I was a head of like all about the new
iPad pro now everyone that has them you
read all here all the reviews they're
all like yeah you may not need it but if
you're an iPad fan this is it this is
the one see screaming thank you thank
you thank you thank you that work I
almost went into a Tim Cook ran but we
want to keep going no no no cheers this
guy it's okay we got it
um this is the coolest story of the week
quite honestly for me if you're a fan of
video games if you're a fan of Sega
Genesis were you what are you a Sega
Genesis owner a totally oh my goodness
oh goodness right altered beast I
remember all the Z's in the arcade
before it came to the home and I was
like so pumped okay so check this out um
Sega has this new kind of like I guess
you call it an initiative but they're
calling it Sega forever and what they're
doing on iOS and Android is they're
releasing standalone versions of their
games super cool and they're starting
off with the original for free they will
be ad supported but if you want to you
can pay to $1.99 to get rid of the ads
but they're launching with five games
off the top one of them is obviously
Sonic the Hedgehog fantasy fantasy star
- altered beast I don't know if you guys
remember this game called
comic zone it was like you're this guy
that basically has an adventure through
comic book panels oh that's cool and
then there's another fifth game that I
actually not as he never played called
kid chameleon but oh that was awesome
that was one of my favorite kid
chameleon on chameleon I never played
that yeah yeah I played that so they're
offering these on iowa's they're
available now I got them on my iPad the
other cool things about them is they
work with iOS compatible controllers
which I'm going to go and get one now so
I can play it while I'm on the when I'm
flying on flights and sticker packs come
with them when you download the apps and
they're free to download free every two
we just have to buy the controller no no
you could you can actually use the games
on on a phone or an iPad but if you want
to just have a sit back experience you
can use the controller as well
yeah I saw Bridget Carey tweeting about
like now I gotta buy a Sega Bluetooth
controller and I was like that sounds
awesome I need one of those yeah so um
that that's really cool I think that you
guys should check it out but even just
having classic sonic on your on your
device like remember years ago I talked
about Nintendo this is exactly what you
need to do so
they've never done B no they've never
done it they've never done it they
barely got Mario on there barely and
some like Super Mario jump
everyone knows let's be real it's not
it's it's lame it still is kind of fun
it's fun ish yeah but you have to okay
like what is it 10 or 15 bucks to unlock
it and ten bucks yeah that's not it's
not the come on bro it's cool I could
get five Sega games for 10 bucks booyah
like come on what was it like one of the
first Sega games that came out that do
like flying I figured what it was called
like Harry or something Space Harrier
Space Harrier millions
what about Top Gun was a second game
Hopgood at the jet game at the arcade
where I was like shaking around and
stuff so cool that was amazing
alright we're dating Sam stay with me
stay with me Sam
alright she gets the phone calls it's
two phone calls like it would be these
guys kicked ass yeah this week you guys
were in we're feeling it so okay here we
go number one Beach in town love the
show name is Jesse Houston Texas I want
to throw out a bad apple find my Siri
remote for the Apple TV if you have kids
that remote
it's lost it's too small too tiny why
can't it be intertwined to define my
iPhone app and then while they're at it
slap on a fingerprint sensor then we can
separate the different IDs so that way
kids get to the kids stuff and stuff of
the show keep it up guys they dig it
good point
I'm all about it that's great maybe
we'll see that in the next app you know
well the next Apple TV we'll see I'll
send this show to an apple exec and
hopefully all days there they have two
floors in this building that we can't
access I'll drop off a copy somewhere on
their floor okay slip it under through
the air vent through the air bag yeah
here we go next call hey this is rody
from Tampa I saw that when Apple
released a ten and a half inch iPad on
the Apple Store app on the iPhone if you
look and under iPad pro the only two
models that show up are now just the
Tanana Hass and the twelve point nine
inch versions I was wondering if that
means that we're never going to have a
nine point seven inch iPad pro anymore
and that's why they released the new
just iPad curious what your thoughts are
on it
love the show thanks this man has
foresight a hundred percent think that's
what they're doing but they're not
outright saying it and quite honestly
like the ten point five inch iPad pro is
just marginally larger than the nine
point seven iPad in addition to that it
weighs basically the same so I think
that if it comes down to a price thing
yeah you might find people are just
going to get the regular iPad or you
know the nine points of an iPad pro as
it'll I don't know if they drop the
price on it yet or not or they will
eventually to a certain degree but the
ten point five is going to replace it
and then the nine point seven
entry-level will be kind of like a more
affordable iPad that's what I'm that's
what my gut tells me but I think you're
right on it what you saw cool no next
call hey Beach and Chong this is Keegan
calling you from Edmonton Alberta up
here in Canada my big question for you
is what would it take for you to make
something like the iPad pro your main
and only computer what would replace
your MacBook or you know your Dell or
whatever is it an application is it this
case is it a form factor for me I've
been using it
what I really love to see some more Pro
applications like Final Cut Pro
something like that but otherwise that's
pretty much the you know only thing that
would make me see differently anymore so
for you guys what would make you take an
iPad pro over a brand new MacBook thanks
so much guys keep it up all right
I'll be honest with you nothing nothing
like nothing would get me to replace a
MacBook with an iPad pro like if you
said you have one computer to buy today
hmm I just because of how Apple's OS is
and yes iOS 11 is going to get a lot
better but if I want to do podcasts like
I've actually looked into how can I just
do a dedicated through the iPad pro it
actually works well with one mic but
with two mics very dicey it's a lot
different it's not easy right you want
to interview someone right yeah then you
talk about pro apps that's another thing
but even just file management like again
making it your I think if you're someone
who's or there's how about this let me
take this back for me I could not see
myself ever having it to replace it now
am I fortunate and firstworldproblems
lucky to have an iPad pro that I can
take with me when I travel instead of a
laptop yes
so does it temporarily replace it
sometimes yeah for sure but I don't if I
had to pick one and you said you have
one device that you can choose to use
right now it would be a MacBook Pro and
also just from the long term of the
flexibility of the things I can do with
it it would have to be a laptop yeah for
me it would be like I need a good
keyboard like a solid key that I can
like pound on and like just really go to
work
I also need apps like Pro Tools I need
premier and stuff like that on that too
you know he said comparing it to a I to
a MacBook Pro the MacBook Pros removed
the disk drive which was a big problem
right so I I would like to have a disk
drive I know they're never gonna put
that on them you mean like a spinning
disk drive you don't like yeah outstate
I'm fine with that no I'm sorry I'm
talking about an optical drive Oh like
like oh yeah I'm sorry like that they
removed that from the MacBooks I know
but I have a your music I have a PC I
have a PC that has
that I rip DVD's all the time I Ripley
ladies and stuff legally legally uh you
know so that kind of stuff you know no I
legally legally by the way I legally oh
there's something in my eyebrow yeah
again I love the iPad pro but it's hard
for me to see it replacing a really
truly replacing any kind of laptop in if
you really wanted to say if you sis
here's the thing if you the question was
would you choose a Microsoft Surface pro
over a laptop that would be the few one
of the devices I would I would yeah
that's the one that you would and
because I know I could take it and use
it you know exactly and the debate of
the thing is its although they look
similar and are trying to kind of do
similar things quite honestly if you
want to separate what the Microsoft
Surface pro compared to the Apple iPad
pro the Apple iPad pro is the best
standalone tablet the Microsoft Surface
pro is the best standalone hybrid tablet
that's kind of how I see them so if you
want a tablet experience dedicated
tablet experience and that's all the
iPad pro is the thing but if you want to
use it like a computer you want a hybrid
OS you want the flexibility of a laptop
you've got to get a surface pro yes if
you were if you really want to make that
distinction
I actually don't say one is super
superior when iOS 11 comes out on this
thing I think people are gonna be like
holy crap I've never used a tablet like
this before that's what I think is going
to be interesting about it but again
it's not trying to be a PC I've gotten
over that I'm not gonna complain and
bitch and whine about that like it
doesn't have a hybrid OS it's never
going to or not in the next few years at
least you know so Apple doesn't want it
to be I'm not going to like keep on
wishing - hoping for something that they
have not indicated to us in any way
shape or form that it would happen so
but as a dedicated just standalone
tablet it's it's awesome just not as
nice not as versatile we got two more
calls let's check them out hey guys it's
John from just oedema Zuri's ago I
wanted to call in regarding Apple Maps I
recently took a trip from Missouri to
Orlando Florida driving and I used Apple
maps the entire time
of going there to Orlando Florida and
back and I wanted to comment about how
everybody says how Google masterhood
with Google Maps good wrong about that
but I think apples starting to not get
credit where credit is due because I was
driving down there and when there was
accident it notified me that there was
an accident hit when traffic was
starting to slow down
it gave me yellow bars to let me know
that traffic was slowing down and then
if traffic was at a complete standstill
it was red and told me that it was at a
complete standstill there was some
construction along the way and Apple
maps diverting me to a faster
alternative route so I think that for
the most part that Apple Maps has been
very good I know that and I could
testify for that firsthand because of
what it did for me on my trip down to
Florida loved the show guys keep up the
good work that's all the endorsement you
need for Apple Maps anyone who's
listening to that that man just he got
to Florida man no problems it's all good
I was the endorsement right there but I
love it that was you know what thanks so
much for the call that was great and
you're so into it it's like no Apple
Maps does this bro
yeah so it was just funny the first time
we listened to it we were just we were
laughing because Google Maps is all that
stuff too you know and that's all
everything is done he wants to give
Apple Maps credit that's yes I'm giving
them credit that's where you from I did
use Apple Maps recently and the way
that's formatted like some things you
want to see are below the screen so you
kind of have to scroll up to see them
is it because more they do that
three-dimensional perspective instead of
just a flat on the top yeah yeah I mean
I know you can change it but by default
it's more that 3d skewed like angle look
yeah I wasn't into it I'm like I can't
see some of the things I'm used to
seeing when I'm using Apple or Google
Maps you know like there's just things
that I couldn't see it's part of it is
just figure what it was part of it it's
just also though like just being
comfortable with a certain product for
so long yeah that when you use another
one it's kind of like what but it's just
funny as he's going through his list his
laundry list of things I know I know it
I hear let's be honest I appreciate that
because guess what we don't know
everything and when we don't use Apple
maps we want someone who uses it to call
in and do exactly that yes like pages
users I heard a lot from y'all and maybe
I'll start using pages on this because
I'm going to subscribe to office 365
no and so the day that I use pages
consistently on an iPad pro I'll let you
know
whose office 365 is cost a lot oh yeah
it's a second round is it 150 bucks per
year something yeah like come on just
just sell me the software once and I
don't want to worry about this
subscription these noble prophecies why
you think I'm using people using Google
Docs and everything now every startup
now is like we have a great subscription
startup idea yeah that's like everyone
has a damn subscription now man we don't
need any more I'm gonna create my own a
Apple bite subscription box with the
random merchandise that is should be on
sale for 50% that is exclusive bundled
together now you know you know this is
great
those are crazy that's a steak enough
all right is there one more call you
said there's one more yes shorty shorty
showers short and sweet here we go
reach-in Tong Tom on Ocracoke Island
North Carolina regarding the home pod I
won't buy one initially but I may in the
future I think that one thing is that
everybody is missing and not discussing
is they put a freakin a processor in
that thing it's gonna do more we just
got to find out what it is discuss by
discuss good selves no I think you make
yet look you make an amazing point Apple
did allude to that in the keynote and
unfortunately they didn't really talk
about how smart Suri was because they
really want to position it as a top of
the line music speaker first so if they
can bring some more noise to that
meeting noise me like heat or you know
bring the noise you have you guys heard
that term bring the noise not noise
layout bring the noise bring that um um
then I'm still look I'm not one to
poopoo on products that I haven't tried
I do have opinions on when they first
come out can those opinions change yeah
so like the air pods i soften my stance
on them i still think they look
ridiculous but they're really really
really good and they can get but the
thing is they they have so much room to
get even better and that's why I was
like and I know they're waiting for Gen
2 but it can be those things gonna be
ridiculous Gen 2 I think I really just
want to stand in a room and have Google
home and uh you know an Alexa and then
the home pod all on the same table just
play the same song oh it's easy each
three of them and see which one sells
the but I know and I'm sure it's gonna
be the home pod is gonna blow them away
you know but I want to know how how much
how much better yeah how much better how
much mobile it is than the other two how
mol bet it is mo better it is yeah
that's I think also Amazon's got to
eventually make an echo that sounds
better
that's literally they're using the same
speaker system at least from our
knowledge and sound wise absolutely that
they did from now is it almost three
years now two and a half three years now
yeah so Wow they've got to make an echo
prime Amazon echo prime because the name
in Prime and everything now yes not Pro
Prime so cool that's it man oh we got
alright remember ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls please give us a call the
phone number is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
