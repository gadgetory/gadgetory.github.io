picture just using your voice okay glass
take a picture
Lisa Oshima is one of the lucky few the
mobile tech consultant was selected in a
lottery to road-test Google's biggest
wearable tech investment Google glass it
took you know a little bit of getting
used to in the sense that I wasn't used
to having something on my face but it
was very much like wearing sunglasses
the $1500 Google glass mimics smartphone
functions you can see texts and emails
make calls take pictures and videos get
directions and search ok glass Google
pictures of Barack Obama and now you'll
see the pictures of Barack Obama and
when you see a little notification come
up you just look up and it's there it's
not in your line of sight directly a
swipe of the finger takes you through
different slides a tilt of the head push
of the button or voice commands also
controls the functions I don't need to
keep going in and out of my handbag for
my phone I think that's the big thing
but it may take a while before this
technology goes mainstream it needs to
be frankly a little bit more useful
right now it doesn't even report for
instance stock quotes unless you're
searching google for that there's no app
for that once there are a lot more apps
it will be a lot more useful and then
there are questions of etiquette safety
and privacy there's no sort of social
pact about when you can record things
and when you can't and how clear you
have to be about when you're taking
pictures and when you're recording and I
know that a lot of sea nuts audience has
real questions about that and real
concerns about what a world full of very
subtle cameras means a blogger snapped a
picture of himself in the shower some
West Virginia lawmakers wants a ban
using glass while driving and a Seattle
bar warned on Facebook that it won't
allow anyone inside with glass and then
there's this issue ok glass take a
picture you can activate someone else's
Google glass with your voice command
mine took mine did too
oh she mo wears them mainly during work
hours but usually unplugs in the
evenings when you're having a
conversation with someone it's important
to continue to have that conversation
and not be distracted by either your
phone or your glass about two weeks
after wearing glass daily
Oh Shiva has her wish list and has given
her feedback to Google I want Twitter I
want Facebook and I want a longer
battery life if I take a lot of video or
if I do a lot of navigation the battery
doesn't last as long as my mobile phone
battery Google glass is expected to be
released to the public early next year
with a significantly lower price in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
