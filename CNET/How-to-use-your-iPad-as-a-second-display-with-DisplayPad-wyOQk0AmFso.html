contributor and today I'd like to talk
to you about display pad it's an iPad
app that lets you extend your Mac
desktop using your iPad as a second
monitor let's take a look all right
let's take a look at display pet in
action so you can get a sense of how it
works from the iPad tap on the display
pad icon after you've installed it cost
$2.99 and then from the menu bar of your
Mac click the small display pet icon and
you should see your iPad listed here
click on that little flash of blue and
we are up and running so I can take an
application through a window here and
slide it from the Mac over to the iPad
just like that it goes from the right
side of your Mac to the left side of
your iPad and the iPad works either in
landscape or portrait mode here I have
an in landscape so it's really easy just
drag things back and forth
let me demonstrate here I got TweetDeck
up and a browser window as you can see
it's a little tight space on the iPad
you can't have too many windows crammed
in there unless you use a lot of widgets
so here I click on a link or tap on a
link from TweetDeck tap and it opens
right in the browser next to it so you
get full touchscreen functionality after
tapping on the link I can then use two
fingers to scroll through the page and
then tap to close it's a little hard to
get on the exact location you're aiming
for with tapping a lot of times if it's
a small small little target so I tend to
you I found I was using the cursor more
than the touchscreen so there's the
tiniest amount of lag when you're
navigating on the iPad screen nothing
that's going to really get in your way
although watching a video I've watched
some Hulu videos on the iPad screen and
the audio and video didn't quite match
up so John Stewart's lips delivered joke
and the audio arrives a split second
later I did find however that sliding
over some major league baseball here
that this came in pretty well the the
crack of the bat matched up with when
the ball arrived so video results vary
but it does provide a great little
second screen to watch some day baseball
during the work day for more tech tips
