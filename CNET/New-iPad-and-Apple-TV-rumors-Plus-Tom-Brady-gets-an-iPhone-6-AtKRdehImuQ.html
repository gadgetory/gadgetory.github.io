the apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to it and we start with the iPad we're
expecting new ones this fall and a new
report from Japanese blog Macotakara
claims that the new iPad Mini 4 will be
a smaller version of the current
hardware inside the ipad air 2 now they
also claim it may release alongside a
new iPad air three with the all-new a 9
chip inside even if that's contrary to
previous reports that said we'd see no
air model this year with the focus being
on the 12 point 9 inch iPad pro now
Apple has faced six straight quarters of
declining ipad sales and a recent IDC
tablet tracker report says even though
apple remains the world's largest tablet
vendor the iPads market share has fallen
below 25 percent and the overall market
continues to decline in new developments
around the Apple TV recently revealed
patent filings by the big a in early
2014 showcase the use of a fingerprint
sensor on a remote control for custom
profiles that could be used with
something like the Apple TV now the
patent describes it as being used on a
dedicated remote control but it could be
used on hardware that supports touch ID
so maybe we'll eventually get multiple
user profiles for an iPad but even
slicker custom profiles for viewing
content on the Apple TV it doesn't mean
we'll be seeing this anytime soon but
with their current tech it's a
no-brainer to make this happen alright
new tech firm Intel is on the horizon
that has implications for future max
thanks to a leak slide from fanless tech
Intel's skylake processors will provide
up to twenty percent performance boost
forty-one percent faster graphics and up
to thirty percent more battery life over
the current broad wheel chipset now
Apple's MacBook Air and 13-inch retina
Pro have broadwell processors but the
rest of their product line is still on
Haswell which might indicate apolis
skipping a chip generation and leap
frogging to Sky lake for even a bigger
jump in performance gains now the new
processors will start shipping in
October giving us plenty of time to
possibly see an upgrade with some apple
macs before the end of this year and in
more new groovy tech this time by Intel
and micron
two companies announced a brand new
class of memory called 3d cross point
that both are calling a major
breakthrough it's 1,000 times faster 10
times denser and more durable than the
current NAND flash storage that's used
in mobile devices in solid-state drives
now this is huge it's still a very
nascent technology and won't be used in
mainstream devices just yet because of
its high cost but it has the potential
to bring major gains for mobile devices
and desktops and hey Apple get on this
ASAP thanks advanced all right music
site hits Daily Double reports their
record label sources claim Apple music
has signed up more than 10 million
subscribers in the first four weeks
Apple is sharing that figure with
insiders and honestly thought it would
be higher because it's free but we'll
see how many stick with it after the
three-month trial now they report a
couple of hip hop tracks are streaming
on par with Spotify and their 75 million
paid subscribers also if your music
lover and your data usage has
skyrocketed thanks Apple music myself
included t-mobile has added Apple music
to its free music streaming service
where you will not be charged for using
the data from Apple music plus anyone
buying an iphone in the next couple of
months on t-mobile will be able to
upgrade to the brand new unannounced
rumored iphone 6s for free so good on
your t-mobile and in more iphone news
take a look at this photo from nowhere
else fr it's believed to be the front
panel of the upcoming iPhone 6s giving
us a first look of something that looks
exactly like the iphone 6 is front panel
and if you were hoping for an iphone 6c
and looks like it isn't happening
anymore Business Insider reports rumors
were swirling that Apple would bring a
4-inch screen iphone similar in design
to the current 6 and offer at a lower
price but sales of the six have done so
well they may not have wanted to
cannibalize sales now the only drawback
I won't be able to make another Alan
bryerson plastics kid weas in here
Apple's supposed to be the leader for
innovation and we in here talking about
plastic and in our final story sometimes
the news headline becomes larger than
life and what it does you know it ends
up on the Apple bite we're talking about
deflategate tom brady the New England
Patriots and his smartphone now I'll
spare you the details because if you
don't know about this already you don't
care but here
the NFL recently accused Brady of
destroying his cell phone on the same
day he was supposed to give it to
investigators about his deflated balls
but Brady said he didn't destroy it at
all instead he replaces samsung phone
with the new iPhone 6 because the
samsung phone was broken and you know
what somewhere Apple really needs to
capitalize on this hey Tom you've won
four Super Bowls three Super Bowl MVP
awards and two League MVPs you know when
your balls are perfect and of all people
you should know if it's not an iphone
it's not an iphone all right that's
going to do for this we show you can
always email us at the apple byte at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong and
i'll respond after my midday nap thanks
so much for watching we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
