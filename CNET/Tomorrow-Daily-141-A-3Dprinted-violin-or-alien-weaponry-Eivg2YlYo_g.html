heart chip that responds to medication
just like a real living human heart why
watch sports like a normal human being
when you could watch it through the eyes
of the player himself or herself and
we're gonna show you a 3d printed violin
that looks mysteriously like a Klingon
weapon do you know to speak Klingon I
will translate that tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scale Jamie's always Kayle
anonymous you didn't let me speak I was
clearing my throat I was a well that is
speaking Klingon is that's the joke
that's the joke if anybody watching this
show actually speaks Klingon I would be
really curious to know how to say
tomorrow daily in Klingon so record an
mp3 and email it to us tomorrow at
cnet.com just that's a real test that's
like real family how intense our
audience is how legit are you you speak
Klingon you still no one worth it
language that I do that is sure I you
know almost two languages I barely can
speak English merely string two words
together we have some really fun stories
today definitely so as always every day
on the show let's talk about the
headlines I thought this was a crazy
example of future tech this is so cool
is straight out of a science fiction
book it also freaked me out a little bit
that's health tech it is so it always
seems a little like weird rays yeah
weird so this is from UC Berkeley it's a
research team at UC Berkeley which
thumbs up guys cuz you you research team
created a very special chip and what
this chip does it's it's about an inch
long and it's got a bit of cardiac
muscle in the middle and it's embedded
inside this like silicone body and the
way it's designed it makes the little
bit of muscle respond to medication like
heart medication the exact same way a
human heart would Oh
trial and error yeah so so here it hard
on a chip so here is heart cells beating
normally and then they're gonna give it
different medications to see how these
heart cells respond otherwise so it's
kind of Awesome for a few reasons number
one being it could route this type of
technology could replace animal testing
yeah that would be fantastic which is
great news and because you know first of
all using animals is a little bit on
that it's like some people argue it's
unethical yeah and and of course like
you know the animals probably don't like
it is it more expensive it is more
expensive I'll get into the price like
there's a oh my
the numbers on this there's some there
are some statistics on this that are
crazy but the other part of it is is
that obviously animals are not us and
they're not human so when you give them
something we might react to it very
differently
meaning more trial and error so this is
something that they're very excited
about and Kevin Healy who is the
professor in charge of the team who
developed the chip was talking about it
and he said that it takes about 5
billion with ABI dollars to develop one
drug usually look on average about five
billion dollars and a well-designed
model of a human organ kind of like this
could basically cut the traditional cost
in time and and raise the efficiency and
you know medicinal development I mean it
would be so much easier if your knew you
were developing specifically for human
tissue and could see exactly how it
reacted yeah so it could really change
the way that we develop medication which
is pretty awesome
yeah that's pretty fantastic so it this
is how they make these like muscles they
don't just like open you up and take out
some heart some parts okay they are do
that or explain it so they take an adult
stem cell and with stem cells you can
sort of train them you can coax them
into being different types of cells and
so they they coax these adult stem cells
into being heart cells like cardiac to
muscle tissue so it's heart muscles
grown in a lab and it's uh they place it
inside the silicone chamber and the
chamber itself is actually designed to
mimic of blood vessels like the way that
so to delivery the drugs is very similar
to the way we get them in our hearts and
so and the tissue remains functional for
like a few weeks and you can test
multiple drugs on it so which is great
you can test multiple things you don't
have to worry about like oh we have to
wait for the scale system like Beauvoir
and then the LAT the next step of this
which I thought was totally insane if
you think about this heart on a chip you
can make an entire sort of computer of
the human body
with these like stem cells they want to
make they want to try to move forward in
building other organs on chips and then
come and then actually connecting all of
them as if it were a human like a little
testing ground yeah all these
differences because sometimes because
sometimes when you take a medication you
have a side effect so maybe or as we all
know there are some medications that are
let's say good
your heart they help a specific
condition but really bad for either your
liver your kidneys yeah other organs
yeah and so they're saying now you can
domino is falling or whatever now you
can see like with that type of
technology built you could see exactly
how your specific individual body would
respond to like specific kinds of
medication so very personalized medicine
like this this is something that could
be really really cool a few years in the
future and I just thought it was amazing
they were able to sort of replicate the
way the human heart works and responds
the medication on a one inch chip so how
long far along are they you said that
they want to do like all different types
of organs so they're only working on the
heart right now they're working on heart
right now and that was the thing that we
saw in the video like you could see
these like little heart like heart cells
they're kind of beating a horrible
little heart cells your cute little
heart cells you look so adorable she
wanna squeeze you um yeah so they're
working on heart cells and then and then
I think like one of the things they
specifically mentioned was you know I
kidney or liver which is you know cuz
your body processes medication through
those organs so it's like and a lot of
other junk so they're saying that like
that would be a logical next step is
sort of like either that or you know
maybe your lungs stuff like that so I I
thought that was so cool yeah I'm scared
again scare sighting that's very scary
sighting but it's so like it's really
impressive
yeah that's fantastic yeah super good so
nice job UC Berkeley we can save those
animals for you know eating yeah wearing
clothes yeah what okay okay please
continue okay so this technology is much
needed in the world of sports okay
because you just watch sports you see
it's a bunch of guys running around
yeah they look so small there are little
guys running around high-fiving each
other hitting each other and but
whatever it whatever it is they're doing
over there wow this new technology lets
you live the sport from the actual field
or court or whatever so basically what
this is this is called first vision one
it's a Spanish startup club in it
they basically mount a camera on the
athlete so that you can see what it's
like from their view and it sends it so
that you can watch it in a low latency
livestream you can actually see
that's cool it live and even like if
you're looking at the screen it also
shows their heart rate yeah I was gonna
ask show statistics for their mark right
side of the screen you can see a like a
heart beating and a number that's their
heart rate as they're playing yeah so
you can see how much they're getting
into it now what's crazy about this is
you know the technology of cameras and
live streaming is got so far that this
is 1080p HD footage oh yeah it's just
this little tiny camera that they wear
on them and it feeds back immediately
lightweight imagine okay so this or this
already made its debut they made its
debut at a game a game featuring Spanish
team a core Cordoba yeah yeah so which
so so it was it was football football or
soccer yeah it's also worn by refs and
players in the Euroleague basketball
games I think the great idea yes learn
by rams can see the replay you could see
so like sometimes maybe we'd be able to
catch like refs cheating like if you
could like well no no listen you hear a
lot about people going oh the refs threw
that game refs threw that game yeah but
if the fans could see what the ref saw
maybe there'd be a little bit like the
Russian or that game is more or less a
defensive mechanism for people that
think I think it'd be cool though yeah
it like any last minute things to see if
someone did a foul or anything that's a
like a false call so yeah so what we
think this could raise the bar in terms
of sports watching in the future I would
definitely if it was like the Super Bowl
I would love to get like into like see
like a like a quarterback getting ready
to like throw it and you see all these
dudes running at it but it's I think the
heart rate thing is especially cool
that's cool you know like Usain Bolt
like imagine watching him run and like
watch his heart rate just spiked and
then come back I oh man that would be so
awesome
or maybe it's already beating really
fast before the before the gun goes off
and then he's like he's because he's so
pumped to run or he could be even
crazier to see an athlete do crazy well
and his heart rate isn't even going nuts
yeah it's like cool under problem so
yeah that's pretty cool that's awesome
all right so hashtag of the day I like
this TD first this first person yeah
what activity would you want to see
broadcast on television live in first
person so please behave yourselves we
all know what would more terrible people
will go to immediately yeah
what's yours uh I'm kind of weird as we
have all figured out on the show yeah
I'm a little bit weird I would say
surgery like I love the idea of being
able to watch surgeries like I dig that
like I'm really into like the medical
like I just I really like medical stuff
and so to be able to see that in real
life and that that's not dramatized like
Oh like Grey's Anatomy like I want to
see the real thing I want to watch that
or UFC fighting cuz that's oh that seems
intense
yeah watching but where do you I mean
for the guys like where do you just on
their shorts but it's like I mean you
can't attach it to them unless they like
implants on a camera under their skin or
whatever but once it gets punched it's
over like that cameras rapping on their
arm the camera be terrible I wouldn't
mind seeing like circus performers
anyway that does like extraordinary
things that we wouldn't like I'll never
be able to do like I can run down a
soccer field and kick a ball or whatever
yeah but like I cannot like be on a one
of those trapeze artists I can you know
like doing flips and stuff like that
this reminded me it would be really neat
to be able to buy a pay-per-view concert
like like pink she does all the
acrobatics and stuff yeah like a be cool
to be able to see the show from her
point of view all the time so she has
like a little tiny unobtrusive camera on
like all of her costumes or whatever or
any artist like I think would be really
cool to be able to see a show from their
point of view it veers p.m. smart the
office offer this is like a bonus
package but they're gonna have to get
though they're gonna have to get they're
definitely gonna have to get the
athletes to wear them and that's gonna
be a whole headache extra money yeah
especially if it's like a quarterback
that makes sense so but I love it no I
die really like it I think that's really
fun
so that's TD first CD first TD first T
first just the whole activity f irst you
don't do one st I don't want to
confused anybody who's listening I can't
actually see the hashtags so um I gotta
tell you about this 3d printer violin
first of all this is crazy-looking this
violin is crazy like what's it okay
producer Logan's gonna put it up on the
screen it is unbelievably weird-looking
it is super curved and beautiful it's
part of this art exhibit it's it's gonna
be part of so that this is a different
instrument that you're right it doesn't
that looks like a bat'leth so this is a
different instrument so they have like a
whole collection of instruments that
they're showing off at this art exhibit
it's called the 3d print design show in
New York City Wow look at that thing it
looks that looks like sharp it'll it
does it looks like it could hurt
somebody really bad if you someone tries
to steal it just take them where the
violin you're saying it sounds like yeah
it's it's actually not just oh look at
this cool 3d printed shell of a violin
and but it works exactly the same as a
normal violin no it works
totally different than that it's only
has two strings instead of four uh-huh
and then it the curves amplify the
acoustics of the sound in a totally new
way so you can hear the way the violin
has played in a completely different way
than a standard violin which is pretty
impressive all of these 3d printed
instruments are gonna appear at the 3d
print design show in New York City as
part of this like exhibit where they're
gonna show all of the different
instruments and you can buy tickets you
can go after your New York City I've
seen that covering that uh you know I
have a feeling someone's probably gonna
go to that okay cool um it's uh I know
that I mean we covered it on the site
like the violin which is pretty cool and
then but I don't know I don't know if
they'll go to the go to the Art Show I
think we're really fun to go sound off
that's TD C net goes to the 3d art
exhibit and that's your home so many
characters you can yeah yeah it's just
like the thumbs ever thumbs down because
you literally have taken up 139 you have
to do fault you have to do all of that
Orsino serious you know today will go
yeah future instruments super weird man
like that super weird already I'm ready
for some super instruments like see how
instruments like some Final Fantasy
there's this weird stuff there's this
crazy keyboard I don't know if you've
seen it or not but it's like maybe we'll
show it on the show one of these days
it's not brand new but it's it's so
unreal looking like it just looks like
it
came from space like it looks like
aliens designed it and it makes really
weird sounds and it's very odd right no
I don't think we did us okay we did
aliens yeah yeah one base thing yeah
it's you there's that one and then
there's another it's like a keyboard
it's like an electronic keyboard looks
like it was made in outer space it's so
cool anyway um we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back it is Tuesday
so we have new releases and then of
course your user feedback which is gonna
get pretty exciting because i doand
YouTube comments and then and then of
course we have our phone talker for
today so don't click away it's tomorrow
daily hey everyone welcome back to the
show it's Tuesday and that means we are
gonna talk about all the great things
that are coming out this week that you
may want to spend your hard-earned cash
on all the things were really excited to
see coming out whether it be video games
movies television this is new releases
okay so we there's some good games
coming out this week I'm pretty excited
okay
we have AI really well there's one that
you're gonna be really excited about but
for me hotline Miami 2 is coming out
today have your play Holi man
yes I'm terrible at it I'm too I'm awful
at it okay but it's a continuation of
the first story they're saying that like
it's gonna happen before and after the
events of the first one which is pretty
exciting
and if you haven't played hotline Miami
I don't know I just I recommend it
because it it's great it is it's it's
pretty good and and so that's available
today on PlayStation 4 PlayStation 3
PlayStation Vita and PC you can get it
but not on no Xbox one on the whole hole
which is kind of a bummer but it looks
slow it's super graphic and violent and
it's very old-style
Smash TV very smash man it's it's got a
lot of personality the music is great if
nobody's recommend what for hotline
miami like you can get a soundtrack like
usually come by the san fran they're so
good so it's pretty cool i I recommend
at least checking out a twitch stream
for it so you can you can get a feel for
it but it's a it's not this is one of
those games there's nothing like playing
it it's very like Smash TV it's it can
be very hyper violent but you know I'm
it's definitely hyper violent as an
adult I get to play hyper violent games
so going from that to the complete
opposite end of the spectrum of other
things that I like which are whimsy and
amazing artwork and just gloriousness
tell me more Ori and the blind forest
okay which I played at e3 it comes out
for Xbox one and there be an Xbox 360
version they're working on if it'll be
later this year this is gameplay and
Windows so they're gonna window so this
is um this is actually the intro of the
game this is like the cutscene so oh my
god that's adorable
this game is unbelievably gorgeous it
looks like um god there's just so many
games that it's it reminds me of like in
my heart like it's it's very reminiscent
like that's gameplay that's at the
actual game okay it's so it's a side
scroller three like a side-scrolling
venture they said that like methylate
and Raymond were - they're like that's
they want the heart of those types of
games so very a side-scrolling a kind of
platforming adventure game it's a very
coming-of-age story the intro to this
game literally almost made me cry at
when I was on the show floor at e3 last
year it was the only thing that like hit
me emotionally right in the feels like
gut punch to your feels guys I have to
buy this it's do you think this is gonna
be like a candidate for any any
particular categories for like Game of
the Year I think I think it definitely
might win some awards
that's all I'm sorry all right stunning
I haven't played the full game but I
will say that one of the things that I
really loved about the development of
this game is as far as I'm aware and
when I talked to the guy at e3 a whole
bunch of the guys who developed it they
don't live in the same country cool
developed the entire game like from
different countries there were like nine
guys and they developed it and they they
had just gotten to sort of meet some of
them got to meet each other for the
first time ever at e3 to come show the
game which I thought was so cool again
technology coming together but none of
these none of these will interest Logan
producer Logan more than as much as our
next one which is true grand theft auto
5 heists which isn't a new game no it's
basically they now the much promised so
long ago heist highly involving player
so now I guess a lot of people are gonna
start loading up their robbery some bank
it's right by the way if you have grand
theft auto it's free this is how you
know say yeah yeah so you get to you get
to hang around your friends group up and
do heists I haven't got a chance to try
it out I know how many heists there are
go rob some banks get to Robert Chuy
banks I gotta wait for the PC version to
come out I've got an Xbox 360 but who
cares yes so this is much anticipated
this is another one you can expect to
see a lot of on Twitch if you want to
check it out and see these heists going
on you can go download it today actually
on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live if
you're so inclined it's on all of okay
cool yeah with you PC I think it's what
next month yeah yeah next month so um
and then lastly and in theaters this
weekend of interest to me oh if only
because AI love Cate Blanchet and she
looks like she is like chewing the
scenery in this which I adore
and then but Cinderella is coming out
with me a live-action Disney to two
things on this go ahead
I liked Maleficent I thought it was good
yeah so I'm curious if this is gonna be
it looks decent it looks like a good
kind of live action fairy tale does look
too cheesy that's the first time I'm
seeing the trailer for this I don't
think did they promote this well and
they've been providing this like crazy
and that and but I just heard today like
speaking of live-action Disney movies I
don't know if you heard this or not but
Tim Burton's gonna do Dumbo a
live-action Dumbo yeah what you're
silent yep now that I think that's
exactly my response actually what what
okay yeah cuz we we have we have buting
the beasts coming yes now we have the
bard from The Hobbit playing guest on
okay and then we have Dumbo yeah what's
left I was hoping that Tim Burton mutton
right
I was hoping they're gonna do Pinocchio
that seems like wood even they go to
pleasure really don't know what pleasure
island and they do it like they're all
they the cigars and something they turn
into donkeys and it's terrifying that
seems like a Tim Burton see you know
what do you remember that scene in Dumbo
where it's all the like heffalumps yeah
the pink elephants on parade
that seems gonna be nightmarish I listen
it could be really good that's the only
part of it I think is very Tim Burton
but everything else rather do don't know
Dumbo I don't think Dumbo needs to be
live-action let's not let's not even all
that it's a class it doesn't need no
Pinocchio seems like someone of us feel
like outcasts because we have something
different about it I just don't want to
see Johnny Depp play the leader of that
group of Papa Johnny Depp as Dumbo as
the leader of the crows like it's gonna
because he is a too big I don't know
what to do with them where's all the
room oh no oh you're the super racist
crows like he's gonna do that role like
he already played Tonto and lone ranger
it's not a real stretch for it be
slightly racist come on Johnny Depp
don't do it I'm begging you all right um
every everyday we like to talk about
what you guys think of the show and so
it is now time for your
feedback all right we asked everybody
last week we did the the $30,000
doghouse of the future and we had TD
house yeah unfortunately none of you on
Twitter
looking at you Twitter nobody responded
so guess what I did it's hard on Thurs
my scuba diving suit and I dove into the
depths of YouTube comments I went in
with my nose plugged and I jumped I try
to keep my welcome back thank you I'm
alive still have all your you know
facial pieces it's true elbows and
fingers I may also have just been I may
be liquid metal and I've rebuilt myself
as a robot like informaiton yeah pretty
cool um okay so I took some of your
youtube comments which actually we're
surprisingly adorable and great you
can't always talk crap on the YouTube
commenters there's a lot of cool people
out there I was really impressed with
you guys just FYI um okay so things in
the rough first comment gaming TV wrote
to us and said what would be awesome is
if eventually we have entire simulated
wildlife parks where all the wildlife a
robotic so we could explore and observe
their behavior of current species
animals and extinct species as well like
dinosaurs and hunt them and hunt a most
dangerous game yeah that's cool and that
was about the plural bot the salamander
robot so they were saying like if we had
these like zoos where there were robotic
animals where they basically acted
exactly like real animals we could study
them without actually having to like
capture them uh handy Randy wrote if you
really read the comments on YouTube you
would mention my name since I'm the
biggest fan of all time handy Randy well
guess what I do read the comments and
I'm mentioning you handy Randy biggest
fan of all time biggest fan of all time
that's why somebody step up to handy
Randy thank someone to challenge you for
that title show that they're a bigger
fan someone's got a challenge handy
Randy for the baddie Randy watch your
back now for me I'm not gonna everybody
just gonna sit here we're just yeah
we're fine okay
edit Hulk wrote contra is easier than
Ghosts'n goblins no it's not ha
no it's not edit Hulk agree no and then
Robert wrote about the TD schooled where
he said
with the lightsabers and we were like
why would you pick paintball when you
could have a full-on like war you could
do like wargames like came back he has a
response and he's like sorry for being
such a d-bag and TD schooled here's my
explanation I agree with guys with you
guys that using real blasters spaceships
and lightsabers would be much more
awesome but my logic was for having a
paintball fight with them was because if
I have blasters shooting real lasers
those people would get injured and Luke
would probably get sued from the parents
who go who have a kid with his or her
arm chopped off or a hole or a hole
burning through them loved the show
watch you guys every day you guys are
the best sometimes I have to stop
because I'm laughing so hard hashtag
tomorrow daily hashtag best geek talk
show hashtag pizza forevermore Pizza
Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza Pizza thing why
do you think about lawsuits like
nobody's everything you got to keep it
safe imagine if like Luke Skywalker got
a lot of egos no you could have sued
Darth Vader for cutting off his hands
oh yeah the lawsuit is strong in this
like Saul Goodman shows up in Return of
the Jedi and he's like you're being
served that would be the best crossover
I said Darth Vader what we should
totally do that
we support Saul Goodman shows up in
other franchises to like serve people
like paper that would be an amazing we
should do that don't steal that idea
anybody on the inner Shh don't tell
anybody Kayla and I are gonna do it it's
gonna be great
all right guys it's time for our very
last piece of user feedback which is of
course our phone talker for the day
all right so our phone time for the day
today is you got to do that I know I do
that let's get Bob Odenkirk on the phone
after we're done with chef if anybody
knows Bob Odenkirk or related to Bobby
he's watching he's watching yeah huge
fan of the show call us all right Molly
wrote in and I'm saying I loved this
picture she says I took this picture of
my iPhone 4s back in November at my
friend's sweet 16 birthday party Atwater
Sound Beach Florida I love the show my
family all watches it together I love
this bonfire with the beach it's like
it's super artistic I really like it
what would make this picture like just
just I can't really get much better than
this but what could what's the one thing
that would make it better
Jeff Goldblum off in the back Blazers in
the water but he's got floaties on his
arm I would say left shark would make
this picture I'm just saying no this is
beautiful yeah gorgeous I want wait can
we throw me a sweet 16 party my birthday
is at the end of the month only if we
throw me a quinceanera perfect done
let's like at i/o ha done can we put you
in a kids and get a dress si muy bien
muy bien excelente I'm excited all right
use the fire Spanish no I have lots more
did you use up all your Spanish si si
okay all right guys if you want to be
considered for photogra for the day you
