procrastinate and find excuses but
sooner or later you're going to have to
vacuum so you might as well use a model
that'll make the process as painless as
possible let's talk through the
different types of vacuums available to
you if you want your carpets to get a
deep clean you'll need either a
traditional upright or a canister vac
you can find either type for 40 or 50
bucks all the way up to 7 or 800 these
are full-sized models so they're bigger
and heavier than other types but also
more powerful both can come with a
variety of accessories for picking up
pet hair or cleaning corners the big
difference uprights are well I mean they
stand upright you push the whole machine
as you work canisters put the engine on
the ground next to you and you wheel it
around while maneuvering a lighter one
for quicker and easier cleaning look for
a stick vac or a handheld vac these will
be cheaper lighter and more maneuverable
than their full-sized counterparts 6
tend to run from 25 to $300 though a few
fancy models do cost more than that
handhelds tend to cost between 20 bucks
and 100 some stick VAX
even claim to clean as well as a
traditional vac for the most part though
no they do not you don't get quite the
same power with these smaller models but
they're more portable and better for
spot cleaning that's the trade-off stick
vac scan also include accessories for
pet hair and the like but handhelds are
the best for getting the crumbs out of
your car if you want to get high-tech
robot vacuums can do a lot of the
cleaning for you but be prepared to pay
set these guys up with a charging
station and they'll patrol your floors
sucking up dirt you can automate
schedules and even control some models
with an app they can't Traverse multiple
floors obviously and they don't tend to
clean as well as stick backs but a spot
cleaning from a robot vacuum means you
can put off your own chores for longer
unfortunately figuring out which vacuums
perform the best is tricky as a number
of different factors such as the shape
of the head the brush roll and the
section power lead to different results
that can be hard to discern in stores
fortunately we have plenty of full
reviews of different models to help you
pick on that front</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
