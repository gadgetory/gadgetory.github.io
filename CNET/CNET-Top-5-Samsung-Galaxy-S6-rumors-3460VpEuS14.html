of the most popular in the world 2015 we
expect to see a brand new version likely
to be called the galaxy s6 as if life
with a lisp wasn't hard enough over on
cnet we have a running list of all the
rumors surrounding this yet to be
announced phone in this top 5 I'll be
counting down the 5 most solid rumors
work knowing about starting off at
number 5 the processor Samsung will of
course go top of the line for their
flagship phone but it remains to be seen
if they'll be using their own process or
grab someone else's respect either a
Snapdragon 810 quad-core like the one
found in the upcoming LG G flex 2 or
Samsung's own Exynos 7420 at number for
the camera Samsung has always outdone
themselves on the camera and photo
software features this year expect to
see a substantially beefed up front
facing camera also known as the selfie
camera also we expect to see optical
image stabilization from the Galaxy Note
trickle down to the galaxy s coming in
at number 3 cos all signs point to the
s6 running Android 5.0 lollipop the
Samsung the question then becomes how
much will they junk it up with their own
TouchWiz software fortunately we've been
hearing a rumor that Samsung might be
dialing it back on TouchWiz it could be
they heard my gag reflex trigger all the
way from Korea at number 2 a bigger
screen samsung basically created the
market for a big screen smartphone and
they're not about to stop now expect an
incrementally larger screen for the s6
possibly up to the 5.5 inches of the
iphone 6 plus we also expect to see
Samsung use their AMOLED screen
technology similar to the Galaxy Note
and maybe even release a separate
version with a curve like they did with
the note edge finally our number one
strongest rumor for the upcoming samsung
galaxy s6 smartphone
the unveiling just this week they sent
out their invitation to the march first
and Mobile World Congress unpacked event
featuring a shadowy outline of what we
assumed to be the galaxy s6 with a
curved screen considering that the
galaxy s5 was announced at Mobile World
Congress last year this seems like a
safe bet and hopefully like last year
we'll see it release a few weeks later
so there you go all the rumors worth
mentioning surrounding the samsung
galaxy s6 smartphone you can keep up
with all the smartphone news over at
phones cnet.com and more top five for me
