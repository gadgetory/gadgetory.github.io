in Las Vegas i'm bryan song here with
amana you're probably gonna recognize
the fastest man alive mr. Usain Bolt
what's up man thanks for coming out and
I'm good after the beer thank you so
much for coming out to the scene that
stage first of all I know you pretty
much just got in here from the Bahamas
tell me a little bit about the weather
there versus here right now
the wait is the same thing pretty much
the trough from from the states is just
skating through the Caribbean right now
it's kind of chilly but it's the
Caribbean so still awesome always is
this your first CES yeah it's actually
my first year and uh have you you have
you had a chance to walk around a little
bit or not yes I just got here came
straight here so a little bit later I'm
gonna walk around and see what's going
on cause all my friends keep saying you
need to walk her on and see what's
happening so you saw Sophia that robot
what was it what were your first like
good instincts about that man it's kind
of freaky it was cool it was cool well
it's kind of freaky that she she
understood what's going on so I'm just
watching we all watch our robot so we
have to watch out now you're also here
to talk about the Philips bass plus line
we want to talk to you a little bit
about that and then just talk about a
whole bunch of other things what are you
here for you know kind of represented
talk about for me I'm just trying to let
people know what I'm about if anybody
knows me knows I'm all about music and I
mean all about music I'm a DJ with track
and field I listen to music all the time
music is a part of me so after I have
the best sounds at all times you know I
mean so for me the the Philips bass plus
in here is one of the things that works
for me especially because I travel so
much it's it has portable which is
always key you know I mean we have six
hours we have six hours on on on the but
easily and then we have a extra six
hours to charge so for me is like 12
hours and I travel everywhere constantly
and I mean so bama's here then I go to
South Africa I'm in Vegas so I keep
moving so it's something that really
works for me nice
we have people that review headphones
and I think you could have just taken
all their jobs right now
watch out what I do for me is easy but
the overhead is one of my favorites
because because of who I am and people
always i watch to the airport people
always just come up to me when I've no
idea when after yearbook they come to me
all the time you know I mean but when I
have the overheads on they kind of leave
me alone a little bit you know I mean so
for me it's always it's always a good
thing
it's easy it flips in and out quickly so
something I really enjoy and I really
love it so something I'm working on uh
you know I love you talk about music
what are you listening to right now you
know or they're artists right now that
you that you're you're on that maybe
people may or may not know about some
that are local some some of that are not
for me as a as a as a DJ a guy who
listens to music on a regular ah I try
to stick to every drawn of music you
know I mean but I'm much into dancehall
music I love to dance so on my favorite
artists right now is ding dong and
that's what we do so we dance a lot and
we just have a good time do you have any
music artists or songs that are guilty
pleasures that people would be like I
didn't I didn't think you saying listen
to that there's gotta be everything I
mean for me I try I try to keep it like
I don't want it that way so uh in
addition to music this is and you know
you I'm sure you're using a lot when
you're training everything this news
just dropped out I don't know if you saw
people writing a lot about this but
you're going for a trial with you know
with what about Lucia dortmund right the
German professional football team oh
that's pretty amazing so talk talk about
that for me that's that's something that
I'm retired from track and feed but I'm
I'm a sports person you know I mean
always watched over the years and I've
always played soccer sure of my ear so
something that I was like you know what
I feel I could personally do so I
decided that you know why not and my
sponsor Boomer sponsors our birth chadar
mind and I say you know what comfort
Charles and the Charles when I would go
to the child will determine what I do
exactly with my crazy folly it up or if
I don't so we see what happens is is the
trial happening in March like they
they're reporting so where are you with
that just physically and skill-wise how
do you feel about it straining yeah I'm
trying to get back into shape uh you
know I mean and I see no as I said you
gotta keep listening to your music pump
me up you know that keeps going that's
when I use my wallets the most so it's
something that I'm focused on and I'm
gonna get there because I really want
and when I want something I really
pushed myself to be the best I can be
oh I didn't notice that at all the other
thing about a you training everything I
heard really is it's kind of a step to
your dream of playing for Manchester
United is that what man you is that is
that one of those things that's
something that would be a big dream for
me and I mean I'm a massive fan of
Manchester United so if I could get into
the team you know I mean even for one
season it would be a dream come true
just to play with the guys just to play
at Old Trafford there it would be
something big so we see what happens
when Marsh come we'll determine a lot of
things I think a lot of people gonna be
watching that I mean this is it's
exciting to know that you're gonna be in
a position to try this this is pretty
awesome yeah a lot of people have been
saying are you serious about it
something like yeah why don't people
think I'm serious and I mean there's
something I want to do so I'm gonna go
out and do my best for sure times now
what about let's just pretend and
imagine that you scored a goal for a man
you we know there's a lot what would be
the pose would it be something different
or the same or way what do you think if
you took yourself there like we vision
the future like for the first time I
remember the first time I want to go
don't limp a gold medal I didn't know
what to do you know I mean so I know
that's exactly what's gonna happen in
your mind you're like alright I'm gonna
do this pose I'm gonna do distance but
as soon as you score that goal you're
gonna lose it
I mean you're not gonna remember
anything because that that jar is gonna
just take over I probably just run the
whole pitch so let's see uh the other
thing that we wanted to try and do I
don't know if you're game for this but
we know you're the fastest man alive
right really yeah oh yeah I heard I
heard we know we like your tip you're on
your phone right you text message and
stuff we wanted to see if you wanted to
challenge me to a text messaging speed

this okay I've never said we I haven't
seen the cents but we've collected a
sentence that they actually have a
contest every year

this sentence that we'll both be able to
see whoever finishes it first and
accurately will win the contest you

noise doing right applause all right so
