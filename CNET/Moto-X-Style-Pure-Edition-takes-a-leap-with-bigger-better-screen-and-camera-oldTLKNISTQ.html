motox the time has come I'm here in New
York with the Moto X style which is
going to be a 5.7 inch quad HD phone
this thing is more impressive than the
nexus 6 that came out last year the
Nexus 6 had a 5.9 inch display this is
5.7 but this has something that the last
Moto X a lot of people's opinions
including ours needed a better camera 21
megapixel on the rear but not just the
megapixels Motorola claims is going to
take clearer better photos even claiming
that it's going to beat out the iphone 6
plus we'll see about that plus it's got
turbo charging like always but they
claim that it's even faster at doing
that then the samsung galaxy s6 this is
going to be available in September for
399 unlocked sold directly to those who
want to buy it plus it's going to be
quad band so you can pick this up and
hook it up with any service or carrier
that you want in the US with sprint ett
verizon whatever you can hook it up and
use it which is the way all phones
should really be but they're not and of
course it's moto maker so you've got a
lot of sustainable wood backs leather
finishes seven different metallic
finishes there's a new soft touch back
and there are different metal frames so
a lot of different options this is part
of three new phones of motorola's
launching this one is going to be
available the latest but for a lot of
people the weight might be worth it now
this phone has two different names
overseas it's going to be known as the
Moto X style but in the US it's going to
call the Moto X pure edition which is to
help people I guess feel like they
understand that it's pure Android or
that you can purely connect to lots of
carriers just keep that in mind I'm
Scott Stein with the new pretty sexy
Moto X style
