based on the race car that marks Ford's
return to Lamont and Ford hopes beating
Ferrari at its own game something at
first did in 1966 besting marin ellos
finest with a one two three victory the
last four GT came out in 2005 and it was
brilliant it was a modern interpretation
on the gt40 and it was really bloody
quick as well this new one when it
brings it not only bang-up today but
also further into the future help it
looks more like a Lamborghini than a
Lamborghini designed in secret long
before it's Detroit 2015 debut by a team
led by more a column brother of Jaguars
ian callum it's utterly stunning it's
made from carbon fiber and I suspect
magic we're told that there's nothing on
here that doesn't need to be either and
it uses aluminium subframes to keep it
light but still mega strong take a look
at its silhouette it is unmistakeably
length to the gt40 those headlights the
shape and positioning as well or an
awesome hot bath as off my favorite bit
for buttresses speaking of its ancestry
here's why the new gt's return to Lamar
is so important in the 60s for tried to
buy Ferrari but Ferrari at the last
minute tore up the contract and knocked
Ford something chronic so rather than
simply go off and lick its wounds for
decided it was going to very publicly
shame Enzo and his races it was going to
beat them on the racetrack so began
development of the gt40 and after a
shaky start the gt40 went on to win
lamothe four times on the trot from
nineteen sixty six to nineteen
sixty-nine basically it was a very quick
very large middle finger to Italy with
love from America now some people are
making a lot of noise about the new
gt's v6 engine after all the gt40 and
the last GT came with big noisy v8
however a lot of people either don't
know about or have forgotten the gt70
rally car from the 70s that started its
life with a v6 so technically a v6 is in
the GTS blood this v6 though has two
massive turbos and promises power in
excess of 600 horses there's carbon
ceramic brakes at each corner and one
interview promised the best
power-to-weight ratio that's interesting
arrows important in a car like this is
designed to go very very fast down the
Mulsanne straight and around all of the
corners every corner everywhere and you
see the wing on the back it's got active
Aero to get the car in as good shape as
possible and it can be an air brake
which is pretty cool those buttresses
actors wings to a downforce and fire air
towards the big wing at the back it
rises on active suspension to keep the
GT and its driver in the best possible
shape in any given situation and ford's
even fitted and lifter on the front so
if you encounter a speed bump you won't
tear the underside of the car off there
are some wonderful details on the GT but
my two favorites are the air scoops on
the buttresses to send their to the
engine and the holes in the rear lights
they're there to let hot air out of the
car how cool is that there are no
confirmed figures for the new GT Bart
using educated guesswork and not 262
time of around 3 seconds probably lower
and a top speed in excess of 200 miles
an hour would be fair now Ford is
promising to make 250 of these a year
the price well that's around lamborghini
money quarter of a million quid sounds
about right if you want one you're going
to have to wait until 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
