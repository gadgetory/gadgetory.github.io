sitting here next to Sony's 84-inch XBR
84 X 900 this is Sony's first 4k TV and
one of the first on the market we'll get
the biggest thing out of the way first
is a twenty-five thousand dollar
television further that twenty five
thousand dollars Sony includes not only
the TV but also the first 4k content
that you're likely ever to see it
actually ships with a little server that
includes a bunch of videos that you can
call up on an included tablet so all
that package is kind of unique in terms
of the 4k TVs out there the only other
one is from LG it's 84 inches as well
but it doesn't include that server
package another extra that Sony's
talking about is the 4k conversion from
2k content you're going to be able to
pipe all of that content onto this TV
and blow it up to 84 inches and
according to Sony you do get really good
video processing now we did get a demo
this television Sony set it up next to
LG's 84 inch TV as well as an 80 inch
sharp that's not 4k we did notice that
the video processing on the Sony is
pretty darn good it did allow that 1080p
content to look really detailed and for
what it's worth more than the Sharps
1080p content of course we were sitting
relatively close to this large screen if
you sit a little bit further back you're
not going to notice that much of a
difference in detail sony also showed us
a demo of 2k content versus 4k content
on two identical sony 84-inch tvs and we
really were very hard-pressed to see any
difference between the two you have to
kind of walk right up to the screen to
see the difference the point being the
Sony's video processing again does a
pretty good job of taking that 1080p
content bumping it up to 4k we were also
shown a demo of black level this TV does
have local dimming which means that it's
able to dim the backlight in different
areas of the screen and get a really
nice deep dark color black which does
increase the contrast and pop we've seen
in past Sony TVs that looked extremely
good it looks very good on this one as
well so that's another aspect of the TVs
performance that we weren't pressed by
one other demo included screen
uniformity Sony tell us that each of
these TVs is tuned at the factory to
remove defects and uniformity so you see
a nice uniform pictures which is
especially important when you're panning
over material or you see a white field
or a black field for example such a
large TV Sony does include a lot of ways
to mess around with the form factor you
can take those speakers off if you like
the stand here as shown
also be removed you can wall mount this
TV there's also a way to post them out
the television if you want to do that or
put it on a stand if you'd like to do
that so any stand does include a little
wire hook on the back here to try and
make your wires less visible as we
mentioned at the top this TV does
include 4k content that means you can
connect this included server which has a
series of videos that are included on
their sony also updates they're actually
rolling out one of the first updates to
this server so they'll come to your
house and install a bunch of new movies
on there later in the year the company
says it will introduce a 4k video
distribution system we're still waiting
details on that again that's going to be
one of the first of its kind that's a
quick look at Sony's xbr 84 X 900 one of
the first 4k TVs on the market for
twenty five thousand dollars I'm David
