cnet.com and I'm here with the monoprice
noise cancelling headphones in case
you've never heard of monoprice this is
the electronics equivalent of a generic
drug company yes it makes sort of I
wouldn't call them knockoffs exactly of
name-brand products but it does make
bargain-priced versions of name-brand
products and this is obviously a bit of
an imitation of some of the bose
noise-canceling headphones now the first
thing you notice about them is they do
seem pretty well built I wasn't in love
with some of the cosmetics they do have
a glossy finish on their cups those are
prone to fingerprints and they probably
will get scratched up fairly easily but
the headphones do seem well built they
fold flat and they come with a nice
carrying case they also come with a
couple of different cords the cord is
detachable and you do get a cord with an
inline remote and microphone so you can
make cell phone calls like other noise
cancelling headphones these are powered
by a triple-a battery it's easy to
access and it gives you about 50 hours
of battery life so decent battery life
one of the areas where they do fall down
a little bit is in the sound quality
they just aren't as clear as the bose QC
15s or the Harman Kardon and C
headphones well the problems with noise
cancelling headphones is that when you
do put sound through that noise
canceling circuitry it does end up
sounding kind of processed and it comes
that are able to do it better like bose
they do retain that clarity and make
them sound less like noise cancelling
headphones the good news here is that
you can listen to these with the noise
cancelling off and they do sound better
with the noise cancelling off not sure
exactly why you would buy them except
for the noise cancelling but you can do
that which is nice so there's a lot to
like you there are some other models out
there like the creative hn 900 that are
very similar looking this does seem a
little bit better than that
it does have memory foam in the ear cups
and just seems a little bit more
sturdily built but that creative model
is around $65 online so it is worth
checking out the real question is
whether you want to buy a pair of
headphones that clearly isn't
as good as some of those more expensive
models but cost close to a third of the
price so you're getting about 70% of the
headphone both in terms of its design
and its sound quality and for some
people that will be good enough for
others that 30% will be worth paying the
extra money for I'm David Conroy and
those are the monoprice noise cancelling
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
