want your device to be protected and to
follow your lifestyle now we all know
water and electronics electronics don't
mix like when water is spilled on your
phone or you drop it in a puddle or in
the sink and then you're in trouble
c'est la vie but this is not a problem
anymore because the galaxy s5 is water
and dust resistant
and because your phone is now
water-resistant you don't have to be
resistant to water watch your video in
the tub sing along your playlist and the
shower don't worry about the rain the s5
is protected for your lifestyle but
don't go too far
water-resistant is not waterproof so
don't keep it on the water but if it
does get wet it'll be good
now the galaxy s5 also has an
interesting new feature called ultra
power saving moon how many of you have
had your phone die at a critical moment
I have last week for example I spent a
whole day using my phone with no access
to a charger and I was invited in the
evening to a nice dinner so with no time
to go home I was frantically looking for
a charger because I must be reachable
for the babysitter of my kids this is a
stressful situation the battery not my
kids but with ultra power saving mode
problem solved it will turn the display
to black and white and shut down all
features except the essentials like SMS
and calls so for example if my Galaxy s5
is down to only 10% of battery it can
still last up to 24 hours in standby
so that should be long enough for me to
get back home after dinner in most cases
that's how the galaxy s5 can protect its
battery life but it will also protect
your data at a whole new level and the
key is right here
fingers Canada uses your fingerprint as
the ultimate password to validate your
identity it is encrypted on your device
and never shared all it takes is a
simple swipe of your finger to make
secure payments no need to key in your
credit card number or your mother's
maiden name or your first pet's name or
whatever crazy question they will think
of next
which doesn't solve the security problem
as simply and securely as this does also
fingers Canon unlocks private mode where
images videos and all the types of files
are kept secured because only your
fingerprints will unlock them when I
travel for example I like to keep a copy
of my passport with me just in case now
I can carry it in my galaxy s5 in a
secure way because I know I can only
access it in private mode with this
that's all the security of my data now
what about the security of my kids when
they play with my phone and for that
matter the security of my phone where
they play with it this next feature is
perfect when sharing your smartphone
with the little members of the family
with kids mode I can with only one click
make my phone kid-friendly and provide
them with a number of fun
pre-install applications and design and
designate other apps including games and
videos that my wife and I feel are right
for them well if my phone kid-friendly
and provide them with a number of fun
pre-install applications and design and
designate other apps including games and
videos that my wife and I feel are right
for them well these are some examples of
how your life will be powered by the
galaxy s5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
