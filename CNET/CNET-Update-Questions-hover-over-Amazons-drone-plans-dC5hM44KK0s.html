delivery I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update what if you could buy
something online and have it delivered
to your door within 30 minutes amazon is
working on doing just that with a
service called amazon prime air once you
place your order the item will be boxed
up at the warehouse and picked up by a
drone with eight propellers and in this
perfect world the drone would fly off
and land in front of your doorsteps
dropping off your shoebox sized package
it can handle up to five pounds of
weight which covers about eighty-six
percent of the items that amazon
delivers the drone does this all on its
own there is no human controlling this
thing it's all automated with GPS
coordinates and it would have to be
delivered to a location within a 10-mile
radius of the warehouse Amazon's chief
executive Jeff Bezos said he doesn't
expect this to actually take flight for
several more years and he's hopeful that
maybe he can happen in five years if the
Federal Aviation Administration can
approve rules for drone delivery there
are many factors to be addressed before
this happens like how do you keep it
from landing on someone's head what if
it hits a building or gets caught in
power lines how does it avoid dropping
your package off on the roof or in a
tree and of course this does not help
folks who live in an apartment or office
building you don't want your package
just abandoned on the sidewalk but when
the FAA is ready to discuss rules and
regulations on drone delivery you can
bet amazon will be ready to lead the
conversation but while amazon looks to
the future facebook is tinkering with
your past the social network confirmed
to the blog AllThingsD ii that it is
working on a newsfeed feature that lets
you quickly pull up your old facebook
posts so throwback thursday may be as
easy as clicking a button to reflect on
what happened a year ago people can do
this now with an app called timehop it
also pulls up old updates from other
sites like twitter instagram flickr and
Foursquare after
spending spree of cyber monday comes
giving Tuesday it's another marketing
term made up for the season of shopping
but this time it's about donating money
to charitable causes and organizations
if you haven't heard of it well it's
only the second year of giving Tuesday
and Google is raising awareness with a
Google+ Hangout a thon with nonprofit
organizations using video chat to
explain their work and some celebrities
will also be dropping by hangouts to
encourage donations that's your tech
news update but you can get more details
at cnet com / update and be sure to
follow along on Twitter from our studios
