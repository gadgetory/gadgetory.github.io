cnet.com and I'm here with the Phillips
Fidelio sound ring this is an airplay
speaker that means you can stream music
to it from any iOS device or any
computer that has iTunes it is non
compressed music is not like bluetooth
so this is an airplay speaker and you
can see that it has a really interesting
design this a shaped design it sits in a
little dock here that's because the dock
actually charges the sound ring it has a
built in rechargeable battery that gives
you about three hours of battery life so
you can move the speaker around your
house recharge it around back there is
an auxilary input if you want to attach
an audio dies with a cable that's the
non wireless version and then there's
also a USB port that allows you to
charge your phone using a cable of
course I actually had pretty low
expectations for the speaker's because
it is kind of small and it really did
exceed my expectations in terms of sound
quality it does have nice clear sound
bigger bass than I thought it would have
and it's just a better sounding speaker
than I thought it would be it's really
one of the better smaller airplay
speakers we've tested the one drawback
of course is airplay speakers tend to be
expensive this one retails for around
$300 it's a little pricey you can't get
it for a little bit less than that apart
from that my only other gripe was I did
have a little bit of a problem setting
it up as an airplay speaker and the
manual isn't all that great it's just
kind of confusing once I did get it set
up it actually worked pretty well I had
a few dropouts occasionally and it is a
little bit complicated to see how you
would do a firmware upgrade but aside
from those factors this is a really
nicely designed product it also sounds
better than you probably think it will I
can fill a small to medium size room
with sound and that's really about it
that is the Philips Fidelio sound ring
with airplay I'm David Cardona thanks
