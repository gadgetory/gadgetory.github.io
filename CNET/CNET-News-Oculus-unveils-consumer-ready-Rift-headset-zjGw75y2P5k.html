oculus rift light you can hold it with
one hand let's take a closer look at the
rift headset we've designed a custom
display an optic system that a label
that enables us to achieve comfortable
presence it features two OLED screens
that deliver low persistence so as you
look around there's no motion blur
there's no judder there's no pixels
you're really there you can focus on
virtual objects it feels like you just
put on a pair of glasses maybe not quite
as high resolution as you one day one
but this is the beginning and it really
delivers that magic of presence that
visual clarity is incredibly important
and the rift delivers it it also
features a wide field of view so that
you really feel immersed in a new
constellation tracking system with this
tracking system you have very precise
low latency movement we've refined this
over years it's amazing you put it on
and you feel like you're there so back
to the sensor there's an external sensor
that you put on your desk it's simple
and reserved it's invisible once you put
it down on your desk you plug it into
the back of your computer and you're all
set that's it it just disappears we
wanted to be incredibly simple and easy
to use but the riff doesn't just trick
your eyes it also tricks your ears this
was a really important part to achieving
that level of presence to believing
you're there it couldn't just be visual
it also had to be audio you had to hear
the sound effect happening right where
you thought you saw it and you can turn
and look you had to get that audio cue
getting audio right is a critical
component to achieving presence and the
riff features an integrated audio
that we've again refined we're
incredibly proud of this so let's take a
look at t-rex again imagine he's coming
down this hallway you hear him off into
the distance it needs to sound like he's
off in the distance as you turn and look
and you feel the rumbling of him coming
down the hallway all that audio must be
spatialized it must be 360 it must match
the visual cues and that's what the VR
audio system is all about and the oculus
rift delivers it now as proud as we are
about these integrated headphones and we
think you're all going to want to use
them we know that some people want to
bring their own headphones so we've made
them really easy to take right off
they're removable something else you'll
notice right away right when you get
that rift right in your hand it's really
lightweight it's comfortable you can
slip it right on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
