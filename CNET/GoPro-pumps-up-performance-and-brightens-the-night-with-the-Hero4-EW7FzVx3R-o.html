the company still wants you to be a hero
and it wants you to do it with the best
possible video hey there I'm Josh grobin
we've seen it and this is a look at the
hero4 black and silver editions they
look pretty much the same as the hero 3
but there are some subtle design changes
such as the activity lights they're
moved to the side of the display as well
as on top back and bottom the battery
now loads in the bottom and it's a new
battery so your old ones won't work and
the Wi-Fi button is now a Settings
button that launches a new context
sensitive menu system so there's less
digging around for changes and it
doubles as a new tagging button to use
while you're recording so you can
quickly find an important moment when
you want to play back or edit just like
the hero 3 the Black has the best of the
best recording options and now records
4k video at 30 frames per second and
1080p at 120 frames per second that's
twice the speed of its predecessor and
the silver that goes up to 1080p at 60
frames per second and 720p at 120 frames
per second in both you'll find GoPros
protune mode for control over exposure
color in ISO which could be used for
video and photos now and they can shoot
12 megapixel photos at up to 30 frames
per second and for those who want better
results in the dark the cameras have new
night photo and night lapse options so
you can keep the shutter open for up to
30 seconds so yes the black still has
the best recording options but with the
silver you'll be getting one pretty
great extra a built-in touch screen to
make previewing and changing settings
that much easier there's a lot to test
here and we'll have full review soon but
from what we've seen so far both cameras
continue GoPros impressive streak of
delivering some of the best video we've
seen for the category I'm Josh Goldman
and that's a quick look at the new gopro
hero4 black and silver
