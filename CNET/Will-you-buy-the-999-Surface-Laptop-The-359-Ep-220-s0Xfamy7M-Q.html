York studio sorry we're starting late
today but it's still episode 220 of the
359 podcast I'm BVG and in the house of
me today
I've got Alfred Inge and Roger Chang as
we recover from an event that made us
push our podcast back how dare they I
know Microsoft nothing is more important
than briefly 9 podcast 220 blaze it uh
yeah I mean that was a long I mean look
it was it was an arduous work but it's
long press conference those two hours
long you know that was long surprisingly
long but we have a lot of good
information to bring you in the
follow-up yes definitely
we've got views about the thousand
dollar surface laptop we've got we've
got t-mobile pushing a 5g and yes we are
talking about cardboard boxes this is
you please really and this is a legit
thing way cooler than juice and it does
affect your life so death would pay
attention as always if you have any
questions on any of these topics leave
us a comment Brian will pick out the
best we will get to them in three
minutes in 59 seconds from three to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Alfred hang say hello to the surface
laptop the newest edition of Microsoft
Surface family is a thousand dollar
laptop that's a new flagship product for
its you Windows 10s a stripped-down
version of its software intended for
students like yourself spent a lot of
time talking about that the finish on
the surface laptop but we're most
impressed with the 14 and a half hour
battery life rated so Alfred what do you
think I'm gonna have to see if that's
actually accurate I mean that's what
they're advertising but you know as
we've seen with other laptops that come
out they always say oh you know this
will last you 10 12 hours and then when
it gets actually used that's just ends
up not being the case and also I'd like
to see how it deteriorates along the
line like you might be 14 hours out of
the box but they claim that you know
basically from day one to like 10 years
into or whatever like the battery life
is supposed to be to say but that's
kinda hard to believe in the way battery
life degree on time I'm very skeptical
of it but at the same time because of
the OS that they're operating it on
where it's like all windows like and it
is kind of a stripped-down version right
can't download outside apps it really
it's all kind of controlled either
downloaded from the Windows app store is
kind of like we kind of made the
comparisons like iOS yeah right so they
might actually be able to back up that
claim because there's no like outside
factors affecting it right as much but
that being said you know that that's
kind of like a con for me where I can't
you know download all these apps that I
want unless I pay like 50 bucks for the
pro update now Windows 10s is it tended
for students right yeah so you can't
understand why that exists for a
thousand dollars and isn't necessarily a
laptop for for kids right so who exactly
do you think they're selling the surface
laptop to I mean this seems a lot more
likely for college students than it is
for you know people in grade school in
high school right I mean like any
college campus all these kids have these
like MacBook Pros that cost more than a
thousand dollars and it's just you know
I know for a fact they don't need all
that process do you think that they'll
give up their back books for this thing
I think they will I think they're moving
more towards like a touchscreen like
laptop solution I am a little annoyed
that it doesn't have you know the the
detachable tablet or like being back on
it seems weird to move away from that
for as especially as a surface laptop
yeah I was a little bit limited that way
all right next up team awaits a big
waves over its intent to build the first
nationwide 5g network
I will Laura largely use a 600 megahertz
spectrum which is it's a little wonky
but basically it's low band spectra
that's great at covering great distances
not so good at high speed so it's going
to be like 5g but kind of slow that's
way how could it be 5g if it's slow
so one of the other characteristics of
5g is not just speed but it's sort of
responsive responsiveness basically it's
almost there's almost zero lag between
what you you know hit something and when
we get the response so they say it's
that they say it's the fact that it can
match you know way more devices on the
other network rather than just phones
we're talking about sensors we're
talking about dog collars anything
that's connected can be on this network
but that said people are expecting speed
with 5g this isn't really it will it at
least be faster than 4G or will it just
be the same and have more
I think I'll just have more reach that
that's I don't know I think that's like
really skewing the definition of 5g
there alright so lastly you probably
have a sip spend a lot of time thinking
about boxes that hold your Amazon orders
but UPS has been fox Ruben went down to
Louisville to check out its packing
Innovation Center packaging Innovation
Center well the company's exploring how
to make packages smaller to use less
cardboard which actually I care about
because I've got tons of boxes how about
you well yeah I have like way too many
boxes in my home I just moved and had to
get rid of so many of them they were
very useful for moving sure than that
yeah it's too many I don't know check it
out that's got a great description of
what the centers like the kinds of ways
that UPS is trying to slip down those
boxes for more are those stories check
us out on CNET roger Chang I'm out for
dang thanks for listening
alright let's get real about Microsoft
for a little bit let's do it
let's get real uh for one I had a little
trouble with the stream I don't know if
anyone else did actually watching it
here at the office yeah bet it was right
and I basically our strip died like two
seconds into the actual presentation I
don't know if anyone else out there and
chat was watching the live presentation
as an unfolded as Adam voted on Sina
comm but yeah we had a little trouble
from picking up their their signal but
that's not to deter away from what
essentially is a noble effort I actually
appreciated all the angles after we got
them talking just yesterday about
laptops and schools and the initiative
and like the way they really unfolded it
was very ambitious I thought yeah I
think the more interesting thing was you
know news that was kind of beared toward
the beginning of the event was that
other partners will be making these
these dados tennis
laptop they'll be as cheap as 187 bucks
that's interesting yeah yeah getting
that that price point down to a point
where I wish they named what that laptop
was because I'd love to see this
guessing it's often a serrated I imagine
would be a couple of that kind of hit
that really locally cuz there's gonna be
a lot of demand for those things yeah
that's probably what you're going to end
up seeing in classrooms they the you
know surface laptop yeah yeah that seems
like more aimed towards college kids
yeah that's definitely more of a
flagship product it's I don't think it's
one that schools are gonna they're not
gonna be buying that in mass for
children
destroy those like horror but anyways
it's always nice to see a company really
rally behind the educational side of
things rather than just the profit side
of things you know what they spell out
I'm talking about the accessibility
aspect of Windows 10 - you know trying
to make this usable for people with you
know different different use cases
different uh deeds when it comes to
learning absolutely that's that's always
great to see what you think of the
Minecraft uh update that they had I
think that's brilliant the coder thing
yeah yeah that I think it's great I
think it's a great way to get kids to
think about everything that sounds
gateway it is absolutely already a
gateway for kids to kind of learn coding
in a basic way I think this kind of
solidifies it it's like an intermediate
level almost yeah I think Scott Steiner
actually made the point that this is
sort of a gateway to like a are Bicks
reality yeah I notice or the the next
the kind of bridge there I know that's
how I first like got into coding like I
don't know anything about coding now but
I first got interested in it because of
like modifications were like
counter-strike and half-life yeah like
you could go in and like change certain
things I like I mean this that the game
like Minecraft is designed for you to
tweak it grab eyes so it is totally like
just built for the foundation for
basically getting kids a code which is
kind of great
yeah yeah anything to help kids get it's
not quite translating but it's a almost
a transparency yeah it's done it for I
can't come with a better term in gateway
I think they give example of the one
teacher kind of had his kids create this
the colony in Mars yeah a Martian
scenario barcia scenario where that kids
actually debated about resources and how
to like how what would actually go into
a colony that would sustain life on Mars
the only nice the only things that I've
been skeptical about as part of their
whole press conference today were the
Microsoft teams for kids they wouldn't
wear it like I hated group projects in
school you know but like there was
always like such a person that like no
because that was the person was I'm too
busy I can't that was the point was to
charge you how to deal with terrible
people what now just imagine that you
like play along with everyone magic that
but now there's like a chat portion of
it where you're like oh he's not
responding on like video call well no
now you could chant perscription how
about see if he's in slack
not on slash right now I better text
them the only thing that I'm happy about
with that is now there's actual evidence
of you trying to contact like this group
member that you can present to the
teacher you go and like I try yet try
look at all these like pings that I sent
and they just never responded you real
bitter kid I was very bitter because I
have doing all the work and it was
projects and then the other thing was
the the mixed reality headset where they
were saying they gave this example was
like you know sometimes not everybody
can go on field trips and now we're
going on like these field trips through
VR and I'm just like please don't
replace field trips of this this looks
very bad that defeat is the point is to
get out of CS yeah and it you can
understand where the school would be
enticed by the lower price point yes yes
please don't ruin field trips already
chose your Microsoft just shut down all
right let's jump into the chat and get
some responses regarding the $999
surface laptop attic six six two says
only gonna buy it if it comes with a
Mewtwo four fab you two would like the
techie like no people in the Pokemon
look ah did I think about luck
like I like Pokemon so I don't know I
don't know I just couldn't resist that
one uh mark X says why would you waste
your time with a surface laptop when the
surface pro is already so cheap well as
in it cheaper then uh the surface pro is
cheaper yeah actually the laptop the
laptop it's the surface pro is like 800
bucks I think $8.99 yeah yeah yeah solid
hundred bucks off I mean this is like I
can't do rudimentary math this is a full
keyboard right it's a full laptop
experience it's kind of weird because it
with the previous surface devices they
kind of try to go away from like the
traditional laptop right and like you
know they all failed they call fold back
you could write you scribble of them
this was definitely a lot more
traditional it's a bit more like a pure
play laptop which is uh which is kind of
interesting I mean I could understand
them not wanting to have the detachable
one like the surface book is but I don't
get why don't just make it like able to
roll to fold back like I don't know I
released the real tape about a great
question I mean it's got a decent specs
under the hood we were checking those
out earlier on on the show I mean
certainly it's decent under the hood but
they're all fairly decent under the hood
it's really about what your use case
will be sure yeah that
the battery life happy for me that is
sort of the headline over there anyway
oh yeah ours is ridiculous but we'll
wait and see and get our tests on that
before we make any claims yeah at the
very least like the one thing that they
were selling on the stage was how sharp
it looked and it does look sharp I'm
giving that much what do you think of a
fabric I was so weird
it's like I'm intrigued I have a trade
by two cuz like I'm kind of higher like
the aluminum surface the metal surface
of having fabric I don't know what
happens if you spill stuff on your
keyboard
I mean you shouldn't anyway I will
shampoo it yeah yeah uh all right real
quick we'll get back into some older
comments but Matthew doctor isn't
jumping back into the chat we've seen
him more than a few times but thank you
for joining us
man sorry for coming in late we're sorry
for being late
no no it's just a laptop or a two-in-one
that's a lot to distil it has a
touchscreen though yes and is that it's
a powder but it doesn't split now
exactly does it turn into a tablet
anyway yeah I think that's fine like my
my laptop at home is one of those like
foldable ones yeah like you can roll it
back you know and I know but I still use
the touchscreen on him Shran Chanda says
999 is not a good way to compete with
Chromebooks ain't wrong that's the thing
I don't think the surface laptop
competes with a Chromebook I think I
think it's OS is gonna compete with the
exactly reword placed though it's not a
netbook it's not a full-on lap with more
for full on that is where they try to
market it's definitely not gonna compete
with a robo I think it's gonna compete
against what Alfred said the college
touch using that books MacBook Airs
you're looking at a MacBook Air now that
hasn't been really refreshed it's the
specs are a little bit behind now this
thing looks a pretty competitive I mean
sauce thin as a thing that's it's a bit
thicker than that yeah I I let it
definitely is competitive with it I know
for a fact that like college kids
demanded like MacBook Pros to run like
word and it made no sense to me I'm like
you're not editing anything on your look
you're an English major dude what are
you doing yeah but I mean that's the
thing like they have money to spend
right and they want like high-end stuff
my Cleo T is asking is it compatible
with the surface pen yes while we're at
it he's asking us to walk into dangerous
territory would you recommend this over
the MacBook
I mean we haven't got our handles yeah
it's too early to say just seen it so
it's really hard to recommend Dan
Ackerman our are the head of our PC
reviews side I mean so far he likes what
he sees but it's so if there's any
indication from what I've seen from
prior Microsoft events from the surface
studio to the the Pro we've been
impressed so far certainly definitely
whether or not it's better the back book
your buddy board of that book is still
it's still early DVD yeah and of course
there's a lot of subjectivity yeah uh
going back over to the surface laptop
Barozzi Jude says the build quality
dreamy it is pretty nice it is nice it
just I thought that was a good comment I
mean it's okay I'm sure you saw like
panel says yeah I was gonna say is that
I know long long create I don't look
very long preamble about the past should
the soul is law that's his MO it's
always that buttery it's Emily every
time he's so it's not desktop yeah he
just he's so tense uh boy uh fourteen
and a half more like eight already got
doubts about that battery life yeah see
yeah yeah I mean I don't claim we will
do some testing I'd like to see its
battery life I like on Windows 10 as
versus Windows 10 Pro just certainly
yeah yeah a boy also says a better come
with a stylus they better fix the
resolution problems and it should also
come with an Xbox or at least cut price
and loss and I want to million dollars
put stock options three better dates I
would love all that to furnisher
Microsoft like giving up a uh CSF 106
lol no outside apps no buy for me yeah I
mean that is the big sticking point
right it's a very limited controlled
version of Windows and really depend
upon the App Store and we'll see how
many apps actually show up on the App
Store right yeah uh boy follows up with
if you want to lure college kids to buy
them sounds really creepy that's also
kind of yeah that is kind of the point
though yeah from what I understand the
Microsoft App Store is actually pretty
robust right now like I mean they have
Netflix and Chrome and like all these
other I think it's more so it's kind of
like the iOS or like the
droid apps are worth more so it just
need to be vetted by Microsoft before
they put it out there yeah
whereas thing about like in terms of
games and stuff though that's it's gonna
take a little bit longer for those games
to pop up in that store yeah but I mean
they they already have an extensive
catalog of games that like most games
that you would find on like xbox Luther
yeah we've got a lot of questions
filtering through that we really just
don't have the answers to yet people
asking about how it's going to compete
with mac OS and iOS regarding
functionality an iCloud documents and
things like that like we wish we had an
answer for you but it mean we just saw
the thing for the first time today
tonight I mean I have you know looking
into all of this is well created office
yeah right which is cloud-based so okay
that's that's comparable to Google Docs
uh but yeah there's a lot of those
details it's it's still fairly early
days a couple more comments from the
chat before we call today Hamilton Bukka
our ap MacBook Air Wow did Apple cancel
it today that seems like pretty bad fish
I think somebody who's hardcore sold on
that presentation and for the water part
they put on a nice show they did oh
that's what that means a little bit long
yeah a little bit a little bit yeah a
little bit yeah yeah uh and then let's
how I love this Michael Brown her friend
Michael Brown longtime listener sometime
please help me figure this out what year
I'm in Windows is out Appling Apple
glossing over very hard on their own
product here yes yes oh yeah yeah oh
here we go receive I read somewhere that
you could change Windows s to normal
Windows is that true yeah so yes you can
upgrade if you have a Windows 10 s
computer you could pay $50 to upgrade to
the pro edition unless you buy the
surface laptop which the upgrade is free
okay yeah okay so you can't move over to
pro so you have the option all right
haven't I I'm pretty sure like most
people that buy the well--there's laptop
are gonna upgrade yeah yeah real quick
and one last thing before we do wrap it
up Alfred let's expand on Amazon I'm
interested being the hardcore prime user
about this packaging initiative so
basically you pass like showed off with
like the
inventor of bubble wrap at like a
factory in Kentucky in Louisville that
Ben was at what was it yesterday that
yeah that's so instead of like you just
getting like hordes of you know
cardboard boxes in the mail like every
week or so I get box in box then it
drives me nuts yeah oh my god that's
awful
but basically like some kind of like
advanced version of bubble wrap where
they're trying to find out solutions to
get rid of the cardboard box around it
so that they can send people more things
because they're there like right now the
way it is like they're expecting way
more people to be buying things online
in the next few years
yeah no surprise yeah so it's basically
okay it's manageable now but in like by
2020 like if we keep using cardboard
boxes this is it's gonna get bottleneck
so we need to find like a solution to
make like packaging like much easier
yeah yeah so they showed us we called
stealth wrap which is basically just
layers of ultra durable film 29 super
thin layers so there's no box just
really just like ebony fur do we have
any footage of that I do not yet okay
still developing wash a if you scroll
the way to borrow midway through the
story right there that apparently is a
stambha spell/trap so let's take a look
at this it doesn't really show you much
unfortunately from a visual standpoint
but that's what shows a box but I mean
this is great news like this is great
news environmentally yeah from your own
home just now just painted all these
friggin boxes yeah that's kind of great
don't make robot forts out of them but
wait what if you notice my son yeah
what if you need to send something
private what if somebody's order that's
its look you can't it's not like this
guy's selling like a like just whatever
that is I think the stealth wrap is that
like okay no no I think a hard time
seeing it from here myself I think the
idea is like if you have something you
could actually just cover it with sell
the wrap as opposed to a cardboard box
yeah yeah we'll see hmm still try stuff
but know that mommy's well wrap Bubby's
yeah that's still not doing anything as
a protective layer when it comes to
things no I think it's for stuff that
doesn't necessarily eat it though yes
like the one time I ordered a thimble
off of Amazon and they sent me like a
box
eight times its size did you irregular
bull yes whisper song yeah as you just
buy a thimble like it Renee Road store
because you know one for monopoly
because they're all gone
see how I brought that over there we go
all right well that was fun
sorry again we were so late but we're
glad that you joined us and we'll be
back at our normal time tomorrow that's
right maybe maybe maybe
no we'll be here will be here I don't
know what you're planning but I'm gonna
be here you guys are here all right
let's call it a day all right if you
like anything you saw or heard here
check us out on CNET our podcast is also
available on iTunes to knit stitch ur
soundcloud Feedburner and google play
music we will see you all tomorrow
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
