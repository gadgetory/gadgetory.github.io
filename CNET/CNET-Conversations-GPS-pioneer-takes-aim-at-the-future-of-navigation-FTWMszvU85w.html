navigation devices powered by GPS but
honestly they've only been half baked
until now there's a new trend toward now
doing GPS on connected devices that
blend search past preferences and even
your future activities into the task of
getting you where you need to go I'm
Brian Cooley in this episode of seen
that conversations we visit one of the
companies involved in this trend that
also happens to have one of the fathers
of GPS as its chief technology officer
Bob Renard we met up with him at TeleNav
to get his view of the future through
his knowledge of the past so where are
we this is your nun what is that so
we're in the TeleNav network operations
center so the people that work in this
office in this area and there's one
similar this in Shanghai are responsible
for keeping our connected services for
scout up and running they can see how is
the system behaving today versus how did
it behaved yesterday so they can see if
there's any trends they ought to be
worried about this is like sac Omaha 30
years ago we don't have a big red button
but yes you may know the name TeleNav
but they're not as well known to
consumers as Garmin Magellan or tomtom
TeleNav is always focused on the
software and algorithms that make GPS
devices and services work and while the
firm dates back to the beginning of mass
consumer use of GPS sitio Bob Renard
reaches way back before that take me
back GPS started when one someone asked
me what's the name what's the year so
GPS was a name change and it was a build
up like merging some things that the Air
Force did under a project 621 be in 1969
and a similar system that the Navy did
call time a shin in about the same time
frame but it wasn't until nineteen
seventy-two that the DoD said let's put
these two together let's get on with it
the myth about GPS and this goes back to
the very core development back in the
day is that it's watching me so many
fries i think that the satellite is up
here looking down at you and tracking
you that's not how it works is it not at
all so what the satellites do is they
broadcast the message which describes
what at what time a signal is being
brought
test and if you know that time you can
also get some coefficients and say where
would the satellite be at that time and
then the little receiver you have uses
just that information from at least four
satellites and it figures out where it
is and it doesn't tell anything back to
the satellites it's the applications
that bring the location information from
the satellites together with a database
of points of interest and a database of
mapping to produce this product they all
call the GPS and so like in the case of
our product like Scout we do all that on
the back end we have the mapping data
and the points of interest data that can
be dynamically accessed from your phone
as opposed to being resident on it which
allows us to keep Scout up-to-date much
more so than a locked up product you
know it's funny it occurred to me that
maybe they shouldn't be called scout but
sniper because it wants to put a bullet
in the head of three distinct navigation
estates you use today first of all they
have Scout me they would like you to use
that instead of let's say google maps or
mapquest because that's where you would
go on the computer to find things to
share locations and such then of course
a lot of us are going to do navigation
on our phone it's the new portable
navigation device that's where you've
got this Scout app this phone app can
blend the functionality of a weather app
and a mapping app may be a place
recommendation at you know who I'm
talking about it also memorizes your
home and work destinations and always
tells you how far you are from them in
current traffic and then of course once
you put the phone in your pocket and get
in the car that's where Scout automotive
is going to transfer control to the dash
whatever the interface is simple text or
full LCD and then can take advantage of
the vehicles voice command as well as do
things in a contextual way that is safer
and more efficient from while you're
driving I might want to go to the
theater or go to a sports event or go to
a music venue so Scout me our companion
website for scout allows you to go there
and find what's going on around you pick
one you like and then navigate to it
later and also fro your Scout
application you can share it with us
other people you'd like to join you at
that event now TeleNav Scout is part of
a major shift that I've been awaiting in
what is loosely termed the GPS business
you see navigation without search just
isn't making sense to me anymore and
soon navik
nation without personal history
preferences and even prediction will
seem antiquated and laborious to use so
watch telenav android services apple's
new efforts in nav and location and
microsoft's expression of all this in
their new blended windows platform if
you want to follow the major players in
how GPS is evolving however that shakes
out I can't help but see a big upside
for all of us for seeing that
conversations I'm Brian Cooley thanks
