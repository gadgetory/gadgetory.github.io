a look at the Dalek thermomix first
phone from finished manufacturing yard
running sailfish OS now the phone itself
has an unusual design of this two-tone
split going on making a look almost like
two phones that squash together these
backgrounds are interchangeable and have
NFC chips built in allowing different
colors to automatically change themes
and settings when they're applied to
your phone as well as it's amazing
lime-green we've also got quite a nice
orangey red and there's a white option
available too now the phone has a 4.5
inch display with a 960 by 540 pixel
resolution that is a little low and it
does result in small tech some of the
icons looking a little fuzzy it's quite
a chunky phone but I think the stark
design makes it quite attractive volume
and power buttons are on the side but
you're later sir there are no navigation
buttons on the front to getting around
sailfish OS requires you to use various
gestures a double tap will wake the
phone oh I'll show you notifications
slide down and you'll see your recent
apps and if you keep going further still
that will show you all apps installed
now to return home from an app you just
swipe in from the left and that will
place the app in the multitasking panel
and going through menus simply swiping
back will return you to the previous
page it's a fairly attractive interface
that there will be is big learning curve
for those of you use of a simplicity of
iOS now one of the big issues with any
new operating system is a lack of apps
the sailfish actually supports Android
apps although you can't access the
Google Play Store there are third-party
app stores available where you can find
titles like Spotify Skype also got
Twitter LinkedIn and that you know you
see YouTube there are plenty more
available as well including whatsapp
messenger and viber well you can't get
everything you find but the funders that
are already so many Android apps means
it's got a better
election band blackberry tenders now the
elephone is certainly unusual and it
might appeal to those of you looking for
something a bit different from the usual
iPhone and Android phone to see around
phone is currently being shipped out
today leaked through other customers
across Europe for 399 euros
although Yana couldn't say when it will
be available anywhere else so make sure
to keep it seeing it for all the latest
news and leave your thoughts on the
phone in the comments below I'm a Jew ho
ho and this is the yalla phone running
sailfish OS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
