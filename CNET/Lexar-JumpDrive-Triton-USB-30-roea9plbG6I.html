Foster calm and
today I have a thumb drive to show you
this is Alexa jump drive try it on now
this is not a regular thumb drive that
you've seen everywhere this is something
you actually want to have and there are
few reasons first it's made a very nice
shiny metal alloy case and on top here
is made of plastic is also very shiny
and nice on this end here you can see a
hook now this hope to allow you to use
the included lender to hook it to a
keychain as you see is the pretty good
with my the opener here note however the
housing of the dry is acceptable to
scratch it so you don't want to bundle
it with too many keys now on the other
end is the USB head if you take a closer
look is has a blue on blue color on it
and that means it's support USB 3.0
which is much faster than USB 2.0 now
the dry also work with used to be to
point out but you want to use it with
USB 3.0 and again the blue is the sub
USB 3.0 for example this is a card here
the add-in card you can use with a
desktop to add it used to be through
panel to it notice how is how the blue
head the car is not included by the way
this USB head here is easily retractable
or extent now this very night is I to
keep its safe on top here the dry has
only one small tiny early light that's
only visible when lit when the early
light is solid white it means the dryer
is plucking empowered when it's flashing
this mean there's some data going back
and forth now all of those thing
actually very nice and cool with it one
more thing by the dry that makes you
want to buy it I'll take a close look
here it is one of a very few if not the
only one I've seen that is not made in
China instead is a product of USA now
that might or might not make it a better
device but hey it makes you feel more at
home now the question is how much have
to pay for it now this one is 32 gig and
it's got about eighty dollars if you
want something up 64 gig which is to cap
a capacity that is too hot
dollars there's also another 16 gig
version that is about seventy dollars
now that's not cheap but for I'd rather
offer you the good look good function
and it's made in America I think it's
worth it once again my name is dango and
this has been the first look at the jump
drive right on from Alexa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
