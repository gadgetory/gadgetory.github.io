speed bump Wow like that like I said my
cameraman sitting next to me you guys in
his flipping out so what do you get when
you combine Italian styling with just a
little bit of eco-consciousness
no it's not that green pasta that we all
love so much it's this the 2015 Fiat
500e and that's right it's electric baby
Fiat says that ugliness is the worst
pollution of all and frankly I tend to
agree with them there's no reason that
V's need to look space-age there are a
few tweaks on the body of the Fiat that
the eagle-eyed might see like a lower
front fascia and rear spoiler for better
air oh and a rear diffuser but beyond
that and some simple 500 badging the
electric version looks just like the
gas-powered 500s so like a giant roller
skate so how does it all work well first
of all we get rid of this trend piece of
plastic because we don't need it and
I've got a high-voltage lithium-ion
battery here I've got my regular battery
that just powers all my accessories and
then tucked underneath that is the
electric motor now here is where all the
magic happens this is the inverter what
that does is that inverts that see what
I did there that inverts the DC power
from the battery into AC power that the
electric motor wants and that will give
you a range of 87 miles per charge
but of course this baby needs some juice
right there's a couple different ways
you can do that the first way is through
just a regular 110 volt outlet that is
just what you would find in your home so
you just plug this guy in and then you
just plug this guy in and simple but
you're going to have to wait 24 hours
for a full charge another way to do it
is via a level-two charger and that is
like you would find in your washer and
dryer 240 volts you need to install a
power unit in your home for about two
thousand dollars but that will allow you
to charge the car to a full charge in
four hours
now unfortunately the Fiat 500e does not
support the high-speed the level three
charging which would charge it up in
about a half an hour boo boo boo boo but
the good news is the battery is covered
by an eight year limited warranty and
you can charge this from the mid-cycle
all the way up full and it will not
diminish your battery life now you've
only got seven cubic feet of space back
here that is less than the regular 500
so what does it mean for my trademark
laundry basket rating well looks like I
can shove two in there but don't think
the door is going to close so trademark
laundry basket rating of zero but don't
despair you can fold those receipts down
and get about 26 cubic feet of space now
the interior of the cabin is pretty
sparse and unfortunately you got a lot
of plasticky materials but in terms of
the tech they've kind of taken a
cafeteria approach and that you've got a
big plate and maybe a couple of
different small plates to make a whole
meal now my big plate is right here in
the center and that's what gives me all
the information about what I need to see
while I'm driving then I've got some
little plates now one of them is a
TomTom navigation system which
unfortunately our test model didn't come
with for some reason but that would sit
right here right in your line of sight
and when most people use navigation on
their phone anyway it's kind of a wonder
why fiat still offers the TomTom but
right in here I do have the blue and me
system it's pretty easy to hook up your
cell phone and the sound quality is
pretty good there's no HD radio but
there is Sirius XM satellite radio which
is awesome when you have to sit in
traffic
but does that range live up to the hype
well my first time in the car I've made
an 11 mile commute that dropped my
perceived range by 3 miles but on the
reverse that dropped my range by 36
miles
so essentially 87 mile range is 87 ish
miles okay it's all going to depend on
road conditions traffic conditions and
driving style but here's what's great I
have a hundred and forty-seven
pound-feet of torque and that is all
instantly available going through the
front wheels so that means I just mash
the gas and it's right there it isn't so
much fun and that's what makes this car
really cool to drive around in the city
I've only got one forward gear here I
just press D on the push button in the
middle here and I just go you can't get
a six-speed manual so I can't even give
you guys props about when you choose the
manual over choosing their automatic
because this is all you got I do have a
hundred and eleven horsepower which is
more than the regular Fiat 500 but it is
significantly less than the turbo model
but it still is enough to propel me up
to 70 miles an hour out on the highway
maybe even a little bit faster if you
want to take your life in your hands
just a bit but I have great really quick
steering it's an electric setup but the
feel is nice and heavy and I've got this
short little wheelbase which means that
driving through the city taking turns
accelerating out of them is a lot of fun
I'm going to go out on a limb and say
that this car next to the a bar is the
most fun Fiat 500 that you can drive
so how much is this going to cost you
well the 2015 Fiat 500e starts at thirty
one thousand eight hundred dollars which
is a lot but you do get a seventy five
hundred dollar federal rebate and then
depending on where you live you can save
up to fourteen thousand dollars on this
car that's right that's like there's
like two European no three European
vacations of course there are other
options out there for example the spark
TV gives you twice as much to work and
it starts at five thousand dollars in
less that's it for now thanks so much
for watching I'm Emmy Hall hey be sure
to find me and CNET on all those crazy
social medias see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
