need some help deciding on the right
tech gifts for your friends and family
or even for yourself well get ready to
feast your eyes on our favorite gift
options for the holiday season the cnet
tech review Black Friday buyers guide
starts right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line at
least that's what we usually do on the
tech review but this is our black friday
special so it's all good all the time
this week we're wrapping up our top
picks from the cnet holiday gift guide
and showing them off under the product
spotlight so let's get right to it on
with the good our first product
spotlight showcases what happens to be
the most expensive item on our list 3d
TV was a hot topic this year but not
everyone is sold on the concept just yet
that didn't stop Panasonic's 3d Viera
line from topping our year-end TV list
though here's David Katz my earth to
tell you all about it hi I'm David Katz
meijer from cnet.com and this is the
panasonic tc-p VT 20 / 25 series this is
our holiday pick is the top overall TV
for a 2010
this is Panasonic's flagship TV for the
year and it's also 3d television we'll
get to all that in a little bit but
first it's worth taking a look at
styling this set Panasonic went very
conservative around the edge of the TV
you'll find the standard glossy black
although it's actually a little bit
bronze colored and there's a swivel
stand here and some chrome accents but
otherwise it's not really more
remarkable than a lot of the other TVs
out there turn to the side you can see
it's definitely not an LED TV this is a
plasma it's about three and a half
inches thick but of course still plenty
thin for most people it's definitely a
flat panel as I mentioned one of the
principal capabilities of the set is 3d
it comes with one pair of 3d glasses
additional pairs run 100 to 150 bucks
apiece and of course you need one for
each family member but once your
family's equipped with those glasses and
you put in some 3d content this TV does
a pretty darn good job of displaying
it's a 3ds very impressive looking it's
also has fewer artifacts than a lot of
the other 3d TVs on the market of course
it's excellent performance with 2d also
translates pretty well over into 3d the
downside the Panasonic lacks the 2d to
3d conversion found on a lot of the
other 3d TVs on the market but really
don't think that's that big of a deal if
you want to turn your 2d into 3d we
found some issues doing that with some
processing out there so we don't really
miss it slide for 3d other features on
this TV include the internet capability
offered by VIERA CAST you can use that
service to access Netflix videos as well
as Amazon video on demand Twitter even
skype if you buy an optional
speakerphone attachment doesn't have
quite as many content options or quite
as much customization as a lot of the
other competitors but it's still pretty
good for your basic streaming services
panasonic also threw in a good selection
of picture controls although again
there's not as many options as found on
an LG or a samsung of those competitors
but does offer the capability to play
around with things like gamma and color
temperature we also appreciate the THX
mode on this TV was excellent again you
can kind of put in THX mode and forget
it for a lot of your critical viewing
for movies and such speaking of critical
viewing we really didn't think this was
the best overall performing TV this year
I it's real strength is black level
performance now panasonic in the past
has had some issue with the black level
actually getting a little bit lighter
over the lifespan of the TV we tested
this one over the course of 2010 and it
does actually get lighter but not to
nearly same
extent as the others and again when it
levels off it's still really the best on
the market in terms of achieving those
nice deep blacks so we really don't
think the black level fate is anything
to worry about on this TV THX mode does
offer excellent color accuracy you get a
great skin tones and excellent primary
and secondary colors TV also has very
good video processing it handles 1080p
24 correctly although we did see some
slight artifacts in that mode so purists
might want to keep it at the 1080p 60
mode you do have that choice as you
mentioned 3d performance is another
strength on this TV it's crosstalk was
among the best we've seen which means
that it doesn't have very many ghostly
outlines that are seen on some of the
other competitors around 3d objects also
that black level and color accuracy
translates very nicely into 3d although
it's not quite as accurate as some of
the Samsung models we saw connectivity
on the Panasonic is very good you got
four total HDMI inputs three on the back
and one on the side two component video
inputs of PC and put two USB ports and
even an SD card slot in addition to this
land port for the wired ethernet
connection overall the panasonic VT
20-25 series while pretty darn expensive
is the best overall performance today
2010 and that's why it's our pic is the
best TV for holiday shopping this year
maybe it's best to just think of 3d is
an added bonus rather than the main
reason to buy a new TV but if you think
it's time to dive into the 3d world the
panasonic viera is tough to beat but
maybe you're happy with the TV you
already have so how about this gift idea
to help you get more out of it the sony
playstation 3 slim much more than just a
gaming console the ps3 could easily
become the center of your home theater
experience brian song here with cnet com
and we're signing the product spotlight
bright on the sony playstation 3 slim
now the ps3 claims it only does
everything so we want to dig in and see
if that holds true now cosmetically this
is a lot sleeker console from its
predecessor gone is the shiny black
piano finish which I miss a lot and it's
replaced by this duller textured surface
and a metal accent on the front we like
how they trimmed off the fat but it's
lost some of its sex appeal at the same
time under the hood this current ps3
slim is a beast the standard 299 model
is loaded with a 160 gig hard drive it's
bringing a blu-ray drive for movies in
gaming you'll have built-in Wi-Fi
Bluetooth support for accessories and
the two USB ports in the front you'll
also have easier access to the hard
drive that's user upgradeable without
voiding the warranty on the back you'll
see the same connections as before
there's an Ethernet port HDMI video port
digital audio out and Sony's AV cable
connection for component or composite
now the ps3 flexes its technical muscle
with exclusive titles like the accident
venture treasure hunting exploits of
nathan drake and uncharted two or the
over-the-top blood-soaked battles in god
of war 3 playing online games through
the playstation network is absolutely
free and that's a price that you can't
beat sony is also getting into the
motion gaming market with our
PlayStation Move controllers and games
the tech is more accurate than
Nintendo's Wii butter remains to be seen
how this will translate to more hardcore
titles now if you're not looking for a
gaming system it's still an excellent
multimedia system it's one of our
top-rated blu-ray players here at cnet
it up scales standard DVDs you can
purchase movies or rent them through the
PlayStation Store and it's currently the
first device to support netflix with
1080p streaming and 5.1 surround sound
there are things the ps3 slim doesn't
have there's no IR port to use universal
remotes with it you won't be able to
play your old ps2 games on the console
because they've removed the backwards
compatibility and sony has broken the
hearts of hackers by removing the
ability to install another operating
system like Linux on its box but for 299
this is the best value in home
entertainment that's also prepared for
the future with software updates and a
built-in blu-ray player that separates
it from any other console I'm Brad Tom
for cnet com with your product spotlight
on the sony ps3 slim blu-ray netflix
movie rentals and tons of gaming titles
the only reason you need to get off the
couch is for PlayStation Move games or
maybe to go for a walk once in a while
alright the ps3 wasn't the only one of
our top picks that slimmed down this
year the new streamlined 11 inch apple
macbook air blurs the line between
laptop and netbook and it looks good
doing it too i'm dan ackerman and as
apple's new 11-inch macbook air is one
of the snazziest most popular laptops of
the holiday season we're going to shine
it under the harsh glare of the product
spotlight
now 11 inch laptops have really become
very popular in the latter half of 2010
originally they were offshoots of 10
inch in town Adam netbooks kind of
low-power low-cost systems but now you
have 11 inch laptops with dual core
ultra low voltage CPUs that are nearly
as powerful and nearly as full-featured
as regular 14 15 inch or even larger
laptops Apple's 11-inch MacBook Air is
the latest version of that super thin
series from Apple if you remember the
original macbook air it was not
rightfully sell for only having one USB
port the new version actually doubles at
22 you're still missing basics like an
SD card slot on the 11 intrusion there's
actually an SD card slot on the 13 inch
version of the macbook air now in the
11-inch macbook air you get an intel
core 2 duo cpu and nvidia is basic 320
graphics that's actually very similar to
what you'd find in the basic 999 white
macbook although this is a low voltage
version of that processor which do get
however is a pretty decent graphics for
it not truly discrete graphics and
enough processing power to do basic
chance like word processing and web
surfing and streaming video and pretty
much what you want to do with your
laptop nine to nine percent of the time
one of the most interesting things about
this new MacBook Air is this is the
first MacBook with a 16 by 9 display
which is pretty much what you find in
any other type of laptop it's a 1366 x
768 display actually the 13-inch macbook
air along with the other macbooks still
have 16 x 10 displays if this looks very
familiar that's because it's got the
same flat key widely spaced keyboard
that you see on other macbooks along the
same large multi-touch trackpad it's
almost as big as the ones on the 13 inch
macbooks and of course it's got all
those cool multi-touch features like
using the four finger swipe here to get
to all your windows pretty much new pc
laptops have a touchpad that is as
intuitive and works as smoothly with
multi-touch gestures of course one of
the reasons you really want to get a
macbook airs because they're so slim and
so sleek this guy is about point six
eight inches thick in the back about
point 11 inches in the front and when
you open it up it wakes up from a sleep
state very quickly in fact it even turns
on from a full stop almost as fast if
you're thinking that this new smaller
screen size makes it look a little bit
like an ipad just with a keyboard
attached
well that actually makes sense Apple is
taking some of that iOS development and
moving it into the macbook line in the
case of the new MacBook Airs you can
actually close the lid it'll go into a
super low power standby state and you
can leave it for up to 30 days without
fully draining the battery i'm dan
ackerman and that's the new 11-inch
macbook air it's really hard to grasp
just how thin the macbook air is until
you see it in person and in fact we
recommend checking out most products in
the store before you buy them even if
you plan on purchasing online all right
our next category digital cameras I like
the idea of a camera as a gift because
you can open up the box and just start
using your present to capture memories
of the event after you charge the
batteries of course here's Josh Goldman
with our favorite snapshot shooter of
the year hi i'm josh golden senior
editor for scenic views and this is a
look at the sony cybershot DSC w350 it's
our top digital camera gift pick for the
holidays
while there are certainly a lot of
cameras we could have gone with we think
the w350 strikes an excellent balance of
design features shooting performance and
photo quality for its price this 14
megapixel ultra compact features a nice
26 millimeter equivalent wide-angle f27
lens 4x zoom with optical image
stabilization and a bright 2.7 inch LCD
all packed into a body that's no bigger
than a deck of cards and it's available
in four colors silver black blue and
pink the W 350s controls and shooting
options are basic and uncomplicated on
top is the power button and shutter
release with the rest of the controls
here on back everything's pretty
straightforward so just about anyone can
start shooting with it right out of the
box a switch here on the right lets you
choose your shooting modes for still
photos there's Sony's reliable
intelligent auto program auto for those
that want a little more control and
several same modes including one tuned
for use under water with an optional
housing there's an easy mode to that
locks down all but a couple settings and
enlarges on-screen text making it
perfect for newbies if you like to take
panorama is that w350 makes it easy with
a sweet panorama just press the shutter
release and sweep the camera and the
w350 will create a panorama shot in the
camera of course there's a movie mode on
the camera to that can record at 720p HD
quality and you have use of the optical
zoom lens while recording there's even
software embedded in the camera's memory
that helps you share your photos and
videos online when the camera is
connected to a computer photo quality
overall is very good up to iso 400 but
photos were usable even at ISO 800 and
to some degree ISO 1600 so this camera
is able to take decent photos in less
than ideal lighting and while it's
shooting performance can be a bit slow
shot to shot it has a low shutter lag so
you'll have a better chance
of actually getting the shot you want
being so small it's rechargeable battery
is tiny and doesn't last long so you
might want to pick up an extra battery
plus no memory cards are included but it
does take both Sony's memory stick pro
duo cards as well as more standard SD
cards all this adds up to make the w350
a great pick for a pocket camera the
w350 is very much a point-and-shoot
though so if you've got someone on your
list that's looking for special features
or manual or semi manual controls check
out the other digital camera holiday
gift recommendations i'm josh golden and
that's a closer look at the sony
cyber-shot w350 now this camera is
available in other colors than pink but
personally I say go for it so cute I'd
still haven't found what you're looking
for we're not done yet we have a couple
more gift ideas coming up right after
the break see you in a bit when the cnet
tech review continues
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV and
this week our holiday tech buying guide
continuing on in the good these days
tablet sorry readers and e-readers or
tablets but Amazon's Kindle is holding
firm it's for books here's why we still
like that the Kindle is the e-reader
that launched the category but will it
get buried in an avalanche of tablets hi
i'm molly wood from cnet and I'm putting
the product spotlight on the amazon
kindle three these days the kindle is
starting to feel like the last man
standing in the e-reader department
barnes and noble revamped its nook to
add a color LCD screen newspaper and
magazine subscriptions and the android
operating system people are using their
iPads as readers and bigger numbers than
ever expected and a new generation of
tablets like the Samsung Galaxy Tab are
similarly sized but offer a lot more
features so can the Kindle still compete
wall in a word yes there's a lot to be
said for a gadget that does one thing
and does it well and the kindle three is
still the best at what it does the
latest version of the kindle improved
the already good 6 inch e-ink display
which looks incredibly like text on a
page it's also easier on your eyes than
a backlit LCD at least for many people
and it's certainly the only thing that's
readable in direct sunlight so the
Kindle still wins for best beach book
this third generation is also smaller
and lighter than the previous models
it's probably lighter than a paperback
in fact it's so holdable amazon also
improved the speed of the page turns
with this model and it made the page
turn buttons a lot smaller and less
intrusive giving the whole thing a much
more sleek appearance the kindle three
also has a better browser although it's
still rudimentary at best it has
Wikipedia access and a new built-in PDF
reader that supports password protected
pdfs and amazon has added the ability to
share books if the publisher will allow
it you can lend someone a book from your
shelf for up to 14 days now that was a
big feature on the nook and it's a
great thing for the kindle to have plus
you're not going to find this battery
life on a tablet any tablet with the
wireless turned off you get up to a
month of battery time the Kindle still
has built-in 3g amazon calls it the
whispernet for downloading books on the
fly but they've also built in Wi-Fi now
and you can buy a cheaper Wi-Fi only
version of the Kindle if you think
you'll mainly shop for books at home or
at public hot spots now the Wi-Fi only
model is nice because Wi-Fi is often
faster than cellular access but also
because that model is extremely
affordable it's just a hundred and forty
bucks and the Wi-Fi + 3g model is 190
dollars those are good prices but as the
e-reader wars keep on raging you can
expect even those to get lower over time
an Amazon's book selection still the
best in the game there are almost
700,000 titles available and even though
you'll still find some books that are
dead tree only almost all the new books
and best sellers are right there in the
kindle store and your purchases are
portable because amazon has made the
kindle software available on almost
every other platform you can download it
for free on android iOS blackberry
windows phone 7 and on and on and on now
you could argue that the standalone
ereader is a dying breed but we think
there's still a place for a single
purpose device like the kindle as long
as it's affordable portable and flexible
and the kindle three still pretty much
meets all those requirements if you're a
digital era bookworm to read our full
review of the amazon kindle three go to
cnet com and search for kindle for cnet
com i'm molly wood and let's be honest
140 bucks for a Wi-Fi only kindle is a
very doable gift idea but if you're the
type to splurge and you want to more do
it all experience well there's still
that old standby the ipad if there's one
new tech product that defined our year
is this the Apple iPad I'm Donald Bell
here to shine the product spotlight on
this game-changing tablet
the iPad debuted April of 2010 and
immediately reset everyone's idea of
what a tablet should be there are two
main models of the iPad one that
connects to the internet using a combo
of Wi-Fi and 3G from AT&amp;amp;T and one that
relies just on Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi models
are priced at four ninety nine for 16
gigabytes 599 over 32 and 699 for 64
models with 3g are available in the same
capacities but are priced at one hundred
and thirty dollars higher out of the box
you get the ipad a wall adapter and USB
cable headphones cases docks are all
sold separately and are all worthwhile
investments looking at the iPad itself
the design is constructed entirely of
glass and aluminum giving it a field
that's closer to a macbook then to an
iphone it's 7.5 inches wide 9.5 inches
tall and just a half an inch thick with
the diagonal screen size of nine point
seven inches on the bottom you have a
dock connector and a speaker along the
home button the slightest volume buttons
and a mute switch and at the top you
have the headphone jack a little pinhole
microphone and the screen lock button
compared to a smartphone or a dedicated
ebook reader is not the lightest thing
at 1.5 pounds but it's lighter and more
convenient than a laptop and that oddly
enough gets us to the heart of what
makes the iPad great it holds its own
between the smart phone and a laptop
without making you think why am i
bothering with this when I can just be
using a smartphone or a laptop it sounds
obvious but it's something that the
competition hasn't been able to
reproduce they go smaller or bigger but
we just keep coming back to the iPad so
getting past the design what's the iPad
actually good for starting with the
stock apps you get email a web browser
youtube maps videos music calendar notes
contacts and photos all of which have
been optimized for the iPads large
screen you'll find similar apps on
competing products but you won't find
these here you have links to the itunes
store and the ios app store in a way you
can boil down the success of the iphone
the ipad and the ipod touch to these two
killer apps
with itunes you get direct access to the
world's largest and most popular digital
music store along with movies and TV
shows that you need to buy or rent and a
great selection of podcasts audiobooks
and free educational content all of this
content downloads directly to your
device with no need to connect to a
computer more importantly you have the
App Store which gives you access to
hundreds of thousands of third-party
applications and games that can mold the
iPad into tons of different uses if you
want to use the iPad as an e-book reader
you can download apples on iBooks app or
the Amazon Kindle reader the barnes
noble nook reader or even an app for
comic books that's just one example but
Apple really does have an app for just
about every interest and that's a big
part of the iPads appeal now there have
been a few changes to the iPad since we
first showed it off in April of 2010
after the update to iOS 4.2 the ipad now
shares most of the features found on the
iphone 4 including folders multitasking
TV show rentals printer support and a
new wireless streaming feature called
airplay if you like staying organized
the folder feature lets you group apps
together under a custom label the
multitasking capability allows you to
run multiple apps at the same time and
quickly jump back and forth between the
currently running apps it's great for
productivity but it's also fun just to
listen to pandora radio while reading an
e-book TV show rentals which came to the
iphone the ipod touch in September are
now finally on the iPad offering tons of
popular shows for as little as 99 cents
per episode if you have an AirPrint
compatible printer you can now print
email photos web pages and I works
documents wirelessly from your iPad and
if you own one of apple's $99 Apple TVs
or you're thinking about getting one the
iPads new airplay feature lets you send
your videos photos and music straight to
your TV over your home network add it
all up and you have an awesome product
that just keeps getting better it's also
one of those few tech products that we
feel good about recommending across the
board whether you're a gadget fanatic or
someone who typically shiz away from
computers it's worth giving the iPad a
try so that's the ipad from apple it's
seen its top pick for tablets and it's
also one of the most talked about
gadgets of the year and more than
anything it's a lot of fun so for cnet
com i'm donald
so I guess it wouldn't be a tech review

times sake let's take a look at this
