wearable startup meta contributes his
fair share I want to change the way we
use computers and I think I have a
really compelling vision of the future a
lot of people are buying into it this is
gribbit TSA's future forward device meta
space glasses a pair of augmented
reality specs that layer digital
information and content that users can
manipulate over their field of vision
meta an analogy has a stereoscopic pair
of glasses with a projector that
projects to each I allowing for a 3d
screen that wraps around the entire
world and the analogy to the mouse and
keyboard is this camera that can track
the edges of your fingers and their
location in space at really high
dexterity and low latency in a video
highlighting how the glasses might be
used meta presents a mind-boggling world
where free-floating virtual shapes can
be molded then actually produced with 3d
printers and details like names and job
titles pop up as you meet people
watching this it's easy to be odd yet
also hard not to be skeptical but during
a recent visit to their makeshift
headquarters in the los altos hills we
experience some of these demos firsthand
ok they look a step back with backing
from venture fund y combinator meta is
off to a strong start it's received
pre-orders from 1300 developers that
want to get their hands on the glasses
Architects looking to create 3d models
collaboratively that'll be the first
collaborative computer they're surgeons
who want to track cat-scans to the body
and sort of rotate them with their hands
in 3d as they perform surgery because
their hands are bloody so they couldn't
touch an iPad I mean there's so many use
cases that are coming in and surprising
us meta success will in part hinge on a
robust app store and there are other
non-trivial hurdles the prototype is a
bit on the bulky side but metas goal is
to shrink down the technology so that
ultimately the device is the size of a
pair of ray
all this reminded us of another tech
companies wearable device google glass
though gribbit seeeeee doesn't see the
similarities we're not competing with a
multi-billion dollar company they create
a very different type of device than
ours so their device is what I call a
notification machine okay it's a small
screen in the corner of your eye that
you can only interact with with your
voice or Y by swiping the side of your
head meta bills its device as a natural
machine that's more intuitive we use the
thing that I was evolved to manipulate
your environment namely your hand and
it's just so much more immersive than
Google glass so I think it's gonna bare
different use cases from its home base
meta has sweeping views of Silicon
Valley you have a little apple over
there in the distance little Google over
there we could see all the way to San
Francisco a perspective that inspires
Griffiths and reminds him exactly what
he's up against in San Francisco I'm
