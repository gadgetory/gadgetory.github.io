play this a little segment where cnet
editors and GameSpot editors tell you
what to play this week I have been
playing a life is strange i just
finished the third episode and it is
well worth the play because it's got an
epic narrative that is just getting more
complicated and exciting i'll be playing
a crapload of split team that's the team
is one of the greatest games i've ever
played it what's up i'm playing project
cars on the pc on this sweet
thrustmaster steering wheel but what I'm
really playing at home is a Tokyo jungle
on the PlayStation for the PlayStation
now they're weird playstation 3
streaming service which costs 1999 a
month I'm playing a game called I am
bread and it's actually a pretty amazing
game it's a lot of fun it's the most fun
I've ever had playing a bread video game
it's beige stop the butterfly effect
principle where the littlest actions can
change a huge number of things and it's
got personating game mechanics and it is
a really cool place so it's a shooter
except everything's colorful and totally
up with you to play and the best thing
about it like magically last three
minutes so it's got that Moorish factor
so yeah squids and kids quite a lot of
money to basically be a Pomeranian in
Tokyo but personally I think it's worth
it i'm really not to question that all
of us have to answer for ourselves the
object is you have to move this slice of
bread through a level and get it to the
toaster so the bread could become toast
that sounds crazy when I say it out loud
but it's actually a lot of fun go check
it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
