$1,000 or more but how about a tea maker
meet the $1500 tea forea infusers yes
$1500 so what do you get for $1,500 well
you get a handsome design it's not
exactly what I would call extremely
high-end its plastic which is a bummer
for the price but it does do everything
automatically and it's easy to clean
which is definitely a plus
it's not all plastic though the carafe
is glass as well as the infusing orb the
circular chamber where you actually brew
the tea the infuser is also packed with
some pretty sophisticated technology it
has Wi-Fi so it connects to your network
you can also control it via a mobile
application and that will be able to let
you know what T is in your pantry as
well as order more tea directly through
tea forea each packet you buy from T
forea also has RFID technology so that
you can tap it on the top of the machine
and that allows you to basically prove
everything automatically the machine
will know exactly what to do without you
having to do anything the machine is
also designed to do something called
micro infusion essentially water goes up
and down and steeps tea multiple times
just to pull out the perfect flavor and
all the taste that you want to get out
of the tea without any of the nasty
stuff all that aside this machine is
still extremely expensive so that is
probably the biggest drawback of this
device also you don't really have much
control over how you brew your tea it
just does it based on what type of tea
you tell it that you're going to
actually use so while the tea foria can
brew a very good cup of tea it's not
$1500 good
you're better off spending your money
elsewhere
