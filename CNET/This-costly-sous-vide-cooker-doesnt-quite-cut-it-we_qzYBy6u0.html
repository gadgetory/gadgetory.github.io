seenot appliances here with the caso
sous-vide Center model number SV 1000 so
if you aren't familiar with sous-vide
it's basically a fancy sounding name for
sticking food in a vacuum seal bowl bag
sealing it up sticking it in water
heated to a specific temperature and
letting it cook gently over an extended
period of time so if you're someone who
has a very specific way you like to
prepare your steak but you have trouble
getting it right every single time on
the grill or in the oven this could help
remedy that but there are a few
drawbacks to this specific design first
this thing is pretty big like the size
of a small toaster oven so if you're
just looking to dabble in sous-vide this
kind of stainless steel cube is going to
leave a pretty big footprint on your
counter also it's really expensive it
costs $500 so again if you're just
looking to get an introductory course in
sous-vide this is a pretty big price to
pay we also notice that the target
temperature say I wanted to cook
something at 135 degrees doesn't
actually match the temperature of the
water in the cooker it's actually three
to four degrees below that temperature
so if you're expecting a certain result
you'll be disappointed right away you'll
need to actually adjust up so say 137
138 or even 139 degrees to get the
result that you were expecting
even with this temperature disparity
this thing did a pretty good job of
cooking it did cook consistently I made
a bunch of eggs I made salmon steak and
pork spareribs and everything came out
fine but like I said slightly
undercooked I also really like that it
has a built-in vacuum sealer that's
worked really well and a hose in the
back so that you can drain the water
instead of having to physically lift
this thing up and dump it into your sink
after each use I also really like that
this cooker has a built-in circulator so
it'll actually circulate the water
around to help maintain a consistent
temperature so even though it didn't
stick at the perfect target temperature
of say 135 degrees it did perfectly
maintain 100
- or 131 so if you are looking to get
into sous-vide for the first time I
would actually suggest an immersion
model like the ANOVA one this is a
handheld device that you stick inside an
existing stock pot so it won't take up
as much space and it was just as
accurate if not more accurate than this
model if you do want a water bath model
say you really are sure that you're
going to cook regularly with sous-vide I
would suggest looking elsewhere thank
you for watching this review of the caso
sous-vide supreme model number SP 1000
