the actual Mille Miglia requires it
teamed up with the Caledonian classic
and historic motorsport club to create a
mini miglia of sorts not only would I
get the chance to spend some time with
the glorious c-type I'll be driving
across Italy but also with its owner and
my co-driver then I the car is one of
the first production ctypes made and is
running about 285 brake horsepower it
has a race history though never raced at
the mille in its heyday then however has
raced it a fair bit in the 26 years he's
owned it I've driven a seat height
before and I'm well aware of two things
one how much they're worth and two how
very different they are to the kind of
cars unused to the gearbox is tricky the
steering heavy throttle response amazing
but the Briggs not so much oh and the
clutch is really springy so the cars a
bit tricky but nowhere near as difficult
as the drive you see the mini and by
extension Mille Miglia isn't a race but
a rally a rally that requires perfect
timing talent endurance and skill
there's three main things to look out
for the first is the root book confusing
right well one very similar is going to
be our Bible in Italy it shows us how
far we should have gone how far since
the last direction and what we need to
look out for to show we've been there
the second are the control stages you've
got to drive as smoothly as possible at
a certain speed over a set distance easy
in something modern less so when you
target speeds in kilometers an hour and
your speedos over 50 years old and works
in miles the final bits the real killer
the regularity stages like the controls
you have to maintain an average speed
over a set distance within a larger
stage and it's time so they know exactly
when you're mucking about
unlike my last trip to Italy this isn't
a point-to-point Blair this is going to
require real concentration we practice
for an afternoon while the Millie will
be four solid days of driving the mini
media what I thought was going to be
quite entertaining and you know very
jolly he is going to be that but it's
also going to be a serious amount of
work and concentration and you know what
I can't wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
