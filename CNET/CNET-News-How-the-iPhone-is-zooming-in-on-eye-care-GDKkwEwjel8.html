seen these devices I can see his retina
now I can see his optic nerve his macula
and in his retina to closely examine a
patient's eye doctors use indirect
ophthalmoscope s-- and slit-lamp
instruments so it's an excellent device
but it does not let you do is take
pictures if he has some complex findings
we spend a lot of time describing it in
words and then the next person who sees
the record has to take what I've written
and then form a picture in their head
it's an inefficient practice so a team
of ophthalmologist at Stanford
University came up with another solution
involving their smartphones we developed
an adapter called the I go adapter that
we designed so that we can easily take
photos of the front and back of the eye
I go makes use of items and
ophthalmologists likely already owns a
condensing lens and an iPhone that also
keeps costs low the early estimate is
under $100 by comparison
these instruments run thousands of
dollars the lens is held in front of the
phone at the intra start distance and it
takes up at the center of the screen and
now we're ready to take a picture of
Alex's I can see here this is the optic
nerve right in the middle or actually
off to the side and then there are
vessels that come off of it and then
here is this macula this is what we call
the posterior pole the inventors aren't
claiming that I go replaces
sophisticated medical equipment but it
does offer a way to screen patients in
places with limited healthcare
facilities and we'd be able to figure
out what's going on with the eye with
these photos things like conjunctivitis
corneal ulcers maybe some things like
diabetic retinopathy hemorrhages in the
back of the eye the ophthalmologists
also developed software so images can be
shared securely and privately with other
physicians combined with the adapter the
technology holds enormous potential you
can make the diagnosis of diabetic
retinopathy for instance very very
easily on an image just like the ones
that we can take and in doing that you
can save literally the site of millions
of people over the course of a
several years the team's next step FDA
approval for the I go to make that
vision a reality in Palo Alto California
