how-to contributor today I'm going to
show you how to create photo albums in
iOS 5 now keep in mind this is a
Developer Preview and things may change
between now and the initial release this
fall if that happens we'll be sure to
update this video as well as this post
now let's jump in and learn how to make
a photo well there's a couple different
ways of creating a photo album on your
device first thing we'll need to do is
go into our Photos app and here we can
tap on the edit key up in the top right
hand corner and then tap on add create a
title for your photo album and hit save
what it does is it brings up all your
pictures that you could then scroll
through and select and once you've
selected all the pictures that you want
to put into your newly created album you
just tap on done you'll see a new album
pop up with how many pictures you've
just put into that album another way to
do that is to go in and view your camera
roll tap in the top right hand corner
where you would normally tap the share
copy or delete pictures once you start
tapping on pictures you'll actually see
down here at the bottom and addto-button
become highlighted once you tap on that
you can either add to an existing album
which is the album we just created a
title CNET or we could create a new
album we'll tap on that and we'll center
test for this album name we'll go back
to all of our albums where we can see
Cena and test are the two albums we just
created if you tap on the edit button
you could rearrange the albums by
dragging and dropping them or you can
even delete them by pressing the Delete
key you're going to be warned that the
album is being deleted however the
photos will stay on your device alright
