to your voice commands through Alexa and
even teaches you yoga this is the $800
OOP tech links let's check it out
link says Amazon's assistant Alexa
built-in meaning you can use it to
control your smart home you can add
entries to your calendar you can search
the web all with a voice command so you
can also activate links with a tap on
the head tell me a joke did you hear
about the sick chimney it had bad who
just like the original echo this thing
sense of humor is terrible and it'll
make some bad gestures along with the
jokes for some reason links isn't quite
as good at the echo it hearing you links
is good at hearing you if you're talking
at it from the front but if I come back
here Alexa Alexa there you go I had to
speak up a little bit but at a normal
speaking volume it's not that great at
hearing it if I'm talking from back here
in addition to its Alexa capabilities
links has other uses in the smart home
you can actually turn on surveillance
mode which will make it act as a smart
home security camera surveillance camera
so it'll use a passive infrared sensor
in its chest to detect motion and if it
does it'll send you a push alert and
record a clip of what happens so links
has a couple of other cool robot tricks
it can dance you can also control it
remotely with avatar mode you can move
it around with these joysticks here and
even ask it to do some fun gestures
right here oh it's giving me a hug 5
so let's most unique feature is that it
can actually teach you yoga and lead you
on an exercise routine so we're gonna
give that a try I'm gonna beginner at
yoga so we'll see if links can actually
show me a thing or two Alexa
asked links to teach me yoga if you
spread your legs shoulder-width apart oh
my god excuses spot squat down as far as
possible slowly return to starting
position inhale it's just a nothing
raise your hand straight over your head
it's describing the last one whoa how
are you standing it doesn't seem to be
doing that ready I'm ready you don't
appear to be ready okay so obviously
it's not that helpful as a yogi if you
don't know what to do it doesn't offer
any extra instructions I'm pretty sure a
lot of those poses aren't actual yoga
poses it's even less helpful as an
exercise instructor watch this Alexa
asked links to teach me exercise welcome
two weeks please put me on a flat
surface first your next exercise is
needs push-ups if you aren't ready stay
ready or you can say help to get help
ready see this I'm supposed to be doing
this it's not doing it along with me I'm
not feeling the karate links how am I
supposed to be motivated to work when
you don't work along with me and that's
how it does it with all these routines
so there's no actual variety here
there's no help
it has brief explanations just like with
yoga but I don't know I don't find a
ticking time or all that useful
so links is unique it has lots of tricks
it's really fun to play with should you
spend $800 on it no no you shouldn't all
of its smart home functionality is
really easy to replicate with other
cheaper devices that do each of its
functions better and its extra functions
like teaching you yoga teaching exercise
let's just put it this way it's not a
very good teacher
so that adds up to making links nothing
more than a novelty toy a fun novelty
toy but definitely not a toy you should
invest in and at $800 it needs to be a
little bit more than it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
