it today I'm here to talk about the
quirky + GE refuel the refuel is a
connected sensor it lets you know via
quickies wink app how much propane the
tank for your gas grill has and you can
check on that anywhere here's how it
works you set your propane tank on top
of this donut shaped piece connect it to
this hockey-puck shaped piece then use
the app on your phone to connect this
thing to your Wi-Fi router once you're
connected you're going to tell the wink
app what the tare weight of your propane
tank is the tare weight is what the
propane tank would weigh if it didn't
have any gas in it this donut piece is
then going to weigh your tank subtract
the tare weight and tell you how much
out of the standard 20 pounds of propane
your tank has left in it the app will
keep you up to date on your tank status
if you don't have your phone on you you
can actually also check on your tank
just by tapping on this sensor so the
setup is simple in the device is cool
the cord that you're used to attach is
heat resistant and this sensor is
magnetic you can also customize the app
to send you alerts when the tank is half
full or quarter full and i'll send you
push notifications or emails that said
for a smart device this thing is pretty
simple lots of other smart gadgets have
hidden features this one doesn't it
weighs your tank so the refill is pretty
excessive if you're comfortable with
picking up the tank and telling how much
fuel is in there plus lots of grills
right now come with gauges for knowing
where your level is at not to mention
the dozens of products you can get on
amazon for ten dollars or twenty dollars
that measure gas pressure and tell you
the same thing to top it off this thing
will only work with standard 20-pound
propane tanks so if you have an unusual
set up at all or a hanging propane tank
this won't work for you given its
limitations and the number of other
things that do the exact same function
the amount of people that are going to
find this useful is pretty small that
said it only proud
us to do one thing and it does that one
thing well I mentioned other sensors
costs ten dollars or twenty dollars well
this one's only 30 and it adds
connectivity so sure the device is
frivolous and unlike many other smart
devices it does not have the capacity to
wow you in any way but for those couple
of times a year when you're out shopping
and you don't remember how much fuel you
have you might find it worth the
convenience to be able to pull out your
phone and check for cnet I'm Andrew
