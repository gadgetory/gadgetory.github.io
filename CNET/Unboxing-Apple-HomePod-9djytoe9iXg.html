important product for Apple because it's
the first in the smart speaker category
so let's see what's inside the box of
this three hundred and fifty dollar
Apple product okay so the first thing
I'm noticing is the weight of this thing
it is heavy much more so than say the
Amazon echo or the Google home now let's
get all this out of the way and I'm
gonna keep the box because I'm hoping
there's some other things inside let's
focus on the speaker itself first it is
space grey as you can see and the plug
is already connected to the speaker
itself so in terms of design I think
it's a good-looking speaker it's a
cylinder kind of like the Mac Pro and
it's covered in this mesh like fabric
that you see here with what looks to be
a plastic top but let's peel off the
plastic to confirm and yep that's
plastic underneath too but honestly what
strikes me the most is the cable I'm so
used to seeing the USB and wall adapter
for Apple products and even the material
itself of the cable is different it also
seems to be covered in fabric maybe to
avoid knotting not so sure in fact the
entire cable is completely attached to
the speaker and there's no way to
disassemble any part of it so let's flip
this thing over and the bottom looks
like plastic as well but it feels more
like a soft rubber with the Apple logo
of course so back to the box we have the
instruction manual which is pretty short
and the Apple logo sticker and that's it
guys no more cables no more wall
adapters no more fun surprises that's
all you get inside the box of this 350
dollar home pod
well I think this has been one of the
shortest unboxings in CNET history let's
go over what's in the box once again the
box the home pod and oh yeah this
sticker now check out our full review of
Apple's home pod at sea Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
