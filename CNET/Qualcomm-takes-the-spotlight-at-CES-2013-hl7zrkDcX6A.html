open the consumer electronics show our
course cual comes not a traditional
consumer electronics coming I mean
obviously we don't make tvs or stereos
or game consoles but we are at the heart
of mobile devices and a growing number
of connected consumer electronics
products that are at the center of
everything you do it's kind of amazing
if you think about it right now there's
more than 6.4 billion mobile connections
worldwide that's almost as many mobile
connections there are people on earth
pretty soon the mobile connections are
going to outnumber a lot outnumber us so
if you think about it almost a million
new smartphone users are added every
single day that's more than double the
number of babies born worldwide and
mobile is fueling economic growth it's
transforming industries and its really
redefining the way that we live so you
know we went out and we asked some folks
what does it mean to them to be born
mobile was it need to be born oval
horrible being born on the way to the
hospital somebody born in the age of
wool devices or like something else I
started running the beginning of high
school just kind of get out there run
you kind of guess how how long it was
yeah maybe it was eight mile now I'm in
college and every time I gonna run i
throw my gps watch I know exactly how
far I ran I do like big metal public art
sculpture stuff I got contacted for
doing a sculpture symposium in South
Korea I have
app for the 3d software i use i can just
email that off there through your new
printer and i built this 20-foot long
12-foot tall two tons stainless steel
sculpture the same process that took me
a month and a half took me about three
days it's like I've get like ten careers
out of one career my god or I seen her
three times in my life but I've watched
her grow through a screen six seven
thousand miles away just through video
Chinese my mom's phone I just like look
at pictures and just has a camera
nikolic I started a company called dog
for dog to help as many dogs as we can
in need these dogs that tend to be in
rescue groups are escape artists we're
able to track them with GPS devices on
their collars we see our office maybe
once a week other than that it's all
mobile I'm kind of at a hard time
because I've just gone to a new school I
don't think we'd still be friends now if
we couldn't connect they can be halfway
across the world he lives in India like
China Indonesia I have a grandson in
Seattle my name is iron sahaja and I'm
26 years old 21 years old 47 years old
living 32 years old and I'm five every
generation is now by well born mobile
generation born mobile is the generation
I'm in and I don't know if people are
gonna look back at our time and just say
those were the pioneers they were right
on the cusp the beginning the brink of
something really awesome there's a hell
of a generation let's make this a little
bit of a truck horn mobile means like
when you go
you actually connect to your people talk
to your people you can actually connect
to them now this chip industry it is
highly competitive but we have the
advantage of being mobile natives and we
have been since day one and we're
continually creating new breakthroughs
which we need to amazing new products
including products from companies like
Microsoft I mean two years ago right
here on this stage Microsoft took a
major step forward announcing that the
next version of windows would be born
mobile that would run on the chips that
power smartphones and tablets then last
year they showed how Windows was
completely reimagined starting from the
chipset all the way to the user
experience and this year Paul welcome my
friends Steve Ballmer Microsoft
rather have in here
thanks Paul thanks to all of you it's a
great to be back here at CES with
Qualcomm this year I'm here to actually
have a chance to show you some of the
phenomenal new windows devices on
Snapdragon and on the market today I
mean it was a big year Microsoft
reimagined windows and introduced
conclude completely new forms of mobile
devices into the world well we really
have that maybe if you don't mind we'll
have a chance to check out just a couple
couple of things here the new Windows
PCs tablets and phones I think are
stunning Windows RT devices are the new
addition to the family they're highly
mobile thin lightweight super super
impressive battery life and they have
instant on always connected operation
this one is the Samsung at Eve and right
here we have the dell XPS they're both
powered by Snapdragon they're quite
unique and how they bring together the
best of worlds the world of the tablet
and the pc the touch in the keyboard
computing and mobile which we think make
them absolutely perfect for work and for
play so why don't we start with play I
mean these tablets are really wonderful
they're super fast and fluid and
connected to a growing world of
applications well they're now four times
the number of applications that we had
at the time of Windows launched just a
couple months ago 10,000 applications
were added in the last month alone
including some fantastic new
applications like Expedia and Fitbit
Huffington Post the no textbooks Dropbox
barnes &amp;amp; noble nook the Disney's where's
my water application and we have a lot
of others coming including CNN Sony's
crackles Songza Twitter and again many
many more Paul you know in the these
windows RT device I mean they really
to let you enjoy hours and hours of
entertainment but they also have plenty
of power and productivity get your work
done too yeah I mean as you can see
microsoft office word excel powerpoint
and these easily convert between the two
worlds of work and play just by
attaching the keyboard just that simple
and built into every Windows RT device
is our new world class office 2013
productivity suite with Word Excel
PowerPoint and OneNote Windows tablets
are the only tablets in the world with
office and I think the capability to not
only be to have some fun but to be
really productive absolutely i mean it
what i really like seeing is how
microsoft took many of these innovations
that originated in mobile and
incorporated them into windows to
redefine the computing experience so
okay so we talked about these things
what about these smart phones you got
here these guys have been great partners
on the phone and we really appreciate it
and the new windows phones i think are
incredible ending november we reported
that sales of windows phones were four
times greater than during the same year
last during the same time last year and
during the week of christmas we were
running at five times the number of
phones from the christmas week of last
year oh it's not hard to see why look
you got snapdragon in the middle you got
these great designs i mean this hardware
is killer well this one is the nokia
lumia 920 and this is the windows phone
8x from HTC these windows phones or
cutting edge and are really leading the
smartphone industry with hardware
capabilities like optical image 8
optical image stabilization in the Lumia
920 and beats audio in the HTC windows
phone 8x alright so we're going to check
out I think we're going to put up my
windows phone up here so I personalized
it by pinning my favorite apps and the
people i connect with most to the home
screen
and it's the unique thing about windows
phone is this ability to be personal
this is in fact my windows phone with
everything that's most important to me
each windows phone is as unique as the
person who owns it call me or any one of
you when we sent out to reinvent the
smartphone we didn't want to build just
a single phone for all of us we wanted
to build a phone that could be personal
for each of us we also design the
Windows Phone to be the best phone
absolutely the best phone for anybody
using a Windows PC or Windows tablet
they share as you can see here the same
iconic look and feel the same live tiles
with by logging in with your Microsoft
account you can access the same photos
document SkyDrive all of your xbox music
Xbox games and on any windows 8 device
you can also use these these mobile
windows devices to control your TV
provided it's connected with Xbox and
you use our smart glass applications on
all windows phones and Windows tablets
and Windows PCs to literally have an
integrated second screen experience so
you can cue a movie or a song to play
from your tablet and have that come up
on on the pc navigate the internet on
your phone but use the full TV for that
experience for the queer that you guys
have completely reimagined windows i
mean i got to say it is really exciting
to me to see what we've been able to do
so far and what we're going to do in the
future well I want to say thank you to
Paul for the chance to be here today but
most importantly I want to thank you for
the opportunity to partner with call
come to bring to millions of people new
windows experiences on this new
Snapdragon processor and with an
experience that was born mobile yeah
thank you
pretty clear that Microsoft and that man
Steve Ballmer are born mobile sleep in
the clouds away ah hi everybody I'm big
bird and I'm Dave that's Dave I'm uh I'm
a writer and I'm a designer in Sesame's
content innovation lab and i'm here to
show you something pretty special yeah
and you're a bird khatir today uh-huh
yeah I'm also a bird kits here today hey
hey flap those wings okay hmm well
pretty good you remind me of my uncle
henry only you're better looking thank
you big bird um so guys we're gonna show
you a new app it's called Big Bird's
words and and with it kids can learn
about words wherever they find words I
annex yup agreed well tell them tell mom
about it okay so with euphoria uh it
gives kids mobile devices the ability to
read words that are out there in the
world well Dipper khatir Dave yeah I got
an idea why don't you show him how it
works okay yeah let's let's try to find
the word crassa nautilus no no way it'll
take too long try the word milk okay uh
yeah let's let's find the word milk in
our kitchen okay so um guys a young bird
khatir that's uh that's still learning
to read that's you that's me just for
today ah that person probably doesn't
know the word milk but Big Bird's words
will help us find it euphoria is gonna
give the application the ability to read
watch see here ooh here's a word on this
on the box but it is it milk uh let's
find out guys I'm just gonna take my
word Isco and I'm gonna move it over to
the word on the box and Big Bird's voice
is gonna tell us if that word is milk my
own voice your voice check this out am I
listen to this gee you're good at
finding words you found this one cereal
but we're looking for another word
look for milk hey that was not you're
good at finding words you found this one
perforce again yeah hey it was talking
while I was talking I bet we'd find the
word milk say if we looked on a milk
carton yeah okay um why don't we do that
I'm gonna take my my word of scope again
and guys this time I'm gonna move it
over to the word that's on this carton
and Big Bird's voice will let us know if
that word is milk here we go and you
found it milk milk starts with the
letter M that was my voice we did it big
bird yeah well that's great we did it
hooray guys um so at Sesame Workshop we
know that kids are entering kindergarten
with a vocabulary gap now to help close
this gap we have to build vocabulary
skills early we have to help kids learn
the words that they see every day guys
with this app we can introduce kids to
new words wherever they are and we can
give kids a deeper understanding of what
those words mean and how they relate to
their own lives and guys I'm thrilled to
let you know that that Big Bird's words
will be commercially available this
summer really yeah oh I'm glad to hear
that well it was a good job Berkut air
days oh thanks big bird but uh good job
yourself I you made a fantastic at um
question though thanks when did you
learn how to code well I didn't I out
sourced it to a bunch of owls oh that
makes sense okay guys thank you very
much that's a long fall bye Scott
right there for our friend Sesame Street
thanks very much gotta love big bird so
this qualcomm tricorder xprize probably
gives you a little hint that there's a
few Star Trek fans here at Qualcomm and
now we can't really wait for this new
star trek into darkness which is the
next film in the franchise it's coming
out on May seventeenth this film sounds
great there is a ton of buzz around it
there's greatness you
but there's not an ounce of humility do
you think that you can make mistakes
but there's gonna come home
wrong about that and you're gonna get
yourself
and everyone under your command kill
you think you're safe
you are not
is there anything you would not do
for your family
how cool is that so we're excited to be
helping paramount leverage some of our
newest technologies for their incredible
new Star Trek app they're using our
context awareness platform called gimbal
to make new connections and interactions
with fans now gimbal user the
combination of geofencing image
recognition and audio recognition to
present information to us in creative
new ways so here to tell us more about
the app and the movie is actor alice eve
thank you for having me now I gotta yes
you're facing a little bit of pressure
because you know Star Trek fans and
guessing there's a few of you out there
in the audience we are serious about our
love for this franchise yeah so am I you
know obviously when we started filming I
was nervous because everyone had made a
movie together before and of course I
was the new girl on set but as you can
tell from that JJ is bordering on genius
and so he was also very welcoming in a
gentleman so uh it's been a lot of
mystery here are you gonna tell us a
little bit about your character on Star
Trek into darkness yeah mystery is the
name of the game I think on Star Trek in
any JJ project but i can tell you thank
goodness did I play dr. Carol Marcus who
like you has a PhD and although I had
something to do a stock I can't tell you
anything else obviously dr. Marcus was
in the original series and the second of
the original movies but since JJ split
the universe in 2009 any eventualities
possible so in really not going to tell
us anything more well what do you want
to know pool ah anything you want to
tell me people on no my lips are sealed
good and you know we're just with a
bunch of our friends yes mr. close
little group of us yeah um in my depths
are sealed is the the prompter is
telling me to say hello I'd love to tell
you more but there is a way you can
delve deeper into the star trek universe
and unveil perhaps some of the mystery
so I'm guess you're talking about this
app we're doing yeah that's right and I
was just playing with it it's pretty
cool it let me tell you how it works so
fans can become a part of the crew the
minute they log in and they go out on
real-world missions so you have to find
like a trailer or if you find a
billboard a post or if you go into your
called theatre you gain points and
become more heroic so it's pretty fun
yeah it's the hero making out I like it
so so the way that that thing works it's
Qualcomm's new context awareness
platform yeah and it makes all those
features possible and what it does is
lets this app sort of adapt to the user
surroundings and so the app can actually
detect when a mission is completed using
combination of audio scan or geolocation
identification or image recognition and
this app it's actually the first one
that's used all three of these
technologies together in our gimbal
platform so big but just uses one yeah
yeah you have a few more yeah we have
two more than Big Bang yeah got it got
everybody's trying to get something over
on big burn out there's a bad joke in
there somewhere but I'm not going to
make it so there's a sound scanner as we
just said and so fans watching star trek
into darkness videos can manually unlock
and sound scan their mission there's
also an image scanner so they can
interact with the film's images to
accomplish additional missions so you
know the way that that works is with
this hbu for a platform that big bird
was using and it really allows the app
to recognize a whole bunch of different
visual targets so you can interact with
you know real word billboards or images
or posters it's all much much more
seamless and it ever was before yeah
yeah so don't forget the Star Trek app
also uses geolocation but what was quite
cool about that I just heard is that if
you're near a billboard like the app
will tell you if you just go over there
then it's quite cool it's like an Easter
egg hunt yeah so it allows fans to take
part in a real-world scavenger hunt or
Easter egg hunt where they accomplish
missions by finding specific locations
so what happened with that technologist
or two because uses this very low-power
location technology so this geofence the
thing that tells you when you're near
things or inside a place that
capabilities always on and so what that
means is that fans can auto complete
their missions i mean they don't even
have to take their smartphone out of
their pocket to do it so the app just
run silently in the back
noun and you know fans can unlock
special missions just by walking into
the local movie theater bit lazy isn't
it yeah but it's kind of cool so as you
accomplish these real-world missions you
rise up in the ranks to n special
content and rewards so um I only told us
a little bit are we gonna hear any more
soon you will you'll hear more in
February during one of the biggest
perhaps the biggest American sporting
event of the year the American sporting
I am a Chelsea found myself how to make
that clear um there we go um Chelsea
anybody else yeah Star Trek I love LCA
good so there'll be another sneak peek
during that and much more to come after
that obviously including the film in May
so that's great also one lucky fan who
registers to be notified once the app
launches will have a chance to win a VIP
trip to the US premiere that's gonna be
fun cool yeah that will be fun that will
actually be fun and go to go to Star
Trek movie calm / CES bit details and a
chance to enter so the stuff that
Paramount's doing with gimbal really
fits this vision that we have where the
smartphone's going to enable a digital
sixth sense for us and what Paramount's
doing so using the smartphone in gimbal
to market the film in the real world but
at the same time they're pulling in the
user into the film's world so the line
between the physical and the digital
world they're really blurring yikes so
with the new star trek out and gimble
the future is really not the future
anymore no I don't think so so hey
thanks Alex for being here I'm really
looking forward to seeing you on the big
screen thank you Paul nice to see you
good to see you too
I want to show you one of my favorite
battery-powered mobile devices this is
something that was really born mobile
one type of mobile product that's
particularly promising and cool is
electric vehicles we're working on a
unique wireless charging technology
called Qualcomm halo with Qualcomm halo
your electric vehicle automatically
begins to charge when you pull into your
garage or into an activated parking
space there's no cables to hook up you
don't have to worry about aligning your
car exactly just works and as we're
working on commercializing this
technology we are seeing some amazing
concept cars come out so we borrowed the
keys to this one
so rolls-royce pulled the b12 gasoline
engine from this car and replaced it
yoki said thank you very much with an
electric motor and it's powered by
incredible batteries that can store 73
kilowatt hours of energy so let me put
that in context those batteries would
fully charged over 12,000 smartphones
kind of impressive they're right in
there anyway so this electric
rolls-royce went out on a world tour
visited Tokyo Beijing Paris Pebble Beach
Singapore I was just in Singapore great
place during that tour it was recharged
by either a cable or by a Qualcomm halo
wireless charging system now let me tell
you at the end of the tour the wireless
system proved more reliable so for the
last three months of the tour they used
the qualcomm halo system exclusively now
if you want to check out this gorgeous
car for yourself or you want to find out
more about our connected car and
wireless charging solutions for EVs and
devices come by the Qualcomm experience
area on the exhibit for this week this
car is it's pretty sweet I mean
everything about it is awesome even the
sound system is awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
