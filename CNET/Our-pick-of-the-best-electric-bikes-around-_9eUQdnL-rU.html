the clutches of modern technology and a
whole host of new ebikes with electric
motors are descending on our city's
streets
I've been putting some of the best
examples of a test to help you work out
what you need to consider before you
splash your cash on a fancy new ride
first of all think about what you need
your bike for if it's just for a short
city commute in amongst traffic and
consider a smaller frame that's easy to
maneuver through cars this go cycle g3
is very nimble and it's electric
assistance will help propel you up to 50
miles per hour better yet it's got
built-in lights automatic gears and you
can customize the amount of power the
motor provides using a smartphone app
demand Oh Footloose i.m is a similar
style with a compact frame that's easy
to steer the battery is removable too
allowing you to easily charge up without
having to move the whole bike near a
wall socket the foot loose is different
though in that it has no chain it's
entirely electrically driven it
therefore takes very little effort to
get you to your destination
meaning you arrive at the office without
having broken a sweat
the downside is that when you run out of
power you're not going anywhere and
pedaling from a standstill waiting for
the motor to kick in is an odd sensation
that does take some getting used to if
you're taking your bike inside consider
one that folds up the cyclo tricity
wallet has a motor inner front wheel
which takes you up to speed either by
assisting your pedaling or just sit back
and use the throttle by itself it folds
up making a slightly easy to get in and
out of your office but its hefty weight
still means you won't find it easy to
carry onto public transport
from our stylish ride cast your eyes
over the Kobuk Rome it's a full-size
bike with gorgeous stylings and large
wheels that let you pick up plenty of
speed on the road as a fuss free
approach - with automatic gears and
automatic motor assistance all you need
to do is get on and ride it's very much
like any fixed gear bike you'll see on
the street though the additional motor
it's less effort to get about if you
want more control over your full-size
bike then the vault infinity should be
the one for you the large wheels and the
suspension on the front forks make it
very comfortable to ride through London
city streets particularly when you're
going over potholes and speed bumps you
can change the amount of assistance the
motor gives you right on the handlebars
it's got electric gears and you can take
the battery off to make charging much
easier if you're more concerned with how
to conquer the countryside when the
commute cycle tricity stealth is the one
for you it's a full sized mountain bike
with aggressive tires and suspension on
the front forks to absorb the rocks and
bumps on the trails it's comfortable to
ride and it's motor can either give you
assistance while you pedal or just hit
the throttle and rock it over the hills
with no effort on your part regardless
of what you choose always keep safety in
mind and never ride without a helmet for
