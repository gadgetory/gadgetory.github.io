max we were all rooting for you the $200
instant pot Max was supposed to do more
than older models along with being able
to cook faster thanks to more pressure
the max also has new features like the
ability to sous-vide and pan food is
impressive at first glance it has easy
to use touchscreen controls and an
automatic steam valve that adjusts to
your preferred method of steam release
which is a first for instant pot it was
helpful and canning fruit and the inner
pipe gets nice and hot when you have to
saute vegetables or cooked meat
unfortunately many of the new showing
features on the max didn't live up to
our expectations basic dishes like beans
and rice took just as long or longer to
cook in the max as we've seen with
previous things to pop models that's
especially disappointing considering
that one of the biggest selling points
of the max is faster cook times and the
sous-vide setting was a huge letdown
this method of cooking food in a water
bath is all about precision and that's
exactly what the Max didn't have
temperatures inside the pot were about
20 degrees less than what it read on the
control panel which resulted in some
undercooked food and there were minor
annoyances that made us wish for an
older instant pot model
there aren't any preset modes for beans
or chili nor are there water volume
labels on the inner cooking pot but when
you make rice and the max cost twice as
much as other models overall the max
does it match the performance of its
predecessors if you're interested in
the pot after one of the older models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
