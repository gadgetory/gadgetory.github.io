welcome to the 359 I'm bed Foxx ribbon
yoni salesman I'm Alfred hang Twitter
and CEO Jack Dorsey have been taking a
lot of heat for not banning Alex Jones a
far-right conspiracy theorist and host
of info wars after YouTube Apple Spotify
and Facebook banned him last week on
Tuesday Twitter suspended Jones account
for 7 days for a tweet to a video about
getting quote battle rifles ready
against the media and others Jones
denies he made this threat
meanwhile the Infowars Twitter account
is still live the video is still on
periscope which is owned by Twitter so
either way that was a lot of an intro
but Joan do these social sites have a
clear and transparent policy on banning
certain kinds of content I'm having a
hard time figuring out like do they know
what they're doing I think the answer's
no okay
I think kind of what I thought they know
I mean that's part of the problem it's a
combination of they don't know how to
handle this responsibility where they
have to exert editorial judgment over
these sort of very gray areas of what is
what is a violation of their policies or
not they have these policies and they're
transparent about these policies but
there's so much gray area in what is
hate speech what is satire what is what
is harassment what is that what is
harassment and so because they're not
transparent about how they adjudicate
these decisions and why this thing
deserves to get somebody kicked off but
this thing doesn't it just leads to an
overall impression that they don't know
what they're doing yeah a lot of the
moves have appeared to be very arbitrary
in a way where you know he gets banned
on Twitter for this one but he's made
similar comments in previous posts where
he talks about you know trying to shoot
not him trying to shoot but like just he
mentioned like a rifle and then former
FBI director James Comey and
no he didn't get banned for that one or
anything like that but then like he does
get banned for this one it does like
bring about this whole feeling of
they're really like the rules don't
really matter and they're just doing
whatever they want just seems kind of
ad-hoc that's the impression that I get
so it kind of wanted to pose this
question of the both of you do you think
that this episode this is probably the
most optimistic view of this potentially
but do you think this episode with Alex
Jones will help these social sites
improve their policies no I mean I think
that it for one thing it's maybe like
you could say it's kind of crossing a
Rubicon like at a certain point even
Twitter and Jack Dorsey which I think
has called itself like the free speech
wing of the internet or something to
that effect
you know when they even have to say like
yeah we can't allow something like that
to be present on our platform then maybe
that's showing that they're willing to
take responsibility for more of their
content but it just it opens up a whole
Pandora's box because their sites are so
large there's their services are so huge
and they've given a lot of free rein to
a lot of people for so long it's messy
yeah anyway like you know this goes back
to what I was saying where you know it
seemed really arbitrary for Alex Jones
this doesn't just apply to him like
there are a lot of times where I've seen
a post get banned on Twitter or an
account get banned on Twitter and the
reasoning makes no sense at all whereas
other posts where I'll see you're like
oh that makes complete sense that like
they should you know take this down but
they don't there's like always all these
screen shot accounts like hey that we
found that this post from a Nazi like
threatening to kill you did not violate
our rules and then I see another account
where they tweeted at frosted flakes and
says like I'd like to have sex with Tony
the Tiger and that's that account was
banned so it's just like what is going
on with like these rules how are you
applying them in the doubt yeah okay I I
do want to get to one other piece of
lighter tech news while we still have
time Alexa and Cortana's long-awaited
collaboration is now live as an early
access public preview you can now talk
to Alexa with your Windows 10 laptop or
queue up Cortana on an Ecco speaker
I don't know if you guys are excited
about this but obviously it's something
that people can check out if they want
to if they want to do that anyway if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Reuben
from Johnny Salzmann I'm Alpha ring
thanks for listening and apologies to
everybody for all these smart speakers
we queued at the end there yeah my bad
by the way I ran out of time but I
wanted to plug Meghan wallet ins a story
about road trip so she wrote about the
work to protect the rare Devil's Hole
pupfish with the help of a lot of
monitoring tech that's also on CNN so
check out that story and yeah okay it's
a four-minute podcast so sorry bear with
me for minute podcast and now wants to
take your questions and comments so go
ahead and submit those in the chat we
want to kind of reiterate again we don't
want this to get political or heated I
know it has a tendency and it's easy to
get that way let's talk about where free
speech does come to play how it plays in
the social media world where it starts
where it stops what rights does Twitter
Twitter have what rights does mr. Jones
have and let's try to keep it there we
know we trust you guys you've been
fantastic in the past just disclaimer on
behalf so anyways yeah I mean related to
that I'm sure a lot of fans of Alex
Jones would call the censorship he's
obviously been promoting that issue for
a long time specifically with the bands
from last week whether our deserters and
censorship really depends like where you
where you say right I mean ultimately
it's not a First Amendment issue because
those are not we don't have the rights
to say whatever they want there is no
right to saying whatever you want on
Twitter it's not government controlled
that's where the First Amendment starts
and stops but we were talking about this
before the podcast that because Facebook
and Twitter and you know some of these
other sites are so big and powerful you
could to a certain extent make a First
Amendment claim or at least you can't
you can't make it for some yeah but you
can't make the claim that it
censorship because it's there's such
powerful companies but it's not
government-sponsored that they are such
gatekeepers Joan you got to move your
mic closer sorry but there's such
gatekeepers to conversation that that's
you can't sue them on a First Amendment
grounds but you could make the case that
it's still kind of censorship yeah we
have a question here from Simon Chang
asking what Alex Jones moved to VK or
any other possible social media what are
the platforms do you think yeah but my
question is will he just start his own
because he's got the resources he has
info wars.com that's the like I mean
like drags down it's a place where his
followers can interact with them like be
social there the other the other thing
is too is that they are promoting
already gab dot ai which like you know
that was that was an attempt by a lot of
folks on the right or the far right to
create something that they thought was
like a free speech social network so
that's that's an area where a lot of
folks go yeah I mean on the know ton of
like free speech on social media though
I mean like Joan said it's not like a
government like problem or anything like
that for them because they're private
companies but you know the folks behind
Twitter and Facebook and to a certain
degree YouTube have this like very like
I feel like ingrained like mentality of
you know this is a place this is a open
platform or anybody can express their
feelings and we don't want to stifle any
voices online what even though we
disagree with them Jack Dorsey defended
that last week on Twitter where he
basically brings up all these points and
says you know it's he can say these
things that are awful and wrong and it's
up we rely heavily on journalists to do
that and like disprove him but there are
many many cases of journalists like
disproving like yeah I don't and I don't
and yeah they it's not it doesn't care
so like when this whole like marketplace
of ideas things like blows up in your
face like what are you really supposed
to do at that point it is interesting
that Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey
have both come out and very publicly
said that it's okay to be misleading or
have
misinformation on their sites that is
not a reason to be banned and that to me
is a very clear indication that they do
not want to make editorial decisions I
mean when I'm statics Jones though
obviously went too far and they decided
that this is this is me other than we
want to handle I agree with their point
of you know it's okay to be wrong on a
social network but they're applying that
to like normal people you know they're
applying that like if I post faith yeah
yeah if I post that on my page and if it
like some political view that I have and
it's like completely wrong but it's like
that's just like me like I can say that
like within this circle or something and
like you know it's not gonna be that
much of a problem the fact that there is
a verified account or like an account
that has like millions of followers
that's like posted you know with with a
verified status with like marked or
classified as like a news organization
like saying stuff like this that's
something that they could definitely
control I guess in my books at least
yeah alright anyway when I hear some
more from the audience so do we have
more questions Brian yeah yeah I'll get
there in a sec I just want to say I'm
actually impressed that the alfred's
kind of a level-headed one this time you
put it put it in there put in the
calendars why would you be surprised by
that because it's not smash so anyways
that's uh take a comment from syringe oi
what do we think about hash tag diac
today that's been trending on Twitter as
a step against jack by deactivating
their accounts unless he takes down Alex
Jones I mean I don't know if it's a
direct result of but it might I don't
know exactly how the hash tag got
popularized but yesterday there was this
widely spread post by somebody who works
at Twitter who said that they that he
was that he's been a user a daily user
of Twitter for eight years a decade I
can remember exactly what it was but
been using Twitter daily for years works
at Twitter but he's gonna take a
sabbatical he's gonna stop he's gonna
take it he's gonna delete it from his
phone he's not gonna use it even though
he works there because of these problems
like that
that he feels like the leadership of
tweet Twitter as letting Twitter's
leadership down by not being more
proactive I don't know if that's
directly linked it to the the hashtag
that's trending but I think that
definitely is probably the sentiment
that's involved with with that part of
the conversation
yeah I mean I I don't think a protest
like this will work I think it's like a
small like circle of people that might
be doing it but like if you deactivate
your account on Twitter like how can you
tell like most of like if you use
Twitter I assume you get most of your
news from Twitter or Facebook or
anything like that
so my point is like how are you gonna
know if it's successful if okay I think
the point is is that it's one of many
like bricks on the wall yeah kind of put
pressure on Dorsey and I think that to a
certain extent it worked I mean like
Alex Jones got suspended so it's
obviously not a ban and it's very leaky
in that Infowars like that twitter
account isn't suspended at the same time
even though it's like very directly
linked to Alex Jones so I I think
Facebook YouTube Spotify those guys last
week all made the same calculation that
they were like okay do we really want to
is this the hill that we want to die on
like do we really want to defend Alex
Jones and like say that like we're not
gonna censor people specifically for him
he's a very very difficult I would say
kind of kind of person to have as a
rallying cry and say like we're not
gonna make editorial decisions and
here's a good reason why it's it's
difficult to defend what exactly he does
I mean like Sandy Hook is a perfect
example of that I kind of feel like
that's maybe more and I don't want to
get too personal about this because
we're supposed to stay as unbiased as
possible but if anybody says something
distasteful or outwardly and objectively
and intentionally offensive just to stir
the pot they should get their wrist
slapped like if your kids screaming in
the grocery store
Facebook that's kind of the attitude
I've kind of taken away from all of this
personally and I that should go for
everybody not just somebody whose
beliefs I don't 100% agree with if
you're being an ass you should get your
ass slapped
well not like don't laugh at me no I I
I'm glad I'm not your kid I don't I
don't want to deal with this but I mean
the point that but I think it's not even
like if you're doing something bad
you deserve to have some sort of you
know slap on the wrist or whatever it
may be but even I don't I don't
personally understand why these
platforms don't hold higher standards as
people have greater and greater
influence on them like if there's a site
if there's a page or an account that has
millions of followers that should I feel
like mean that they are held to a higher
standard of you can't say these offhand
things off the cuff quite as much I
don't see but and that's would be one
way to allow there to be a continuation
of free discourse just not by the people
that can use the free discourse in a bad
faith way to poison other people's
conversations yeah and I feel like
Twitter does it it kind of gets to do it
both ways yeah a little bit more now in
that if somebody's like trolling you a
lot of times they'll like hide the
comments like if there if there are like
responses to things like the algorithm
will identify that like oh there's a
group of friends talking and then
somebody shows up and starts just like
writing in troll comments or whatever
those those comments will then get
hidden but you can just click through
and see them if you want to so that's
that's kind of a way for Twitter to not
editorialize too much but to also make
the make discourse like a little bit
more comfortable or a little bit safer I
guess I mean to Joan's point though I I
agree within in the sense that you know
if somebody you don't have to
editorialize to like take away
somebody's like verification check or
something like that would you
yeah really doesn't matter but like to
do that is like I feel like is a sign at
least from a social network saying like
yeah we don't like a proof of what's
going on here but like we're letting it
like happen anyway
in the sense of yeah we're like okay so
this is no longer a verified account
that we're like pushing out to people or
like signal signifying to people like we
you should consider this a trusted
source like I don't really care about
like the the blue checkmark or anything
like that but a lot of people who look
at Twitter accounts do yeah since when
they'll see something and like oh this
account is verified that must mean it's
like a legitimate source of news or
something right so you know that's like
a simple step that they can take and
like ensure that they're not like
verified
they're like pages anymore or anything
like that and Twitter said that they are
gonna look into verifications it's not
like yeah and they said it's not a top
priority but it's obviously they've
admitted it's a broken system and they
realized that it is often viewed more as
a seal of approval than just a way to
verify that yes this is the person that
is as it is so like yes this is Alex
Jones is a counter Elon Musk's account
as opposed to like a fake account which
which if you're gonna look at it as face
value that's what they claim they wanted
to do with the verification checks but
you can see like and this is where like
I will grant them these decisions are
super complicated like I could see a
scenario where let's say you take the
check mark off of Infowars then you
don't then the whole panoply of site of
accounts that pretend to be info wars
that vein being info wars could spread
even more noxious things and yeah people
can understand like the one that has
like 1.8 billion followers is the one
but you know what I mean like I've been
emboldened and provide more legitimacy
to the ones that are pretending to be
the crazy I completely agree with you I
agree with you to jail are not they are
not in an easy position at all but
that's precisely why we're talking about
it on the podcast so yeah they're not
it's a it's a hard position to be in but
they're also like incredibly wealthy
people that make these decisions like
they've beyond like in the scope of
history people it's very rare that
people have in like in enrich themselves
quite as much as these people that run
these platforms so like these are hard
problems so when I say like I'll give
them I'll cut them that slack it's a
hard problem but like they should be
dealing with hard problems that they're
making as much money hmm you know yeah
excellent points all around Joan I do
agree with you too it's better to know
where the obnoxious behavior is coming
from I'm gonna have like a finger at it
yes and we'll get to a couple more
questions and Sanjay asks is ghosting an
account okay or better than censoring
this is a good question is that kind of
like a shadow banning shadow banging or
gonzo egg or whatever it's called Bo's
owing
yes right it's a lover people that these
platforms can Paul I don't know what do
you guys think I like I feel like it's
one of those things you can look at you
know like different sides of the mirror
like is it is it good that they're
taking a half-measure or is it bad that
they're taking happens like it's
classified I think I think it depends on
the type of troll that you're dealing
with
so when Infowars had their account
basically deleted from YouTube they set
up another like YouTube account like
right after and it was on their on their
Facebook page they were they made a post
that basically said you know YouTube is
censoring us now and we are moving to
another YouTube channel click on here
for our like stream today while we like
get set up or whatever so that was the
results of a permanent like band that
they knew about had they been ghosted or
shadow band or whatever you want to call
it then it would have taken much longer
for them to figure that out like I guess
the idea would just be like how come
we're only getting like five views or
like ten viewers like today as opposed
to how much we usually get and then like
you know the but the thing is like at
that point they'll probably connect the
dots and yes figure out and then make
another account anyway yeah in a
best-case scenario I think reddit it was
apparently ghosting people that were
trial they were doing that until like
2013 2012 and and the idea there and I
don't know how effective it was
obviously they're not doing it anymore
but the idea was is that people would
just you know post crap on Reddit and
they would get no responses no yeah but
that's votes whatever and and the
argument is is that they just kind of
get tired and you have this site but
that's different though because it's
like anonymous people that like don't
have a massive following that would be
wondering you know any time you're off
screen hey where's poochy
you know the idea is like oh that person
like has like a large following so even
if we shadow band them they would know
like they're falling would be like you
know still find them all stuff and if we
banned them out completely then they're
still going to be a big big like ruckus
about it so shadow banning doesn't
exactly work when the person you're
doing it to has a large following to
begin with I really like this
conversation that's going on in the chat
right now about accountability and
standards our wallops says the
verification check should mean more than
just this is in fact the person that
they are APEC asks wouldn't having
separate rules for accounts with more
followers be fair take YouTube and
people with six million subs and people
with a hundred is it fair for their
rules to be in different classes sir
enjoy says why isn't pro speech
defendants so vocal save Facebook for
going against Alec Jones and then Hunter
Lee comes up with this fantastic idea
that I think would be an interesting
thing for us to look into
Hunter Lee says maybe they should have a
new way to mark an account different
degrees of marks like with an X instead
of a check mark to label them
untrustworthy that's an interesting
argument well the whole event gets to
make yeah so they're very against like
saying we'd like you shouldn't trust
this source like even even on like the
fact checkers that they put on Facebook
those are those calls that like this is
like deceptive news or this is
misinformation the those calls are not
made by Facebook they like rely on third
party sources like the AP and nope yeah
to do that for them because Facebook for
a while has basically like we don't want
to be the ones that are telling you
what's true and what's not so like I
think that like making a mark for a
website that like provides like false
information would not be like would not
be something that they would do and on
the first point about you know different
sets of rules for if you have a verified
account or like X amount of followers I
mean I think that makes sense I think
like you know when you are verified or
when you have like an account with like
you know at you know millions of
subscribers you enjoy a different set of
benefits that like a normal user
wouldn't have like I believe on YouTube
like you're allowed to monetize your
stuff like almost immediately after you
have like X amount of subscribers which
they changed recently so like normal
like random channels just couldn't
monetize stuff so I think that if you
enjoy certain benefits from it then you
should also have to adhere to a
different set of rules from like being a
bigger name it's a good point yeah yeah
and and just on YouTube for example just
to be clear if you do have access
to being able to monetize your videos
you are held to different standards of
appropriateness instead of being called
to like the YouTube Terms of Service
can't like curse right you're held
together friendly yes so there are
higher standards but but but that's not
to say that you could have one video
that fits those appetite of standards
and still be at Alex Jones you know what
I mean you could still have like tons of
things you don't monetize that are in
violation of the basic community
standards but you know now he's been
kicked off so so these thing went that
far
Christian says if the major social media
platforms censor everything then there
will be a social media for those who
have don't want to be censored that's an
inevitability here's another really
interesting thought from Christian as
well what if Twitter lets you know that
they're going to censor your post before
you upload it using some form of AI what
if there was some kind of automated film
for that AI to exist it would have to
know what you're typing before you even
publish it and that's I mean it had a
meat-based invasive it has to be based
on keywords right we're talking about
slippery slope we may be like that is
more thought policing they just
suspending or banding they also do that
in comment sections though like on
certain websites like New York Times
does it too or like if you try to like
type in the f-word or anything like that
they'll like tell you basically you know
like it's so easy to get angry yeah yeah
it is which is why I don't think it
should be based on keywords or anything
like that
that being said that I think is really
weird if a website had a policy like
that of you know what we're gonna take
this post down before you even post it
just so you know like kind of things
like our a I spotted some you know
negative things in here it does seem
clear to me though that that these sites
are gonna have to make more editorial
decisions than they are right now
because they're trying to avoid it as
much as possible so if five to ten years
from now Facebook Twitter have like
editorial teams that actually monitor
this kind of stuff from that perspective
I guess I wouldn't be that surprised by
that they obviously have a lot of
moderate
I'm ready to get rid of you know crap
and troll comments nudity a lot of those
things that are some more often than not
easier to just say like oh okay that's
nudity we'll get rid of it as opposed to
something like harrassment or hate
speech which can fit into gray areas and
remember everybody just as a public
service announcement and thank you to
Greg there's always a block button
syringe oi does bring up that there
there's a very good segregation of
verified marks for articles on Wikipedia
they have different colored stars
padlocks and a whole host of marks not
Twitter could take note from that I I
completely forgot about that feature in
Wikipedia that there's different grades
of authenticity to an article like if
it's been heavily edited by third party
users rather than actually cited from
source that you have to take like it's
like a grain of salt reading I think
that'd be an interesting thing to see
implemented across a lot of different
media platforms yeah somehow Wikipedia
has done a really good job of avoiding
like putting itself in this internet mud
pit that we're all in now where you know
I mean yeah it is also you know an
incredibly rich target like if somebody
wanted to spread misinformation I would
imagine that Wikipedia is a good place
to do it it's been yeah people have
tried to gain Wikipedia for years yeah I
think they have a lot of experience
trying to exact out in certain pages
yeah I imagine the Presidents Wikipedia
page is something that gets targeted a
lot and and I know that like Yelp has
started doing something like this to
where like anytime there's something
controversial in the news involving a
business like that place will be like
bombarded with like negative reviews at
all like out of thin air but like Yelp
has started doing stuff now or like
they'll lock a page if it's like been in
the headlines lately because they know
people will swarm it to like like ruin
its ratings or anything like that all
right so that's I guess that's proof
that there are controls that can be made
to improve things but at this point
especially this year it does feel like
more of like a dumpster fire at Facebook
and Twitter and well I think the thing
is like when you're that big you have to
be a lot more careful and considerate of
like what your moves are when you're
like Yelp is kind of let me
like Yelp is a big website but I think
out of them it's like they can make
these moves without like making any kind
of waves cause like people won't like
scrutinize that or try to figure out
like oh how can I get around this or
anything like that with Facebook and
Twitter they you know they're so big
that like they have to be nimble about
everything they do less they you know
end up like crushing a few things like
by accident because of like the changes
that they've made so do you think that
something maybe along the lines of the
rating system for like movies and TV
would be kind of helpful like what is
appropriate rating people no no no no
rating content rating channel rating one
major concern is like impression ability
of a user if younger users are getting
inundated with conspiracy theories how
long until they just kind of fall down
that rabbit hole themselves maybe that's
that's hard to do online though like
especially like I guess it's different
from movies and TV shows but like if
you're going with like we're gonna rate
like info Wars versus rating like seeing
that or something like that like an
organization like that could always just
ask all its viewers and like rabid fans
who like well I mean we gauge something
Facebook is doing this right now they
did their trust survey and they're
continually doing these trust stories
where they ask their users just those
two questions are you familiar with this
outlet and how much do you trust it and
what they do is in order to eliminate
those like bipolar elements of how boil
tea they eliminate the like factions at
either end so they only listen to
people's and this is a simplification of
it but they only really factor in people
that aren't on the two poles of oil tea
either like I don't trust CNN at all or
I think Infowars is the best thing ever
you know like those people aren't
counted in Facebook's rankings but
Facebook's rankings aren't transparent
they don't share yeah primaries that's
my primary problem with all of this is
is that none of this really seems
transparent they say what the policies
are by the way that they are laid out
and actually met it out in different
like it seems completely I don't know
oftentimes nonsensical it still doesn't
make it I'm not personally trying to get
in
were suspended but it doesn't make sense
to me that you would suspend Alex
Jones's account but not Infowars account
at the same time they're like one and
the same and Alex Jones is just posting
stuff on the info wars site it gives me
the impression that all you have to do
you have to specifically say something
bad on that one account or else it's not
really like it doesn't make it
difference so the argument could be that
Alex Jones could create 24 different
accounts to post things like willy nilly
on all of them and then prevent bands
that way I like this comment from Alex
Mitchell that just came in the problem
the Internet is it's trying to be a good
parent because parents don't want to do
it themselves as the difference between
making things civil and making a child
safe bring back parenting on that note I
myself I'm just kind of becoming
disenchanted with the whole grassroot
things and farming out to the audience
to get the feedback and it's just it's
it's a cesspool guys accepted only
questions except for our chat room but
yeah I don't know I don't know I'm
getting dangerously more and more in
favor of having like what's the msrb
rating board for the internet geez I
know I know I hate that I just said that
out loud but at the same time I hate
what's happening in content right now
except for the show except for this show
that's the problem is that except for
whatever you know like everybody
everybody likes their thing and you know
you know let me push my own conspiracy
theories on this show and it's awful
yeah so breakfast is a scam that's that
as dr. Robotnik did nothing wrong yeah
Wow way to bring it down Ben this entire
show was your fault
okay yeah I don't know what I just said
but yeah I'll take the blame for it
that's fine that's what good parents do
is that take responsibility can we have
something lighter tomorrow to talk about
yes any questions about Alexa and
Cortana being on the same device
election what shoehorn that one in at
the
anyway I kind of have to go yeah we're
out of time but good discussion and
thanks everybody for keeping a level
head the Internet as I said is a
horrible horrible place filled with
trolls and rotten comments so it's nice
to have a civil discussion that's some
good think about big breakfast industry
okay like nobody really wants to eat
cereal in the morning that's not so
hungry right now
okay cereal is not a good meal all right
like cereal they really needed to sell
it on are we done are we still on air I
think we're still on air either way the
brush can't silence me okay the
breakfast is delicious counsel podcast
