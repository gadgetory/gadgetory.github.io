conference south of Los Angeles at the
terranea resort I come to the D
conference every year and report on it
as you guys know this conference is
famous for giving out ridiculous amounts
of schwag last year there were two bags
full literally this year it comes in
this one single canvas bag the hall is
not quite so big it could be because of
the economy finally affecting the tech
industry could be because maybe that
people might be a little gun-shy about
putting their gear in here last year
there were two products that didn't fare
so well there was the pogoplug little
network-attached storage gizmo that had
a tendency the creators thought maybe
after the fact of overheating little but
bit and possibly causing some problems
in the fire department so that product
had to go back and then of course was
the HPV r the palm powered little tiny
phone now a paperweight for those that
have one and everybody went to d has one
so let's see what's in here for this
year and hopefully it's stuff will fare
a little bit better now there's less
stuff in here than there has been in
years past a lot of just ordinary swag
stuff but some cool things so well work
with me here here we go first of all is
a really nice canvas bag all right now
if you come to d you do not need to
bring a full change of clothes at least
outerwear you get a lovely fleece
pullover this is the official d pull
over there is no hidden message on it
inside like there was last year where
they were aching or making fun of Mark
Zuckerberg the secret message inside his
hoodie there's nothing special in here
just please but there is of course
ability because you have to wear a
hoodie these days if you are CEO on
everybody here to CEO so here's the
hoodie it is some free range all cotton
Morgano hoodie thing from
where anyway it's quite nice very nice
cozy hoodie that's the front nothing
lets the back there's a target on it I
don't know this logo I probably should I
think it's so that if you wear this
thing you can take the arrows there's a
hat the D hat and you got your fake cig
bottle from tins i think recruiting
company got your pin from d we've got a
pair of cheap sunglasses from spotify to
go spot by stalking later paperwork and
stuff who cares about that
advertisements the USB key from who
cares ah a book reid hoffman the startup
of you read is speaking at this
conference will be covering that
interesting guy interesting book more
paperwork okay the swag proper parallels
seven this lets you run windows on your
macintosh i expect that when I go up to
that conference hall there i'll see
about three people on Windows machines
on the rest on max that's just the way
the world is going for tech execs it
appears Nasdaq has a little gift box
here maybe to help us forget what they
have done to the facebook IPO let's see
we've got a Zynga ten-dollar game card
for those who have time and not ten
dollars and a set of skull candy
headsets that's kind of potion Thank You
Nasdaq alright let's see two things left
one which is cool
and one which is kind of goofy here's
the Dropcam this is a Wi-Fi video
monitoring setup we've covered the bra
cam products before they're quite good
and they keep improving I don't think
we've covered this one I'm not sure but
this is a obviously the latest from
Dropcam if you want to know who is
inside your house when you're down here
its comforts and finally from true and
company what is in here now I have in
the past I was very pleased when a
couple years ago YouTube Ava gave out
tube socks true and company is an online
bra retailer they have a new algorithm
instead of algorithms for helping women
find the bras that fit them best without
having to go through the measurement
process very interesting company I've
got a review of it coming up so what do
you think is in the box surprise
surprise something to match the bra
you're going to buy from true there we
go isn't that lovely I don't think this
fits me and I'm not going to try it if
you want these lovely lavender panties
drop me a note because I don't know what
to do with them I'll find out what size
they are later on so there you go that's
what you get if you come to the D
coppers in addition of course to a bunch
of really really interesting talks Tim
Cook here speaking is speaking here
tonight Larry Ellison from Oracle guys
from google spotify all over it's a
fatso Nathan Merville speaking tomorrow
very very good conference interesting
speakers will be covering it here check
out newscom for all the latest I'm rate
