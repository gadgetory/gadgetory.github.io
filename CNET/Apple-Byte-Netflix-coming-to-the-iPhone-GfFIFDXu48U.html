show we like to call-- the Apple by its
all the good and bad inside of Apple so
let's get to the stories now as Netflix
coming to the iPhone well the report
from multi-channel news says the video
streaming service is coming to not only
the iPhone but the iPod Touch and the
Nintendo Wii
Netflix keeps pushing its TV Everywhere
strategy where subscribers can already
access the service on their PC or Mac
Xbox 360 TiVo other set-top boxes and
specific TVs now Netflix had no comment
but you can bet this app will be Wi-Fi
only now I love the idea if it happens
so you know I could catch up on past
episodes of Walker Texas Ranger
this is Mexico Ranger you've got no
right I've got no right
I think that's pretty good right hell
yeah it is Chuck damn I really missed
those clips from Conan O'Brien it was
just an excuse to see one but we'll keep
you posted about the Netflix situation
now what would the Apple buy be without
more tablet news we've talked about how
Apple labels and identifies its products
in past episodes and ARS technica has
found a new device in the Preferences
that will support the latest iPhone 3.1
software it's now known as AI prod of
1:1 and it's indication that we're
getting closer to whatever Apple
releases now this doesn't mean this is
the tablet but at the very least a new
device supporting the iPhone OS is
coming soon also it might be time for
gaming companies to pay attention
Apple's touchscreen toys last week
during the intend own conference call
Nintendo admitted that the iPhone and
iPod touch not the Sony PSP is having
the largest impact on the performance of
its DS and DSi sales it's the first time
one of the big three in gaming has
acknowledged Apple as a real threat to
their business and it really didn't
happen this year but I expect we'll see
a larger iPhone gaming presence at e3
and 2010 now let's take a break from the
news and check out the iPhone app of the
week the app of the week is paper toss
come on how could it not be it's free
and you'll flick a paper ball into an
office trashcan with three levels of
difficulty but does it improve your
real-life skills we put it to the test
oh hey guys guys what's up let's playing
a little paper toss over here you sure
all right get out of here with that
cowboy go
Oh
that nice wash I know look
uh-huh if you learn anything from this
video don't mess with the master all
right I pretty much heard enough netbook
rumors and you can probably guess what
that means every day there's a new
netbook rumor and the worst offenders
are these so-called industry analysts
now Barron's claimed a veteran unnamed
analysts had seen a prototype firsthand
and what did we learn well the machine
impresses with its display of high-def
content and it's a better-than-average
movie experience when you hold this
thing in your hands Wow pretty
groundbreaking stuff there guys then the
next day sha woo from Kaufman brother
said Apple has bought screen sizes of
four seven nine ten and twelve inches
over the last two years
you're really covering all your bases
there buddy and predicting Apple will
launch at least one but possibly
multiple new devices in the near future
these guys like to stay in the news but
I hear a new rumor every day and it's
getting ridiculous
so here's some advice until there's
something concrete to say I would
recommend that they shut their pie holes
and bite on a bad apple all right now
another bad apples several of you wrote
in about last week's show telling me
that Google Voice is not a voice over IP
service but a phone service and yes you
are correct I should have been a little
clearer because I meant to refer to the
Google Voice app which might have had a
voice element but CNET was quick to
discipline me this is horrible I cannot
use this where's my dock
two more days Tong you know what you did
you know what I think it's a foul off
here okay nope Oh dr. windows
my hand is still tender okay
um at a launch party a few days ago I
met some great people and after meeting
Michelle I introduced her to a friend as
Michaela what an idiot
so yeah you guys can throw another bad
apple at me so I'm sorry about that
but we'll be here next week with an all
email show for you so send us your
comments or concerns to the alpha-beta
cnet.com i'm brian tom thanks for
watching and come back next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
