Insteon starter kit for $119 it promises
to automate your whole house except this
is not the instant starter kit this is
the instant starter kit the instant
starter kit will give you the three
items you see here this is the Insteon
hub and it's sort of the control center
we've seen this with pretty much every
home automation network with a few
exceptions you get an advice like this
that plugs into your router and then
talk to your devices to help automate
them you'll also get these two which are
lamp link dimming modules and what these
do is they plug into your wall and then
you'll plug the lamp in down here and
that lamp will then be automatable you
can turn it on and off remotely you can
set it to turn on and off automatically
at a certain time you can even have it
turn on and off at the sunrise or sunset
but what you can't do with this entire
system is conditional automation and
that to me is a huge drawback
conditional automation is what we've
seen from services like IFFT and
networks like the Belkin Wemo and the
next a home intelligent system and what
conditional automation means is it just
two different devices triggering each
other so if you walk into a room and the
motion detector sees you it'll turn the
lights on or something to that effect
this system can't do that
it can only automate items in an
isolated fashion you can tell the lights
when it turn on you can tell the motion
detector when to alert you but you can't
have those items work together to
perform complex automations and to me
that's a colossal drawback to this
entire system as for the app itself it
is free for both iOS and Android devices
but it does leave a lot to be desired I
said before it doesn't do that
conditional automation that we're
looking for and this has out a lot of
little things too it feels more like a
beta it's not quite polished the way it
should be
now all that stuff that I just swept
away a second ago those are all upgrades
you can get to this system and if you
decide to go that route there's some
cool stuff that's very very useful
there's this leak sensor you put this on
the floor in your bathroom and if
there's a leak it'll alert you to it
that's great the Belkin Wemo can't do
that another feature about the Insteon
that we like is that it is backwards
compatible with a great deal of existing
x10 devices another great perk no
monthly fees so if you're looking at a
system like the next year you're not
sold on that $9 a month feed
use it take a look at the Insteon
because it doesn't have that and it
still offers you some pretty decent home
automation options so if you have a
specific need for the very specific
devices that instan offers it might
actually be a great fit for you but if
you have any wider aspirations towards
an elaborate network of automations and
systems and rules and items working
together in tandem to make your life
easier this probably isn't the best
system you can look at belkin's Wemo
line of home automation products they
have the Wemo switch the weevil light
switch and the motion detector all of
which we thought were very nice and you
can get the switch in motion package for
$79 that's $40 cheaper than what you get
here it gives you if functionality and
you can plug more than just a lamp into
it you can plug toasters and coffee
makers whatever you want so we think
that's probably a smarter starter kit
for seeing that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
