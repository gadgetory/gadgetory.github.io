turns into a precise output alphas back
in a serious way and we're gonna bring
you the proof the Bible of car tech that
determines how cars look and work and my
top five car electronic heroes it's time
to check the tech we see cars
differently under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost the good the bad the bottom
line this is cement on cars
welcome to see net on cars the show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis we get a lot of cars in
around here occasionally they are all
new models to our shores in the US but
very rarely do they also herald the
return of a car maker that's exactly
what the Alfa 4c is doing the first
volume production car from Alfa Romeo to
come to America in 20 years it also sets
the table for the alphas to come let's
try this little red wonder and check the
tech
this is how alpha is setting the table
for its us come back with a minute
supercard his dead manual rack and
pinion steering you almost never find
that me more
let's drive the Alfa 4c check the tail
ok anatomy of a supercar at in the
middle is a carbon fibre tub that's
where you sit on either end or aluminium
subframes that's what connects you to
the rest of the car behind you is the
engine behind that you're gonna find it
very small and the only trunk it's warm
place you wouldn't take a lemon meringue
pie to the track back there you gotta
put that on the passenger seat the front
looks like a trunk it's not there's just
apparatus in there it only comes off
with tools - people know + -
now while the 4c is little its body seal
is not getting across that thing is like
taking a trip across country well once
you're in it's snug but not tight you've
got an LCD and rather compact instrument
panel up there it's kind of godly
rendered but it gets the information
across the head unit is an afterthought
in fact it's aftermarket that's a parent
Astro and Antwon reviewed one of those
years ago a little bit of app support
but it's kind of a weird little outlier
obviously not the point of the car the
drive controls are you've got
asymmetrical paddles downshift left up
shift is on the right here is your
transmission drive control for your dual
clutch automated manual one is the same
as drive puts you in first gear there is
no park neutral reverse and then your
automatic or manual switch over mode
I don't like many other cars if you grab
a shift while you're in automatic it
holds for a few seconds in manual mode
and drops back to auto this is an
interesting control down here you can
tell somebody an Alfa was in love with
the idea of having a control called DNA
and what it does is control the cars
drive modes its DNA D is gonna be your
dynamic month and down one more gets you
into what they call natural mode and how
do you make a work what is that yeah
it's kind of tortured its all-weather
mode go up to dynamic though hang on to
that guy for like five seconds and
there's the Easter Egg you get into race
mode now your abs and your stability
controller both turned off
you better know your car well first
huge part of the story on the force sea
of course lies back here in the engine
bay mid-engine car rear-wheel drive one
choice on the transmission it's a
six-speed dual-clutch automated manual
now the engine itself 1750 CC
inline-four servo charged of course it's
also got direct injection and multi-port
fuel injection the idea is that each of
those is better at different parts of
the RPM range and driving load range so
the car will alternate back and forth or
blend them the number 237 horse 258
pound-feet of torque gets this car that
weighs about 2,500 pounds up to 60 and
around 4.5 seconds now note that if
you're one of our European or a rest of
the world viewers your 4c weighs a lot
less over 350 pounds less because in the
u.s. we have a lot of crash standard
apparatus especially at the front rear
ends and of course we're loaded up with
air conditioning other niceties that you
can strip out in other markets in a car
like this that matters a lot the fuel
economy if you care is 24 City 34
Highway that's actually really good so
you're getting a really fast exotic car
that sips gas what's not to love first
thing you notice on the 4c which you may
be hearing are all these glorious noises
you've got the spooling of the turbo
you've got the whooshing at the intake
you've got the Popoff valve blasting off
once in a while as they bleed off excess
boost this is the nearest thing to the
sound you get in a Veyron that's exactly
what it reminds me of the next thing
you're aware of is the steering it's
high ratio come
unassisted tuck into a corner like this
and the precision is amazing
there is prodigious power here but
unless you keep it on the boil you're
very aware of turbo lag it's not like
it's not there as either alpha or some
other reviewers will tell you but in a
car like this it's not a big impediment
because you're happy to keep it schooled
up keep your foot in it now Alfa Romeo
doesn't plan to come back to the US as a
value brand but they gotta have this
cars a screeching deal for its exotic
engineering and extremely wearable
handling we're looking at about 55 to
face and then there are three things
we'd have to go see in style that can be
as packages 1,800 bucks I will get you
Park distance sensors the only parking
help you can get on this car better
speakers an alarm and cruise control
Americans like that stuff the track
package for 2400 gets you a firmer
performance suspension some carbon fiber
trim I could live without and a rear
spoiler and if the base exhaust isn't
rowdy enough for you 500 bucks
into the sport exhaust so your neighbors
will fully hate you all in about 60
grand for one of the most distinctive
cars that we've ever driven and perhaps
one of those responsive ones you ever
will
find our full review on the Alfa Romeo
4c at cars dot cnet.com you may think
car companies sit down to a clean screen
when they design a car but it's anything
but that coming up
Wolf's thumb through the book that
dictates much about every car in the
u.s. that's coming up when see that on
cars continues
up until 1967 making cars in the US was
a bit of the Wild West
strong hot blooded safety was only
loosely regulated cars were largely
designed for style drag your chip
rolling through the you read thing then
along comes Ralph Nader his book unsafe
at any speed started a national dialogue
about auto safety Congress held hearings
and on March 1 1967 the federal motor
vehicle safety standards took effect a
vast Bible of safety regulations that
all new cars must conform to if they're
gonna be legal for sale in the US for
example just consider the lowly safety
belt the first thing the FMVSS mandated
back in 67 it says that this device must
have no burrs or sharp edges on its
hardware have only one way to latch it
the belt can be no less than 46
millimeters wide it must adjust to fit a
5th percentile female all the way up to
a 95th percentile male have between five
and six thousand pounds of braking force
have its cut ends treated not to fray
resist UV light and micro organisms and
have the belts maker model manufacturer
date and overseas importer permanently
inscribed on it and that's just a
summary for a belt regulations cover
just about every part of a car involved
in crash avoidance crash worthiness and
post crash survivability from bumpers to
lights shifters to doors mirrors to
buttons
brakes to display panels but if you
really want to see the effects of the
FMVSS just look at a graph as the miles
we drive in the US have soared the
deaths per mile driven have plummeted
the expectation of automotive safety has
radically changed since March of 67 and
car makers now it pays to double check
that every bit of their designs conform
to the FMVSS
welcome back to CNN on cars coming to
you from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well it would be natural for you
to think that your car's main output if
you will is motion but in fact it's not
its heat hence your car's elaborate
cooling system that envelops the engine
in fact about 70 percent of every gallon
of gas or diesel you burn makes heat not
movement that disturbing fact makes for
interesting car tech 101 on technologies
that try to do something better with all
that waste of that roughly 70% of your
car's fuel that is wasted about 85% of
that goes out as heat exhaust systems
grills ducts radiators coolant plumbing
and fans they're all over your car just
to get rid of heat but heat is Just
Energy why waste it why not convert it
that's what car makers are seeking to do
via two main strategies the first is
around the thermoelectric effect that
occurs when connected materials react
differently to heat creating an
electronic differential between them
that generates current spacecraft have
long used this to generate electricity
from the sun's rays
an example is BMWs work on
thermoelectric generators that capture
the heat in the cars exhaust system to
make electricity in a solid-state manner
a 7-series for example needs up to a
thousand watts of electrical power while
running any of that demand you can
offload from the alternator saves gas
researchers at Boise State University
along with Robert Bosch Honda and the
Oak Ridge National Labs are working
under an eight million dollar federal
grant to create better thermoelectric
generators by using nanomaterials they
hope to improve vehicle energy
efficiency by a solid five percent now
another main thrust is turbines Ford is
keen on using exhaust heat to warm up
fluid that creates vapor pressure to
spin a turbine generator and make
electricity sort of like a mini nuclear
power plant without the nuclear part
BMWs turbo steamer project is similar
and they say it'll be on the market in
around six years they're seeing up to a
15
improvement in test vehicles but our
hoping to get a solid 10% in the real
world on longer steady drives now the
real keys to all these technologies are
threefold first prove their efficiency
gains in real-world driving next get the
size of the mechanisms down so they fit
in small cars where efficiency is often
more prized than larger ones
and of course manage the cost so the
fuel savings are not overshadowed by the
price of the ten in a moment hard starts
in the cold and top-5 electronic
technologies that have changed driving
will see that on cars continues
you
welcome to the Vantage GT 3 the most
extreme small aston ever to grace the
roads it's designed for the track not
for crushing continents personally I
think that's a good thing why not add
some more anger and fire into the mix
buy more from the ex car team of C net
UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to C net on cars I'm Brian
coulis here's the part of the show where
I take one of your emails and this one's
coming in from Dillon s in snowy cold
New England and he writes in hey it's
been a pretty brutal winter for us in
the New England area yeah I should say I
own a 2008 BMW 335 X I he writes it's a
coupe today I started my car in minus 10
degree wind chill weather and it started
fine without hesitation but after a trip
back from running errands and parking my
car
a yellow battery light came on this
question is how do I know if this is a
battery problem or an alternator problem
well let's clear up battery versus
alternator Dylan I think that might help
you first of all the battery is
primarily your device for turning that
engine over when you're cranking the car
from dead to a start the alternator
doesn't have anything to do with it it
has to be spinning up later when the
engine is running to keep the battery
charged that's its main task if you're
having a hard time starting your car
initially that's likely a battery issue
if at the end of a drive you come back
and now the car won't start and it did
before that's likely an alternator issue
it's not keeping this guy topped up as
you're operating your car to get a
really good test of how your alternator
and battery are functioning in different
modes you do have to go to a shop where
they've got a pretty elaborate
professional electrical circuit
generator they can check the battery's
abilities to take a charge to deliver
current and also how well the alternator
is replenishing the battery in the
meantime you've got a double whammy
really cold weather causes a battery to
typically send out a little less current
because it slows down the chemical
the action by which it makes electricity
secondly in that really cold weather
your oil gets really thick and kind of
viscous makes it even harder to turn the
engine over from a battery that's
delivering less current so you see how
it's a daisy-chain effect that's why the
toughest test for electrical systems is
often in the coal in the meantime you
might want to look at one of the new
breed of these portable battery packs
that can jumpstart a car or charge your
laptop or charge your phone there kind
of do all devices and they're
lightweight and small now my colleague
Wayne Cunningham did a nice round up of
several of these you can find that at
scene at home by the way on your era of
BMW I think you might have two battery
indicators one for the car service
battery another one for the battery in
your wireless key fob make sure you know
which icon you're seeing that key fob
was supposed to be in that little port
in the dash at least a couple times a
year to keep it charged up now we cover
a lot of automotive electronics here on
this show in general electronics have
done more to revolutionize cars in your
lifetime than any other avenues of
development here are my top five
examples
these are hands-on things you experience
in your car everyday or soon will
number five is infotainment seems pretty
low for something which includes
navigation mobile devices satellite
radio and apps and more but I put
infotainment electronics rather low
because it still lags well behind our
phones in terms of scope and elegance
and until that changes it stays down
here in the cellar
number four is lighting yes General
Motors rolled out smart lighting like
our tronic I some sixty years ago but it
was like something out of a Flash Gordon
movie wonky today Auto lighting
electronics are solid you may switch
your new cars lights to automatic the
first night you own it and not touch
them again for months and soon smart
beam shaping lights will arrive that
will utterly transform the way your car
lights the road not just when it does
number three keys and security it used
to be that when your car was getting
boosted all I could do is sound an alarm
that nobody cared about today security
electronics actually try to stop the
theft not annoy neighbors immobilizing
the car's ignition unless an electronic
smart key is present and that same key
is rarely handled today thanks to
electronics just leave it in your pocket
and the car's door handles and ignition
recognize you even other settings may
follow based on the keys presence it's
ironic that a key we barely have to
touch anymore seems to be getting bigger
and heavier all the time
number two is Road sensing this is a big
one it rolls up infrared radar laser
camera and ultrasound to read the road
detect cars around you and even find and
get into parking spaces alongside you
it's moving us fast from a current world
of driver assist to an imminent world of
self-driving cars the other side of the
coin are the sensors that drive things
like ABS airbags and stability control
those are the big three that have made
huge reductions in many kinds of
injuries and fatalities on the road
before I get to number one I can tell
you it won't be climate control in spite
of having a lot of electronics behind it
it just doesn't seem to have made that
much of a difference tell me you don't
still fiddle endlessly with the heat and
cooling controls as you drive
the number one way electronics is
revolutionized cars lately is in the
power drink today's engines and
transmissions are run by computers
instead of past technologies like
carburetor adjustments or vacuum timing
contraptions and voodoo transmission
tweaks Electronics have made car power
trains more powerful less fuel consuming
much cleaner and with ages between many
service intervals this is also the main
reason your car starts and runs the same
every time
unimaginable a few decades ago and
whether you drive a minivan or an m3
that appliance like quality is the
electronic benefit you enjoy the most
every day thanks for watching I hope you
enjoyed this episode follow me on
Twitter if you want to get sneak peeks
that the cars were shooting or the
segments we're producing for future
episodes of CNET on cars and of course
look for us on any of your favorite
streaming platforms pretty sure you're
gonna find us there I'll see you next
