is a shared experience versus an
individual one what do you think that's
going to do for for people and how they
perceive augmented reality yeah as you
know augmented reality is mixing the
digital elements into the real world
right and it's interesting because we
can share the real world right that we
can both look at the same thing they are
should be no different right it
shouldn't be the matter of fact that I
can look at an AR experience and I'm
seeing something I'm on my iPad or my
iPhone and you can't is this the
beginning of people beginning to have a
common language and understanding of
what it means to create experience like
AR together
well it's interesting point because that
whole commonality even expressed through
the common file format right we
developed with Pixar a file format USP
is e Universal screen scene description
for augmented reality that allows you to
have a common way of describing a
elements that used in any our world
digital elements so that every app every
website doesn't have to create their own
we think AR is a huge thing right we're
bringing it to hundreds and hundreds of
millions of customers you see great apps
that are being developed you saw the
Lego app on stage today it was
unbelievable right those elements take
some work to create so you need a rich
toolset you can't tell the difference
between the a are elements in the real
elements yeah you looked at that Lego
house the one that was the standard
model then you saw the houses build next
they look the same the rendering has
gotten so good with AR can't - it looks
so realistic so you need a great tool
set to create those realistic looking
elements I think so many name brands are
important with a re image like Lego is a
big deal you know get excited Pokemon
was a big deal they're gonna be a
Pokemon experience well yeah pokemon is
it is taking advantage of AR kit you
have to ask them about any communal
shared experience I want them to
announce whatever they have but I think
AR you know was it was you know through
Pokemon was a good example of fact the
world was interested in this sort of
thing right and that was very early AR
if you will that was really got him a
rough mixing of digital into the real
world and we obviously got a lot farther
with a arquette and they started to use
a arquette and now you see experiences
like this today and
it's come it's come a long way baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
