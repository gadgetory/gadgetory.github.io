heart in a lab from scratch you can
become a robot pilot if you happen to be
in Japan and portal is back in a way
you've never seen it before who love
that GLaDOS sera daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show of a nerd universe I'm Ashley
together that's kill anonymous so your
thing the other thing you said I want
GLaDOS actually I would more just say
they say your thing I want Gladys to be
my navigation and you can cuz there's
there's like um you get a GPS yeah
garmin we know what you and you download
it and it tells you the opposite
direction you're supposed to be going
that's so it's like lat on if you're
supposed to turn right it's like turn
left now or do a u-turn if you're
supposed to keep driving straight having
traffic yeah it's really it's really
like doesn't help you out at all but
it's funny yeah I love that so much I
would like the Gladys voice I would like
to be able to pick that as series voice
in my iphone oh it's cuz you're almost
there and treat me like I am the worst
person like just be like you are looking
heavy today like I just want her to be
like I was once a potato like that for
that I would pay for that I'd be amazing
an add-on pack for GLaDOS as Siri that
would be glorious we're not talking
about we're not talking a portal just
yet not yet let's have headlights
Cale finally my dreams can come true I
can now be a robot pilot I can I can go
and try it out I saw this story on
rocket news and I got really excited
rocking news if you're not familiar is
this site that like focuses on mostly
Japanese culture either here in the US
or actually in Japan and so they they
sent one of their reporters to go check
out this 33 thousand pound robot a
called superga Zilla on display in Tokyo
at up at a festival that is called and
this is this is the translation from
rocket news so hopefully it's one
hundred percent correct Odaiba dream
continent dream mega summer festival
which I feel like they should make a
music festival and bring to the US so
there are lots of boots all different
kinds of stuff and this robot was part
of that again 33,000 pounds about 13
feet tall it's heavier than kuratas
sweta bashe heavy industries robot
that's going to fight that other mega
robot next year it's heavier it's
heavier than that robot by quite a bit
and they let you pilot it like you can
actually get in and pilot it but there
is a total catch to this so obviously
they don't want you jumping in there and
rolling around the festival that the
dream dream continent dream mega summer
festival they don't want you rolling
around there and like crushing people
and stuff so what they do is they put
you inside the cockpit of the actual
robot because see these like giant claws
that it has they put you in the cockpit
and you put on an oculus rift and they
have they have they have joysticks on
each side and the seat is hydraulic
controlled so when you're moving it
actually feels like the entire robot is
moving like they've designed it for the
seat and everything to move as if you
are moving in the robot and apparently
the the interface is like incredibly
realistic really really cool and the
seat again moves as you control it and
and so that's how they that's how they
let you be a robot pilot for a 33
thousand pound robot but I mean you
gotta start somewhere you gotta train
you gotta train you can't just take a
giant robot out so let me let me get
this straight you don't actually pilot
the robot well you're piloting
virtual reality so to answer the
question no no you're not really pilot
but it can the robot move for real no
they can move it around yet look it
actually this video made me laugh really
hard because they play this song from a
popular Japanese pop group and it kind
of dances to it like it's hilarious like
really entertainment that's got a damn
but no it totally moves it's a totally
functional robot they actually have see
all those rocks underneath like behind
that barrier yeah it's it crushes those
rocks like yeah the rocks inside these
claws and like smash them in half and
stuff so this is actually functional
kind of dangerous robot so that was the
reason they have like we can't have
people going around slicing people and
have yeah I trust no one to pilot that
thing no not at all that's why they gave
you the oculus and that's cool does that
doesn't cost money to do it or I don't
think they charged the the reporter they
didn't say anything about like a fear
anything you can just go check it out so
apparently i would imagine probably a
pretty good line at the ODB dream
continent dream mega summer festival
that's the best the biggest summer dream
festival dream continent dream mega
summer festival to dreams you got to
dreams to know that's the best festival
name of our logo are we going to that
cool i'll be there next year Odaiba we
got to go there all right okay okay no
no that just just just forget that but
this is it okay guys this is the moment
we've been waiting for I've always said
that VR to actually start selling
headsets needs to create something that
we want to play that let blows our minds
that we that we don't want to end and
that we like it's we're like I'll get a
VR headset for that and this is
basically it and it's a demo that they
showed off for the the HTC vive this is
the headset that valve is making with
HTC in which we get to experience
aperture labs from the portal series
like one of the best games of all times
you get to walk around the lab there's a
lot of different you get to fix a
Peabody Sherman no wait Atlas atlas
sorry you get to fix atlas you get to
look through some different cabinets or
some really funny jokes one in which you
see out look there's cake I know and
they and the guy and they do a voiceover
for this and they point out the fact
that the cake is moldy because that joke
is old right great touch and then of
course these little tiny characters and
it's a little office and you scare them
all of the humor from the portal series
so great in this demo it's only a five
minute demo but from what we can see in
it and there's out it has all of the
charm and it explores portal in a
different way than we've seen before you
don't get the portal gun but you do get
to go around and experience the fact
this world is interesting to a tee yeah
apparently watching this video which is
available and that's that's what you're
watching it's a record off of a leg off
a screen but apparently this does not
even begin to show why this is so
awesome in VR and that's that's the
exciting thing is we really haven't seen
anything from the HTC vive you've seen
things from oculus Samsung gear do you
know they had a trailer at comic-con
like they an actual full trailer where
they people were able to line up and try
the vibe and I wanted to stand in that
line was so long it was like outside of
the convention center like a couple
blocks down by a cupcake shop and I'm
like I want to stay on this line so bad
I don't get to that would have been
worth it um but again this is for what I
know the first thing that they've showed
off and then by far in my opinion the
most interesting and exciting thing that
like I'm like I have to try that I want
to play this game so bad does this mean
there's going to be more of this yeah oh
yeah definitely like come on they're
just gonna build a demo it look like oh
we built this five-minute demo and
there's this definitely not a game
attached this will sell HTC vive headset
I will buy one if they release a full
portal game and again I've been saying
all they need to do is get a game that
makes sense one that you don't want to
put down and one that is an experience
that you have to have to have a play and
this is this is it yep this is a
competition the console seller so this
is like halo for the Xbox this is you
know these are the games that make
people buy hardware and so that I mean
gosh portal all they need now half-life
3 felony yeah that's us saying is any of
those three games left 4 dead 3 I need
any of those a second
I hate that it has to be an IP that we
already know that's gonna sell the
consoles right but it it does kind of
make sense to first to want to explore a
world that we already love ya in a new
way it's all a new way that's so I think
that's so there you go yeah that's um
that's basically that's basically that
you can go check out the video against
five minutes they narrate it there's no
sound to this guy narrates it perfect
narration yeah super ghetto schlump
really I was marriage really well done
yeah but that brings us to our hashtag
of the day for the last article yes it
does which is a TD bot pilot which I
wanted to ask I forgot I'm sorry I'm
getting really bad about forgetting the
hashtags you were excited about Portland
I was really excited about portal okay
um if you could pilot a robot where what
would you do with it what kind of robot
would you pilot what would you want to
do what you want to take the robot and
what would you want to do with it like
if you could just pile it a robot around
and you can't sail I caught on like oh I
want a self-driving car like that's not
the same like I'm talking about like a
yate like a jager type robot or you get
in you like pilot it around and it walks
and stuff uh I probably said do
transformers have jet packs I mean
rocket packs I mean listen in first
course we goin yeah I want a pilot
Starscream yeah so from the Transformers
Starscream cuz I'll have a jet I'll have
a robot that walks around and I'm good
yeah yeah yeah that's what I want I
would want a robot with a 3d printer
attached that makes roads that 3d prints
me plastic roads so I can skip traffic
oh nice see you later suckas and it
dissolves in the rain like just like oh
yeah like cotton candy like spider-man
spiderweb no one else can use it it's
just like basically as soon as i drive
over it my emissions for my tailpipe
just like wipe out the road behind me oh
my god what yeah you're like ice man
does the present wiser oh yeah probably
why don't you turn it to Disney sure i
do disney alright last story but
certainly not the least important this
is rad ok so we've talked about
lab-grown organs before right so we've
talked about people the scientists are
making some really interesting
microscopic versions of the human body
and they want to connect them all
together they wanna make like a nervous
system and a brain and a heart and all
the stuff well that is always relied on
scaffolding so what they do is they
actually will like sell wash like for
example a valve from a pig like a heart
valve they actually sell wash it so that
it can be transferred a new human body
without like more levels or
possibilities of rejection so they
basically like make a scaffolding they
take all they strip it it's all it's
called like cell stripping I think they
strip it and then they rebuild something
like to make it for humans well this is
a first because UC Berkeley has now made
a beating human heart whistles that were
rewound and I'll explain that in a
second without scaffolding they they
taught these cells to make it themselves
into a heart without any like
scaffolding or structure that otherwise
told them how what shape to make them
sounds gross let's see this insane so
this is its microscopic you still I mean
it's not obviously not nearly the same
size as a human heart um what they did
was again without pre-existing
structures to help guide the cells the
cells themselves figured it out but they
did make chemical sort of like no-go
zones so they could tell the cells like
okay well you can build here but you
can't build here so but there was no
scaffolding involved there wasn't like a
premade like 3d printed you know
different there's different types of
materials that you can make like
polymers and things that are like a
scaffolding they didn't have any of that
and what they did was this is insane so
basically they imitated what happens
when an embryo grows its own heart right
okay crazy and how they did this was
this is how I am to understand this and
hopefully I get this right because I
read the story a lot and was like if i'm
reading this right they rewound ordinary
human skin cells backwards to a point
that is called induced pluripotent stem
cells which are basically like they
basically washed them or strip them of
the idea that they were skin cells they
took they rewound them all the way back
to a point where they could say okay now
your heart cells go make a heart science
yeah you're cute because he's making
that no you're making that up that's
just weird
hey I'm gonna rewind these cells as I
said we're rewiring you we believe
rewound these skin cells into cells that
can be rewired to heart cells and go
make yourselves into a heart right now
like that's what they did I don't much
naysay and say that you're speaking
magic words that are true on this show
it makes I feel like I'm speaking magic
words but that is what happened that is
what happened and they want to make
their goal is now to make a full-sized
heart at some point they want to make
full-sized heart these stupid magic
students it's been is this from Hogwarts
sometimes guys science is really a lot
like magic I honestly I think the whole
rewinding the cells thing is could lead
to a lot of stuff yeah well they so
maybe they'll open that can of worms
it's so and it's a great way to kind of
like take cells that exist without
having like because I know there's a lot
of controversy around like embryonic
stem cells like there's a big
controversy there so scientists have
been for a long time trying to find
other ways to sort of make cells that
can go without having to use embryos
which is like very controversial there's
ethical issues involved all this stuff
so that's sort of the thing where
they're like how do we not use those how
do we find other ways to do this and
this is one of those ways to do that I
guess good super weird but you know guys
one of these stories today wasn't true
can you guess which one it was which one
it was it was definitely portal alright
guys we're gonna take a quick break
we'll be right back it's Tuesday I've
got to tell you what movies are coming
out this week cuz knows no video games
and and of course we have your user
feedback in our photog refer today so
don't look away tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a tuesday which is always a great
day because we get to tell you about
some of the stuff that it could be or
probably won't be emptying our wallets
this is new releases so let's just let's
just get this out of the way this is the
thing that will not be emptying my wall
this weekend pixels is coming out nope
so I'm gonna go see this movie though I
won't I wait for it to show up I'm like
I don't know lifetime or something okay
so subscribe moving marshals describe
this movie and then I'll tell you why
I'm saying it is there a way to describe
to me so uh basically we sent a bunch of
stuff in a space that had like a look at
times capsule and some of it was video
games and now aliens are back and they
are literally video games like pac-man
and pack a man is now as Adam Sandler
says which made me very upset pac-man's
a bad guy there he is right very same
yeah a guy I hate it okay so here's the
thing this movie was inspired by a
internet video that came out I want to
say like six years ago in which of like
space invaders were attacking the city
and turning everything into this digital
thing yeah but the reason that I'm gonna
see this movie even though I hate most
of the cast's except for Peter Dinklage
yeah he's gonna be doesn't Allah Peter
Dinklage is because honestly this movie
couldn't have existed in any other
generation time like 10 years ago no but
like it wasn't until now that Hollywood
wasn't until now that gaming is accepted
enough as something that we all
understand that we can make a movie like
this okay I'm and I know that's a really
stupid way to like validate it but I'm
gonna say this to you which is if it's a
bad movie you're setting back video game
movies like just like Super Mario
Brothers people are really excited about
that movie it ended up being a total
mess and it was awful everyone knew it
was bad and now Nintendo is like we're
never making another video game
adaptation movie ever again and all in
like it's just it's set the precedent
for like bat look bad video game movies
and so for
me it's like I don't want to see this I
want to see a good video game movie well
I'm not saying it Ralph that's a good
video yeah exactly okay see that's what
that's what I'm saying is that it isn't
based on one video game its celebrating
video games as a culture and I see what
you're saying wreck-it Ralph did it
right but I don't want the studios to be
like oh this is a terrible movie so
let's not make any more cool video game
movies but if it succeeds I movie will
not succeed would you like to bet on
this can we bet on box office for pixels
uh I'm gonna I'm not gonna be I'm gonna
bet baby please placed on the box office
40 is that serious a 40 million yeah I'm
gonna save an Adam Sandler movie people
go see Adam Sam through in fact see Adam
Sandler movies um I'm gonna say we'll
see here's the thing i don't want to
give a number out because i like I would
rather say what number it'll come in at
the box office I don't think it'll be
number one at the box office I think
it'll be I think we'll come in sir
arthur there's like minions there's aunt
me minions getting up man still yeah and
then look I'm not validating this
movie's existence I will not i'm in my
mind saying okay at least hollywood is
understanding that they're the people
like video games it's excel let's make a
game anna versatile movie about get and
i like that because 10 years ago nobody
was celebrated yeah we were yeah i guess
so and then that's the only route and
also because I probably would've gone to
see cuz that that pac-man scenery goes
up and he's like I'm your father good
boy yeah yeah and then he bites his hand
off oh it so what do you want me to do
should i just go I want usually will see
us a matinee and pay the least amount no
I want you to go see this instead
southpaw with jake gyllenhaal this is
what you should go see this weekend if
you wanted to see a good movie uh it's
get down you know like it's a bit sad
underdog story it's a boxing story
apparently Jake Gyllenhaal so good in
this they say he's like a lock for Best
Actor nomination for an Oscar um this
guy like Jake Gyllenhaal gonz such good
shape for this movie that I think they
said it took him he said it took like a
year to get in shape for this mm did
some of the soundtrack he's got like a
new was it phenomenal the phenomenon I
don't know I feel good name of the song
is phenomenal I was right the first time
and so yeah he plays a boxer and a pair
it's really really good and people are
raving about it his performance in this
so if you want to spend your money this
weekend go see this or if you like music
I was going to say see what Kayla's
gonna see you I'm actually gonna see
this instead oh is it the next one it is
ok so instead of seeing pixels I'm
legitimately gonna see Amy this is the
amy winehouse documentary it has like a
ninety-eight percent on any of the
review sites apparently it's amazing
this is this was shown at South by I
think and to just incredibly rave
reviews yeah she's look look as much no
matter what you think about her
apparently she's just very misunderstood
and this kind of breaks into sort of
that sort of world and what someone who
seems so tortured it's always great to
kind of see inside that person no matter
if you hate them or love them very
interested in and she was a phenomenal
musician yeah only he's a huge Amy
Winehouse fan and so I'm really looking
forward to seeing this ayat was actually
battling whether i want to see train
record this first both of which are
train wrecks um no but I I really really
really really really want to see this
everyone that I saw walking out of the
cuz I'm what's cooking it IA everyone
walking out a theater was just like I
didn't hear their actual conversation
yeah of course they were thumbs up Inge
and they were high-fiving and hugging
each other yeah it was amazing you know
this is a very polarizing um weekend for
movies yes yeah there it's like man you
got to make some choices okay so if you
had to see one movie this weekend I
would go see Amy uh pretty sure Logan
Ant Man oh come on yeah that's fair
enough enough and I would probably also
be go see Amy so there you go I might
see some maybe I'll see southpaw that's
actually I really want to i'll go see
pixels there's a two dollar theater down
the street cause i guess then yeah i'll
go there hours to the box office take
the in a couple months that's a better
idea to all right guys let's talk about
you it's time for user feedback
yeah I also I liked where that into two
we actually that's I want to know what
people how it's gonna stack up from this
please tell us what movie you want to
eat here in the you too because look I
really YouTube comments even you jerks
go ahead and tell us what you're gonna
see there tell us our Q Street on us
yeah okay so we asked you guys yesterday
use the hashtag TV film VR to tell us
what film upcoming movie you want a VR
experience from and what would it be oh
there's some good one so Frank wrote in
and said pandora is meant to be explored
using the rift pause the film and
explore the surroundings avatar 2 that's
a good one that is completely possible
yeah because he waves it he filmed it in
a very VR way he created this technology
in which he has kind of like this tablet
thing and they build the entire pandora
world and he's able to use the camera as
if he's looking through the world and
film it like that I did it behind the
scenes experience with james cameron and
he showed that technology i was just
like this is the future and then they
haven't used it since oh this is so when
he owns it maybe he owns that technology
he's the only one I can use probably but
now they have to do is just flip the
switch and now you're in that world yeah
great awesome will Rodin said a flyover
of the city as the monsters from pixels
as they destroy everything so there you
go fly over the city it's good finally
someone else you're skipping cozy pixels
I don't know you're out now I'm not
proud of the fact that I defended it in
any way I know but I'm trying to make a
very thin point okay that's going to
fall apart or not after the box Rick
writes in and says a VR experience for
upcoming Sherlock Victorians special
where you help Sherlock find clues to a
case I like that it's like a hidden you
knows hidden object games there's like
fine stuff and they solve puzzles and
things like that like that would be
pretty cool I'd love honestly like the
7th guest or the 11th hour is like a VR
game so scary one I don't know it was
from like it was one of the old like
trilobite games where you like yeah I
was like games read like kind of go and
you'd solve these puzzles and it was a
real creepy house and I oh man so so so
so good yeah you're very good yeah deep
deep cuts guys you get gaming deep cuts
for me all the time trolled trilobite
games so welcome to 1992 and then then
hey-soos wrote in and said it'd be cool
to do a VR tour of the GQ tastic Batcave
of bat vs bats vs oops including a bat
wing and Batcave Joyride that definitely
also seems like it could happen that
seems like a go on the Batcave I feel
like WB's and touch enough to kind of do
something I definitely think so Warner
brother seems like the kind of company
you might take a risk but yeah so I'm
really good also I still I still like
that guy's idea from yesterday about
having a date with Harley Quinn through
VR that was my idea yeah that was
definitely uh was his name it rhymed
with kale anonymous I think it right
says close that it doesn't sounds like
all right anyway that's time for our
last chance your feedback which is
always our photog refer of the day
alright so we got it we got a picture
from Andy and this is something
different than what we normally show I
would usually with like landscape
pictures well this flips it all around
we have like a portrait almost there's a
really good portrait picture so Andy
wrote in and sent this lovely picture
very artistic and said hi guys I took
this picture last night at my husband
and thought it turned out really well I
took with my iphone 6 plus love the show
keep up the great work why thanks I
that's a great picture looks like it
could be in an art gallery that's you
need that on a billboard chart on my
phone stop watching tomorrow daily and
go get famous as a photographer yeah
jeez Andy what are you doing with your
life that's incredible that's a really
good picture I love the lighting is the
shadow as well and it's one of those
ones where you can kind of like take
your own like meaning from it yeah wow
it's like a Rorschach test what do you
see in that face what do you see in that
look at it look at how well the definite
ran except the skin I know I know I saw
it this morning and I was just like okay
Wow like that's that's why factor it's
really good if you want to try to beat
that or if you have your own amazing
phone to our you want to send to us you

course or you can find us on social
media we're tomorrow daily on Twitter
but really if you want to strike up a
conversation with the show you want to
come to us individually yeah come to us
individually um and if you have you have
any like conversations you want to have
about pixels you can hit up
at Ashley at Ashley's gala or you can
taxi where you can hit up me at economic
pixel conversations only yeah please no
talk to Caleb out anything else unless
you're Margot Robbie and you would like
to go on a date yes please in which case
please please please contact contact me
and I will figure that out for kale oh
man that would be amazing if you set me
up on a brother I'll be your wingman
cailabe I'm I'm an excellent wingman I
just want to say all right on that note
my friends are friends that is the end
of the show we will be back tomorrow
with a brand-new docket a weird
wonderful science fact in science
fiction blown up in your face and and
doing all sorts of great things but
