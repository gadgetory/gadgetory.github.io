movie lets you edit videos right on your
iPhone for real director lets you do it
even better the acura TL gets a tech
makeover and we count down the hottest
cell phones that are slowly cooking your
brain it's all coming up right now
hey everyone in Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review the show where we
round up the hottest videos of the week
tell you which ones are good which are
bad and offer some tech wisdom in the
form of the bottom line let's start with
the good when Steve Jobs unveiled the
iphone 4 last month he got a huge
reaction when he announced that I movie
would be available for use right on the
phone so what's it like making movies on
your iPhone here's Arielle nunez to show
you how it works it's a new age my
friends TVs on the internet music is on
your iPod and now you can make mini
movies using this I Mario nuñez for
cnet.com and I'm going to show you how
to produce mini masterpieces on your new
iPhone 4 now first you want to go into
the itunes store and purchase imovie for
iphone it's 499 but worth buying if you
ever wanted to dabble with video editing
but not quite ready to drop the big
bucks on a desktop video editing program
now when you first open the app it'll
ask you to choose a theme there are five
generic themes you'll have to choose
from now after choosing a theme you can
start dragging photos and movies that
are recorded on your phone or you can
record them directly from the app you
could trim down clips to your desired
length by tapping on the clip in the
timeline and dragging the yellow lines
by default imovie places dissolves
between each clip that you drop into the
timeline if you want to alter these tap
on the transition icon now you don't get
too many choices here you're pretty much
limited to using the standard cross
dissolves or the transitions that come
with the team you chose and finally
we're ready to add music now our movie
lets you choose tracks from your music
library stored on your iPhone by tapping
on the Audio tab you can sort through
your music and drop them right into the
timeline and it'll show up underneath
your video clips as a green bar now note
that you can only choose one song per
project so choose your song wisely and
now that we're done we can export our
masterpiece I movie gives you three
options to export your movie medium
large and H
II choose a setting in your movie will
be exported directly to your iPhone's
camera roll now I movie gives you the
option to upload directly to YouTube or
to mobileme but the quality will be less
than 720p if you want to upload the full
resolution you'll have to transfer your
video to computer first and is a
masterpiece is born now there are other
options for making movies on your iPhone
but if you want a simple bare-bones
Atlas easy to use and easy to learn you
might want to start with this one first
I Mario nuñez for cnet com with your
how-to for making masterpieces on your
iPhone
so yeah I movie looks pretty fun for
editing quick clips while you're on the
go but unless they come up with some
more themes everyone's iPhone movies are
going to end up looking pretty much the
same luckily I movie isn't the only
phone based editing program in the App
Store here's Brian Tong with his look at
real director
let's do the twist welcome to tap that
app guys i am brian Tong and this is the
show what we cover the hottest apps in
the mobile space now we've all heard
about the iphone 4s imovie app for
editing movies but i've got one for you
that takes it up a notch with its
feature set it's called real director
it's 499 the same prices I movie and it
runs best on the iphone four and 3gs but
you can also use it on the ipad ipod
touch and iphone 3g but its features are
a little more limited there the learning
curve on this app is higher than I movie
but for most people willing to try this
out it's definitely worth it now you
have your standard timeline and the
ability to add videos or still pictures
one thing that really stands out right
away is that trimming your clips in this
app is a lot smoother and more specific
compared to iMovie and you can also
split a clip into two separate parts in
real director as well now your eye candy
options blow I movie out of the water
you're getting 28 different transitions
to use between clips and there are eight
different title styles that can be
positioned in nine different locations
you can also create still images from a
frame in your video and you won't find
that in iMovie and anyone who wants to
do some real sound editing real director
allows you to control the volume levels
for specific clips in iMovie it's either
on or off now obviously there are a few
drawbacks the interface is a lot more
complicated if you want to see your
whole movie in its entirety you'll have
to wait and render out the whole project
where I movie lets you watch your
project at any time and the biggest
Bugaboo you do not have access to your
ipod music files so you can either use
the phones Mike to record audio or you
have to add music wirelessly by
connecting to your computer over Wi-Fi
and importing them and that might be a
deal-breaker for you now overall if you
want the most extensive video editing
app on a mobile phone real director is
the app that you'll want to tap now it's
499 we love all of its eye candy and
editing features but it really needs to
resolve its clunky music import feature
that's gonna do it for this week's show
if you have any suggestions send them to
tap that app at cnet com I'm
right talk and we'll see you next week
come on sure real director has a lot of
features but if you can't directly
access your itunes music I still think
I'm movie has the advantage either way
it'll probably be a while before any of
our producers give up on Final Cut Pro
on their max now if you're more
interested in sitting back and watching
movies than in creating them that's okay
too after months of speculation paid
subscriptions have come to Hulu and now
Hulu Plus has come to your hand helds
ever since Hulu first started streaming
TV shows on the web mobile phone owners
have been wanting a version of their own
well here it is I'm Tessa kadhal court
with cnet and here's your first look at
hulu plus 1 point 0 for iphone ipad and
ipod touch hulu plus organizes hulu's
vast content catalogue into several
categories because of its larger screen
size Hulu Plus on the iPad is pretty
easy to navigate around among TV shows
movies and your queue you can also
search for specific titles or browse by
what's featured popular or recently
added we're less enamored of the iphone
apps more cluttered layout although the
small screen size doesn't help getting
around the app could be easier you can
still search and sort by popular and
featured content plus TV ships but other
content is harder to get to movies in
your queue for example are hidden in the
more screen and from there you can
search movies by title or genre as far
as video quality goes it was excellent
when streaming over strong Wi-Fi and 3G
signal but weak signal caused all sorts
of pixilation hiccups and occasional
crashing luckily videos resumed in
almost the same place each time they cut
out though the app really could benefit
from the ability to download shows well
signal is strong for later viewing when
signal is weak particularly for monthly
subscribers the Hulu Plus app itself is
free and there is a corpus of new TV
shows you can also watch without charge
the same as you would do from your
desktop or laptop computer however most
of the content does require a Hulu Plus
subscription which costs ten dollars a
month while it's reasonable to charge
customers for premium content like
movies the fact that hulu is also
streaming ads for monthly subscribers
leaves many users feeling cold including
us come on hulu ads or monthly charges
pick one or the other the brand new app
has ways to go before it can win over
the majority of Hulu Watchers but we're
glad to finally see Hulu acknowledge its
mobile fans I'm jessica's all cord and
this has been Hulu Plus for the iPhone
and I
all I can say is thank goodness for hulu
plus I came for the glee but I stayed
for the Buffy all seven seasons okay
this next video has absolutely nothing
to do with movies now they're making
them or watching them I mean I guess if
there were still any drive-in theaters
around you could drive the new acura TL
there but parking it seems like such a
waste
acura TL is a nice enough car but loaded
up with all the electronic and
performance options and it becomes
something entirely different a really
desirable car let's drive the TL super
handling all-wheel drive with the tech
package and check that text the TL is
acuras best-selling car if not its
prettiest it's burdened with just about
the most extreme execution of Acuras
ungainly corporate face but luckily you
don't see that in from the driver's seat
instead the tack and the tech portray
this car is true nature this by the way
is the fourth generation of the TL and
its current styling is an interesting
combination of the rate knife light
edges of a Cadillac combined with subtle
curves that look like they could have
been lifted from infinity RTL is loaded
to the gills let's get started go to the
screen that's where things begin this is
a car that's got a very bright hi res
display makes it really easy to get to
things because finally acura honda
recently revised their menu system which
was getting really long in the tooth the
geography is about the same but they
finessed it in a lot of different ways
and of course they've done wonders for
the resolution and the rendering of the
graphics they use a controller like most
car makers so on this one you've got
this rubbery ring you turn that also has
a kick function on the crown above it
and an enter function on the middle of
it things move pretty briskly because
like most cars that aren't cheap today
it's hard drive based you've got
multiple ways to view the map of course
bird's-eye and top-down and directional
stuff that's all pretty standard you
also have traffic on this car provided
by XM navtraffic which also brings in
weather stock quotes sports scores now
the audio system is upgraded as part of
this tech package a lot of things are in
this mix including the ELS surround
sound system that's a Panasonic unit
done in conjunction with Elliot shiner a
legendary recording studio guy you've
got audio disc ability on this guy but
one disc at a time they compensate for
that by giving you the hard drive the
output on this guy is pretty robust 440
wats 7 dot ones surround capable as you
see DTS Dolby PL to all decoders are
built into this guy am FM of course no
HD radio on this guy XM is your
satellite radio and your traffic stock
sports and weather acura still drunk on
buttons as you can see they create
lots of them in here to kind of make up
for that in my mind what balances it is
that they do use this dual display
technology so you can have your map up
on the top there and be enjoying your
navigation scenery and at the same time
have a full crisp display of things like
time your media setting your climate
settings I like when cars do this now as
I mentioned rather a treat in this car
is a manual transmission in a vehicle
that has a lot of performance we almost
always see automatics or dual-clutch
gearbox is a lot here's our six-speed
manual it's a pic on this car by the way
same price as the automatic now I don't
know of a car company that does as much
of a showcase presentation of their
engine look at this thing at this big
plastic skirt all the way around the
engine that's how important it is in
this car because we have a super
handling all-wheel drive TL that's more
than just a drivetrain change on this
car you get bumped up from a 3.5 v6 to a
3.7 liter v6 up from 280 horsepower to
305 horsepower 273 foot-pounds of torque
your MPG comes down a notch from 1826 on
the garden variety TL to 1725 on this
guy not bad and 0 to 60 is about a five
and a half second affair
if you watch a lot of our scenic car
tech videos you know I'm not one to gush
over most cars I'll leave that to every
other bloggers but I'll tell you what
this car needs some gushing this is one
of the great driving sedans we've ever
had in our scenic garage in the last
handful of years the power comes on like
that it never gets breathless super
smooth and silky just a great motor and
of course the super handling all-wheel
drive does its thing now I'm not on the
track so I'm really not taxing it but
the car just maintains its bias
perfectly it's pulling and pushing all
the right directions evenly through
turns just a nice driving experience and
thank you so much honda for this 6-speed
manual and a great clutch to go with it
real linear and the gearbox while not
the best I've driven is real good
there's one word I had to apply to this
car its balance the power the suspension
the comfort the overall usability of the
car the tractability of all the control
inputs everything is balanced and seems
to fit as a whole this guy nails it ok
let's price a 2010 TL 36 grand out the
door base but that's for a standard TL
that's not what I'm driving this is a
super handling all-wheel drive TL with
tech so the super handling all-wheel
drive part which is both the drivetrain
and the 3.7 motor above the 3.5 that's
going to add thirty five hundred dollars
another 3700 is required for the tech
package hard drive nav hard drive media
playback the ELS audio system so add
eight grand but you get a sweet package
did he just say es el audio system
that's pretty sweet oh he didn't say
that okay well nevermind then and with
that it's time for a break we'll be back
with more tech review in anywhere from
two to thirty Seconds feeling lucky
welcome back to the cnet tech review
your weekly digest of all things good
and bad from cnet TV where were we oh
yes it's time for the bad touch screens
are all the rage smartphones tablets
media players but somehow it doesn't
always translate to pcs quite as well as
it should in some cases that's because
the touchscreen doesn't respond to the
touching sorry gateway hi I'm Rick brown
senior editor for CNN com today we're
going to take a look at the gateway one
ZX 6900 01 e this is a 999 dollar
touchscreen all-in-one it's available at
retail to fix configurations so what
which sees what you get here pretty much
now it is actually a touchscreen desktop
there's a little kind of corner up here
you can peel back and you can get the
gateways touch application interface
it's not really that exciting though
there's some basic apps there's a little
paint app there's a map application
there's some media browsing tools most
of them feel a little bit slow though
and the touch response in general is not
that great with this pc but we can show
you how unresponsive it is so here's the
corner where you peel it back to get to
the main window screen and you can see
we've got our finger on it dragging
across nothing is happening it's either
the software the hardware but somewhere
along the way gateway needs to do some
more work here that said that we really
like this system both because of its
price and the other features that come
with it so this is a large 23 inch
screen that's pretty big for a sub
one-thousand-dollar all-in-one it's 1920
x 1080 so that means 1080p resolution
and it also comes the blu-ray drive that
makes this a perfect home entertainment
system if you want to stick in an office
then there's a 2.93 gigahertz core i3
cpu inside you get 4 gigs of ram and an
integrated intel graphics chip so for 3d
it's not that great otherwise this is a
fairly standard all-in-one you've got a
webcam up here a few connectivity ports
around the sides there's a USB here on
the left side on the right side you also
get an SD card reader a couple audio
jacks and you can see the blu-ray slot
here you also get a few more USB ports
on back as well as an Ethernet input
couple audio jacks you also get an east
side
Jack which lets you connect faster
external hard drives and there's an HDMI
output despite a few complaints this
very well may be the best all-in-one
under a thousand bucks the giant screen
the blu-ray drive and the fast cpu
really make this a very capable desktop
so I'm rich brown this is the gateway
one ZX 6900 01 e it's true it does look
like a pretty good little kitchen
computer other than the touchscreen
factor maybe they should just stop
telling people it does that and then
when it works it'll be like a bonus now
I think the best thing about the gateway
is actually the built-in blu-ray player
that lets you watch HD movies on that
nice big screen and if that's important
to you you might just want to buy one
because hooking up your laptop to your
regular TV is not as easy as it sounds
take a look hi I'm Scott sign senior
associate editor cnet com and you
probably already have a laptop and in
fact you may already have some TV shows
streaming videos that you want to share
and other great entertainment stuff
built into that package but how'd you
get it onto your TV well it's pretty
easy in fact with most laptops nowadays
and we'll show you how first wouldn't be
great to connect your laptop wirelessly
and I'd have to connect it at all to the
TV and still have a play audio and video
well sure that sounds fantastic in fact
there are some laptops that already have
the technology built-in it's called
intel wireless display there's $99 you
have to pay for a little box that plugs
into your TV that facilitates the
wireless connection sometimes it's
bundled in with the laptop and in
addition while it works and shows audio
and video it operates at a bit of a
delay and it will not play DVD or
blu-ray content it will only play
streaming video content now one thing
that all these laptops do have
increasingly is hdmi and it's really
simple to use hdtvs have hdmi and when
you plug it in it's generally as simple
as plugging the hdmi cable here plugging
into the TV turning both on and the
image gets carried over onto this TV now
certain laptops are not automatically
set up to activate that connection to
the TV you have to turn off mirroring
which is
your control panel settings and once you
do that you select the display which is
your HDTV it'll be labeled by your
manufacturer name like Samsung so you'll
know that that's the display and then
you'll be able to pull down the settings
and select 1920 x 1080 your full
resolution provided it is 1080p what's
great is that audio gets seamlessly
transferred over to the TV another way
to connect to a TV that every single
laptop has is vga now not every single
television as a VGA port but there are a
lot of hdtvs that do if you connect vga
to vga you'll get the video signal but
you won't get the audio so what you're
going to have to do is connect through
your headphone jack which will transmit
the audio out you can connect it through
a splitter which you can pick up a radio
shack or you can actually hook it up to
speakers if you don't want to hook it up
directly to the TV for macbooks macbooks
and all Apple laptops do not have hdmi
and that's often complained about for
Apple users the good news is that mini
DisplayPort while it is not a direct
connection can work exactly like HDMI
with the purchase of one little
accessory they Griffin mini displayport
to hdmi connector this cost about 30 to
40 bucks when you plug it into the mini
DisplayPort on all current macbook and
macbook pro models it will not only
transmit the video but audio and we
tested it out here it works great it
even works in a 5.1 surround of course
there are a lot of other solutions to
including how do you get real audio
files surround sound hooked up to your
true receiver how do you take advantage
of certain refresh rates that's more
complicated stuff maybe we'll cover in
the future edition but for now that's
how you hook up your laptop to your TV
depending on which one you have
hopefully it's simple and easy enough to
understand I'm Scott's time to cnet.com
so I guess if you want to connect your
macbook to your TV there's an adapter
for that haha I'll be here all week
alright let's just move on to this
week's bottom line San Francisco just
passed this new law requiring cell phone
retailers to display how much radiation
each phone gives up well the five phones
in this week's top 5 will probably be
flagged with flashing lights and a siren
so you want to buy a really hot
smartphone these will fit the
description both ways they're desirable
and they spew radiation I'm Brian Cooley
with a scene at top 5 this time we're
ranking smartphones based on their SAR
for specific absorption rate which tells
you the watts of power absorbed per
kilogram of tissue now there's never
been a clear connection made between a
phones SAR rating and dying but for me
I'm gonna play it safe and look for a
loan number until they figure this out
anyway here are the high numbers number
five is the tmobile dash 3g with a Tsar
of 1.47 not too far from the US
government limit of 1.6 nice keyboard
slick design GPS 2 megapixel camera and
it's not on AT&amp;amp;T so it's got that going
for it number four is the palm pixi plus
also at a toasty 1.47 SAR one of the
sleekest smartphone designs ever and it
runs the much-loved Palm webOS but HP
just bought palm and their CEO mark hurd
recently made it clear they didn't do it
to be in the phone business so this
might not be a great pick unless you
like buying your phones on eBay number
three is the motorola droid at a SAR
rating of 1.49 no phone has done so much
to propel the android operating system
as this squared off little bacon fryer
great touchscreen power to really run
android well and it has access to the
only collection of apps that ever causes
apple to lose at least a little bit of
sleep just bring a foil hat number two
is the blackberry bold 9000 with a SAR
rating of 1.51 this guy revolutionized
blackberry display and interface quality
supports fast hsdpa data connections
just not for me and was the first
BlackBerry that could at least pronounce
multimedia the latest version the 9700
loses the annoying little pearl ball
that always seems to get food stuck in
it which is kind of handy because you
can cook it by just making a call before
we get to the number one dirty
smart phone what about the iphone well
the SAR on that model varies by which
iphone you have the 3g is the dirtiest
at 1.38 the very first iphone the
original much cleaner at point nine
seven and the 3gs is the best at point
seven eight steve wants you around buy
more apps at number one is another
blackberry the ubiquitous curve 8330
with a SAR rating of 1.5 for hard up
against the limit guys don't lay this
one in your lap if you like getting
father's day cards curves are everywhere
because they're on multiple carriers
there's always a pricing promotion that
pretty much makes them free this little
pocket Chernobyl is arguably the most
successful smartphone ever because it
has so many variants everyone loves the
keyboard and let's face it your company
will probably make you carry one at some
point but it's a crappy web device and
not a good choice unless you like your
bacon crisp that's it for this edition
of seen that top five use a headset i'm
brian cooley see you next time
the bottom line this week Brian just
said it use a headset or maybe speaker
phone because dorky all right the good
news is that all you iphone users still
have a pretty good shot at procreation
thus ensuring future generations of
Apple fanboys and that's our show for
this week everyone tune in next week for
an all-new look at the tech week that
was until then you can always find more
great seen that video at cnet TV com see
you next time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
