at CES in 2016 and check it out I'm in
the Bosch super connected crazy car I
kind of wish they build this car because
it is beautiful but let's talk about
some of this technology now some of the
really cool things that I've got in here
is a whole screen that's got some haptic
feedback and I've got a whole suite of
connectivity but personalization as well
as interaction between the car and
myself so one of the cool technologies
that Bosh is developing is being able to
be connected to my home while I'm in my
car so for example right now I've got a
visitor at the front doorbell
so I need to go into you automatic modes
of the car engage it's going to drive
for me and then this guy's here he's
gonna deliver a package so I want to
start a conversation okay so my visitors
told me that he's got a package for me
so I'm gonna open the front door secured
and I can see everything that is
happening confirming with my fingerprint
there we go that control now now I can
control everything by touch but of
course there's also a lot of cool
gestures so when I go to my music and
I've got a ton of options right but you
need to kind of scale those down a
little bit so I can choose here on the
sensor looks like I'm pretty happy I'm
always in an epic mood I'm kind of
relaxed and progressive and by changing
those things around it will give me less
choices in my music and help me make a
better choice for my driving so another
way that it's connected to my home is in
terms of security when I arrive home I
want to make sure that I can check all
my security cameras and then it will
show up on the display here yeah all my
security cameras are good no one's
hanging out at my house I don't have any
stalkers awesome I can also check my
security system and will tell me that
all of my systems are 100% go alarm
system is good cameras good I can also
check my car surroundings so I press
that button it will give me a 360 degree
view of anything that's around my car
says it doesn't see anything so we're
all good to go and I can go ahead and
pull into my home and then once I get to
my home the cars gonna park itself
that's just amazing
now Bosch seems to think that all of
these things will be available by 2020
it's a little quick to me but hey you
know how technology goes you never know
how fast it's gonna move
so there is a lot of haptic feedback in
this car as you would expect for example
in my climate controls if I want to just
move my climate controls as high as
possible I just swipe here and when I
get to the very end I get a little bump
so I know exactly what I've reached the
highest point so that's a great way for
me to be able to keep my eyes on the
road and operate my climate controls
without even looking at it of course
there's a lot of other cool features
here on the Bosch part of the future
including personalization where you can
choose your own colors and kind of make
this car your own that's it for now from
CES 2016 this is Emmy Hall frissina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
