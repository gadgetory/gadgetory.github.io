months that Alienware Dal's in-house
gaming brand was going to announce
something very different at CES 2019 the
big reveal turns out to be the new area
51 M laptop a huge 17 inch gaming system
that Dell calls the world's most
powerful gaming laptop it's the product
of several years of design and
engineering work looking for new ways to
present a very familiar product now if
you're thinking hey isn't the area 51 a
desktop well you're right that very
desktop specific brand was chosen
because of the desktop level components
inside the ninth gen Intel CPU and 20
series overclockable NVIDIA GPU are both
modular which means they could actually
be upgraded at some point although
especially in the case of the GPU that's
really high clinical at this point
because you need a compatible new part
to swap in the look overall is
streamlined made from a magnesium alloy
and available in either white or matte
black and it's easily the most
sophisticated looking at me where to
date although it's definitely not slim
or light there's still a 17 inch monster
that weighs about eight and a half
pounds but somehow the screen still
manages to work in pretty slim bezels
plus a 144 Hertz g-sync display and Dell
claims it'll stay cool which is easy to
believe considering how many vents
around this thing including some new hex
shaped ones on the bottom boot
configurations will get expensive but it
actually starts at just around $2,000
and should be available on January 21st
more portable than that is the new
Alienware m17 that's you've guessed it a
17 inch version of the existing m15
model he's a very slim and understated
at least as far as Alienware goes and
the company says it's its thinnest and
lightest 17 inch family and wherever but
it does use the older Alienware design
language not the new area 51 style still
for a non gigantic gaming laptop that
doesn't skimp on performance I'm liking
the m15 so far and the m17 looks like
more of the same it'll come with 8th gen
Intel CPUs and up to Invidia r-tx 2080
max-q graphics card starting again
January 21st adds
16:50 and up but these are all
definitely on the expensive side
fortunately Dells budget gaming systems
have been broken out to something called
the G Series previously these were
basically mainstream Inspiron laptops
with GPUs but now that g5 and g7 models
are giving a design makeover to better
straddle that line between gaming and
non gaming laptops previous versions of
this have been huge value favorites for
us and I'm sure that is going to be true
of this version as well starting at
$9.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
