Street poke into our Facebook
connections and become the next six
second video star I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update in Apple's
recent earnings report the numbers were
great record sales of iPhones and iPads
as usual and Apple made nearly 55
billion dollars in revenue and that's
just in the last three months of the
year but even with the good numbers
investors are running for the hills
that's causing apple's share price to
drop why well because investors thought
apple would do even better investors
don't care about how Apple did they want
to know how Apple will do and Wall
Street seems to think apples growth is
starting to slow down during the
earnings call CEO Tim Cook wouldn't say
much about apple making its own TV other
than a cryptic statement quote there's a
lot we can contribute in this space so
we can continue to pull the string and
see where it leads us cook also told
investors that Apple is improving its
trouble maps app with better satellite
and fly over imagery as well as more
info on local businesses Netflix also
had a good 4th quarter which surprised
analysts netflix added more than two
million new streaming subscribers in the
US Netflix is also set to premiere its
exclusive TV series house of cars on
februari first and will be the only
venue where you can watch new episodes
of Arrested Development starting in May
hundreds of 18 p u-verse customers have
been dealing with an outage for several
days that has knocked out access to TV
internet or phone service throughout 13
southern states a TD has only said the
problem has to do with a server and the
company is saying it will give refunds
in some form if you want to dive into
what makes your Facebook network tick
head over to the Wolfram Alpha site the
organization enhanced its facebook
analytics tool to find statistics on
your network of friends you can filter
through location of friends their ages
or perhaps even see a visualization of
where all your married friends live or
find out who is the most popular friend
from your university and in the future
there will be even more ways to break
down data about your network there's
new app for the iphone and ipod touch
called vine which lets you create and
share short looping videos the video is
limited to six seconds and you can
choose to have the sound on or off and
with it being so short the idea is that
you can share a quick window into a
moment of your world or chop it up into
something quirky you might think of it
as an Instagram for video letting people
get creative and share on social media
Twitter owns vine so you can have these
videos embedded in your tweets but you
don't have to use Twitter to share the
videos that's your tech news update for
