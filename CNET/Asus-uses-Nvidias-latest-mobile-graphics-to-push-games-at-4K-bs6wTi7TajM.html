pc gaming i'm dan ackerman and this is
the ax sous g75 one this is one of the
first laptops that we've seen with the
next generation of nvidia graphics cards
it's the nvidia geforce gtx 980 m and
what that means is that really the first
generation of mobile cards that can push
pc games and reasonable settings at 4k
resolution which i think is super
exciting and really one of the only
reasons anyone should be interested in a
4k TV or 4k monitor because there's not
really a lot of twerking video content
out there but you can take almost any
game and at least try to push it to
those higher resolution settings and
it's actually a really breathtaking
experience if you get it to work right
now of course in the 17 inch laptop like
this big bulky desktop replacement
gaming laptop you don't actually get a
4k screen just a regular 1920 x 1080
screen it's not even a touchscreen but
what you would do is you take this guy
and output it via HDMI to your 4k TV or
your 4k monitor and then I've had a lot
of luck running recent games at 4k
resolution usually it low to medium to
high medium settings if you have some
older games you can crank wazzup as far
as they'll go and up to 4k resolution
and it's really a lot of fun and it
looks great of course if you want to get
the optimal sort of visual performance
you really do want to turn up all the
graphic settings in which case you want
to keep it at 1080 but the the 980 card
in here paired with a a current-gen high
on core i7 an interesting 24 gigs of ram
and a very nice storage combo 256 gig
SSD and a one terabyte regular hard
drive so plenty of room to download and
store a lot of games looks fantastic you
know if you're playing at 1080p which
you can do right here on this screen or
on an external monitor of course this is
not the fanciest looking gaming laptop
out there right now a lot of the newer
ones have gone you know very kind of
thin and light but with that you can't
squeeze in the 980 card or the
higher-end cards you're pretty much
stuck with a card that's kind of the
middle of the last generation you see
that some of the slimmer gaming laptops
that's perfectly fine but if one a very
high-end
top gaming experience you're gonna have
to make some trade-offs and in this case
your trading performance for for a
thicker heavier kind of a dorm room you
looking body here there couple of
interesting buttons on here one directly
launches steam for you if you have steam
the pc game software installed another
one launches invidious shadow play game
recording in case you want to take your
gameplay footage and record it or stream
it online and of course all this is not
inexpensive it starts at 24 99 with all
the parts that i listed here you can
actually get a much less powerful
version of this about 1500 but really
want which about it i'm dan akron and
that is the asst g75 one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
