beer pong this isn't our idea this is a
very popular video that's been going
viral this week that we saw and you know
we've got plenty of robot vacuums around
so we wanted to give it a try so here we
are
we've got we've got two teams on this
table here we have a Roomba and on that
table area of a neato
so it's team Roomba vs. team neato and
it's beer pong only have to hit the
moving target so nearly seem to be
moving with much conviction how did we
arrive at this arrangement of cups yeah
I think magic and science yeah we were
so with the neato we had to try to not
block the sensor so it would actually
move and then with the room but we got
to use like the traditional beer pong
formation oh I'm sorry
I will be back
alright I'll drink it if you hit the
shot I'll bring ya oh the pressure was
on right all right all right rich
pressures on we haven't hit a couple of
all here we go we haven't hit a couple
one somebody's got a hit up oh the open
what the parties are a sash Lee Thompson
all right chance here we go so this is
obviously our first time playing this
and sorry camera guy failed somebody
asked the one this is an AI robot and
this is a neato
that's a neato said anybody wondering
add some more just wait neato bought
back connected okay
perfect you know your leave it you got
to lead the robot
I lost track of who's trying goes around
I can hear ya
I do it's just such a huge fan of that
any questions
somebody commented when the boss walks
in we're all fired he is just not
getting anything
reflect on their ability to vacuum let's
say yes let's say that the winner of
this gets editors choice that's why that
ones leading team Brown finally gets one
all right not before the July everyone
and if you have two rumbas we recommend
that you try these shenanigans because
it's very enjoyable and spice all right
bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
