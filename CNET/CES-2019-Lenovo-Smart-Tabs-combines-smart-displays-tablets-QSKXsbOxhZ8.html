kind of a genius combination of features
look in this form it's a tablet an
ordinary Android tablet it has the apps
you've come to expect you can email you
can play games you can do tablet stuff
and take it with you as you would that
ablet put it into this stand which comes
with it and it becomes an Amazon echo
show complete with the always listening
Amazon assistant so you can give voice
commands you can listen to music you can
check the weather you can check your
calendar and it has the visual cards
that come on the echo show Lenovo worked
with Amazon on this device so it's
basically a full-on smart display when
you're not using it on the go and then
you get the power of a tablet for when
you need it the only thing missing here
is Amazon's communication suite the echo
show lets you drop in on other shows
lets you make voice calls and video
calls that won't be available when this
launches this month but it's due out as
a feature update later this winter so
when it's in the dock here it can act as
a central family hub for controlling the
smart home playing music all the things
a personal device like a tablet isn't
normally good for but then when you want
to bring it with you it has the full
computing power so you can surf the web
and check emails it has the things that
I sometimes miss from an ordinary smart
display I kind of wonder why more
companies haven't already tried this
plus the fact that it has Android built
in allows you to watch youtube videos
Netflix and do the things that aren't
actually accessible on the echo show
plug it into the dock and you'll get the
full screen experience with the
speaker's of the base you can pre-order
these smart pads now and they're due out
later this month there's two different
versions of them they have mostly the
same functionality but this one's a
little sleeker it has a little more
memory it has a fingerprint sensor and a
couple of other nice extras for when
you're using it
tablet mode plus they're both pretty
reasonably priced the p10 is $300 and
the m10 is 200 compare that to the echo
show which is 230 and doesn't double as
a tablet and I actually really like the
pitch of the Lenovo smart tab lenovo
says it's aimed more at tablet users
than smart home users but I actually
think this combination of features could
work pretty well for both
