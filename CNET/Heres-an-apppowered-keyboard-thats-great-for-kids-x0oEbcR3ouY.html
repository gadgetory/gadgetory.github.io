piano this is a keyboard that leverages
the power of your phone or tablet works
with iOS and Android devices plugs right
in over here then you pull up the one
smart piano app and then you can go
check out video lessons or you can play
games you can do all sorts of cool
things with this that you couldn't do
with a normal keyboard one of the really
cool things about this keyboard are the
LEDs that are built into each of the
keys and what that means is I can bring
up a piece of music here on the iPad and
then play along on the piano with the
keys lighting up and telling me what
notes to play so here I've got a piece
of music by Johann Bach and if I start
it right here at this low C go to this G
this D you can see the lights are
lighting up as I play and I can learn
how to play the song a little easier
it's kind of a nice guide you can also
do it by left hand part or right hand
part or both hands at once nice and
customizable I think it's a good way to
help you learn a song those LED keys
also come into play with these video
lessons if I tap here you can see I get
these 105 tutorial lessons basically
10-minute piano lessons I can follow
along with so here you see I'm following
along with the piano riff from the
tonight shows thank you notes and I can
should learn how to play this as the
keys light up and now it's kind of hard
here he's doing it all once he'll slow
down and show me each note each part
it's a pretty handy little tool I like
it a lot the app also has sort of a
guitar hero mode for the keyboard where
you can load a song and play along and
try and get a high score there aren't a
whole lot of songs to pick from but it's
kind of cool okay
hey not bad
the one smart Keyboard retails for $300
there's also a full sized version that
has the full 88 keys for 1500 that's a
lot to spend but honestly this keyboard
is pretty cool I like it and if I was a
kid and I learned to play the piano I
think I would enjoy using the app to
follow along with a lesson or learn a
new song to impress my family and
friends so if you have a kid that like
the piano or you want to learn yourself
maybe give it a five we've got enough of
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
