for cnet.com and I'm do with the jaybird
blue bud X earphones these are a
Bluetooth wireless model and they are
designed for sports layer sports
Bluetooth model and they claim to fame
of jaybird earphones is that they fit
securely in your ears because they have
these little wings on them you can put
the wings on two different ways sort of
one over the top of the inside your ear
and one that kind of tucks in beneath it
the presser thing about these earphones
is that they are small typically
Bluetooth earphones are a little bit
bigger they have a bulkier back to them
sometimes
this one has a thin cord and the buds
themselves are actually quite small the
other important thing is they deliver
eight hours of battery life typically
when you go this small with Bluetooth
earphones you just can't get that
battery life and these are also sweat
proof I've been testing them out for a
few days and I like them a lot they do
offers a secure fit you do have to find
the right bud size as well as the right
wing you also do need the left wing to
fit as well but these are well fitting
in-ear bluetooth headphones they also
sound good because if you can get a
tight seal that really helps the bass
with Bluetooth earphones they don't
sound as good as a wired model but these
do sound very good for a bluetooth
earbud the only real drawback here is
the price these are a hundred and
seventy dollars list that is pretty
expensive for sports headphones you can
get wired models that cost significantly
less that delivered a little bit better
sound but if you do want a premium set
of Bluetooth earphones to run in or do
other sports in this certainly fits the
bill these are the jaybird blueblood X
Bluetooth earphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
