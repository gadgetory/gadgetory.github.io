more than 200 new features starting with
some significant enhancements to Siri
I'll walk you through a few let's start
with Siri the first thing that Syria has
learned in last eight months is all
about sports so I can ask who is taller
lebron or kobe lebron james appears to
be slightly taller next up series
learned a lot more about restaurants so
i can ask find a great place for dinner
I found 15 restaurants 14 of them are
fairly close to you I've sorted them by
rating if I go ahead and choose one of
these i'll choose millennium you can see
all sorts of information about the
restaurant we have maps here we've
partnered with Yelp so you can see
reviews right in here tap on that and
here's the reviews if you want even more
information just tap on any of these
reviews and we'll take you right to the
yelp app from the App Store I'll go back
we've also partnered with opentable so I
can tap here to make reservations takes
me agin to the opentable app right from
the app store and make a reservation
it's that easy so Cirie knows a lot
about restaurants now you can ask about
movies you can launch apps make dinner
reservations you can now tweet just by
talking to your phone we are also taking
Siri much more international now as part
of making serum or international we're
now taking local search which was us
only in iOS 5 around the world and for
the first time we're taking Siri beyond
the iphone 4s and we're bringing it to
the new iPad and these are just a few of
the enhancements for Siri and iOS 6 next
Facebook integration we're integrating
Facebook right in to iOS 6 we're also
making it really easy to post to
Facebook for many of our apps you can
talk about your favorite app your own
app in this case from the app store
we've also integrated it right in with
Notification Center so anywhere you are
just drag your finger down from the top
of the screen to reveal Notification
Center and you can tap to post to
Facebook and we've added Twitter writing
to Notification Center as well we've
also integrated Facebook with Siri and
we've taken this deep integration and
made it a public API so it's easy for
apps on the App Store to integrate with
facebook we've also integrated it with
the App Store so now you can like apps
and see which apps your friends like and
if your friends are sharing say a phone
number or an email address from Facebook
those who appear in your contact list
now right on your iPhone also your
facebook events will now appear in
calendars along with birthdays so we've
taken a deep integration of Facebook
right into iOS 6 and we've taken that
same integration and brought it to the
mac and that is facebook next is face
time when iOS 6 we're enabling facetime
over cellular also we're unifying your
phone number and your Apple ID so if
someone calls you on your phone number
with a facetime call you can answer that
call on your iPad or even your Mac
next up is a brand new app we're calling
passbook now passbook is the simplest
way to get all of your passes in one
place I've got some tickets so here is a
Fandango ticket for a movie and these
are beautiful I have a nice ticket for a
giants game here we have store cards
here's a card for starbucks the agency
has the balance there when you use this
to scan and pay for your coffee the
balance automatically gets updated
here's an express checking card for a
hotel now when when you're done with a
card just flip it over is a trash can at
the top left we had a little bit of fun
with this deleting your cards now as I
said this is all integrated in with the
phone with the lock screen so if I have
my phone locked and I go to my favorite
Starbucks up comes my Starbucks card
slide across it brings on my card scam
pay for my coffee and I'm out it's that
easy and all these cards are actually
live so if my gate change that's got an
update for my united airlines gate
change it comes up I slide across here
there's my boarding pass updated right
in the app
