Esqueda and your time is money which is
why I look at the news across movies TV
and games until you where to put your
fan investments this week we're kicking
things off with something a lot of
people are invested in and that my
friends is Star Wars Collider dropped a
huge bomb this week with an exclusive
report saying the a Star Wars story
spin-offs were being put on hold at
Lucasfilm sources also say that that
obi-wan movie we'd been hearing about
was in development but now that team is
no longer involved so that's not good on
top of that there was that rumor that
James Mangold the guy who co-wrote and
directed Logan was going to do a Boba
Fett movie that's probably also being
put on ice because of a little movie
called solo so we have to talk about
solo for a second in as of today or a
few days ago hasn't even crossed the 200
million dollar mark domestically at the
box office and making the movie cost in
the neighborhood of two hundred and
fifty million dollars now mind you that
250 million dollar is not including a
marketing budget so we're probably
talking maybe half a billion dollars
that they're probably not gonna make
back so I guess it makes sense if
Kathleen Kennedy wants to maybe put
these standalone movies on hold for a
little while while they regroup now
Lucasfilm is going to be focusing its
efforts on episode 9 and on top of that
Rian Johnson is still making his Star
Wars trilogy and also Game of Thrones
showrunners DB Weiss and David Benioff
are also doing a series of Star Wars
movies so those are okay but all those
stand alone movies for right now are not
happening so I think we need to do a
quick fire as to whether to buy or sell
so in the way of buying I think we can
buy both of those movie series from
Benioff and Weiss and Rian Johnson
because
they're geniuses guys they make good
stuff we should totally buy that I'm
gonna go ahead and say cautious optimism
on an obi-wan movie that could be good
if they refocus and do some
introspection and then I'm gonna say we
just need to sell off that terrible
Bubba Fett movie idea to a Sarlacc pit
because at the end of the day guys both
that sucks don't at me but when you can
at me about is whether or not you think
Lucasfilm is making the right decision
here so tell me in the comments now
we're kind of losing a lot of spin-offs
on the star wars side but guess what
we're getting lots of Star Trek you'll
get a Star Trek you'll get a Star Trek
everybody gets a Star Trek CBS
Television Studios has officially signed
Star Trek discovery executive producer
Alex Kurtzman to a five-year deal that
will bring even more Star Trek to your
screens sources say there are a few
different concepts on the table
including a Starfleet Academy show from
the people who brought you Gossip Girl
there is an idea that could bring back
jean-luc Picard like a little miniseries
action maybe on top of that we've got a
potential series involving infamous Trek
villain-con no word on which one
Montalban or Cumberbatch
I don't know and on top of that even an
animated series but at the end of the
day CBS isn't talking and they could
scrap any of those concepts during
development
now disclosure CBS is the parent company
of CNET and they could have totally sent
me an email and told me all their
secrets but they didn't so now I just
have to say that my dream show that I
don't know anything about is a prequel
set in Starfleet Academy starring none
other than John Luke Picard with hair
what's the only way the only way she
looks so good you guys that's amazing
now obviously CBS is expanding the Trek
universe because Star Trek discovery is
doing so well and if you haven't seen
Star Trek Discovery I highly recommend
it it's a by it's really really fun I am
enjoying watching it and I know it's
another paid to stream service but if
it's something you're interested in you
should check it out so now we go from
the vast out reaches of space to the
shores of Azeroth because it's time to
talk about vanilla
blizzard officially announced which
patch would be the foundation for world
of warcraft classic that's a pre
expansion version of the game they also
detailed a lot of challenges the dev
team faces as they restore it in a blog
post Blizzard discussed the basis of how
they chose which patch would be the core
of WoW classic and they fell upon patch
1.12 now that is drums of war and marks
the last major content patch before the
Burning Crusade content started
launching in late 2006 so about two
years worth of game content and the
culmination of that so we all just go to
Berens chat right poured it over let's
launch it tomorrow
not so fast the dev team also talked
about having to update and change a lot
of code for different systems they also
have to make sure that it's compatible
with things like battlenet which wasn't
around when the game originally launched
updated graphics card compatibility and
of course security and antibody measures
it's a lot of really important stuff so
it's gonna be a minute before a world of
warcraft classic is ready to go but at
the end of the day i think if you've
been asking for this for a really long
time you are in a good place and i think
that you're gonna get even more than
what Blizzard originally promised you or
what maybe you had been asking for so
it's a buy if you've been asking for it
there but if you haven't been asking for
it I'm gonna say it maybe start off with
the game in its current form because
it's a better starting off spot now I
used to write in rap the Lich King I
think this is a really cool idea but at
the end of the day how many times can
you raid knacks 40 before you get bored
guys how many times I don't know I'm
speaking of the supernatural and strange
goings on I'm really worried about Mark
Searles he hasn't been sleeping a lot
and he keeps making a weird clicking
noise with his mouth I don't know you
guys you check in on him
yeah read it see have you seen this
movie have you seen it oh jeez I went to
the cinema by myself kiss my kids I'm on
my way for the someone else saw it those
two myself
so it's like all good see how a movie so
then I went into the cinema and I saw
the movie anyone I went him I was
bringing it myself the real American
Neha no I was too skinny with history's
empty my history is empty and I love the
old in the hood and then when I went to
sleep I couldn't sleep because I was so
scared I kept looking at when the other
soul is not inflation and all those my
gland but did grab sonic line come on
I'm sorry
and then I tried to tell myself to go
asleep let everything I like to the
chair I was a bit shocked totally baked
Lay's hanging out floors are human being
coming eat me alive
- that's just been heartening for our
week I can't deal with I can't even take
a loose money I think I myself good
see Larry is so good but oh Jesus Christ
- so scary
Oh best movie ever good stuff
when you hear the words for DX movie you
also might think of the words theme park
ride but it's a little more complicated
than that and that's why we're here at
40 X labs in Hollywood California to
learn a little bit more about the
technology behind 40 X experiences and
how each movie is designed where's my
popcorn
and up right now I think viewers who
watch a 40 X film probably have some
kind idea of how the movies convert into
4dx they might think it's a simple
process but to tell the truth is very
complicated method we come into the last
stage of the production right so there's
post-production and then there's us and
that could sometimes be like a couple
weeks before the premiere so we really
have to figure out how we're gonna
approach the situation without just
blindly putting in for everything that
we feel or here because it becomes an
overwhelming sensation our key intention
here is not to interrupt not to go too
much so we stay low and the restate
comment to make your movie watching
Express a more immersive so we you feel
end up feeling like you're living the
experiences in Australia these creatures
were here
they're gonna be here after
when something is designed perfectly and
it feels right it's so satisfactory 40x
isn't for everybody that's for sure some
people find the experience to be a
little bit too overwhelming but if
you're looking to add a little dash of
adventure to your movie-going
experiences 40x might be just the thing
I like to think of 40x as sort of a
secondary viewing experience so see the
movie you want to see the first time the
way you want to see it and then the
second time you can consider adding a 4d
act ticket force and extra a little fun
I can't wait to see it Jurassic world
fallen Kingdom it is going to be so
exciting in 40x and thank you again to
the team of four DX labs for allowing us
to come over and check out what they do
on a daily basis we have some
housekeeping for future episodes next
week we will not have a full episode
instead we are going to air a really fun
interview with Rebecca Johnson and Kimmy
Gatewood who are actresses on the
Netflix series glow they're coming over
to talk about season two and also what
their characters Don and Stacey are up
to with a really fun sort of newlywed
game and I think you'll really enjoy
that we will also be off on 4th of July
week so if you are around and you don't
know where the show is I'm sorry
we'll be right back I promise you this
second week of July we're coming back
now
that is next to the show thank you so
much hit us up on Twitter use the
hashtag dream economy if you're on
YouTube like comment subscribe
ring the bell I can't wait to hear your
thoughts on Star Trek Star Wars and Wow
classic it's gonna be so exciting get

doughnuts I do read all of them well
