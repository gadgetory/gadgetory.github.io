look at the brand new dell XPS 15 now
dell has had XPS 15 inch laptops before
this model is a bit of a pretty serious
revamp it's thinner it's lighter it's
got a lot of the same industrial design
as we've seen from the XPS line in the
last couple of years but the main
selling point here is that it has two
features i like a lot one a better than
HD resolution display this is a 3200 by
1800s display that makes it kind of like
the retina macbook pro or kind of like
the lenovo yoga 2 and some of the other
better than HD display laptops we've
seen recently and it also has a discrete
graphics card in this case it's the
nvidia geforce 750 and which is a
perfectly fine mid-level card if you're
not doing like super serious all the
time gaming it gives you that option
while still being kind of a thin light
tote around almost business-minded
laptop because it's pretty buttoned-up
looking now i will say the the actual
look here the grey mat and black there's
certainly nothing wrong with it but it's
the same look that XPS systems have had
for a couple years now this could be a
nine hundred dollar laptop this could be
a two-thousand-dollar laptop or more
it's kind of hard to town I think for
something that's this expensive this
particular configuration is eighteen
ninety nine and four about 2,300 bucks
you can upgrade that gives you a 512
gigabyte SSD this has one of those combo
hard drives that's a regular hard drive
with a small SSD you know I think for
that kind of money you need something
it's just a little bit fancy a little
bit more upscale looking but the build
quality is really great this is a
Luminum and and carbon fiber the joints
are all tight no real complaints there I
always liked the rounded corners on the
dell keyboards but this keyboard feels a
little bit small is a lot of dead space
here they could definitely put in like a
full number pad or something like that
having the big super high res screen is
a lot of fun super crisp text and images
if you're using the windows menu like
this that everything looks great if you
have some legacy programs that aren't
like full windows 8 versions like let's
say Photoshop or some of the gaming
system programs the text and icons get
really small they're hard to see and
that's one of the
with having a super high res screen
everyone hasn't quite adjusted to that
world yet we've only seen a few so far
but I think we're going to see a lot
more so basically if you want something
that's pretty much just like the 15-inch
retina MacBook Pro and I mean that in a
good way but you have to have windows 8
instead of OS 10 this is a very very
close comfortable system both in terms
of features and price i'm dan ackerman
and that is the dell XPS 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
