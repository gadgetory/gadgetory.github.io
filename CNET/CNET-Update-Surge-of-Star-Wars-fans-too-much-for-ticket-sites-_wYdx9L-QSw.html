ticket websites Monday I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update you may have
felt a disturbance in the force Monday
night as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror when they couldn't
get tickets to the upcoming Star Wars
movie because every ticketing website
and app was down and constantly crashing
unable to handle the demand I was among
those trying and I was trying for three
hours tickets for opening weekend were
supposed to go on sale at the same time
as the new full trailer for The Force
awakens which premiered on ESPN during
halftime of Monday Night Football and
social media went crazy
the force it's calling to you
I mean there is so much there to freeze
frame and analyze why is ray crying and
Finn is fighting and why didn't they
show Luke's face and there was sad
Princess Leia and you know what let's go
back to that lay a shot because that was
pretty much my face from the exhaustion
of dealing with these ticketing websites
which ended up starting sales before the
trailer went live but even if you kept
refreshing apps and websites you were
hit with constant timeout glitches and
other error messages Fandango or shall
we say fail dango didn't prepare for
this traffic and it was listing some
showings as unavailable when they were
available and even crashing on me
several times after i submitted payment
finally i did get through on amc's
website but some people just had better
luck going in person to a theater yeah
best to just give up on technology oh
and after I did finally get my tickets
here's something that added to the
venture even though I got failed
messages on fandango some of the
payments actually went through
apparently as i discovered with random
confirmation emails for tickets i didn't
think i bought and how to get refunds
for it's enough to make you turn to the
dark side we have another two months
until it comes out so at least i have
little sphero bb-8 to keep me calm in
the music but in the meantime there is
more news to talk about so let's segue
from the dark side to an apple story
more than six and a half million people
are now paying for the Apple music
service since it launched at the end of
June it costs ten dollars a month Apple
CEO Tim Cook shared the number at a
conference Monday to compare Spotify has
20 million paying members but 6.5 isn't
bad for only being around for a short
time cook also revealed that the new
Apple TV streaming video box will go on
sale monday and it'll start to ship by
the end of next week the box costs 150
dollars and it adds support for Siri as
well as app games and that's it for this
tech news update there's more at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
