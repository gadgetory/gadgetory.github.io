Subarus big boring granola sedan or is
it a fun and sporty alternative to the
Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords of the
world I'm looking at these muscular
fender flares and all-wheel drive system
and I'm thinking it's the latter but
apparently Subarus got some other ideas
let's hop behind the wheel and check the
tech now the legacy dashboard is
composed of some pretty cheap feeling
materials when you really kind of run
your fingernails across it these
plastics feel really hard and really
hollow on the bright side though there's
a lot of variety in visual texture in
color and that makes it look a lot
better when you're driving around in the
car that makes me kind of appreciate it
a little bit more there's one place
where it does kind of cheap out and
that's these two little bits of
translucent blue plastic that just
seemed out of place in this metallic and
wood dashboard now this limited model is
gonna come with a nine speaker Harman
Kardon audio system and it's got nine
speakers all around the cabin including
a subwoofer in the rear parcel shelf now
this system actually sounds pretty good
there is a lot of bass coming from that
subwoofer that just really fills the
cabin up the problem is that at the flat
fitting the mid-range is kind to get a
little bit muddy fortunately you can fix
that with this multi band EQ in the
infotainment system now there aren't any
presets they all come flat you've got to
set them yourself which means it's
pretty easy to mess it up even more
fortunately I was able to find some
pretty nice presets on a Subaru users
forum so we want to go there and check
that out first before you start really
getting in there and messing around now
the navigation system is good it gets
the job done but this entire touchscreen
infotainment system is very kind of
laggy every time I push a button there's
about a good half a second to a whole
second delay between I'm pressing the
button in the next screen popping up and
that can be a problem when you're
driving along you just want to tap two
buttons the fewer the nearest gas
station is fortunately you do have a
full array of audio sources including HD
radio you've got XM radio you've got
Bluetooth audio streaming and iPod
connectivity you've also got AHA radio
connectivity in case you want to listen
to some streaming internet radio or I
don't know listen to your Twitter feed I
don't know who actually uses that
functionality it's a little bit annoying
but
is there if you want to have access to
it
who's there there is no Pandora internet
radio or iHeartRadio that I saw those
are the more popular internet radio
systems I'd like to see those in this as
well but you don't actually have access
to them
and if we look up here we'll actually
see the the eyes and brain of the Subaru
driver assistance system that's actually
going to be their eyesight camera and
that's two cameras mounted on either
side of the rear-view mirror that are
gonna point out the front of the vehicle
and watch the road ahead when you add
that as part of a technology package
you're gonna gain also lane departure
warning you're gonna gain pre collision
detection and that's actually also going
to power the adaptive cruise control
system also you get some pedestrian
warnings and cycle this morning so it's
really good at seeing what's in front of
the car and letting you know that it's
there before you run into it now
underneath the legacies hood is a 2.5
liter horizontally opposed boxer engine
that has like basically the two Pistons
punching out of either side like a boxer
now being horizontally opposed and flat
allows Subaru to put it nice and low in
the engine bay and keep the center of
gravity low to the ground for better
handling now don't get too excited this
isn't the turbocharged 2.5 liter that
you're under the hood of the Subaru
Impreza WRX STI this is a naturally
aspirated version that puts out 173
horsepower and 174 pounds feet of core
still has a decent amount of power for a
vehicle this size fuel economy is stated
at 24 32 with 27 miles per gallon
combined being the estimate from the EPA
it's paired to a continuously variable
transmission which is kind of
unfortunate talk about that more in a
second in turn that transmission is
going to send power to Subarus trademark
symmetrical all-wheel drive system
that's gonna give this vehicle a little
bit more sure-footedness when the
weather gets slippery wet let's hop
behind the wheel and see exactly what I
mean about why that transmission is the
worth
for a car like this off the line it's
not bad you do you know get off the line
pretty quickly the problem is when
you're cruising around at low speeds 25
miles per hour 45 miles per hour those
speeds that you do in the city and then
need to accelerate you need to get the
transmission to jump down and ratios so
that you can actually take off the
problem is that when you do that the
transmission and the engine they just
don't really want to work very well
together they basically kind of
rubberband and you get a lot of revving
from the engine while it's up in the
power band while the transmission is
just kind of waiting to catch up of
course and you're a laid-back driver and
you really are all about maximum fuel
efficiency this transmission is more
fuel efficient by a couple of miles per
gallon than the manual shifted option
you do have a manual shift mode and
paddle shifters but the shifts that you
get from the paddle shifts are even
slower than you would have gotten from a
traditional torque converter
transmission or if you just left the CVT
to do its own thing the 2014 Subaru
Legacy 2.5 i limited that's the one that
we've got right here is gonna start at
26 195 now there's one option package
you can add that adds all of the tech
that we talked about the iSight camera
with its driver a tech and the index
technology that's gonna be 4,000 $40 as
your destination charges that'll read to
an as-tested price of thirty one
thousand and thirty dollars now that's
gonna get you about 32 miles per gallon
on the highway and it's a pretty good
price even if it's not fun but if you
really care about driving thrills save a
couple of bucks and get the manual
transmission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
