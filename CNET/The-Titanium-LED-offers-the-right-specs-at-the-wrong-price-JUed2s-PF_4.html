hand here is the titanium led series for
from being creative now green creative
appeared on our radar this year when
they put out the cloud LED that's a Bea
Arthur t-shaped floodlight that has a
unique design that floats the diodes up
above the base and there's a better job
of heat management and so we want to
check out their baseline bulb and this
is it this is a 60 watt replacement that
puts out 800 lumens of light when we
tested it out it actually locked in
higher than that about 830 so plenty of
brightness and it's also pretty
efficient it puts out all that light
from just nine watts of power draw
that's very good that gives it a lumens
per watt efficiency above 90 that's very
very good so all in all this bulb is a
pretty complete package and I was
impressed with how it performed but I
was not as impressed with the value it's
a $14 light that you're gonna need to
buy online and if you head to the local
hardware store in your city you'll
probably find bulbs that are cheaper and
better in a lot of different ways
specifically the odds room 60 watt
replacement LED comes to mind these
bulbs are a lot alike but the odds room
edges green creative out in almost every
category it's a little brighter it's a
little more efficient has a longer
warranty it dims down lower and best of
all it costs four dollars less that's
just ten dollars per bulb and AHS rooms
not the only bulb that I think offers
better value and it's easier to get than
the titanium LED so like I said it's a
good bulb if you have one in your house
already probably happy with it but if
you're buying a bulb today I think you
should shop around thanks for watching
