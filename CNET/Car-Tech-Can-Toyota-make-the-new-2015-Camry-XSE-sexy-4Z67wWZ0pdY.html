is anything but boring at least on the
outside the new camry has been
redesigned from the chassis up pretty
much everything has been changed the
only exterior sheet metal that it has in
common with the previous generation is
the roof up front we see a much more
aggressive front end it kind of brings
it in line with the new toyota corolla
and these new headlights have LED
illumination for the high and the low
beams inside we've got an upgraded
interior that's going to include a
couple of new tech features including qi
wireless charging for your mobile phone
this new camry joins the toyota avalon
and the toyota prius as forerunners in
offering that feature we've also got a
bunch of new safety features including
lane departure warning adaptive cruise
and whatnot this particular model is an
ex SE model a new trim level and the
sportiest camera yet according to toyota
it's got an upgraded suspension firmer
bushings 18-inch wheels that are unique
to this model that's going to make it
even sporty-er and more fun to drive
than the SE model which was previously
the sportiest camera you could get the
2015 Camry goes on sale in the fall of
this year pricing has not yet been
determined but we expect it will still
be in line with the 2014 prices I've
been antuan goodwin on the floor at the
2014 New York Auto Show taking a look at
the 2015 toyota camry x s ii</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
