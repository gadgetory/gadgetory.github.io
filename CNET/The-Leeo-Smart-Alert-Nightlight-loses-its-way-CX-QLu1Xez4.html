I am taking a look at the Leo smart
alert nightlight
so this color-changing nightlight can
not only help you keep the boogeyman at
bay but it'll listen for your smoke
detector and carbon monoxide detector
and if those sound it'll hear that
specific frequency and reach out to let
you know something's up no matter where
you are in addition to that you can use
the app to set a variety of colors you
can adjust the brightness you can set
the nightlight to turn on or off when it
detects ambient light
it'll also sense temperature and
humidity and you can customize alerts so
you know when something's up with those
as well when the system does get in
touch with you you'll listen to a
5-second pre-recorded clip you can say
hey it's a false alarm or you can call
911 right there through the app and
it'll connect you to the local emergency
services near your nightlight not your
location which I thought was pretty
smart so like I said I liked this thing
I was charmed by it but I can't quite
recommend it yet here's why the software
is a couple of minor issues right now
the humidity detector isn't all that
precise we found it off about five to
ten percentage points on a consistent
basis and controlling the device with
the app works well a lot of the time but
sometimes it can be a bit laggy it
cannot save your settings and you might
find yourself getting a little bit
annoyed with the song so I could forgive
it all that especially because the
alerts themselves seem to be pretty
responsive but the more major issue is
that those five second clips are really
short and they're really quiet at best
and inaudible at worst this is where
live listening would come in super handy
if the device had a way that you could
actually listen to what was going on
right then and there nope all you gets
that one five-second pre-recorded clip
and
so this nightlight is a fun toy but it
costs $100 and for that much money it's
just not a smart buy so despite the fact
that this is simple and fun to use until
the price drops or it gets a few feature
updates I can't recommend the Leo smart
alert nightlight for CNET appliances I'm
