this is the Nokia Lumia 810 this is a
windows phone 8 device for t-mobile
there are a lot of high-end features on
this phone it's got hspa+ 42 speeds on
it so that's t-mobile's fastest 4G
network it does not have LTE of course
because t-mobile doesn't either it does
have a 4.3 inch display that's very
bright and pretty it's an AMOLED display
and although it is an HD everything
looks really clear and bright to me and
it's got Nokia's clear black filter on
top and that helps cut down on some of
the glare the phone comes in one color
black and it is a thick brick of a phone
I'm not a big fan of the body it's
really thick and square uniform could be
a lot better there is optional wireless
charging if you switch out the back
cover this one is not wireless however
it is enabled for NFC so you'll be able
to tap and share and you'll be able to
use mobile payments as well there's an 8
megapixel camera here on the back and
the Lumia 810 does come with a couple
extra camera features including one
called smart shot that's a nap and also
a panorama app there's a 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera now this is one of
the first windows phones that we're
going to see that actually includes a
microSD card for extra storage there are
only 8 gigabytes of storage inside but
you also have seven gigabytes of free
skydrive storage and you've got this
micro SD card slot that will take up to
64 gigabytes so I think you're going to
have plenty of room for your photos and
videos on the processing side of things
there's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 processor that's
pretty fast since this is a Nokia phone
you're going to find some extra apps
like Nokia drive Nokia Music and Nokia's
augmented reality app which is called
city lens overall I think that the user
experience is going to be very nice
there's a lot of uniformity across
Windows Phone there are also some
high-end features on this device and
Nokia does throw in a couple extra apps
that you're not going
see with any other windows phone however
when it comes to the design I am
disappointed its lackluster nokia could
have done better so this is not a device
that you're going to buy because you
think it's beautiful even if you can
change the colors on the back but it is
one that is very practical especially if
you are interested in a windows phone
