Surface pro we've gotten a lot of
requests from people for a road test of
this device because it's sort of a
combination of laptop and tablet at
least if you include the optional
keyboard accessory and it is running a
full version of Windows 8 so we put
together an expert panel of users we
have Jason Philip and Jasmine each of
you is gonna get a couple days with this
device to evaluate design features and
usability hi my name is Jason Hannigan
I'm a dad an attorney and I enjoy gaming
hi I'm Jasmine Washington I'm the
support specialist for sidecar I used to
be a cowgirl now I'm a Cali girl
hi my name is sue loves Oh I'm a
valuation consultant and I like to watch
an NBA basketball the design of the
surface pro is a very solid moment in my
hands it's clearly a serious piece of
equipment you can feel that it's well
engineered
nothing moves nothing shakes look at it
was be aiming this is a very heavy
tablet playing it for any period of time
with one hand then these 15 here is a
lot it's all for getting hot the longer
I'm holding it I really like to design I
think it's sleek I feel like the back is
a little bit bulky they're back in the
keyboard or not as proportionate as I
would like like the way it has its
built-in kickstand back here as far as
the crossover features very convenient
if I want to just bring this portion of
the tablet I could just bring it with me
without the keyboard and putting it
together it's very simple we have
magnets in here that connects it very
quickly I love to take selfies and I
love love love how I can easily take a
picture with the click of the screen
that's awesome
the pin fell off as I was trying to take
try some video
I think the video is awesome I also
think you have to be really careful
about not moving too fast because it can
get blurry but I love how you can start
and stop the video with the touch of a
button just like the camera can actually
been playing fruit ninja on here which I
will be the first to acknowledge is not
a real game game but one of the
interesting functions of this is that
the game store they've got set up does
not have a wide variety of serious games
available to it you know once you
install Excel it's a fully functional
Excel software it's not like a lite
version of it so if you want to do more
advanced features more advanced modeling
you can use all of that so anything that
you could do on a PC or a laptop it give
you with this tablet so the Windows
desktop is really nice because it's more
like a traditional computer I would
actually rather use the towel screen
it's really cool because you can
actually open up certain windows like
this and move things off to the side or
makes things bigger so I like just find
what I need and I just click on it it's
really simple the screen is a very nice
screen as a very high resolution it's
very easy to navigate and the screen is
very responsive if I'm defining apps as
the sort of tiles and touchscreen stuff
they've got a really good set up of
basic functions I'm finding one I'm
trying to select items the stylus shows
up on the screen before you're touching
it because it doubles as a mouse that
level of precision can make it a little
bit challenging to work with the stylus
sometimes it's time to find out what you
guys thought of it jasmin give me your
overall impression of the surface pro
what do you think I thought it was a
really good device easy to use nice
sleek design which is basically my most
concern and I really liked it okay and
then Philip overall I liked it it's a
nice compact portable device it's very
functional so I was able to use all the
office products on it overall it was a
good product okay Jason how about you
overall at the end of the day did you
love it would you want to go out with it
again at the end of the day it was so
close I think as a tablet it's a little
too heavy it's a little too hot but
using it as an actual laptop replacement
more as an ultrabook if you're willing
to cough up for the extra keyboard that
is it's pretty great so this is the
moment the final determination if you
were in the market for either a tablet
or an ultrabook
would you buy the surface pro as a
tablet know as an ultrabook maybe all
right Philip be brutal you know I
wouldn't buy it just because you know
it's a little more expensive in and I
would choose a laptop or a
ultrabook over this and then gentlemen
how about you if I were on the market
for a laptop I would definitely buy it
it's sleek it's easier to carry around
all right cool
I would say that one out of three is not
that for the surface pro thank you guys
so much for your valued opinions
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
