its own version of the HTC One I'm Jeff
Bakalar in for Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update there's quite a bit of
mobile news to cover in today's run down
let's start things off with sprint the
third place mobile carrier made a deal
with the streaming music service Spotify
customers of the family plan will get a
six month free trial of the mobile
version of Spotify and then after that
they can pay for it at a discounted rate
that starts next week on May 9th Sprint
will also start selling a special
version of the HTC One m8 smartphone
that will have better audio quality but
the name is kind of a mouthful it's
called the HTC One m8 Harman Kardon just
rolls right off the tongue the Harman
Kardon brand is a maker of home audio
products in case you were wondering the
phone is set to support HD audio formats
and can enhance details of music that
are lost during audio compression
basically it means that the music on
there will have six times as much data
as it does on a CD it will include a
special Harman Kardon earbud and that
will value at one hundred and forty
dollars the phone hit stores next week
also on May ninth for the second year in
a row Nintendo is bailing on a
traditional III press conference opting
for a change of pace in the way the
company delivers news to its fans
followers and partners Nintendo will
hold a series of events at e3 2014
instead Nintendo calls the strategy a
quote-unquote proven tactic but I was
there last year and I found their
presidents to be a bit underwhelming
we'll have to see how this year goes
acer has introduced a new line of PCs
and a powerful Chromebook the products
include a switch 10 which is a hybrid
tablet laptop with a detachable screen
an iconia 17 android tablet a 23 inch
aspire u5 all-in-one and an intel core
i3 Chromebook overnight Apple cut a
hundred dollars off the cheapest macbook
air and upgraded the processor across
the board the 11.6 inch macbook air now
starts at nine hundred dollars while an
entry-level 13.3 inch model will go for
eleven hundred dollars the processor
upgrade will push the air to a one
in 4 gigahertz core i5 up from 1.3 this
isn't a major update so it's still
possible the macbook air will get a
total redesign at some point soon after
months of speculation Lucasfilm and
Disney have announced the cast of Star
Wars Episode seven topping the bill our
actors reprising their roles from the
original trilogy Harrison Ford will play
han solo Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker
and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia
newcomers to the series include Andy
Serkis Oscar Isaac and girls star Adam
