thousands of years almost as soon as we
invented the wheel we started inventing
services to allow those wheels to turn
more easily over the 20th century enough
of our planet has been asphalted over to
allow us to drive virtually anywhere in
perfect ease and yet that's not enough
not satisfied with having access to
virtually everywhere in the built up
world
some of us want to access the rest of it
and preferably without getting our feet
muddy today we snuck out into an area
slightly more dangerous than our average
shooting location to do just that
I want to leave behind the world of
roads and rules and comfort for an
opportunity to carve my own path across
some landscape that's meant to challenge
some of the most capable cars out there
the car we've chosen today to go
off-roading in is the Subaru XV
now of course most people who buy this
won't be taking off roads it is however
a pretty capable little vehicle
I actually really loving this is the top
of the line a 25 grand I think you're
getting a hell of a bargain
now most people who would buy this car
probably wouldn't take off road and it
certainly doesn't have any of the fancy
hill descent control or adaptive drain
controls that a modern land rover
product might have but it's got a
torquey engine and a driver behind the
wheel who's been off-roading a couple of
times it's a Subaru with all-wheel-drive
if it can't handle some off roads I
might not be as enthused we've come out
to the Salzburg plains to have a bit of
a play around it's a massive area not
too far from where they test out
artillery and tanks so the area is
pretty dug up and quite rough and
there's some nice little obstacles you
have to get our teeth stuck into or
rather are our tires if you prefer let's
see just how far we can push this thing
it's not gonna be the worst off-roading
terrain ever and presents it to a car we
should be able to have some fun
now as I said this isn't something
that's necessarily sold to people who
are going to take it off-road that
doesn't mean that it shouldn't be able
to see and to do most of these things
you don't need fancy hill descent
control adaptive terrain to some fast
hands a keen eye and very common sense
and of course our wheel drive and your
set drive down any road in any city and
you'll spot car after car with the
ability to tackle mud and snow or
traverse small rivers if needed but most
of these cars will never even see
anything more threatening than a deep
puddle but still we flock in droves to
buy cars that have the capability to go
where no car should have to but why why
in 2016 do we feel the need to leave the
path more traveled and take to nature
you see I think it's all about conquests
all of the gaps on the map have been
filled in there's nowhere left to
explore no matter where you go you're
never the first just the latest in a
long line of people to visit there but
when we drive a car that can go off-road
we reclaim even for a slight moment that
feeling of discovery and conquest even
if we are doing it from the comfort of
heated seats in Radio 4 we feel unbound
and unrestricted not confined to the
white lines of a road or even the
natural obstacles in nature we truly
experience that freedom we were promised
when we first got our driver's license
as soon as you realize that the car
you're in doesn't need to be restricted
by asphalt white lines and Road
regulations and you've got the
confidence to start throwing it around
and some deep muds and ruts there's a
whole world of fun to be had out there
big slidy muddy fun I had some doubts
whether or not the XV could handle what
we were going to throw at it
but it did remarkably well today we've
thrown steep us and steep descents ruts
Hills deep puddles up to small lakes and
a lot of mud at this car and so far it's
dealt with everything just fine it took
on every challenge we threw at it and
came out unscathed
it's comforting to know that during the
inevitable zombie apocalypse there are
going to be vehicles out there that are
able to take us to where we need without
having to rely on roads and I for one
celebrate that fact of course for almost
all of us almost all of the time having
the ability to traverse terrain like
this is completely redundant but a
primal side of us the same parts that
keeps a torch in the house and some
wellies by the door urges us to be
prepared for any journey under any
circumstance and with cars like the
Subaru XV we can do just that your
driving experience just isn't complete
unless you've taken a car outside of the
asphalt kingdom and challenged it
