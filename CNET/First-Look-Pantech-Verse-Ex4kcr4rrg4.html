messaging phone you're gonna want one
like the Pantech Burst for US Cellular
I'm Jessica delcor from Cena's comm
we're gonna take a look at this phone
now it is a very simple messaging device
it has a really cute and compact form to
it kind of looks like a bubble or some
very nice large key so it's very easy to
manipulate mostly black has this bright
lime green color as accents along the
rim on the keyboard and along the
navigation toggle also has sort of a
no-slip surface on the back so it is
pretty groupable there's a 2 megapixel
camera on the back it's not very good
you're really not going to be using this
to replace your camera they're also not
going to be using it to get to the
Internet too often because it is less
than a 3G phone so it's got about 2.5 g
speeds but you are going to use this if
you are a messaging daemon so there's
text and multimedia messaging on here
and the slide up QWERTY keyboard it's in
portrait mode which I find really
convenient because you slide it up and
there it is for you to use you don't
have to turn the phone to use it the
buttons are also very responsive there
are a little bit cramped but my fingers
are a little on the smaller side so I
found it pretty easy to use and very
tactile it was an extremely comfortable
experience the phone also has fairly
good audio quality I was able to make
calls on speakerphone and on a standard
phone very well there are some
additional buttons on the side here
because this phone is so focused on the
physical so there's a voice prompt
button there's also a button for a
shortcut to do menu items there's a
camera shutter button as well there's a
2.5 millimeter headset jack which is
smaller than the standard so that's a
little bit unfortunate and there is
definitely room here for a micro SD card
which is very good and that goes up to
32 gigabytes and external storage screen
size is 2.4 inches it does not a
touchscreen you have to use the
navigation controls to get around a
little bit on the small side it's a
little bit cramped for reading out
so if you do go online it's a little bit
more eye strain involved in that but I
would say that it is appropriate
especially for such a compact device
here not super expensive the pantech
verse costs $29.99 with a new two-year
service agreement and that's after $50
mail-in rebate if you want to get it
prepaid you'll just spend $69.99 to get
the phone investing adult court for CNET
this is your first look at the pantech
verse for US Cellular a very simple but
very good messaging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
