the very first stand-alone smart home
device from LG we've seen them used
thinkyou technology on their large
appliances but this guy stands on its
own it has a built-in Wi-Fi connected
camera it has environmental sensors and
it can act as a smart home hump better
yet you can have a TT monitor what's
coming in here on a month-to-month fee
without any contracts so the camera is a
5 megapixel camera it has digital zoom
1080p and supposedly it's gonna know the
normal activity of you and your family
and it's gonna send you an alert if
something's unusual I'm not exactly sure
how that's gonna work and I'm curious to
find out but it has a number of other
security features as well like I said
environmental sensors it knows your
preferred temperature and humidity range
it's gonna send you a push alert if it
falls outside of that and then again
Smart Home Hub that might not sound
glamorous but because this thing talks
Bluetooth and ZigBee and z-wave all of
those smart home peripherals that you
might want communicating with the cloud
can use this as a bridge to do that
that's pretty cool LG developed this in
partnership with ADT and it works with
ATT's new canopy smart home system
that's a month-to-month contract free
system you can add your own smart home
devices to it and ATT will monitor them
for you so I'm glad to see LG getting
into the DIY security game and better
yet bringing ATT with them so you can
have that Pro monitoring with your own
DIY system and if this thing can do
smart detection as well and actually
know your family's movement patterns and
tell you if something's out of the
ordinary that could be really cool with
the LG smart security system at CES
I'm Andrew Gebhardt for safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
