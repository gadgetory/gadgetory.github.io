and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up the best camera
phone we've seen how not to get a virus
on your cell phone and the most
technically advanced Jaguar yet but
first let's take a look at a tiny little
mp3 player James Kim really only likes
one thing about this music point there's
no extra features no FM tuner no voice
recording no nothing this right here is
not a button it's a phantom button it's
a nice place to put your thumb these
three buttons right here play forward
back also double up as your volume
buttons so what's the big deal about
this thing well the reason I like it is
because its twenty dollars 40 bucks
that's worth it just for the storage now
on to something that gives you more for
more money ken German really likes the
new sony ericsson k 7i da camera phone
this is sony ericsson's for cyber-shot
phone so it is really all about
photography don't see the limbs right
now but just slide down this cover there
it is does have a pretty big lens along
with the mirror for self portraits and a
very bright flash almost floods the
pictures with too much light in some
cases looks but very much like a camera
from the outside same with the
ergonomics just press this button right
here and take pictures in this to zoom
over although very stylish phone and
packed with features as well yes this is
a phone not a camera but kent german
says it's the best camera phone he's
seen yet now mobile viruses are starting
to become a real concern Robert famosi
explains one of the most common ways you
can get a virus on your cell phone
antivirus vendors tell me that the
number one reason people infect their
own mobile device is that they need to
make a phone call so they say yes and
they accept the virus onto their system
just so they have access to the outside
world in doing so however you have now
become a vector and you are now
spreading the virus to other mobile
devices around you Robert recommends
installing antivirus on your mobile
phone and if you get one of those
messages repeatedly from a number you
don't know just walk away you'll
probably get out of range or you can
drive away in a hot new car ride and
cooley shows off the most
we advanced Jaguar yet so here's what's
really interesting they tell us it's the
first automotive application of
macromedia flash to power the menus and
drive the interface sometimes it seems a
little bit sluggish in terms of its
processor power we're not sure if that's
a hardware or a software issue but
hopefully they'll optimize that more in
future x KS because it's a little bit
slow on the uptake sometimes that
doesn't take away from the overall
satisfying visual quality of this screen
it's an extremely beautiful interface
that controls all the cars major systems
you've got them right there audio
climate phone bluetooth phone in this
car of course DVD based navigation and
overall vehicle settings remember it's a
coupe though so you're not going to fit
in the backseat Brian tried was it
pretty that's it for this edition of
road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back
next time for more gadgets to keep you
armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
