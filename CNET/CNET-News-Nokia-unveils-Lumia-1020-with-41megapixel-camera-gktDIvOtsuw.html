1020 take a look at that all right with
the Lumia 1020 pictures will mean more
to you you'll see things with this
device that you've never seen before
you'll get closer than ever before and
you'll discover and rediscover new
stories we've done this by creating an
entirely new ultra high resolution 41
megapixel backside illuminated sensor as
a result what you get are the smartest
sharpest best smartphone pictures
possible take a look at these pictures I
took with three different smart phones I
did it in these lighting conditions in
the back corner of the room about 12
hours ago in this room first I took a
picture of you hon Christina jumping
using a samsung galaxy s4 automatic
settings flash I thought that's not so
good so now let's try well I know it's a
cool device but let's try it nonetheless
the iPhone 5 there's the image now Lumia
1020 with a super-fast
xenon flash can freeze the motion take a
look
you see that isn't that amazing finally
you can actually use your flash check
this out this image even after you take
the image zoom in same image you can
read it amazing level of detail we
capture one image but save two versions
one is a full resolution image for
endless reframing opportunities the
other is the over sampled image that we
save for sharing as a result of these
two images takes a little bit longer to
process the image than with a standard
camera but no other camera can achieve
what we achieve I actually travel to a
small farm in northern me a tree in
Finland and I went to a supermarket and
bought a needle and decided to try out
this camera everyone see the needle
so I can try zooming in those individual
straws here it's not there
we could spend quite a lot of time here
so I will save save the time here and
tell you that it's actually right Oh
keep going keep going keep going keep
going keep going
look at that the eye of the needle in
the haystack with the Lumia 1020</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
