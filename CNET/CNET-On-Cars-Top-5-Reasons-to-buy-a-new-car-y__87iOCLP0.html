years old don't call it old call it
normal that's the current average age of
cars on us roads and yes that's an
all-time high
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 tech
reasons you might want to buy a new car
number 5 is upgradability I do put this
one low because it isn't real common yet
but car makers are beginning to make the
most recent cars with software that can
be upgraded after you purchased them
particularly for the head unit Tesla is
famous for doing these updates over the
air
Ford has sent out millions of DIY
upgrade USB drives that you plug in and
do yourself and many other car makers
will upgrade your software when your
car's in for regular service you could
end up with some nice new features on
the main screen the results can be great
or sometimes not but without a late
model car you can't even find out number
4 is lighting from high-intensity to
automatic high-beam to headlights that
steer themselves front lighting has
really changed test drive a new car at
night and then get back in yours it's
like driving by candlelight and for the
oncoming car it's like being
interrogated number 3 is LCD touchscreen
now I put this in the middle of my list
because having an LCD screen with touch
or a controller isn't necessarily better
than traditional knobs and a dot matrix
display see my Ford touch but in general
you'll get more choices more control and
more information available on an LCD
than any number of old-fashioned knobs
and buttons though Honda and Acura try
pretty hard to overload you with both
today all but the least expensive cars
are shipping with at least a color LCD
in the center step number two is
connectedness but you say your current
car already has an iPod connector and
satellite radio aren't you adorable
today it's all about USB ports built-in
Pandora tune in and Spotify streaming
apps wireless bluetooth streaming from
your phone and maybe even connect
did nav and destination search these are
things you'll use every time you drive
but only in the most recent years of
cars now I still don't make these number
one because your smartphone can graph
most of this onto an older car with at
least an aux jack and a windshield map
before I get you to number one to recent
car tech trends that I wouldn't even
make number 10 voice command and rear
seat DVD systems why because they sucked
come on car makers get voice to work at
least half as well as my phone and DVDs
still really the number one tech change
that is going to affect you every day in
a new car it's turbo charging and direct
injection this is the dynamic duo that
have changed automotive power usually
found in combination di and turbos have
meant a wholesale move to cars with
smaller engines with fewer cylinders
that still deliver more power better mpg
and lower emissions and this is the
innovation on my list that you will
literally appreciate every second your
car is running poor top 5 lists to wake
the car lover go to see net on cars calm
but on top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
