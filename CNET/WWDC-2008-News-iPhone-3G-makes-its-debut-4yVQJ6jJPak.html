birthday we're gonna take it to the next
level and today we're introducing the
iPhone 3G
we've learned so much with the first
iPhone we've taken everything we've
learned and more and we've created the
iPhone 3G and it's beautiful this is
what it looks like it's even thinner at
the edges it's really beautiful it's got
a full plastic back it's really nice
solid metal buttons the same gorgeous
3.5 inch display camera flush headphone
jack so you can use in improved audio
dramatically improved audio it's really
really great and it feels even better in
your hand if you can believe it it's
really quite wonderful the iPhone 3G now
let's look at a very typical scenario
you've got an email attachment you want
to look at you tap on it let's do the
same thing here same phone same place
the 3G version downloads in five seconds
and the edge version in 18 seconds that
is 3.6 times faster on the 3G version so
we can see a real difference now of
download speeds and again if we compare
this to Wi-Fi you'll see that the 3G is
approaching Wi-Fi speeds one of the
things we're also really proud of though
is we're doing this with great battery
life we've managed to get five hours of
3G talktime which is really an
industry-leading amount of time we're
very pleased with this browsing five to
six hours of high-speed browsing video
seven hours an audio we've managed to
get 24 hours of order so great
performance great battery life now one
other thing that benefits from fast data
of course is GPS and we've built that
into the new iPhone 3G as well
as you know location services is going
to be a really big deal on the iPhone
with the iPhone 2.0 software you saw a
bit of that here today it's going to
explode and of course we get data from
cell towers location data we get
location data from Wi-Fi and now we also
get it from GPS and I'm really happy to
tell you that the iPhone 3G is going to
sell
at a hundred
at a hundred at just $199 we think the
iPhone 3G is going to be affordable to
almost everyone and that's for the 8 gig
model the 16 gig model just $2.99 and
for the 16 gig model we also have
something special we have a white one
it's also very beautiful 70 countries
this year we're gonna start with 22 of
the biggest and we're going to be
rolling out the iPhone 3G at the same
time in all of these countries and we're
rolling it out on July 11th July 11th
and in almost every one of these
countries the price is a maximum $1.99
all around the world so we are really
really excited about the new iPhone 3G</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
