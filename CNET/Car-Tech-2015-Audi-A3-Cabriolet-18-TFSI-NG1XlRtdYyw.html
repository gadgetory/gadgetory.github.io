about a fairly capable rather impressive
performance vehicle with sharp top
responses but sometimes and maybe card
it's just kind of silly and fun this is
that car let's try the 2015 Audi a3
Cabriolet with the little engine and no
Quattro
let's check the tech now the a3 was
heavily revised for this 2015 model year
gen a nice power top is beautifully
insulated a glass back light it cycles
in less than 20 seconds and can do so up
to 31 miles per hour
okay our a3 cab keeping it affordable
here is about 36 v base that's a 1/8
front wheel drive and the basic trim
level a tick under 2 grand gets us
navigation this is one of my favorites
in the industry worth the money driver
assist for 1,400 gets you parking sonar
rear camera and blind spot tech and like
it or not I kind of not the Audi am i
music interface is something you're
gonna want for your portables that's
about 350 bucks all in word about 40,000
100 that's kind of your minimum CNET
spec now inside the a3 just like outside
of the a3 this car is all grown up it is
a premium compact car you can tell by
the nice finishes in the vehicle even
though it's not terribly ornate your
eyes drawn immediately of course to this
head unit this pop-up screen that in the
sedan I think is silly
in the cab I think it's great because it
hides this delicate piece of gear from
the elements when you either want to
on-demand or when the car turns off some
other things to tell you this car is
premium is the fact that you can get
banging Olufsen audio I wouldn't but you
can get it
howdy drives select but you really
control the personality of the vehicle
exceptionally well and you've got a
built-in 4G connection that brings us
back to this head unit
look at that nav display you're looking
at a combination of 4G data pipeline
Google Earth data and imagery and Nvidia
graphics processing in terms of sheer
map interface this is the best in the
biz right now and it moves very smoothly
underway which a lot of other cars don't
even without photorealism
and that 4g icon
see down there is right next to my phone
icon because they're separate this is
not pulling data from my phone like most
connected cars do today it's got its own
LTE radio pricing on that 4G connections
gonna be a sticking point for folks
after a six month free period you're
gonna pay $100 for five gigabytes across
six months or $500 get you 30 gigabytes
across 30 months nobody likes another
wireless bill I think that goes to zero
in the industry in the years ahead but
for now it's gonna stick in your craw
being a German car as typically is the
case no touch we've got a voice command
button over here but that's at ease and
the cab there's no voice command the
hardware's not in or available in the
sedan of course it would be this is how
you control everything you've got a turn
kick and click wheel you've got four
zone buttons around it the correspond to
the menu zones and the corners of the
screen you've got these two rockers that
kick up or down into any of the four
major functions and on top of that
controller you've got a nice big finger
touchpad particularly good for writing
out things like addresses let's talk
about media Audi's have a great
assortment of that of course the part
that I want to point out is that they're
still using this damn
outtie am i connector which is a
proprietary buck on one end and then you
choose the cable that has the other end
that goes to what you want iPhone or USB
or what have you this makes me nuts
they've got a USB port down here which
is what I want to use but notice it's
charged only maybe next year they'll
give us a USB port that's also smart now
one of the little button nose of our a3
we find in this case the lesser of two
engines that aren't that far apart this
is the 1.8 liter sidesaddle for turbo
charge with direct injection they call
it a TFSI engine this is going to give
you 170 horsepower 200 pound feet of
torque so this little guy's got about
3400 pounds of car to move which he gets
up to 60 in about 7 and a half seconds
while delivering very good mpg to
4:35 they're in the rationale for the
1.8 now these 1.8 by the way are all
front-wheel drive if you want all wheel
drive you're going into a 2-liter and
they all use the six-speed dual-clutch
automated manual well as I mentioned we
had the 2-liter Quattro we had the sedan
of this car now I've got the 1.8 liter
front-wheel drive and I miss the 2-liter
Quattro not so much the four-wheel drive
which I don't need right now in this
situation but I missed the engine and
the transmission relationship we had a
some turbo lag I detect there's some
gear logic lag there's some transmission
actuation lag and in general therefore
feels like it's kind of always playing
catch-up it's like behind the 8-ball in
terms of power response the ride quality
however is really good and fits a car
like this I mean it's a little cab I
don't really want a gutsy track to
suspension in a car that has the top
going down this is a great little car
though even though it's not as sharp as
some Audi's are in a performance sense
it's very livable I just wish the
powertrain was a little more snappy to
go with it's nice tidy lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
