and today I'm looking at the Vizio
e-series TV it's not often actually it's
almost never that we will review a TV
after already looking at at once but
with the Vizio a series we made an
exception as its much lauded but
ultimately underdone local dimming
feature was finally fixed several months
after appearing on the market the e
series comes in a range of sizes from 39
to 50 inches and now includes the
promised local dimming for better
contrast the styling of these direct LED
panels is thick as this is where all the
LEDs go but it has a minimalist look
from the front with a very slim bezel
the stand is unfortunately non swiveling
the TV comes with a fairly button heavy
remote which unfortunately also lacks
the reversible QWERTY keyboard of last
year's TV the app selection is fairly
standard with netflix youtube and
pandora all standard inputs are limited
to three HDMI slots unless you get the
50 inch in which case you get four as
you'd expect the latest changes do have
an effect on the picture black levels
now rival plasmas like the Panasonic s60
and shadow detail has been much improved
be aware that we did find differences
between the 42 inch and 50 inch versions
and would pick the 42 if we had to as it
has less black crushing problems color
is okay but a little under saturated and
not as vibrant as its plasma competition
Vizio was shown that it is possible to
improve picture quality with a simple
firmware update but we found that
getting it can be tough if you're having
problems check the review on cnet com
for details on how to get it overall
this is a very good TV and if you're
looking to spend under a thousand
dollars it's quite a good buy this has
been ty pendlebury with a second look at
the e-series Vizio television
