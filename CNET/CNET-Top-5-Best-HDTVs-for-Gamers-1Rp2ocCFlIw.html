second counts your hand-eye coordination
is so finely tuned at this point that
you start to notice the lag between your
game controller in your console and even
between your console and your TV I'm
Donald Bell and in this episode of top 5
I'm counting down seeing that senior
editor David Katz Myers list of the 5
best HD TVs with the least amount of
input lag so rating only gamers will
appreciate 50 to 60 milliseconds is
about average of the TVs on this list
all measured under 40 starting off at
number 5 the Panasonic TCP 50s 60s to be
the highest rated TV on this list and
clocks in at just thirty four point one
milliseconds of input lag it's a plasma
TV which means great deep blacks but a
slightly thicker design than you'd find
on an LCD now the 50-inch model comes in
and around $700 which is a great value
the only bad news is that they cut some
corners with the inputs only two HDMI
connections on the back so if you're a
multiple console type with the ps4 and
the Xbox one you'll have to invest in
the switcher box or just pick a side
already number four goes off the beaten
path a bit the been qw 1070 a projector
the BenQ top seen its list of the best
budget home theater projectors for $1000
you could be playing call of duty on a
screen the size of your wall lag time
comes in at just thirty three point
seven milliseconds which is twice as
fast as some of the TVs we've tested of
course having a life-size Lara Croft in
your living room might not be the best
thing for your social life but what you
do in the dark and the privacy of your
own home is entirely your business just
stay away from the kinectimals for
something a little more inconspicuous
how about number three the Vizio e500
I a one now this is the least expensive
TV on this list with a 50 inch model
priced at around $650 LED LCD so there's
less power consumption than the plasma
or the projector but since this direct
lit instead of edgelet it's still pretty
thick compared to those razor thin TVs
we see these days
still a great value and it comes with
videos full suite of Smart TV apps and
content input lag is a swift 32 point
two milliseconds which is fantastic for
the price but that still obscenely slow
compared to number two the sony KD l 55
w 900 a here's a TV from a company who
knows a thing or two about high
performance gaming 19.7 milliseconds of
lag time along with a stunning insanely
thin design and arguably the best
picture quality on this whole list the
bad news is this one's going to set you
back around $2,300 for a 55 inch TV it's
about a thousand dollars more than our
editors choice TV the Panasonic TCPS T
60 so you're kind of a sucker for buying
this thing especially when you figure
out what our final pick is so here we go
the number one TV for gamers looking for
the least amount of input latency the
sony KD l 55 w 802 a look familiar it's
practically the same design as the last
sony only this one comes in at 1600
dollars and comes with a more aggressive
gaming mode that ratchets that lag time
down to sixteen point nine milliseconds
that said if you're gaming obsession has
brought you to the point where sixteen
point nine milliseconds makes an impact
you seriously need to go for a walk
maybe even change into some clean
clothes or brush your teeth there could
be some real people out there so there
you go four TVs and one projector that
may or may not make you a better gamer
