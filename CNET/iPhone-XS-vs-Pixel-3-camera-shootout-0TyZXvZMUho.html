more important than ever if you're
looking at the pixel 3 and the iPhone
10's it's time to see which one comes
out on top
no surprises here that they both have 12
megapixel cameras at the back but the
iPhone 10s has two a wide-angle lens at
F 1.8 and a telephoto at F 2.4 while the
pixel 3 just has one single rear camera
a wide-angle lens at F 1.8 now the
iPhone 10s this year has a lot of
computational photography tricks up its
sleeve which traditionally has been
something that the pixel line has really
excelled at so I think this comparison
is going to be really interesting and
don't forget that the tennis and the
tennis Max and the pixel three and the
pixel three accel share the same cameras
so the results should be the same the
general photos the phones are
neck-and-neck both produced shots with
pleasing color saturation and good
exposures the iPhone has a new HDR mode
called smart HDR while the pixel has
hdr+ and hdr+ enhanced when active both
make a big difference in boosting
dynamic range in images for portraits
they each let you change the bokeh or
the blur in the background after the
shots been taken I really like the way
the iPhone has the simulated f-stop but
the pixel also lets you change the focus
point and add foreground blur the iPhone
has a natural-looking blur with smoother
transitions between subject and the
fall-off the pixels photos look
pin-sharp and pop off the screen but
hair or complicated backgrounds can
confuse the effect so you'll see the
line where the subject ends and the blur
begins
for selfie fans the pixel has two
front-facing cameras
one's a regular field of view and what
is a wide-angle for getting multiple
people or more of the background in the
shot you can also add face retouching
options on the pixel without any filters
photos are incredibly detailed and
they're almost a little too harsh for my
taste
natural is a good middle ground that
doesn't look fake or cartoonish like the
softer setting can white balance is a
little bit warmer on the 10s overall and
some people do feel the front-facing
camera applies a slight smoothing effect
especially in low-light shots we spend a
lot of time talking about the photo and
video quality but let's talk for a
second about the actual camera
interfaces themselves on the pixel 3
there is this extra setting if you
toggle over to more you'll see
photosphere google lens and this fun one
called photobooth pop-up which is kind
of cute if you smile it'll actually
automatically start taking photos which
is nice if you just want to do some
hands-free stuff also there is a
settings option which is my personal
favorite to tweak around in there is
option to turn on gridlines but if you
tap into the advanced menu you get the
option to toggle an HDR plus control on
the camera app itself so you just have
that easily accessible on the interface
raw and JPEG control the iPhone 10's on
the other hand the interface is pretty
similar to iPhones of old it's simple a
lot of people like that for the most
part I do too but there's a few things
that I really wish it would be add just
like the pixels so I don't have to go
out of the camera interface into that
settings menu to turn on things like
grid lines or even toggle on smart HDR I
just wish there was an option to do that
in the default camera app and of course
you can shoot raw on the iPhone tennis
and tennis Mac's
as well however you do need a
third-party camera app to do that
the pixel has the edge in low-light
producing photos with less noise than
the iPhone I really pushed these phones
with some extreme low-light shots but
the pixel does saturate the red Channel
a little bit more than the iPhone so
photos can look a bit too vivid for
flash photos
I think the pixel looks a bit more
natural but this one is really close the
iPhone produces less dramatic shadows
which you might prefer and Google's
nitesite feature that promises better
looking photos without flash wasn't
available at the time of testing the
pixel only has a wide-angle lens at the
back so to make up for the lack of an
optical telephoto lens like the iPhone
it uses super as zoom it does an
impressive job of keeping up with a 2 X
optical zoom from the iPhone even in
low-light but if you push it to extremes
results can look a little messy both
phones recording 4k but only the iPhone
gets to 60 frames a second at this
resolution clips in good light look
decent on both but the iPhones video
looks just a bit sharper with smoother
shifts in exposure when the light
changes the pixel also crops in a bit
more on the image I like how the pixel
can track moving subjects in stills or
video but overall video stabilization
looks a little less jello-like and more
natural from the iPhone
and the iPhones recording sounds more
rich and full Don the Pyxis track even
though they're both recording in stereo
the slow motion both film at 240 frames
a second but the pixel maxes out at 720
while the iPhone is full 1080p in low
light the pixel struggles to acquire
focus when recording and the image just
looks messy and noisy the iPhone by
comparison looks great a setting called
Auto low-light fps automatically drops
the frame rate from 30 to 24 frames a
second the difference between the two in
low-light is night and day overall both
the pixel 3 and iPhone 10s are
incredibly good camera phones and have
made big leaps over their predecessors I
would be happy with either but I think
the pixel has the edge in still images
especially in low-light while the iPhone
easily pulls ahead for video
so which one did you prefer iPhone 10s
or Google pixel three let me know in the
