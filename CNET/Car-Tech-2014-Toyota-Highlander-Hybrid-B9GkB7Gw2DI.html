anything in its line and give enough
time and you might think that this
Highlander Hybrid is just basically a
Highlander with some Trias technology
grafted but it's actually quite
different let's try this 2014 Highlander
Limited platinum all-wheel drive and
highly electrified and check the tip if
you haven't seen a Highlander lately
hybrid or otherwise you haven't seen a
Highlander and then quite a bit of
plastic surgery on it for this very
fresh third edition and as you can see
it's gotten a lot less boxy and square
shoulder than it used to be that's part
of the big trend in its category if it
looks bigger that's largely an optical
illusion by them drawing the lines
lengthwise although it is about two
inches longer but that's not really
meaningful wheelbase is about the same
as it was before seats eight they tell
me now I counted seven unless there's a
different back seat option or someone's
got to sit on that little cup rack and
that doesn't sound comfortable and one
of the big headlines on this car is no
longer that it's a hybrid that's not
even exotic anymore but this is a very
different hybrid as we're gonna find out
with not one not two but three electric
motors now the first thing you're gonna
notice inside the Highlander Hybrid the
new Highlander in general is this
package tray it's basically a stuffed
tray for your mobiles and such I admire
the idea finally giving us a shelf to
put things not a lot of cars do this
unfortunately you know it's crap your
kids are gonna put in there I see this
being just like an open sewer this is
what they call a cable management system
all it seems to do is take the mess of a
cable and split it between the Shelf and
the console I don't call that management
it's just a pass-through let's talk
about screens you've got a helper screen
here about a 4 inch we've seen this
before in between the two what they call
Optitron very nicely detailed analog
gauges the one on the Left gives you
your charge power and eco swing pretty
common stuff and your temp on the rights
your speedo and your traditional fuel
level notice what's missing here most
hybrids have this huge battery level
indicator at all times showing you how
much charge you've got they kind of make
that go away it's available it's over
here under your home screen but it's not
one that screams that you
all the time it's an interesting piece
of psychology to say look don't worry
about your battery level worry about how
economically you're driving that does
make more sense inside this big screen
is a lot of proven Toyota technology
it's laid out a little differently
you've got a lot of touch buttons
alongside here they are they're physical
buttons as you can see but they don't
move they're just using actual pressure
sensitivity nothing new in the
navigation system to speak of we've seen
that before let's go into your audio
sources where you have many AM and FM
with HD radio XM radio is standard your
CD above here still have optical discs
iPod and USB connecter that's where this
gnarly mess is down here bluetooth
streaming auxilary Jack you can also
play DVDs to particular media apps come
in via Entune it's I Heart Radio for
Clear Channel stations and Pandora for
predictive internet radio all of that
comes out through what's called a JBL
GreenEDGE amplification system the
speakers around the car the amps that
drive them are all built for efficiency
so they don't tap any more power out of
the car's electrical system than they
have to cohesive and makes sense for a
hybrid now let's go to the apps notice
how they make everything an app it's a
little bit of a cheat I mean navigation
is not an app it's a function built into
the car same thing with foam the more
interesting stuff comes over here on the
right where you find your Entune array
mostly things we've seen before bing I
Heart Radio Pandora OpenTable
movietickets.com Yelp and then sports
and stocks from satellite radio that you
probably don't care about traffic is
provided by HD radio broadcast by the
way so even if you let your satellite
radio subscription lapse you should
still have good traffic data on the map
voice command for the Bing search tool
is a welcome technology now just say
what you're looking for and it'll return
results that are navigation oriented now
speaking of the audio system if you're
like me and you still like to grab the
volume knob once in a while just to get
the sound right where you want it or
quickly turn it down you're gonna hate
this car look at these knobs get a side
angle there it's kind of like a round
knife edge there could not be a worse
design knob for the human hand it's
uncomfortable it's a sharp chrome ring
and it's slippery what were they
thinking our back-up camera is standard
as you can also hear are the rear sonar
I like how sharp this one is it's a
wide-angle lens but not ridiculously so
so the world behind you is not too
distorted and you've got prediction of
duress
in distance but most important you've
got really good detail on this screen so
you can make things out with some with
some real precision you'd be surprised
how much that helps the most interesting
technology on this car could be that one
driver easy speak I've never seen this
on a car before it takes a little bit of
your voice from the Bluetooth microphone
system and pipes it to the rear speakers
of the car not real loud it's not like a
PA system it's more like just a subtle
enhancement so you're not having to yell
to the back row and tell them to stop
punching each other in the face you can
say hey little darlings stop punching
each other in the face it also works
with the audio system so it's not
fighting it all the time it's rather
doing now an unusual story about how
this vehicle runs starts here in the
engine bay first of all you've got a
three and a half liter lean-burn v6 not
a terribly powerful beast although total
system horsepower is 280 but that
combines a bunch of electric motors by a
bunch I mean three motor number one is
primarily a generator and a starter and
it's also part of the ratio control with
the CVT gearbox motor number two is your
front wheel drive traction motor and
captures brake energy from the front to
go back in the battery motor number
three is on the rear wheels and also
captures brake regen from them now well
this is a complex and novel arrangement
for an all wheel drive vehicle it's also
rather clean eliminating a slew of
almost victorian-era drive shafts and
transfer cases that other all-wheel
drive cars use now we're looking at our
nearly forty nine hundred pounds of
Highlander here in this hybrid hello big
battery but it still gets up to 60 in
7.2 seconds that's pretty sprightly
hello torque mpg all in complete blended
system is 27 28
now driver operation in this car is
pretty straightforward the all-wheel
drive system is basically transparent
you're not seeing a bunch of all-wheel
drive controls in fact basically none
you put this guy in Drive or over here
on the sports side for shift ability no
paddles on this vehicle and off you go
to the races you have a couple of
buttons up here underneath our cable
management one is called the Eco mode
and that'll bias the car toward more
green running a particularly less
response on acceleration and you've got
the easy mode which will buy us in
another way which will say run on pure
electric as much as you can
given your battery state no jumping in
this Highlander doesn't have anything
terribly all-wheel-drive about it it
doesn't have that sort of rugged
off-road tiene what happens is the
vehicle is largely front-wheel drive
bias but can send as much as 50% of
total system torque to the rear wheels
when needed but it'll figure that out on
its own that's why they call it
all-wheel drive - high it does the
thinking if you do the driving the
overall impression is one of very good
linear power hybrids tend to do that
even when you're in Eco mode it doesn't
become a non-responsive slug I like that
and the braking is similarly linear a
lot of hybrids have kind of multistage
braking between the service brakes and
the regen but this one's a nice linear
smooth application that's a bit of an
achievement my concern here is that
there are a lot of noises I don't like I
get a lot of powertrain noise on
acceleration that doesn't become a
vehicle like this when you come to a
stop there's a whole lot of sort of gear
noise as the drive line settles or
mashes its teeth or whatever it's doing
and when you turn on the seat coolers
this is the loudest thing I've ever
heard in a car that isn't the audio
system if you live in a hot climate you
need to check this out if you test drive
one of these cars I thought I had a
window open in the back for like the
first five minutes I drove this car so I
realized it was the seat fans not the
Lane Departure is calibrated pretty well
although it's late by some people's
standards it doesn't come into effect
until in my experience you're actually
on the line not approaching it the blind
spot tech is very ordinary it puts a
tiny little indicator on the mirror when
there's someone in your blind spot and
it's passive like the lane departure but
in some it's a nice driver it knows its
role is what I would say okay this price
our Highlander we're nearly top of the
stack in fact we are because it's a
hybrid and all hybrids are limited and
we also have added the Platinum package
on top of that we're at just under
51,000 base the Platinum is about $2,500
of that price and adds the safety
connect sort of OnStar features adaptive
radar cruise control the forward
collision warning and lane departure
warning automatic high beams and that
very spacious panoramic
Rufe about the only thing I can find to
add to this to make it fully seen that
style is remote start which is an odds
Factory leave out it's $500
dealer-installed
all-in word about 51,000 4 on this car
for a vehicle that is rather heavily
revised has a great new look a very
innovative ambitious hybrid system and
does some really interesting things
inside the cabin to keep the technology
high as well as the creature comforts
