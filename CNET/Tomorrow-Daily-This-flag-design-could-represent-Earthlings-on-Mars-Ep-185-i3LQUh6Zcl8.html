way to print al panels on uneven
surfaces a giant auction for movie props
from Rick Baker special effects shorten
air monsters creatures okays props so
good and lastly a graduate design
students idea for a flag that represents
everyone on the earth unless you're an
alien tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best Keith
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva join me as always Harlem
Globetrotter kale anonymous that was
really impressed you just passed it I
was an alley-oop was amazing some guys
just dunked like three feet away thanks
for catching that Kareem incredible oh
kuri my office like I didn't recognize
you from the back there ok awesome um
it's Thursday mostly because we film
this the day before but you know if I
you really did not even let us hide that
at all yesterday yeah sure you're like
by the way we're jerks I'm all
transparent about so right now you are
not here I'm here but I'm not here so
right now in San Francisco at Google i/o
she's at the Google press conference
thing yeah at the keynote at the keynote
doing what what are you doing right now
can you yes yes you do I'm listening to
Larry Page after he parachuted onto the
stage uh no I don't know what he's gonna
do I mean it's it you can't really top
that one google i/o where they have the
for google glass when they introduced it
they had the guys like jump out of the
plane and i like scale down with
building yeah come into this I mean it's
kind of like an action movie so I don't
know how they're gonna top that but
there should still be some really
amazing products there so I'm sure this
go watch it just go watch it yeah um and
I don't with Google messaging us right
yes that was google definitely on text
messaging me ah but we have some good
stories today so let's not waste any
more time
one of the things that I think we
haven't really spent a whole lot of time
thinking about as a global society is
what flag are we going to put down we
send a human to Mars is it going to be
the flag of the country of the
astronauts is it going to be what if the
astronauts that get sent to Mars are
from different countries do they each
put a flag of like the country they're
from like does everybody get to put a
flag down can I give you the American
answer yes America good any right
wearing the right shirt for that idea no
that's a good point because we as a
people are hoping to trip like travel to
planets and be there as a people rather
than as a country separated right and so
and of course in the 60s it was a race
to the moon against the Russians and so
they're like we put an American flag was
a very American thing but maybe just
maybe the sort of trip to Mars might be
a little bit more of a global pursuit
which it definitely feels like at this
point so um this guy named Oscar Pern
felt is a design graduate from Sweden
and he decided to design a flag that
represents earth as a whole which I
thought was really cool is a really good
idea so this is a video of him like I'm
putting this thing together it is seven
interlocked circles and they represent a
flower which it represents life on Earth
and then how things on earth are all
linked to one another whether that's
directly or indirectly so this got these
seven kind of interlocking circles
almost a little bit not unlike the
Olympic rings the Olympic rings but
there's nothing like exactly like the
11th or seven instead of five and they
don't have color and then the background
of the flag is blue to represent all the
water on Earth and and so he was saying
that maybe something like this could
even be used on earth to remind us that
we're all part of one community if you
think about it because a lot of
astronauts have reported this sort of
phenomenon but this overwhelming feeling
of global community as they look down on
Earth from the International Space
Station or from capsules and things like
that from space which i think is so cool
and I love this idea that we might have
some day we might you know go to Mars
and put this flag for Earth down like
almost like marvin the martian it's like
I claim this I claim this for more
exactly we would just be doing the exact
opposite and taking Marvin the Martians
planet for us we like this we claim this
for it's ours um so it's a project it's
not anything official this guy just
decided to go and make this design he
took he checked out all of the different
like a bunch of different flags from
different countries I'm and created I
don't know why this is not quiet shush
um but yeah I he took a bunch of
different designs and just really kind
of went for it and created this final
you're going to see the final in a
second hair it's gonna color there you
go so there it is white rings and then
there's that you can see the flower in
the middle like a little flower in the
middle so yeah it's really cool flag
really simple but also very powerful and
then this was sort of his ideas like oh
this is what you would see behind a
global astronauts official photo so I'm
not a real photo no no so give it like
kind of put this together so um so that
brings us as a hashtag a day which is TD
flag and we want to know what you think
should be on the earth flag like what's
the thing what should it look like I
mean this guy is just one person what
about your ideas you guys I'm sure have
some great ideas I know obviously your
first choice Cal would be troll face but
if you had a second choice what would
that choice be God's sum up the entirety
it's tough human existence in one in one
image first of all I wouldn't put a
bunch of circles I was five um god I
don't know I guess to this point yet to
simplify the concept if i simplify
because it's got to be easy recognizable
I'm recognizable so a flag with the
planet earth on it a flag with earth
just a picture of birth I like that I
like the one from futurama ok the one
from futurama is like it's the American
flag but where it were their stars
there's the the planet Earth perfect
it's called the earth that can flag the
earthy can fly we're thinking flag I
like that one I'm a hot okay so what
about you what do you want yours to be
alright yo Chris Pratt it's just crazy
Chris Pratt I on a flag so many
Photoshop that we haven't gotten any
Photoshop from you guys yeah
hertha can flag from futurama perfect
that perfect that seems like a pretty
good yeah it's pretty good um but yeah I
think maybe just a Chris Pratt of like
Chris Brown's like he is a great
ambassador i'm wearing my guardians of
the galaxy shirt convene oh yeah so
conveniently today he's a great
ambassador in the star so that is true
um i would say gosh I i think i like the
idea of a photo of Earth but then I also
feel like I mean obviously I think it
would have to be blue cuz of Earth is
mostly covered in water and then I think
just maybe like um you know like the
sounds so dumb you know like the
bathroom the silhouettes of like a
person there's like men and women good
picture yes I think you just have like
those and then like a background that's
like Earth so it's like blue and green
it's like lamb so you here are some
people you want to represent humans as
well as the planet gotcha okay people as
well as the earth itself because I think
the earth is I mean it's important you
gotta rip the earth but then us like
it's you know we're gonna be the ones
taking it there so why not people to how
about this how about we think outside
the box mr. flag maker and let you do it
and make the flag in the shape of that
flattened earth that they've made you
know when they make those yeah make it
in the shape of the flat endure like a
geography map and then you can put your
humans on it I like that or you could
make that was why we may getting a flag
for a planet we don't necessarily have
this it's not gonna have the same
atmosphere everything's completely
different how was one question I add I
was like why not make the flag a
different shape like you have an
opportunity to make it like a triangle
or like some other you know like an
octagon or something cool like something
futuristic you know Battlestar Galactica
like cuts the corners off of all the
pages and stuff do that like may it look
futuristic guys like I don't know I
thought that was cool if you guys want a
photo shops on the year bonus points if
you want photoshop your flag we highly
recommend it Chris Pratt on it though
every flag all right so okay tell me
about Rainmaker please ok so back to
back to our nerdy pop culture stuff
because so you browse the internet or
watching movie in belek man i love that
creature whatever well it's probably it
was probably done by Rick Baker probably
well you're in luck because Rick Baker
is about to do a giant auction to
auction off some of your favorite
creatures from movies that he's worked
on including gremlins hell boy Harry and
the Hendersons Planet of the Apes men in
black and a lot more if you're watching
just you know play a veritable who's who
of some of these people some of these
characters this auction is happening
tomorrow which is may 29th and you can
hop on there it's obviously going to be
a very expensive auction that's a look
at those characters yes some of them are
actually animatronic so some of these
actually have their like gears and then
you could probably use servos and
actually make them may scare you as you
walk in your house oh my god but there's
all kinds of cool stuff there's I you
said there was one that was like a
couple hundred bucks right yeah I was
looking through the catalog and it's I
want to say like the lowest price thing
like the estimate cuz they give you
estimates only what they think it'll go
for I want to say was a like a skeleton
hand from the Haunted Mansion movie with
Eddie Murphy and it was like 200 to 300
dollars like that was their estimate so
there there was some stuff that was
affordable in the general sense of the
term I know like the Harry and the
Hendersons they had a full-body like
muscle suit with the headpiece and the
the gloves and everything and that was
they said like seven to nine thousand
dollars yeah 30 yeah there's gizmo but
this is a prop store auction they
actually do you can go on there anytime
you want and look at and look at props
and stuff like they had the Jurassic
Park barbasol can there a while back
that went for way way too much was like
two hundred thousand dollars Oh like ah
just just shy of joined a thousand
dollars to throw away most had all of it
saved up but it was too yeah again
tomorrow and these are all by Rick Baker
he has some of the those little those
little those little roaches from oh the
thing that they had that I think was the
creepiest was obviously the skin suit
from men in black Vincent D'Onofrio
Vincent off real skin suit terrifying
just disgusting a cockroach the saggy
cockroach skin suit yeah yeah gross um
yeah no I love this and i've i've been
to prop store before and if you go you
can actually bid online before the
auction starts so if you go like you can
put in your bid and it's like if you win
you win but if not not a big deal and
you'll have to be present during a live
auction but then there's also like you
could call in place a bit like there's
all kinds of ways a bit
so if Rick Baker or his movies are
something you're a fan of you can always
check it out you are they had the
Hellboy hair that one that was that that
I think would be the thing to actually
like a mad cat with like the whole yeah
if you get that if you get the Hellboy
hand call us cuz we want you to co-host
this show but yeah there you go so you
can check it out tomorrow mmm good luck
yeah good luck if you're if you're
bidding good luck I thing I think you're
one of millionaires that watch the show
do you know what L like if you've seen
Al tape and stuff right you go to like
festivals everything so sure you see it
all yes you could just say I go to a lot
of big festivals concerts and raves and
stuff yes okay you're talking about so L
panels are pretty rad but unfortunately
they are they have to have a layer of
plastic in them so they when you bend
them too far they can shatter a fracture
and then the screens now is good like
you can't see the glow as well well
researchers from the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology and Franz bender GmbH &amp;amp; Co
have created a process that prints al
layers directly onto surfaces without
the need of this like layer so check
this out they're going to play this
video and you're going to see that they
have removed the pay their they've
removed the plastic from this process
they have taken that step that bit of al
paneling out of the equation and they
are now able to print an e el panel
directly onto paper and these are them
so you can see you watch that's paper
they're moving it around and they
printed it directly onto the paper like
that's not a special like separate thing
that they then put on to a layer paper
so they focusing on printing it onto
paper or just anything anything so they
were saying we can print it on two
Spears we can actually like straight-up
print onto a sphere we can make a whole
al panel on a sphere they said any 3d
object can have al coatings now at a low
cost so this might change the way we
kind of ceal layers on things like we
might see more of them and they said we
can print onto surfaces that are concave
convex shaped weirdly that have an
uneven surface and they've also found a
way to keep the layer consistently thick
like so they're like it's not you know
all over the place is like thick part
thin part now if they can keep it pretty
consistent and they said the reason why
is there's a new pad process that a pad
printing process I should say that can
conform to different shapes as it
applies the AL coating making it
possible to keep it consistent all the
way around so that's that's the process
that's the rubber pad right there see
that that red thing wow that's the
process that enables it to be able to be
printed directly on to a 3d any 3d
object and they said it does with this
particular process it does not take much
to print at a commercial scale so they
can really scale this up pretty easily
pretty low cost and also it requires
fewer steps than normal al printing and
they have a range of colors that you can
apply to different services so we might
be seeing a little more
electroluminescent paneling that's some
futuristic clothing right there like I
drew these stars lit up trick leggings
easy might these up thinking that would
be amazing I'd love fun blocking
consolation anyway that's cool that be
glorious oh yeah pretty awesome i just
thought it was really cool i can't wait
to see that sort of applied in everyday
Tron Legacy Tron leggings Oh should get
me some Tron leggings Tron leggings see
ya know that is pretty cool I would like
to see that the Tron Tron world good
good good on you good good on me thank

yeah it's one of the cheapest forms of
entertainment if you amortize it out all
the time so we're not we were kids my
mom you should just bias annual
passwords and we just continue on all
the time so the cheapest way to keep us
entertained all day long on the weekends
mhm I've been there been there in that
exact situation yep so so they got
Disneyland I will see you there I'm
actually if you follow me on Twitter I
said a couple days ago that i'm in a
periscope and i probably am I'm gonna
I've got a if your cell phone charger
too I I believe it'll stand a better
there and Google then it will google i/o
you're probably right your prob can't
wait to get those cherries I'm really
excited for this grandbaby is it
yesterday we bet a bag of cherries Makka
cherries on periscope anywho I oh and
you guys will know the result of that
bet like as you're watching the show
because I'll have already tried and
probably failed silly oh yeah by the way
uh let's say I have an hour to periscope
before the you want stay before the
press conference starts or do you want
to say during like the actual conference
during the president you know there's a
better chance of getting something done
beforehand okay bye all right okay
whatever you want to do because I
totally trust that you won't like cheats
okay since I noon lets say by new i have
to get five minutes out by noon okay all
right oops oh how much i might as well
just vibe that bag of cherries on sunday
night i said i mean i already know it's
gonna happen anyway i'm probably
remember you to come on the show all
right good that's fine just caleb is
gonna be cherry covered in turn i am
into guacamelee so if you have a
playstation and you have playstation
plus you can get this game for free
right now and it's the Super Turbo
Championship Edition which includes some
extra DLC like an extra area in the game
there's like extra collectibles things
like that so qua Camilla is a game if
you are not familiar with this I think
the first time I saw I want to see maybe
like some artwork for this I thought it
was a fighting game but no it's it's a
platforming adventure game it's a
platformer and it's awesome like the
artwork is absolutely beautiful the
mechanics of the platforming is unreal
it's so well done the controls are
really tight i love a good platformer
the way Cael feels the open world games
that's how i feel about plaque like
platforming and collection games just
give it to me all day let's that's what
i like give platformers that i have to
collect stuff in so little story about
guacamelee last friday i downloaded it
to my playstation 4 and i played it for
11 hours straight which is should be
illegal in most states it probably is
and then i played it more over the
weekend and i have already beaten it but
i was i loved it so much this week that
i had to tell you that if you haven't
played it you must because it is so good
and it reminds me of like all of the old
Metroidvania is where it's like you have
the map
so they have the secret areas where you
get chest and all these you know extra
stuff there's costumes that you can buy
with silver that you find in game and
then you can also buy extra costumes for
like DLC I want to say it's like a
dollar two dollars or something like
that so um yeah it's a great game the
developers I mean they're really they
did a fine fine job in this game and
it's just really well polished it's so
fun and the DLC whatever the original
game was must have felt maybe a little
bit short just because the DLC like fit
in seamlessly I never felt like oh this
must be the area that's DLC actually
they look it up after I was done playing
the game find out what area was added so
it's so good so so good and it's free
until PlayStation Plus rolls over for
next month which I think ground zeroes
metal gear solid ground zeroes is the
free game one of the free games for next
level he paid money for that game twenty
bucks for like a good like a two hours
of a game takes two hours to do uh but
yeah so guacamelee guacamelee so good
you guys so so good highly recommend
highly recommend but um yeah you should
play it anyway that's what we're into so
now it's time to go over some more
cheater feedback let's hey user feedback
so because we're not in on Thursday
you're not it well I'm not in you're not
in here right now you're not yes I am
you pre-recorded yours and Logan is
projecting it on looks like the
projections wrap does the projection
look okay Logan okay good yeah no
stuttering that's good to hear hi so
we're doing another round of TD cheats
which is what should cheaters do to get
back into the game like what penance
should they pay yeah and again you guys
came up some good ones i wanted to
youtube to Martin wrote in these are
YouTube ones all right one of us Twitter
and there there's a couple of different
ones so Twitter a player that is caught
cheating should be locked in with half
stats in a corrupt skin as a brand I
like that half stats that's rough I
don't what they stay they locked in with
half again I wouldn't go back to the
game I'd say it would take twice as long
like to level up and stuff like maybe I
don't know anyway if they really want
their account back I like that corrupt
skin though
and then Ralph on YouTube Rodin said
reformed a-holes deserve a break
hahahahaha I don't agree uh people
deserve a second chance YouTube
commenters okay goodnight rode in on
YouTube and said if you're caught
cheating the game should be able to
discover when the cheat was installed
into the game files and reset your
progress back to that point as a warning
that's really smart I like that if they
can figure that out but yeah yeah that's
perfect because some of those guys it
would be fair because some of those guys
in case you missed a story when they
made a video to apologize for cheating
they were like well I've been playing
for a really long time and then people
started cheating so I had to start
cheating so if it reaches its back then
it make me know validates our story yeah
yeah that makes sense okay yeah no I see
that I guess that's a good one and then
a very lastly Rick wrote in on Twitter
and said player must donate five retail
copies of that game to the ones in need
or to those who deserve it yeah I like
that to donate five retail copies of the
game and I'd like I don't know how you
would dole those out like maybe buy
raffle or something like that but I
really like that idea where it's like
well you got to buy an extra copy of the
game now and the game dev would really
like the fact that you bought five more
copies of the game yeah it's like it's
like rabbits just keep multiplying
copies get bought because people just
keep chinking yeah or maybe just don't
cheat that should be your number one
choice I'm surprised nobody said that
don't cheat that seems like number one
doesn't look the number one answer but
it wasn't nobody said that everyone's
like punish that everybody really wants
to punish everybody okay we got to talk
about our very last thing which is our
phone talk over the day
that is a very it's a huge funk it's
just just too big too much yeah I wanted
the iphone 6 and I got the 6 plus and
it's just too big I love um I like a big
phablet whoa whoa like it's not like
this is the iphone 6 plus hello um fear
us wrote in he said he took this picture
with his Galaxy Note 4 he said hello I'm
sorry for this long email but i have to
tell you the story about this photo well
maybe it's a mini story I don't know you
decide is he saying all this yeah okay
so there's this awesome building that I
pass by on an average like once a month
for the past five years and I was gonna
send you the picture and tell you how
that I've never actually seen anyone get
in or out of that building for all those
years so basically I was gonna send the
photos and have that be the story lot lo
and behold I passed by the building
again yesterday with the intention to
take a photo of it and send it to you
guys only to find out there's a person
going into the building what talk about
a no irony i guess so i guess is he's
saying all this to ya this is all in his
email so i guess this is the whole story
LOL keep up the good work so let's take
a quick look at this building because
Luminati confirmed is that over go oh my
god this is a this is like a masonry
this is like a freemasons building it's
like a weird what is that I wish we
could zoom in on this I feel like we
should but um yeah this uh this building
looks ominous and I'm gonna I'm gonna
say that you're right and that is to say
I'm gonna say it's a secret society yeah
are you with me it looks like a building
that would be a secret society right
we're Benedict Cumberbatch lives of
course I will hear yes and he rules over
some sort of weird secret society
obviously and I think that that door is
actually a fake door to make people
think that's a real interest it's not
like there's obviously some secret
entrance where these like weird statues
are on the sides of the door yeah I
totally agree with you on that yeah
there's like a crate definitely not a
real door for show fake fake yeah they
painted that on this touch the pylons in
a specific order then it opens a door
totally my green so yeah that's a that's
we're gonna that's what we're telling
you is up with that building it's
somebody was trying to get in but they
probably nobody would be so foolish as
to be seen if there were a real member
of that secret society was a great email
