Valley I think it's just work how's it
going welcome everyone and as always if
you want to join in the conversation
we've got chat rooms going on livestream

Thrones there we go there you go
everyone it's a long we're also on
Twitter if you want to tweet us at crave
we're also keeping an eye on that if you
got any questions or comments you just
want to join in the conversation good
feel free I they won't live in my home
town of Taos New Mexico and the offices
of the award-winning taos news my
hometown newspaper former employer and
today obviously we're going to be
talking about Game of Thrones but did
you know that part of the world of
Westeros originates right here in small
town USA Taos New Mexico well you would
have if you've been reading townnews.com
where you'll find this interview if you
got the link there Steven there was an
interview in the paper here in my
hometown with one of my neighbors here
in Taos 92 year old Robert Fletcher who
is a legendary designer and he actually
the guy responsible the look of Klingons
he worked with Gene Roddenberry himself
he's got a new book out called a trunk
full of yak hair or how the Klingons got
their looks and Fletcher even though
he's 92 years old he isn't the type to
completely retire and these days he
actually still does some sketches for
the costume department at Game of
Thrones so you can read all about
Fletcher right there at taos news com
and I think I probably just gave myself
an assignment to look into the full
story behind this guy and the Klingon
short you
we did so anyway let's jump right into
the battle for the Iron Throne we've got
our resident Westeros guru Caitlyn
Caitlyn petrak of its petrarca vets I'm
gonna screw that up all day at your meow
yeah when she did an amazing guide to
the fifth season for us including a
really nice wrap up of season four and
then we've also got I think all the rest
of us are fans except for Jeff who's
kind of more or less a total game of
thrones noob am i right I haven't seen
any of it at all okay well I'm happy I'm
excited for you will school you will
school you don't worry if a lot to look
forward to and to keep track I think
it's a roller coaster exactly so I think
it's only fair to get Jeff caught up by
watching Caitlyn's amazing two minute
summary of the last season we throw that
on right now and then how about after we
watch this will allow you to get one or
one or two or three questions to help
that we can answer to help you get up to
speed Jeff and then you should be
completely caught up okay I'm sure solid
ok here we go Game of Thrones Season
five is starting and you probably need a
memory refresher on who did what where
and who died last season to help we're
gonna recap all the major season four
events in two minutes Sansa's taken to
the Eyrie by little finger she's freaked
out by our cousin and annoyed at the
creepy uncle routine and then lie safal
owes through the moon door and now
Sancho's lady of the Vale so what will
they make little finger at marine
Daenerys freeze the slaves and sends his
DARS Oh Laura back to you n cuy she's
betrayed by Jorah Mormont and in the end
she has to lock up her dragons so sad
after the red wedding Aria goes on a
buddy comedy adventure with the Hound
when i run into brianna in pod she
leaves the Hound for dead and now she's
Valar morghulis her way onto a ship
bound for Bravo's after Tyrians wet off
to Sansa he's accused of killing his
nephew and boy does a sister one
dead so he's locked up till the Viper
fights the mountain and then his brother
helps him escape only instead he kills
his love che oh and his dad before
climbing on a ship with mah reez newly
fitted with a golden hand the Kingslayer
watches Joffrey died in front of him
then he gives Briana's Valyrian steel
that one herb so she can find Sansa and
then from his sister frees his brother
who kills his father and man that'll
really mess you up huh yes despite her
twin safe return says he's thrown by
jamie's stump then the death of her son
makes her want blood so she blames
Tyrion hates Margaery Tyrell and
threatens her father but in the end she
loves Jamie so naturally they hook up
again basically brands been traveling
with the reeds the whole time and Hodor
and he's projecting himself into animals
and Hodor magically seeing the past and
future and discovering his award then he
finally makes it to the north and a
weirwood and lo and behold there's the
prophetic three-eyed Raven I Castle
black Jon Snow knows the free folk are
coming we can't get anyone to believe
him then Mance Rayder does attack and
John's true love is killed in Stannis
Baratheon swoops in from the north and
as promised here's who's dead or at
least we think so Joffrey Lannister I
mean Baratheon licen Prince Oberyn
Martell Brennan pip your grit Jojen Reed
the hound maybe che and the crappiest
death Tywin Lannister that's it i'm
caitlyn and you're all caught up for
season 5 on HBO caitlin and using Valar
morghulis Valar morghulis as a verb the
amazing part is she did all that without
note she was actually asleep she's
always talked to the best so Jack I
wanted to be faster but they were like
well yeah we can hardly understand you
so my favorite that of lassie son was
choppy like big time I'm yeah I was
really looking at differences I think
there's a really good one for Agron I'm
sorry Jeff questions go okay so if you
were gonna give me a reason to start
watching this knowing me what what would
be the biggest reason for me to start
watching hella innuendos yeah yeah you
windows let's see exactly I'm sold he's
in
I'm on board it I think it has a bit of
the beautiful script I think the script
writing if you like you know if you're a
writer and if you like to read pretty
much you will enjoy this the whole
beautiful trip that they take you into
the vocabulary in the language the way
that they really make that connection
when they use of words and the way they
answer each other is just it's
beautifully done I think it is really
it's very well written it to the point
though where I sometimes watch with the
captions on I do that too just so that
you know you get a little more or if you
don't really understand what's happening
or what you miss a certain section
because a lot of times they're secret
away in little old corners you know I'd
say also knowing how much you like
escapism Jeff that it really transport
you to wear it transports you to another
world but there are a lot of real human
emotions there you know there's fear
love betrayal hubris um just such a
bridge relay set so much humor um and
the production values are extremely high
it's like watching a movie every week it
is definitely and I mean you're a fan of
the star wars canon jephson and it's
really the same thing it's just Star
Wars collided with Rumspringa I mean
it's best if you're throwing some
gratuitous nudity I am so done the
highlight of my day was hearing leslie
say boobies it's all downhill from here
you guys do you got I feel like since
the first couple of seasons and I don't
mean this as a complaint or to be creepy
although I'm sure it'll come across but
it feels like the nudity has actually
decreased while they've they've had to
focus on killing more people over the
reasons that seem right I also heard
that the Khaleesi was not into getting
naked anymore on the show so that was a
controversy I read it once a fight once
she did it like at the beginning I
remember the first time we see she told
me yeah was in the tub yeah yeah she was
pretty much naked and yeah you see here
like with that bike like see-through
gown well I mean when you think about it
they're all on the younger side
the ones who like playing Daenerys and
Kit Harington and they're all in the
younger side I wonder how old they
actually are that's kind of part of the
there's like a feminist storyline going
on there right because Khal Drogo is
gone now and she's like seizing her
power so she I mean there's a there's no
need for gratuitous nudity anymore cuz
Khal Drogo's not around to demand that I
suppose I don't know no but as as we're
seeing her develop her relationship with
like Daario naharis that's true that's
true we're starting to get man of the
names it's very impressed I got a lot of
crap actually oh you people I was like
listen I just don't have an accent I'm
staying at the way I've read it in my
brain in the book I'm saying tell me
there's a wrong way yeah i mean george
RR martin probably good but whatever
said it with an American axe yeah that's
all that's the only difference you guys
I tried my hardest I'm happy to report
that with season five net we've now had
two or two episodes in last night was
the second episode of season five and
for the first time in five years i'm
actually watching it legally i'm pretty
excited you know cuz the head i'm
watching on sling TV actually i added
HBO there and um so i'm actually paying
for my own HBO for the first time as an
adult and it almost feels good I always
watch it on demand whenever I you like
it um and i did not watch sunday it'sa
i'm gonna wash it up to you know buck by
one after the other Oh back to thank you
sorry my Spanish gets in my mind that
totally scares me I have to watch it the
night of because I know everyone's gonna
talk about the next days yeah I get
nervous than I could have to stay away
from Twitter you know so everyone hears
up to date except Tanya and I right okay
not up to date i saw the how do you feel
about minor spoilers oh it's fine i can
handle yeah this episode was much more
engaging than the first one really yeah
the first one you've got a whole load of
information that had to be covered and
we move the plot forward really fast in
one episode but in this episode
would we got more Daenerys more aria is
gonna have yeah yeah the return of
Jacques cigar Oh any better sense of
where sonsa might be headed no ish but
we see a lot of her that's okay I feel
like she's getting more more you know
she's getting she's getting more witty
great heard about it and I think she's
yeah i mean i really think that she's
she am growing up and we've seen a
really good change in her especially has
she's been with Littlefinger oh very
smart and very strategic she's yeah
she's gotten she's learned it took her a
few years but she's learned to think
before she speaks how do they did and i
was surprised that she actually liked
bike that little finger i was let you
know I was like I don't know how this is
gonna go now she's like totally
manipulating him yeah you definitely
you'll enjoy the second episode it has a
really good scene with Santa and little
finger um it's there I don't want to are
there certain characters or storylines
that keep you guys hooked more than
others that keep you coming back or that
you wanted you are more interested in
for me like I love aria is like a
wonderful character and Daenerys like
those are my favorite characters isn't
Denarius kind of everyone's favorite
story when i feel like you know the
whole mother of dragons thing like it is
anyone like not really just I mean you
kind of see it coming her ascension to
the throne and I haven't read the books
but you know that's certainly where I
would like to see it go he's an isn't
everyone rooting for that i'd like to
see Brienne Squire be um take over the
Iron Throne frankly I feel like I love
dinners but i wouldn't mind her having a
little bit of a sense of humor just
cracking a smile or a joke now and then
maybe that's too much to ask for someone
in her position but i think she feels
very thrust into the limelight and
almost like she can't be that person
like she can't be that childish person
because she has to be a queen as she has
to be the
other and she has got a rule and so I
let it let her emotions show it's too
risky yeah it opens her up a lot to her
enemies is what I think she feels but I
think you know the fact that what
happened with the Dragons you know when
she went even backpacking to the cave
and she saw the dragons I think that's
gonna really probably impact her because
I think that now she's like she's losing
you know the dragons that she's a mother
of dragons and then she you know her
decision he pretty much put the dragons
against her yeah cuz they're like mad at
her because she chained them and put
them in a cave like really like who well
I don't understand you don't have like a
dragon trainer that like gives you this
this is you don't know don't do this
with your dragons she shouldn't googled
that I know she told our shooter I'm
sorry I mean um in the premiere episode
uh what's his face told her a dragon
queen no dragon exactly it's not a queen
is not a great you can't you admit
yourself that it's you don't have any so
now she nice dude like start stop losing
her like well like I think she listened
to them yeah I think she's letting her
like hair fear of them because there's
such things I'm late though I don't
blame her you know honestly but it was
interesting to see her fear when she
opened that key question she was risen
back yeah i think it was interesting to
see her fear even though she's like I'm
their mother they would never harm me
they're my children and now she's like
oh god what have I done no I think she
notices the first time when um when they
killed the goat Oh yet the child the
child oats in the traditional yeah
there's a huge turning point in her I
think when you know he like snap at her
like that drogon drogon drug him yeah if
you don't even accent does not my right
I'm sorry well good sorry guys a dry
martes what about you Jeff from the two
minutes you just watched and picking up
bits and pieces off the internet like
what other any characters are parts of
it seemed intriguing
yeah um all rights it's hard to pick
because it just seems like there's just
so much stuff going on and it's it's
like you know what jumping in and like
all my children in the middle of a
season nn so I'm always gonna be going
for Erica Kane but you know there are
all the new characters and stuff like
that so I don't know I just I'm kind of
excited because now I have something new
to obsess about what would you have to
drop in order to take on Game of Thrones
and fit it into your schedule or can you
fit it in with all your other oh no Jeff
has a lot jeff has my second probably
only to me yeah I'm like trying to catch
up to I am all caught up on flash by the
way um um congrats you're the land like
I I would probably have to drop that I
under fortunately it's not so much of a
problem okay there you go as you got to
stay awake i basically i'll be eating it
in my nap time yeah that that's like a
huge cover if I don't get my wife out in
the office Jim your crank even if you
get your nose okay let's be honest okay
Walt yeah I can't really argue that
actually I would have any issues
dropping flash I didn't really hook me
at all I love uh Kevin although well I
love him I've loved him since you what
was that TV show come ahead yeah yeah
yeah so so the key the key question for
Game of Thrones I think before we get
into Star Wars and JJ Abrams is what
does Game of Thrones have to do to wrap
itself up nicely and not kind of become
the next loss sorry JJ that for a lot of
people including me kind of fell apart
at the end I mean yeah how does this
finish strong with break even if it was
just set like here's how many seasons
we're gonna have then they say we're
gonna have yeah I think there's a fixed
in it they were like we're gonna have
seven season yeah yeah yeah so you
better wrap it up yeah deal with that
emotionally as you all want to I think
he's gonna I don't know
really there are so many unanswered
questions yeah so many think is gonna be
a complicated one to wrap especially
they want to keep the high-quality
scripting that they are doing so far and
without haven't seen a special effects i
don't i really i think it's interesting
too because george RR martin came out
and said that in his winds of winter in
the sixth book he's already he's making
some decisions and changes to his
storyline that they've already prevented
themselves from doing in the show so
like certain writing directions they've
taken in the show he's kind of changing
in the books so it'll be interesting to
see how the two separate they said that
we would get more separation this season
and we have we've gotten a lot more like
some characters our way I had where we
would have ever seen them and others are
still in what book three or something so
I think that'll be most interesting for
those of us who follow and continue and
read the books too yeah I don't think
they can depend on old George very much
at all that guy that guy lives in New
Mexico and he's everywhere he opened a
theater down in Santa Fe and he does all
kinds of charity stuff and that that
dude is straight procrastinating ready
though he did say he was like canceling
a lot of appearances and not writing for
the show now and he's gonna actually try
and finish his book George we believe
did he also say was gonna suck the
season or am I did I read a headline
that said he announced was gonna suck or
something or he's apologizing to Game of
Thrones fans am I wrong I don't know I
thought I saw that somewhere I did not
Eric since he live in New Mexico maybe
you should follow him around and do like
a photo a gallery of all the things he's
doing instead of writing yeah there's a
good one well I'm sure he's got plenty
people following him around and an inner
array of costumes yeah those people
around to the bakery counter yeah love
you agree go great I think it's all
relative well I mean I wonder if in
wrapping it up maybe the one mistake
would be to try to actually tie
everything up to neatly it almost seems
like you could get really bogged down
and trying to wrap everything up you
know maybe you just have you know 11
hero ascends to the throne everyone else
dies I don't know and that's actually
another question would you be satisfied
if one of the more evil characters kind
of wound up on top in the end no how
could they not yeah that's what it seems
to be heading that way right I mean how
could they not think about his entire
writing style and how he's like yeah i
mean i could write a book that's perfect
fantasy but that wouldn't be realistic
that's true so if somebody great perfect
lovely ends up on the throne kinda seems
like a cop out at this point we've come
this far skal the way George it would be
interesting to see and has anyone read
all the books yeah you have okay all
right so no spoilers there but i'd be
interested in seeing like Denarius you
know kind of wind up master of the
kingdom but maybe she's grown a little
more evil in the process now could there
be an interesting way to go she's
already growing evil right yeah it is
yeah yeah yeah you can see her you know
her the way that she rules it's very yes
look everybody's gonna die it's like
okay you are embracing your inner queen
really interesting yeah the last I
happens when you don't get naps that's
why napping he's saying important Jeff
Stephen what were you gonna say yeah I
just gonna stay in the last episode she
you know she flex her muscle but she
made a big mistake at the same time so
did she though did she she did did she
pull the whole everyone turned on her in
the last scene that's not because she
made a mistake it's because when you try
and institute blind justice you're gonna
make enemies of course you're gonna eat
finger some people but if she didn't do
what she did she would have angered the
other half of the population and I just
think that on her quest for true justice
it's gonna be really difficult for her
to learn who her true friends are make
sure that she knows what she wants what
she doesn't yet she still you know
taking into account other people's stuff
and other people's opinions and
listening to them and do you think after
you know that what happened do you think
she's gonna try to do that again you
think she'll pull the same
thing she like learned from that
obviously she's what do you go there
trying to stone her to death she's
leaving you know what do you think she
learned from it I think she learned that
she shouldn't publicly execute people
like Denarius is straight-up Abraham
Lincoln man she better watch her back
what no she's Abraham Lincoln um yeah I
honestly as fan favorite as she is and
as great a character is she is I just
don't know if she's going to survive
this eerie yeah neither because that's
that I was a good one straight up
Lincoln get a good especially because of
her own dragon side having her on her
side anymore I mean that's a big thing
okay are they not it's very ambiguous at
this point a bigger question is where is
the other dragon who are Jon Snow's
parents you guys I just I did get to see
a little of Jon Snow's world last a few
weeks ago and i was in iceland we did a
tour of a bunch of the locations they
shot a lot of the the lands beyond the
wall and like the wildlings camp we
wouldn't toward all those they're
actually on crave right now and I gotta
say while i was in iceland it was colder
than what it looks like in the in the
show i actually learned i went to some
of the places where they they film some
of the winter scenes and the people
around there will tell you like when
they film there wasn't actually snow
there so some of the scenes where
they're running through a blizzard
that's steam from one of the hot springs
from some of the geothermal stuff so but
but while i was there there was snow the
winter is so already coming it's so
their winter has arrived yeah winter has
arrived and it stayed this year at
iceland for sure Eric when you're into
those locations were there signs saying
what exactly was filmed there anything
like that no but the not there but you
can find stuff on the web like you know
the Iceland Tourism Board me I some film
board they they'll give you maps of
where everything has been filmed and
there's ton of stuff that's been filmed
there like interstellar and no
and Batman Begins and a whole lot of
stuff you wouldn't expect has been
filmed there so you can kind of go
around and check it out do they have
organized tours of Game of Thrones
locations they do there's the tour
companies have several it was yeah those
were beautiful yeah why do we like the
whole country's beautiful it's all you
got to do is all I do is press a button
but it's it's a beautiful country so
it's it's tough not to get good photos
so any any final thoughts on game of
thrones before we move on to Jeff's home
home field advantage here with the Star
Wars ruler well let's go ahead and do it
you got that the new trailer are you
gonna play it and then run out of the
room spinner I've watched it I've
watched like 10 ok here we go only 10
the plan there goes I remember the tweet
like he was yesterday when my son saw
this he's two years old he went Star
Wars you knew from the font I was so
proud you're doing good Steven how
beautiful
then
crashed oh my
force is strong in my family's
my father has it
I have it
my sister hasn't
you have that power too
you
Chewie we're all
wow what a great moment oh honey it's a
little emotional every time we watch I
do i do with good reason though she
wrote a wonderful piece about that it's
so good it just I don't know I'm just so
happy to see Julian I'm soloing why did
that ending get you so emotional Tonya
the Han Chewie I think I it's like a you
know like I said it on on the piece uh
it's because they kind of like you know
flood me with a bunch of memories of my
childhood you know like um back in
Mexico we didn't really have I don't
remember like having a lot of you know
it was there was no game boys or
Nintendo was not that big yet and we
used to use a lot of our imagination you
know to play and me and my brother
created all these plots you know like we
have this amazing imagination and
creativity and we use our house and we
transform it all the time so like I say
that we use the you know broomsticks to
be by favors and we like Tori got into
it and then I start remembering all the
stories yeah that we created you know he
he and I and we made oh this room is
gonna be the sand color or you know we
were in hot we'd like I don't know you
know like you change it on there's snow
right now so you need to like play it
out hard to walk you know Holly did and
then my dog always got involved the
whole thing yeah he played different
characters may be the ones that he
played the most was on r2d2 Arthur teeth
on Mexican is so I think um the whole
mom flashback you know to this things
that you forget it because the time goes
by and you know you don't really think
about how did you know Hansel is gonna
look right today yeah you don't really
think about it because you know the
movies over they've brought you back to
when you were first the Star Wars yes
it's brought me back to being like a
little child the first time I saw it and
I totally believed it I totally I did
there was no knowledge of that was
impossible or special effects makeup
I was like oh my god this is happening
in a you know yeah see far far away and
Tanya did you did you miss the like the
episode 133 the ones that came out in
the late 90s we like in school did you
catch those when I came out I totally
did I told me I was obviously I've you
know may lines to buy you know tickets
for the Premier's I was it was very god
I remember lining up for those movies oh
my god it was so excited like you don't
you get older a staff to go with your
friends you know to know to do it I
totally did I yeah I totally went crazy
on it uh and you know I think at the
time i was so hyped I didn't really i
don't know i did miss a lot of the main
characters there was something that was
it didn't connect like Star Wars yeah
but the first one wasn't that bad for me
the first one except for I'm not a huge
fan of junior beings and i rewatch it is
anyone there's people that me like a
little but I just think I you know re
watching it it's like oh my god so on
he's so annoying like personally i
really don't i didn't really didn't like
it but it has you know good things that
I I enjoyed I like okay I love the pod
racer with podracer seems like I really
like the cold seeing you know embracing
and obviously you know Darth Maul
fighting at the end with with obi-wan
it's ridiculously amazing that you know
lights I regime with the fight it's one
of my favorites but then we get to the
second one and oh my goodness how dis
naked that was like please why do they
do the romantic story that was really
hard to watch for me I like I honestly
just like stood up and left because I
was like this is not this is not what
star was once you know like especially
when you remember han Solo and Leia be
no you know like that annoying a guy
that likes you when you're in high
school ID bothers you
wasn't that like totally like Hansel and
Leigh is like you I love you I know like
you know you like constantly but her
it's a classic line obviously so I I did
think that they went very very Disney on
the second trilogy I really didn't you
know you watch it and you kind of like
okay you know it's cool it's part of it
mm-hmm but not being like the first not
beloved but no no no like the first
especially I even you know this weekend
obviously I got old enough static and I
went back and I saw them the first
trilogy with without you know the HD
part that is not the new version that
church look at it it's like the original
you know it still has parts that look
like even as he but it's still it's
that's how I remembered it I didn't
remember all these new characters that
they added in the new remastered um
movies that they want so like you know I
i watch it like I watch it when i was 18
years yeah and he was so cool and i am
like oh my god i love our to like that's
my favorite character like he's my
favorite I really think it's amazing the
way that they made him speak so loud you
know without speaking with a little
noises and I don't know he's such an
important he's a good communicator he is
it yeah and safe to run for office I
will totally vote for art thank you Jeff
what do you think oh we're sure oh I was
just like when when we were watching it
when it when it first debuted I was just
like because I didn't want to get sucked
in again cuz you know like what the last
trilogy you know episode one looked
exciting when you saw the trailer and
then you know the movie stars and it's
talking about talking about like you
know taxes and gratefully chen's and I'm
like do I have to fill out a 1040 I mean
so then it's all I just you know I was
very guarded but by the time Han and
Chewie showed up I like you can even ask
Caitlin I was pretty much bouncing in my
chair can confirm yeah yeah I think with
I mean with the return of
on and chewy and the new droids and
stuff they're gonna have to try pretty
hard to screw it up but it looks good
i'm excited i'm not asking them to try
hard to screw it up either I would be
happy if they didn't screw it up yeah
please don't don't try just on my
account yeah sorry everybody's it's huge
fan oh ok I do have one question and
some of you might laugh at me and you
might think it's ridiculous go for it
but could Darth Vader be alive well
that's a tough one cuz he was in Ghost
form at the end or one of the movies too
right ok along with Yoda so possibly not
yeah he says has in the voice-over
hahaha see his mangled helmet I
understand Jeff was like yeah but like
in the force you don't die like your
spirit lives on it'll be a glowing
character possible I was like what again
this is JJ Abrams so here thank you it
could just be in purgatory they did
reverse rock and Star Trek's all right
ah they pretend we're back in time or JJ
loves time travel yes that's true that's
early it can't happen what I think that
we know where was I don't remember when
I was reading that they think that it's
probably one of the kids you know the
grandkids that's gonna turn dark that's
you know that's one of the stuff that i
was reading you know right of the way to
the web ok so i don't understand staying
away from trailers and I understand how
people just like want to tune everything
out but I won't read speculation about
them bagley so like I'll watch the
trailer and I want to know who the
characters are Stephen I saw one another
however I won't read when they're like
here's what's going to happen or here's
what I think will happen in the new Star
Wars and I'm like no no no no no nothing
you could say could come close to this
movie I just think it's you know it's
the normal hype you know you're gonna
start you know you're gonna see the
images and you're gonna create your own
you know kind of like a way to peace
your anxiety to why I just wonder to how
mad some of the people are gonna be
after it comes out oh I know oh yeah
there's gonna be there's always haters
Stephen have you seen the trailer oh you
know I watching the chimes I'm not
avoiding the trailers it's just he
doesn't want to know the extraneous and
our Wars Celebration the other day this
dress yeah they were they had all the
characters and three they had three
character Steven it was only three they
were talking about what their part in
the movie was I was like I don't want to
hear it like name of their territories
that's it they named that over there no
no three just three it was creepy Oh
even get full meals not the old i'm not
talking about original case thank you
I'm just talking about like three of the
new yeah and they were talking about
yeah those other part in them film like
this is what I do in the film oh I'm
like I don't that's all I already don't
say this is what I do or where I go one
of the guys was talking about it it made
me I think Daisy realize I was not
talking about where he goes Daisy Ridley
was like hey I'm this character and
here's what she is like and they're like
okay but and she's like that's all you
know like when they reboot like a
superhero film sometimes to use an
unknown actor that no one knows you know
so he kind of they give some more
believability to you know what I mean
and then if you have all these actors
that you're I've already seen them on TV
a hundred times like it's just not gonna
I don't know I I know them as an actor
not as a Star Wars character you know I
mean speaking of so they're good actors
and you're blaming them dare you get
work started one movie we saw over town
hayden christensen hint not well yeah
what about Ben Affleck yeah what about
Ben Affleck I was just gonna excited I
don't know a good is so beefy yeah Tori
huge for that oh my goodness it's crazy
Oh where's your water JJ why did I know
cool down I'm just thinking about that
like and then Henry give me on my
mission please oh I don't even know how
I underserved by that movie she can't
Jeremy Irons could just talk over them
like staring at each other and that
would probably be enough love his voice
yes right oh that was the best part of
the trailer yeah everybody was amiss
Alfred
odd what why don't we wrap things up at
the trailer Stephen yeah how would he
would see not okay the person I'm gonna
see this it I mean here we go I hope
this is the right one I'll tell you yeah
is it really surprising that the most
powerful man in the world should be a
figure of controversy we as a population
on this planet have been looking for a
savior we're talking about a Balian
whose very existence challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe human
beings have a horrible track record of
France following people with great power
an absolute power corrupts absolutely
chaos maybe he's just a guy trying to do
the right thing better now don't you got
it
they brought their warrior they'd come
from the sky the world has been so
caught up with what he can do that no
one has asked what he should
that's how it starts the fever the rage
the feeling of powerlessness that turns
good men
cruel
tell me do you plead
sure will there's the most ridiculous
line we remember yeah
the number of jokes that will be made
about that line infinite infinite you I
wonder if there's me Oh must be already
I just I like the voiceovers and the
glimpses of characters as we hear
everyone talking ah there I heard neil
degrasse tyson charlie rose and a few
other people are recognized in there oh
that's cool I didn't really yeah I was
like I didn't know I was a listen
specifically for like characters who
were in it so you can clearly hear Holly
Hunter yeah I love Holly Hunter voice oh
no it's just so fantastic I want to see
it just to hear her speak and we still
don't know who she plays in the movie
for sure so we interesting and then um
you can hear jesse eisenberg too oh yeah
I think I don't recognize his voice
because I spent a lot of time watching
now you see me recently I was like wait
mmm I'm totally in they seem to be
pulling out all the the production stops
if nothing else I'm not even a big comic
book guy but uh I'm all in what do you
think Jeff I'm slightly jet off looks a
little bored no I i was looking
something up um I don't know like was
like when I saw when I saw a man of
steel I did not leave the theater happy
um yeah I don't love Zack Snyder I don't
I'll just like you can recover I'm sorry

style I don't love how is cinematography
I just don't love his work you'll see it
you'll see it right I'll go see it yeah
oh yeah I'm so much please go see the
movie if only because I know everyone
will be talking about it yeah I feel
like I can't really you know piss and
moan about it if I don't go see exactly
exactly you gotta know what you're
complaining about yeah exactly it's like
Twilight you're gonna be a good I
finally read or tried to read the book

reason and it was like oh i watch the
movie it's exactly the same oh yeah oh

informed complainer yeah you know why
