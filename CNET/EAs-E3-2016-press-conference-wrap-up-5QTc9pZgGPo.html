e3 2016 they don't have a booth or
anything like that they held their own
event and here's everything you need to
know titanfall 2 it's coming real soon
inside October 28th it hits ps4 xbox one
and pc it's more of the mech battling
that made the first game great this time
around there's an offline single-player
campaign in addition to the game's
robust multiplayer modes EA announced EA
originals which sounds like a program to
encourage and nurture indie titles that
effort is being led by a game called
feet a game they teased as a personal
narrative about our relationship with
nature so what about FIFA 17 OEA says a
lot of that game has been rebuilt from
the ground up there's tons of tweaks to
the gameplay and a new story mode that
follows a player called alex hunter
you'll play as the soccer newcomer as he
makes his way from amateur to pro beef
of 17 hits September 27
Mass Effect Andromeda is starting to
take shape the focus on this game is the
freedom the player has promising more of
it compared to previous games in the
series the game's trailer featured a
female protagonist though like the
previous games you can choose your
gender at the start ea briefly spoke of
what's the common there Star Wars
collection of games including teasing
new titles from the visceral team that's
due out in 2018 of BR Star Wars mission
for battlefront and an undated action
adventure title from respawn the same
team that makes titanfall finally
battlefront 2 is set for release in 2017
and then there's battlefield 1 which
made quite splash at the press
conference
as usual EA is really trying to drive
home the notion of bigger more
unpredictable online battles than ever
before giving players control of the
hemant's which promised to be the most
massive vehicles ever playable in a
battlefield game keep it here in
