Google issues for everything inside the
world of Google lots of little nuggets
for Google News but we always have to
start with the heavy hitters and right
now you know what it's all about the LGV
30 now we saw the leaks from last week
and even LG themselves push out the news
on their Korean site that the V 30
camera will have an F 1.6 aperture the
largest we've ever seen in a smartphone
to date in a recent press release LG
also teased out its floating action bar
for the V 30 which will basically
replace the secondary display
functionality that the 10 and 20 had and
recently the company Immersion announced
its partnering with LG to bring its HD
touch sense technology to the V 30 as
well think of it as their vibration
motor technology similar to Apple's
iPhone tactic engine that can vary how
it feels with fine control during
different use cases on the phone now the
V 30 is expected to be officially
unveiled on August the 30th and go on
sale later in September but come on it's
arguably one of the most intriguing
Android phones coming out this year okay
we know the note 8 announcement is just
about a week away but that won't be the
only thing we see at the unpacked event
venture beats Evan blast revealed
details and images for the new Samsung
gear fit 2 pro running Tizen the band
can be fully submerged in water to track
swimming workout 2 as well and will sync
up with the speedo on app I'm just glad
speedo didn't make the speedo offer now
the fit 2 pro will also have GPS and
support offline play with Spotify and
has a new class that will be more
reliable compared to the fit to pricing
and details were not mentioned but we're
also expecting to see a new gear VR
headset that will be backwards
compatible at the August 23rd impact
event and you know what maybe even more
ok let's get to the Google News Google
is working on a new floating bubble
during calls for the phone app check
this out 9 to 5 Google has been able to
enable it and once you make a call
pressing the home button will reveal a
circular phone icon that you can move
around and if you tap on it you can
either end the call mute your mic or use
your loudspeaker no word when this might
officially roll out but we could see it
with the new pixel 2 in October and if
you're tired of the desktop version of
Google Calendar with a design from the
year 2000
material design update looks like it's
coming after a redditor took screenshots
of it that looks so much better and
actually feels like you're using a
product from 2017 the new Google
Calendar is being tested with a limited
amount of users with no official release
date as well but both of those things
look really good but then the goog has
been dropping the ball when it comes to
Android wear and the latest frustration
comes after a recent google app update
that has now stopped the Google
assistant from working properly you know
the main thing that you use to interface
with Android wear it currently can't
really do anything other than simple
Google searches right now because of the
update previous issues with recurring
reminders and Google Account copying has
still yet to be fixed and no one can be
happy about the feeling that Android
wear is being treated like a beta
testing ground right now you know what
that's how Google bad Google ok the
Google app and G board can now
understand 30 more languages including
two of Africa's most spoken languages
and a number of Indian language variants
and more the list is all here because I
don't want to potentially butcher
pronouncing any of them other Google
products will also be able to add these
new additions in the near future and
Google contacts is now available on all
devices running Android 5.0 lollipop or
later it's the app for managing your
contacts in case the name wasn't obvious
enough it had previously been limited to
the pixel Nexus Android 1 and Google
Play edition phones running lollipop or
higher and finally YouTube is testing
live video watch counts with some users
that will let you see how many people
are watching a specific video at the
same time you are no word if this could
be then moved to live chatting about the
video we've seen them incorporate that
with sharing YouTube videos with your
friends from last week's story but it's
also a cool addition to the youtubes
alright that's it for this week you can
email me at Google issues at CENTCOM or
tweet me at Brian Tong thanks so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for some more of that Google issues
