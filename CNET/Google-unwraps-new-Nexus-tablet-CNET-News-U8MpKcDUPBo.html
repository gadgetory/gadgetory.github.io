beautiful 7-inch tablet it's built thank
you it's built for Google Play it's
running Android 4.1 jelly bean and here
it is so let me tell you a bit about
nexus 7 it's super thin light and
portable and yet we've managed to pack a
lot into this device first of all the
display 1280 by 800 HD display which is
perfect for reading and watching videos
in stunning clarity performance Tegra 3
chipset with a quad-core cpu and wait
there's more so Tegra 3 chipset with a
quad-core cpu and 12 core GPU that's
basically 16 cores which makes which
makes everything including games
extremely fast and smooth front facing
camera perfect for Google+ Hangouts and
video chatting all the connectivity
options you'd expect Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
NFC gyroscope and accelerometer
essential for high performance gaming
and battery up to 9 hours of video
playback and up to 300 hours standby
time
and best of all it's only 340 grams just
about the weight of an average paper
book it fits perfectly in one hand you
can put it in the purse or bag it
doesn't tip over when you're reading or
watching and moving in bed it just feels
right that's Nexus 7 Nexus 7 is made for
google play when you power it on your
content is front and center right here
on the home screen is my library
containing the content I've recently
been reading listening to or watching on
any of my devices so earlier I was
reading The Bourne Dominion on my phone
so we can tap on the cover there and
pick up exactly where I left off on that
other device now I'd like to show you
the magazine experience on Nexus 7
here's the new Google Play magazines app
and just like your coffee table the
newest stuff is on top you can swipe
through and find something that's
interesting to read why don't we go
ahead and esquire and if I once I bring
it up I can tap on it and bring up a
list of page thumbnails on the bottom to
kind of quickly swipe through find an
article that I'm interested in reading
so yeah that one looks good and once we
open it up you look that the content
just looks beautiful on Nexus 7 but if I
want to focus maybe on something that's
a little bit more of a pure reading
experience I could tap on the the view
text link and get the contents of the
article in a form that's optimized for
that still looks beautiful on Google
Nexus 7 is also ideal for watching
movies and TV wherever you are long
plane rides road trips with the family
or just sitting at home watching on the
sofa so let's open the google play
movies and TV app and here you see all
of your movies we can swipe over to see
TV shows and you can get your personal
videos as well you can of course also
download your shows for offline use if
you're going to be somewhere without
Wi-Fi like on a plane so that's finding
content I already have what about
discovering new content with Nexus 7
we're introducing a powerful new
recommendations engine for discovering
content that's relevant to you we
present this information on beautiful
and dynamic widgets on your home screen
here you can see that we've set ours up
for recommendations for apps books and
movies but you can customize it to show
the content you're most interested in
and if you don't like a particular
recommendation just dismiss it you'll
get another these widgets are
intelligent and they'll get smarter and
more accurate the more you use them
Nexus 7 is the perfect device to use all
the Google applications you already know
and love gmail a nexus 7 it's a perfect
size to read and respond to your emails
chrome your favorite websites look
beautiful on the HD display and this is
the first device that ships with chrome
as the standard browser
so the new youtube app has a great
tablet optimized design you got your
channel feed here on the left and you
can just swipe over why don't we pick
something here to watch and gets a video
gun you've got high-def youtube right in
the palm of your hand it's the YouTube
that you already know and love but
optimized for nexus 7 now in addition to
exploring a huge amount of videos online
you can also explore the world around
you so let's take a look at google maps
now in google maps you can find your way
around with the features you are already
familiar with like turn-by-turn
navigation public transit live traffic
and street view but what about getting
to know a place before you get there i
heard about a local bar called district
so let's go check it out we can tap here
and get all this great information about
the restaurant including Zagat reviews
from Google Plus local and I can also
scroll down and tap on see inside once I
do I'm inside the bar I've got this nice
view and for an even better experience I
can turn on compass mode so once you go
ahead and do that Randall
now we've had this feature for a little
while but what we've done in the latest
version is hook it up to the gyroscope
which makes it incredibly smooth and
fast and very responsive it's just like
being there now as we announced we're
also adding support for offline maps so
you can save the data for an entire city
locally on the device as easy as
bringing up the menu and tapping make
available offline and you're good to go
so those features are all in the latest
version of Google Maps shipping with
Nexus 7 with its quad-core CPU gyroscope
and accelerometer Nexus 7 is a serious
gaming device will start with the game
horn from phosphorus phosphorus in
Chicago
horn is an epic adventure set in a
richly detailed world with the kind of
environment never before seen on a
mobile device we've got lens flares
environmental effects and even
individually rendered leaves on the
trees so as a Randall takes the express
elevator down here we can see that in
addition to the the graphics looking
beautiful the animation is very fluid
and it just controls beautifully this is
the kind of experience that until
recently you would have not have been
able to see anywhere out of a dedicated
gaming console so now that you've seen
everything nexus 7 can do Hugo I think
we all have one remaining question which
is how can I get one it's a fantastic
device that we want to get into the
hands of as many people as we can that's
