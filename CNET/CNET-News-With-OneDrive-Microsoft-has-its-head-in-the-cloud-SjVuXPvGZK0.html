service which is one place for you to
store all your documents and photos and
the files you care about the memories
you keep track of every day okay all
ready one two three two-thirds of people
who have a mobile phone
all their photos just stay on their
phone and they never go anywhere really
I mean they text them to people but
they're not backed up and if they lose
their phone their photos are gone so I
got onedrive on my iPad here and you can
see there's the same camera roll showing
up and then we'll go and grab all those
photos and they were those photos that I
took right there
iCloud doesn't work on your Android
phones if you have that and it doesn't
go back to your Windows PC and put all
your photos there but one drives really
designed for all your devices so if you
have an iPhone you take those pictures
you can put them into onedrive and then
there on your Mac with onedrive for Mac
if you switch to an Android phone those
photos stay with you you switch to a
Windows PC or Windows Phone so they
follow you for your life in the area of
documents it's our connection with
Microsoft Office which people use so
right in office you save right to
onedrive you can open from onedrive you
can use office on your phone and get to
your onedrive all my documents are up
there these are my personal documents
and then I have a nice folder for my
work documents so really it's that
connection that makes the big difference
for our service relative to other
offerings like Google Drive or Dropbox
or box the Xbox scenario is super cool
it's the you know if you're playing a
game and you end up being a
great in the game like you've killed
your big enemy you can actually take the
last 30 seconds of that and upload it to
onedrive and then share with your
friends so they can participate in that
moment five or ten years from now if you
say I lost a file people your kids are
gonna look at you like you're funny
because why would you ever have a world
where you lost anything when you lost a
device it's all in the cloud the
onedrive service comes with seven
gigabytes for free we're announcing a
couple things as part of this release
one if you hook up your camera roll on
your phone you're getting another three
gigabytes we know how big those phone
photos are in the end our job is to
build tools that put the customer and
control their data not us we're
providing a service that helps the
customer be in control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
