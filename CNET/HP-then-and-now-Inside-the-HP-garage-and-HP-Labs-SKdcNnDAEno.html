well this is where bill Hewlett lived so
when bill and Dave moved here in the
fall of 1938 as renters to try to start
the company together and they rented
this particular property because the
landlady told them that they could use
the garage as a workshop they paid an
extra $12 a month for rent so that's why
the stuff in here is not original I mean
it was their manufacturing plants so
they took it all with them we have
pictures of some of the things that are
in here
like the drill press you know that went
with them and they used it for 20 years
our first product was an audio
oscillator and they made about 220 in
that 18 months and you can see it's
really small so they were probably
tripping over each other they made them
themselves because no they were so small
no one would take on the work they would
paint the panels and then they bake them
in the kitchen oven and they moved here
in the fall of 1938 and they left in the
spring of 1940 and they were outgrowing
the space so they moved to some other
rental property closer to where
headquarters is now
HP Laboratories mission is to create
novel technologies and experiences that
define the future of HP ink is everyday
we're trying to create something that
hasn't actually existed before and then
apply it fundamentals of material
science with chemistry biology physics
charge manipulation and so that same
technology that basically causes us to
get a little bubble and cause fluid to
spit out in the form of an ink can also
pump other things bioprinter where we
can instead of pipetting down material
that's jetting out small amounts of
fluid and very precise amounts
clothes small little nano fingers around
molecules as to come in the fluid they
wick together we're able to then hit
that with a laser and from that detect
mostly what you're looking at doing this
in combination with the Food and Drug
Administration carries long heritage
from 1939 till now but again a rich
history built in the fundamentals of
engineering and built in the
fundamentals of physics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
