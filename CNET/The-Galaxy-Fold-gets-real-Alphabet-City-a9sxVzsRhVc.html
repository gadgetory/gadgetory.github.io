show that covers everything to do with
alphabet alphabet happens to own lots of
companies like loon X way Moe and Google
I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar and you are
the incredible audience today we're
talking about self-driving cars the
pixel light your comments and more but
first up let's talk about what Samsung
did onto galaxy gateway Samsung
introduced the Galaxy S ten all the
leaks and all the rumors were true
next up up town updates alright let's
talk a little bit about the 5g model
since we didn't know a lot about it the
s10 5g has a massive six point seven
inch screen with a fourth camera on the
back inside is a 4500 milliamp hour
battery oddly you cannot expand the
storage on the 5g version its first
landing at Verizon in the second quarter
then it'll make its way to the other
carriers the rest of the lineup is what
we've seen leaked there's the S 10 e the
S 10 and the S 10 plus IR scanning is
gone you'll have to rely on the
fingerprint sensor for biometrics as for
everything else
let's just put up the spec sheet pause
this part if you want to read all of the
things you know it was amazing
Samsung showed off the Galaxy fold first
thing it looked really slick in tablet
mode when open you get a 7.3 inch screen
and a four point two by three aspect
ratio so it's kind of on the square side
there's a big cutout for its two front
facing cameras on the right when it's
closed the fold has a four point six
inch display with one camera on the
front on the back are the three rear
cameras inside you'll find 12 gigabytes
of RAM and 512 gigs of space the
craziest thing of all is that Samsung
actually announced a date when you can
buy this April 26th and it will cost
just one thousand nine hundred and
eighty dollars the rest of Samsung's
announcements didn't really have much to
do with Android
so check out CNET if you're interested
on two uptown updates
here's something we haven't talked about
on this show the pixel light a report
from Nikkei says Google will introduce a
lower price phone this year as for that
price the report says it should be
cheaper than the seven hundred and fifty
dollar iPhone ten are other rumors say
the pixel light could cost somewhere
between four and five hundred dollars
there have been images floating around
for several months of a plastic looking
pixel which could be this lower price
phone it carries the codename sargo now
recently sargo popped up on Geekbench it
apparently has two gigs of RAM and an
eight core Qualcomm processor the Nikkei
report also says Google will introduce a
new version of Google home a new
security camera and a SmartWatch this
year there's a new California DMV report
about self-driving cars it turns out
that way more vehicles go for around
eleven thousand miles before a human
driver would take over driving duties
General Motors cruise vehicles went
around 5,000 miles then there's Apple
it's human drivers intervened once every
one point one miles
yikes Evan Blass has shared images of
the LGG eight thank you
yep it's a thrilling phone design
through and through to rank it in man
let's talk about a new Android tablet
from Samsung it's called the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s5e we're looking at a pretty
slick design with thin bezels all the
way around it comes in three colors
black silver and gold the Tab s5e ships
with Samsung's new one UI on top of
Android Pi if you've got a galaxy phone
you'll be able to receive calls and
texts from the tab this tablet starts at
399 and will be available in the second
quarter of this year on to comment go
this is the part of the show where we
shine a spotlight at the most amazing
audience in the world that would be you
guys Rudy says just an idea but don't
you think Samsung is allowing all these
leaks out on purpose maybe to keep the
focus off something more innovating well
it's working
super user thinks Samsung is leaking
this stuff to generate hype blazing jaws
says Samsung needs a diaper folks I
think they're all correct sometimes I
think these leaks are to manage
expectations Thanks to everyone for
