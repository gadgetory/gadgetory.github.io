how to contributor today I'm going to
show you how to enable group messaging
on your iPhone it's a feature that not
many people know about but one that can
come in very handy when you need to
discuss something with multiple people
at the same time alright so the first
thing we'll need to do is we'll need to
go into our settings scroll down to
messages then we'll scroll down to group
messaging all you do is flip that switch
on so now when you go into your messages
app you're going to be able to send a
group MMS which everything you send will
go to both of your recipients how many
of you have and then as well as it'll
show you who the last message was from
they'll have their name right above the
bubble this comes in really handy for
talking to friends and family or even
schoolwork as this person here had
mentioned so now that we know how to
enable group text messaging on the
iPhone you need to make sure your
friends and family members or whoever
else you're going to be using the
service with has it enabled too if they
don't and they reply to your message it
will show up just as a regular
conversation between the two of you if
they do they'll be able to see all the
recipients as well as take part in the
conversation within the group I've had
some mixed results when using this
across platform with Android or
Blackberry your results may vary for
more fun tech tips make sure to visit
