spectrum we would have excellent night
vision fortunately we have technology to
solve this problem for tonight's example
I have the floor Pathfinder - an
aftermarket night vision kit for cards
installed in our scene at Chevy Aveo
here I have the thermal camera part of
the Pathfinder system this is mounted in
front of the grill about two feet off
the ground where they recommend it this
is a little bit of a rough install guys
I've just done a temporary thing here
and there's another very important part
of this system it's in the car let's
take a look I've run the video cable
from the camera to the CPU unit this is
an important part of the Pathfinder -
they say mounted inside the cabin to
keep it out of the weather it's nice and
flat so you can mount it up under the
dashboard what this part of the system
does is it takes the imagery from the
camera and looks for pedestrians or
large animals which it can identify on
the monitor
the imagery is in black and white but
it's also fairly distinct and it shows
you a lot of stuff you can't see with
your naked eye through the windshield it
also draws these yellow boxes around me
and any other pedestrians that show up
and it's supposed to also put boxes
around bicyclists but I haven't seen it
very effective with bicyclists it really
doesn't seem to pick them out as well as
it does pedestrians now obviously you're
not gonna want to look down at this
monitor all the time while you're
driving but just in a momentary glance
down can be very helpful as we've seen
the imagery from the Pathfinder - is
very cool and it can also save your life
on the life of somebody else out there
but there are a couple of problems with
this system one is the cost $2,500 a
very expensive addition to any car - is
the installation it doesn't really fit
very well in small cars with that camera
mount in the front this is really better
for a truck or large sedan where this is
really gonna pay off is in a rural area
where you have large beasts wandering
the streets and you definitely want to
avoid hitting those men it could save
your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
