is the time machine from three squares
this isn't gonna send you back to the
future but it is gonna cook things and
see if you time in the kitchen or at
least so it claims this is a rice maker
that also has functions for quinoa and
yogurt white and brown rice you can do a
quick rice cook that'll save you several
minutes
it also has slow cooker functionality so
you can slow cook on low medium or high
with this thing now if I open the time
machine up and pull the pan out you can
look inside and see the 900 watt heating
element there in the middle and in the
very center you see that little round
sensor that strings up and down
that coupled with those ingredients
Pacific presets or how the time machine
knows how to cook things so accurately
and so automatically when I say
automatically that's exactly what I mean
the time machine will cook all on its
own you just put ingredients in you say
you're cooking rice hits start and the
wheels will start turning it'll cook and
then beep what it's done it uses that
fuzzy logic sensor to tell how long it
takes so you can really just set it and
forget it that's a nice feature that
fuzzy logic sensor is also used in
really high-end rice makers that cost
well over a hundred dollars and at
seventy dollars The Time Machine is a
lot less expensive than those but there
are other rights makers that cost a lot
less basic models it sell for anywhere
from twenty to thirty to forty dollars
some of those includes slow cook
functionalities some of those have
sensors of their own not quite as good
as the fuzzy logic sensor but still good
enough for a basic batch of rice what
that means is if you're gonna use this
rice cooker quite a bit and take
advantage of those dedicated quinoa and
yogurt and oatmeal presets things that
you don't find in a lot of other rice
cookers then it might be worth the $70
but if you're just looking for a pretty
basic rice cooker to make you a batch of
rice with your dinner it's probably more
than you need thanks for watching check
out my small appliance reviews at
cnn.com for CNET appliances I'm right
now
