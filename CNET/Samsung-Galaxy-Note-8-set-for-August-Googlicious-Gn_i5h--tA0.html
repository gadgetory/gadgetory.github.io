Google issues for all the Google you can
think of the big drop this week is the
official announcement of the 1+5 phone
now loaded with a snapdragon 835 8 gigs
of ram and a 16 megapixel dual camera
this is going to get you the best bang
for your buck on the market for a 480 to
$540 smartphone now it's evolved to a
phone that looks ridiculously similar to
the iPhone from its curved edges its
antenna lines and even a dual lens
camera mic and flash that are in the
same position that is just more than a
borrowing now there's no SD card slot
it's not waterproof but its specs and
speed are top of the line but you know
what it just feels like a tweener phone
with some high-end specs but the lack of
other features and an unoriginal design
but at that price you know what you
might not care they offered a code to
get the oneplus five right now in their
livestream announcement so if you want
early access use the code clearer photos
on their website okay Samsung is ramping
up for another phone announcement of
their own looking to wipe away last
year's note 7 Reuters reports the new
Note 8 will be launched in New York City
during the second half of August and
that lines up with Galaxy Note
announcements from the past their source
reports the note 8 screen will be
marginally larger compared to the 6.2
inch display on the note 7 and there
will be dual rear facing cameras as well
to bring a 3x optical zoom with optical
image stabilization and a 12 megapixel
wide-angle lens
alongside a 13 megapixel telephoto lens
other rumours include a top-of-the-line
Snapdragon 835 or Exynos 88-90 5
depending on market but will wait until
late August for the official details
remember that samsung voice assistant
bixby you know the one that received a
dedicated physical button for it on the
galaxy s 8 it's still not here in the US
months after the phone's release but
Samsung has open up registration for us
owners of the s8 and s8 plus to receive
early access to preview builds of the
Bixby voice command interface you'll
just need your email link to your
Samsung Account to sign up and you can
do that right now
and as virtual reality continues to grow
and content providers are really still
figuring out the best way to utilize it
the latest update for VR creators on
YouTube will now incorporate heat maps
for 360-degree and VR videos now videos
with over 1000 views will allow creators
to see exactly what parts of the video
are catching the viewers attention and
how long they're looking at a specific
part of the video let me guess it might
be where the most action is happening
but there's still other insights to pull
from this info now they're also
launching their first ever VR intensive
program at YouTube space la called the
VR trader lab with applications open
right now and Google announced their job
hunting search tool at Google i/o
earlier this year but now Google for
jobs is live the feature is directly
integrated into its search so you could
type something in like jobs near me or
something like writing jobs you can
refine it down to full-time jobs and
search by industry but once you've found
the job posting you're looking for it
will direct you to the site to start
that application process and you know
what that's a good goal ok you know what
we like to end things on a high note are
you on this visit spinner craze like I'm
not but you know what it doesn't mean I
can't start thanks to the mind hive of
Reddit users have discovered Google
search has a hidden virtual fidgets
spinner just search for spinner and
voila look hold down your mouse and pull
down for a fast spin or take it nice and
slow you can even change it to a number
wheel if you like and change the wheel
number size up to 20 and what's the
point of this who cares but I know at
least half of you already want to check
this out at home and yes you're welcome
alright that's going to do it for this
week you get an email me at Google
issues at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian
Tong thanks much for watching and we'll
catch you next time for some more of
that Google ishes
