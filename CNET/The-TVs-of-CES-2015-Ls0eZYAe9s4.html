sort of digest and really comprehension
segments of CES 2015 as we are at this
closing part of the show we are starting
to put it in perspective and today right
now it's TV's so our TV showing my
favorite parts of the show every year I
get to sit down with cats
David cats Meyer who is the big brain
behind TVs in our New York labs fits in
there it's a 4k brain you know it's the
size the regular brain but twice to
either pitch yeah that's it okay so
we're gonna round up what's going on in
TV and of course TV needs no
introduction here at this show this is
it has always been a TV show first and
foremost this is kind of your house yeah
the TV's made great demos on the show
floor they're big they're bright you can
pack the booth with them you can show
whatever you want on them using to
demonstrate the TVs themselves or the
technology you know in the TVs so yeah
this has always been about the big TVs
105 inches you know we always have those
let's get on to some of the specifics
now 4k TVs are not new here but they
seem to have flooded the floor with a
sense of reality this year where are we
going on 4k adoption in the year ahead
well CES you're not gonna see anything
but 4k TVs in the boos there's very few
1080p TVs you look around manufacturers
have only announced 4k TVs they'll talk
about there at 1080p DS a little bit but
really they want even focus on 4k that's
where the profit is that's the new
technology is so you know 4k is pricing
is gonna fall a lot we saw the Vizio P
series announced last year yeah 50
inches $9.99 that's still a pretty good
baseline price that Vizio P is kind of
the go-to inexpensive 4k right now is
that right yeah we're looking at some of
these right here Vizio of course has
always been a great well performing but
value brand absolutely yeah okay and so
if we're talking about a set that's a
thousand bucks for it's not like any
premium at all no it's it's like well
you can get a $6.99 50-inch 1080p TV
from Vizio that performs pretty good oh
absolutely so you know the TV prices are
at that point where guys are not eating
that much profit especially from the
1080p s yeah so they'd have to get the
4k they have to get the prices up and
interesting ly with that price erosion
of 4k you see guys like Samsung and LG
the leaders in TV introducing newer
technologies that are even bigger and
better than for Casey had curved
you have su HD which is Samsung's new
term for their you know better 4k TVs
yeah and LG with this OLED says as we
take a look at what's going on with
these screens the resolution of 4k is
better the amounts of color it can show
are theoretically better and HDR we know
that from still cameras yes what does
HDR mean in a television because I
didn't hear that at 4k around 4k last
year yeah HDR something new this year
they're pushing it was a Dolby vision
sort of showed some demos last year but
this year they're they're telling about
a lot more HDR stands for high dynamic
range the idea is that you can have a
really dark black which you can get with
the better TV technologies today and
also a brighter white so picture like a
glint of sunlight officer armor or a
lightning or so the fireworks going off
normally the bright parts blown out
right yeah this is really bright
specular highlights they're called and
at the end of the day you see a really
realistic picture the problem is that
the displays of yesteryear cannot get
that bright they can't produce you know
our beloved plasma couldn't really get
that bright yeah and OLED can get that
dark and get that bright and Samsung
says it's s UHD TVs Sudz if you will are
able to get right who knows HUD's we
don't really know yet they haven't told
us how to pronounce it but those sets
also get extremely bright up to up to a
thousand nits so at the end of the day
that's where they're going is to make
this contrast which is a lot more
visible by the way than 4k resolution
yeah make that show up on the screen and
give a lot of pop and yet it's a lot
harder to sell contrast consumers have
always seen these amazing pumped-up
numbers I mean they'll put any number on
a TV right and 4k they kind of get it's
like okay it's a number it's a grid of
pixels sounds better contrast is a
harder sell color space is a harder sell
but it's more important well it's true
and those are a lot more difficult to
manufacture it's a lot it's really easy
to throw a whole bunch of pixels on an
LCD TV LCD technology look at phones
they have you know 4k resolution phones
now they're tiny yeah so it's really
easy to get you know a lot of pixels on
the screen to get the the HDR stuff to
get the high dynamic range to get the
color space it requires you know better
TVs and a lot better manufacturing more
expensive TVs more LEDs and in the case
of LG's OLED entirely new TV technology
now I want to get to content around this
because that's really the big issue the
last thing I want to ask you while we're
on the heart
though is you and Ty and our TV lab oven
very skeptical of curved TVs since the
big splash a year ago yeah he's still
there
yeah I mean the curve didn't really do
much for me I lived with it for a while
in my house and the kids like playing
with a funhouse mirror and daddy I'm why
am I so fat but you know at when you
when you look at these curved TVs and
you're at the home you kind of forget
about them after a while it kind of
becomes more of an aesthetic decision
and the Curt TV premium is still pretty
high you know you're looking at a few
hundred bucks at least between the
curved and the flat versions so I don't
think you know unless you really like
that look it's worth springing for a
curved TV thinking you're gonna get a
more immersive picture which is what
they try to tell you okay good to know
let's go to the content 4k TV needs 4k
content to look its best
correct right streaming seems to be the
majority of the content offerings this
is first for TV and the previous
resolution improvements it was carried
largely on discs on broadcast on
satellite this is the first Hardware
up-res that's been carried on the back
of the Internet right so the streaming
is here because it's really hard to do
discs again you know you got to get
everybody to agree to a disc standard
whereas with a Netflix or Amazon they
can just go you know what let's just
make some 4k streams and put them out
there yeah so they're able to do that
they have decoding built into the TVs to
get that streaming out there one of the
things we haven't seen that this show is
a lot of announcements about new 4k
content really hasn't happened much so
that's true there's stuff to show you
we've got the same old Netflix YouTube
to a small degree who hulu amazon
comcast a little bit right Comcast and
Comcast and Amazon it's a yes last year
announced they would have streaming 4k
by the end of 2014 and they did barely
they were late December when they
finally were able to do it so you know
these guys made those announcements we
haven't seen really many new
announcements we seen a couple 4k
hardware announcements 4k Joey and a new
prototype for the blu-ray player that's
coming by the end of the year 4k blu-ray
blu-ray player ok are we ready are we
ready and here's that here's that Joey
which by the way is a 4k set-top box
that feeds off their DVR feeds off their
existing DVR is that right right it's
basically to get the 4k hardware
connection that'll go to your TV out
there it's basically their version of an
Apple TV of a sort
kind of but it's also it doesn't require
a new DVR new 4k DVR from what I
understand we're not sure exactly how it
works but yeah this this thing is based
just an add-on that enables your
existing dish hard
to do to do 4k okay now about that
blu-ray disc are we really gonna rebuy
our disc library for a third time
well if Hollywood has its way yes you
will imagine the Lord of the Rings 4k
extended edition boxset you know with
all of them The Hobbit and everything I
mean that's that's that's what you're
looking at there it is there there's the
the first really mainstream prototype
for KBD all right manufacturer panic
Panasonic jumped in and did this I mean
all these guys are gonna have 4k blu-ray
players by the end of the year and we'll
see a couple titles out and 4k blu-ray
by the end of the year I think will be
really interesting because you're gonna
have 4k blu-ray on one end of the
quality spectrum then you're gonna have
4k streaming Netflix and Amazon where
sometimes a little hard to tell that
it's 4k he's gonna say streaming doesn't
always live up to the full potential of
4k does it no and and you know they've
been doing this forever with streaming
they'll say they're 1080p they'll you
know and but it's not really it's just a
slightly better version so they kind of
play fast and loose with the definitions
but you know you're gonna need a 4k TV
relatively recent to get these streams
on your set they'll be a little
indicator that says you're getting 4k so
you know you got the warm fuzzy anyway I
was reading in one of your pieces that I
think I guess it's Netflix the streaming
4k at about 15 or 16 megabits per second
you need which for perch people have a
good internet connection at home that's
a pretty small slice for folks have a
basic broadband connection that probably
eats up most of it it's tough yeah and
there's plenty of place the United
States we just can't get that especially
on a primetime evening you know
depending on your on your provider yeah
so you know all that is still up in the
air the streaming thing is definitely
the low end of the spectrum but you know
4k blu-ray will give the video files and
people that are really into getting that
BEC special quality finally an
alternative so that'll be nice still
crit me if I'm wrong I feel like we have
more content available or imminent for
4k than we almost ever had on 3d blu-ray
well you know you'd think to have a 3d
blu-ray they're still coming out it's
still quite a few of them nobody ever
uses them though so you know you get the
blu-ray pack it's got a 3d disc in there
that you're just gonna you know use for
as a coaster and then you can watch the
actual blu-ray disc of frozen over and
over and over and over that was a usage
problem a real compelling use case
problem
all right the pipeline is we were
talking about a lot of old content can
be rescanned
from film to 4k so Hollywood's got a
huge vault they're looking at saying we
can make new money on this
and so that's part of the ideas they'll
be able to pipe out the 4k they'll be
able to add an HDR layer which is pretty
cool and get that high dynamic range on
a lot of they'll both those new
technologies from an old vault print and
Netflix cool they announced that they're
gonna have HDR streaming at the show so
that was one you know nice announcement
it's a part of the Netflix recommended
label separate announcements Netflix is
also saying that they're gonna be
certifying TVs for what it's worth maybe
a little bit like THX certification
whatever they'll put a badge on a TV but
the that's it Netflix is doing HDR Dolby
is also doing some HDR streaming so
you're finally going to see some of this
content come out which is again looks a
little bit better than we've seen in
terms of in 4k okay and there's no 4k
broadcast coming in the u.s. anytime
soon is there now they dabble in Asia
and Europe I think yeah there's some
stuff out there actually Japan is
talking about 8k you know they're way
ahead of the thing yeah but you know in
terms of the u.s. the the cable
companies and all those guys they're
having a hard enough time delivering a
decent you know in 1080i stream okay now
let's talk about the last area that was
really big here perhaps the biggest area
was not the res or the tech but the
policies and the offers we saw the
beginnings of what might have been hard
to imagine a year ago the unbundling of
the big pay TV channel bundle yeah sling
television yeah and Dish Network pretty
much told the show with this
announcements the $20 package that gives
you access to ESPN a few Disney
Channel's TNT CNN a basically basic
cable
there's no broadcast channels on there
but for 20 bucks a month you can hook up
an antenna or get you know for example
Hulu Plus it's not just on TV it'll be
on phones tablets through set-top boxes
integrated into smart connected
televisions about all they're missing I
think is Apple and PlayStation for
obvious competitive reasons all right
and and you might see that a little bit
later in the year there's also
PlayStation view which is Sony's service
they announced that before CES and
they're saying it's going to come out
around the same time as the dish service
probably a little bit more expensive
I've heard that'll say about 60 bucks
for say say for you yeah and you get a
lot more channels on it so there's this
proliferation of ways to get cable
without subscribing to cable utilize
your internet connection for live TV as
opposed to segmented episodic you know
streaming stuff do you get from Netflix
and Amazon you've been doing now but
listen there's nothing quite like live
and one key to these services that I
think really appeals to the guys signing
the contracts that you can't skip
commercials so the issue with the DVR
these people could go through the
commercials now if you get this net for
this you know disservice you're not be
able to blow through the commercials
anymore so what about that because
there's no DVR in the mix right and it
is carrying the full broadcast
commercial schedule that's why Plus has
like 1.5 stars on the you know Apple
Store it's like nobody really likes
those cameras yeah you get what you pay
for it interesting okay that's that's a
very good point now as we look forward
here what was the biggest story in
television 4k TVs 4k content or
unbundling television I mean it was
unbundling it was it was the content
side I think I mean the 4k TVs have been
around for a while I think the TV
Hardware stuff you know it's really cool
that they're getting these really
high-end TVs with you know they can get
some really good image quality and
especially with HDR that stuff's a
little bit in the future and the prices
aren't really mainstream yet the TVs the
4k TVs that will be mainstream prices
aren't gonna have much better picture
than the current 1080p TVs so it's gonna
be interesting on the hardware side to
see where the pricing goes but I think
these guys are trying to get as much
premium as they can while we're telling
me that by end of the year perhaps the
1080p TVs they're almost they most moved
to the bargain category which makes a
lot of folks feel really good with what
went in for the holidays the
manufacturers are holding your breath
before ke TVs don't go to the bargain
category by that point to just give us a
quick peek when you get back to base
back to New York and you're back in the
TV lab what are you guys looking forward
to getting in soon maybe for the first
time or a refreshed a lot aligned well
we have right now in the lab a ten
thousand dollar television that I'm
pretty excited to review I got a host
expensive you've had in it's the LG 65
inch OLED so we're gonna get a chance to
crack that we saw actually some 77 inch
OLED 's this year at the show
LG's putting out a couple flat OLED TVs
I called it the best TV ever
last year it really is a beautiful TV
technology again really expensive
nobody's gonna be buying these things
anytime soon unless you know you got
money to burn but I really like the sort
of OLED versus you know LCD it's it's
kind of like it fills my heart with you
know my hankering for plasma gets
replaced by wonderful eggs right OLED
gets back into that really gorgeousness
but it's almost wet looking right looks
beautiful that was that was that was the
beauty of plasma had a certain certain
juice to it you know just it was just
different than crystals right right when
plasma goes away we get a new thing and
so it's it's
more than ya alright folks that's the
estimate of the definitive take on where
things are going to television here at
this show and it's of course the center
of CES still in so many ways the biggest
the biggest and the biggest in every
definition at the show I want to thank
David Katz Meyer and thank you for
watching as we've digested TV here at
CES 2015 i'm brian coulis relied from
