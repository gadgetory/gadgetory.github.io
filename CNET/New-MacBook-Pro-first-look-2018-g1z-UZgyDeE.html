Pros if you get the higher-end 30 inch
with the touch bar or the 15 of course
those all have touch bars you have a lot
of new internal component options even
though the outside still looks the same
right here I've got one of the highest
end of the new MacBooks this is a 15
MacBook Pro inside and there's something
pretty new and exciting is one of
Intel's new 6th core core i9 processors
before now you could only go up through
a quad core Core i7 in this system you
can also get up to 32 gigs of ram which
I have here you can get up to 4
terabytes of solid-state hard drive
space I've only got 2 terabytes in here
still pretty good I've also got an AMD
560 graphics card in here that all adds
up to you know you start with the
15-inch pro you started like $23.99 this
guy is about 46 $4,700 with all those
high-end add-ons there frankly that
sounds 8 hard drive adds a lot to the
cost once you get up to the 2 terabyte
and greater options even though this
looks the same from the outside as last
year's model in the year before that's
modeled obviously there's a lot of
internal changes with the components and
a few new features I'm gonna tell you
about 3 I think of the most exciting
most interesting ones the first one is
obviously that Intel Core I 9 processor
when I open this guy up getting out of
the box the first thing I did was went
up to about this Mac I opened it up I
said Oh what processors in here there
you go 2.9 gigahertz Intel Core i 9
that's something that we've seen PC
makers on the window side say is coming
soon to their super high-end systems but
I have not had an opportunity to test an
i-9 laptop before now so I'm very
excited to get a look at that I'm also
excited that a cool feature from the new
iPhones and the iPad pro is coming over
to here I'm going to show you that and
that is called true tone that is a
display technology that uses sensors to
detect what sort of light is in the room
that you're in literally the the color
temperature of the light whether it's a
warm light or a cold light and it
adjusts the colors on
screen to match that right now I have
true tone turned on and then if I click
this little button here and turn it off
you'll see a very subtle difference in
in this environment it's hard to tell
too much of a difference in the color
temperature there and then I can turn it
back on so if you go someplace with very
cold light it'll look a little bluer and
colder if you go someplace with very
warm light it'll look a little warmer
and that's so the colors that you see
let's say if you're a visual artist or
you're doing a layout or something in
the real world around you the value of Y
the value of other colors is accurately
reflected on the screens now the last
big update to this is something that
people have been asking a lot of
questions about lately and that is the
keyboard the superflat keyboard that you
have on the MacBook Pros and also the
12-inch MacBook people are concerned
because some people have problems with
sticky keys where a little bit of dust
or debris gets into these very tight
keys and stops the laptop from working
there have been some lawsuits about it
Apple now has a repair program and they
said this is our new third-generation
keyboard right here but it doesn't do
anything to actually fix that particular
problem there's no engineering change
for that what it is however is quieter
I'm gonna do a little little random
typing test right here it has a kind of
a rubbery a slightly more rubbery matte
feel I have last year's 15-inch MacBook
Pro right here I got a text file open on
here also do the same typing it's a
little sharper I can hear the difference
it's not a huge difference but if you're
worried that your MacBook keyboard was
too loud well it'll be a little bit
quieter I guess not not a ton quieter
but if they expect people to not worry
about this tricky keyboard issue they're
gonna have to come up with some sort of
engineering fix or tweak design for the
keyboard that is not however what we
have here as you can see physically the
2017 model and the 2018 model are
essentially identical so you're just
gonna get a more powerful system that
will let you render graphics or import
stuff faster and and work in you know
super high-res video if that's the kind
of thing that you do and those are the
kind of people who are looking to spend
twenty three hundred dollars to forty
five hundred dollars on a new laptop
that is Apple's new 2018 version of the
MacBook Pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
