Apple with earnings coming out for the
holiday court in our scene at senior a
Teixeira tip Caen has been following the
earnings now Shara obviously the iPhone
7 has been a big performer and it's
broken the losing streak that Apple's
had for the past three quarters what
does this mean for the company at large
yeah so it was really important that the
iPhone do well this quarter they came
out with the iPhone 7 in September it
looks a lot like the success and the 6
so there were some questions how well
it's actually been doing they had record
sales over 78 million iPhones sold they
said that the seven-plus has actually
been selling extremely well which makes
a lot of sense because it had all the
new camera features so this is really
important for Apple most of their
revenue comes from the phone and in
terms of the other revenue streams
obviously we've got the new MacBooks
that came out with the touch bar we have
air pods and the Apple watch and iPads
did we get any indication on how those
were performing yeah Tim Cook spent a
lot of time on the call talking about
how it was basically just a record
quarter max did extremely well they
don't break out Apple watch sales but
they said it was a record both in terms
of units and in revenue air pods they
kind of talked about how they had this
strong wearables lineup now kind of the
only really negative spot was the iPad
which fell for the 12th straight quarter
no matter what they do with the new iPad
pro adding these different features it
just doesn't seem to get people to buy
it and here's an interesting one
services now tell me about what this
category actually is and why it is such
a big driver for Apple's earnings going
forward services as things like the App
Store Apple Care Apple pay all of these
things you do with your phone
basically for Apple it's a big deal
because that's something that is steady
so if you are paying for iCloud you're
paying for it every month it's not just
a one-time purchase like a phone and
then you know you don't buy it again for
two years it's only about seven billion
dollars in revenue is what it was this
quarter
comparison the iPhone was over 50
billion so it's not a huge percentage
for them but it's something that's just
growing a ton and what about the rumors
about Apple moving into content and tell
and creation would that full under the
services been a - yeah that definitely
would they noted that they're hoping to
double their services business over the
next four years that presumably would
come from new sorts of services getting
people to pay for more things so along
with having an iCloud accounts and Apple
music they want you to pay for an Apple
TV account or whatever it is they have
so that's probably a big factor in how
they actually get that business to
increase so much
sharra thank you so much make sure to
stay tuned to seen it for all the latest
on Apple and everything else tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
