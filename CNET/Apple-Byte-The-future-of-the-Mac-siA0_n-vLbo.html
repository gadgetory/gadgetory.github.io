thought I'd you know surf on in for my
vacation browntown hair darker than
normal and we welcome you to the apple
pie for all the good and bad inside the
world of Apple now we haven't talked
about Max recently so let's jump in and
start there after vr-zone recently
leaked the roadmap for Intel's
next-generation processors called ivy
bridge now the macbook pro and macbook
air lines currently use Sandy Bridge
dual-core processors but Ivy Bridge
would bring quad-core processors and
even faster graphics capabilities to
apples laptops now Ivy Bridge is
expected to launch around May and we
could see them in the next generation
laptops loaded with them soon after that
we've also talked about rumors that
point it to apple being a little
cautious about moving forward with the
mac pro desktop because of its shrinking
market but shortly after the developers
build of Mac OS 10.7 point 3 was
released in reference to video drivers
for amd's new graphics card called
Tahiti which is a really warm place
during this time of the year but it's
also a video card that's set to be
released in January of 2012 now Matt
gadget speculated it must have been
placed there in anticipation of a new
mac pro since Apple historically
introduces new graphics support with new
product revisions for the Mac Pro it
might be a good sign but we haven't
heard a peep about the Mac Pro's which
I'm waiting for an apple last updated it
over 15 months ago yikes now product
remembers that won't go away smart house
claims that Apple's rumored television
set will be offered in three different
sizes ranging from 32 inches to 55
inches in the last quarter of 2012 with
the new rumoured a6 processor we might
see in the ipad 3 as well then they
start getting crazy by saying it will
compete with 55-inch oled displays and
super HD TV technology now a couple
years ago an 11 inch OLED TV from Sony
with 2,500 bucks so I'm going to go out
on a limb and say it won't be an oled
screen bloomberg reports their sources
say Apple currently has a TV prototype
but there's still a possibility it won't
go past that stage all right we know
that Iowa's gaming has exploded but I
wanted to take a moment to show you how
some of the successful games we have
known have taken things to a whole new
level now I know you've seen the Angry
Birds plushies you know there
an acute but now fruit ninja will be
selling their own plushies with the
sensei and a watermelon with a face that
guy didn't even exist in the game but
who doesn't love a watermelon with eyes
and since we mentioned Angry Birds we
should mention the fact that the wife of
one of rovio's top executives showed up
to the presidential Independence Day
reception in Finland in an angry birds
evening gown notice the placement of the
angry bird I i know i'll let you take
that all in all right let's check out
some quick bites gamers and fans of the
online service that streams games to
your devices will be stoked after they
announce the service is now available on
android and iOS devices you can use
their bluetooth controller or play new
releases like arkham city or assassin's
creed that have also been adapted to use
touchscreen control so that's welcome
for gamers apple also showed off updated
renderings of their spaceship or their
new headquarters which includes a roof
made almost entirely of solar panels
which would make it one of the top solar
installations in the world and the
largest in the US generating over 5
million watts of power yeah that's a
whole bunch of power and the big a
released an update to their iBooks app
with a nighttime reading theme that
makes it easier on the eyes to read in
the dark a full screen layout additional
fonts to choose from and more and
finally I can't wait to check out this
bad boy from behringer it's an
eight-foot-wide 10,000 watt ipod dock
called the i nuke boom stands four feet
tall and it will cost thirty thousand
bucks it will be on display at CES 2012
las vegas and i will write it and
finally we have to congratulate our
winners for our amazing gelaskins $25
giveaway the correct answer to all that
food that was thrown at me by the apple
bike crew is pumpkin pie cranberry sauce
yams chicken and whipped cream in I also
saved some whip cream in my ear for a
special moment all right congrats go to
