MacBook Pro and it's a great question
try nothing answer well let me start by
some of the key ideas right you want a
next-generation MacBook Pro to have a
killer new display I do you want it to
have an architecture built for the
future you want it to be radically thin
in light and of course you want it to be
bold and embrace the newest technologies
to be willing to discard the old legacy
thing so you could make something unlike
any other notebook that's been made
today so would you like to see the next
generation MacBook Pro let's show to you
now
so the next generation MacBook Pro is
the most beautiful computer we have ever
made well the first thing you're going
to notice from the front it's dominated
by an amazing magnificent new display
there's never been a notebook that is
this gorgeous but really if you want to
be shocked let's turn it around to its
side and see what it looks like from the
side view now I know it's tough to see
from the audience the challenge show you
something so thin and light and small
from so far away but just to give you a
little context here's my finger next to
it right it's thinner than my finger I
mean even even with its closed it is
because that display is so radically
thin it is a true breakthrough in
engineering and there has never been a
notebook this then this light miss
powerful for professional use let's
bring it back around to the front don't
worry we're gonna tell you all about it
in just a minute but we just have to
enjoy for a second how incredible this
is so close it up for now
and let me go up to the slides and tell
you some more about this incredible
product so the new next-generation
MacBook Pro is 0.71 inches thin that is
remarkable putting it next to the
existing current generation not.but pro
you see the difference it's a quarter
thinner but it's a dramatic amount in
fact let me bring the macbook air next
to it and you see it's about as thin as
a MacBook Air that is incredible
and it's weight it weighs just four
point four six pounds under four and a
half pounds it is the lightest pro
notebook that we have ever made even
just lighter in the 13-inch MacBook Pro
today probably the most amazing thing
about it is this gorgeous display that
it's built with it is a breakthrough and
display engineering yes it is a Retina
display
which means
the pixels the pictures on this display
are so small that from a normal working
distance your retina cannot discern
those individual pixels and to use it is
absolutely stunning
it's 15.4 inches across but its pixel
density you are you all sitting down is
this is really exciting it is two
thousand eight hundred and eighty pixels
by 1800 that's four times the number of
pixels in the previous generation
MacBook Pro display their density is 220
pixels per inch and I know some of you
were really smart over there and I've
already done the math it's five million
one hundred and eighty four thousand
pixels that is the world's highest
resolution notebook display and it yes
it's not only a major because the number
of pixels in it but the quality of this
displays the best we have ever made it
has higher contrast ratios deeper blacks
it has a higher angle of view with IPS
technology and best of all you get the
benefit of the glossy display with the
richer color but we've been able to
reduce the glare and reflection by up to
75% makes it a joy to work on
now it's ships with iOS 10 line but line
has been updated to take full advantage
of that Retina display so everything you
do want it can look really sharp and
beautiful so the applications we include
with Lion for example male-male has been
updated so reading your mail is like
reading fine print it's gorgeous
safaris been updated surfing the web can
be like experiencing magazine print
quality and many of the applications
like iMovie and iPhoto have been updated
in iPhoto when you're looking at
thumbnail photos in the events view
you're gonna see a clarity and level of
detail you've never seen before in a
display it's gorgeous
