effort to find great recipes online
whether you're looking for the perfect
way to make Thanksgiving stuffing or a
way to make tofurkey tastes like like
anything apps like all recipes and
epicurious have you covered but there's
a difference between having the
instructions for great food and actually
having the skills and tools to make it
I'm Donnell Bell and this top 5 i'm
counting down 5 apps for the iPhone and
iPad that will make you a better cook
even if you've been banned from the
kitchen having these apps on hand could
get you back in the cooks good graces
starting off at number 5 knife skills
carving the turkey shouldn't remind your
dinner guests of a crime scene to
reaffirm everyone's belief in mankind's
mastery over the animal kingdom take a
minute to really learn how to use a
knife whether it's the cleanly slice an
avocado or to cleave a leg from a pig
carcass this five-dollar app will get
you up to speed at number four time egg
pro timer built into your phone is great
but what about when you need to run five
timers simultaneously one for the turkey
one for the yams the green beans the
stuffing the casserole great cooking
requires great timing just make sure you
enable notifications in this app so it
can do this job coming in at number
three kitchenaid ur is your recipe
measured out in pints and ounces and all
you have around the kitchen or cups and
tablespoons have no fear for 99 cents
the kitchen a tarap quickly dials in any
conversion you want leaders quarts pints
cups this app will make sense of
everything the only thing I can't do is
keep track of how much Chardonnay your
grandma's been thrown back but number
two is a real lifesaver substitutions
you're halfway through your recipe it
says you need cardamon and quinoa but
you're holding a box of shake and bake
you're not going to go back to the
supermarket a4 p.m. on thanksgiving day
what you need is a solid substitution
that's what you get here whether you're
looking for a replacement for yogurt or
you need to make a pumpkin pie that's
gluten-free for your hippy uncle this
99-cent app does all the heavy lifting
now before we get to number one a lot of
you are probably wondering hey donald
where's the android love all i can say
is go
cry to the mothership with the exception
of the timer I couldn't find any of
these apps on the Google Play Store and
what's worse who doesn't even have a
category for food and cooking apps
android has caught up to iOS in a lot of
ways but there are still some dark
corners in the App Catalog all right and
finally my number one recommended apt to
save Thanksgiving dinner from the brink
of disaster the Escoffier cooks
companion this free app has a little bit
of everything has conversions timers
ingredient information the glossary
everything you need to up your cooking
game all in one place plus just saying
Escoffier makes you sound like you know
what you're doing so there you go five
ways to increase your cooking potential
to the power of technology more top 5s
for me including the top five must-have
android tablet apps head over top five
