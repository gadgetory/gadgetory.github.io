and we just came from face book
selection war room ever since the 2016
presidential election the company has
really been trying to prove to the
public that it can stop election
meddling and so we walked into the
spaces very intimate room full of about
20 people from different teams
operations data scientists researchers
that are really working together and
working with Facebook's team of 20,000
people to stop election meddling right
before the midterm election on the walls
we're monitoring both internal and
external signals so internally we're
looking at for any spikes in user
reported content it might be election
related such as voter suppression or
hate speech externally we're looking at
media sources to just get an
understanding of what's happening on the
ground as well as monitoring any
election related content and other
social media platforms we need to deal
with spam clickbait big news and data
misuse that's going to change we have
been hard at work for the last two years
to make sure that we're far more
prepared than we were than in 2016 and
so that includes cracking down on fake
accounts so as an example there we have
actually made huge advances in
artificial intelligence and machine
learning and we have been able to block
in a recent six month period 1.3 billion
fake accounts from forming another
example is in our work to combat fake
news we've really been going after the
financial incentives for people to
produce fake news in the first place
we've reduced clickbait we've reduced
the ability for people who run ad forms
to be successful on our platform on the
whiteboard we kind of have the flow of
how the war room should work so any
inputs or signals we're receiving come
in we make sure that they're thoroughly
investigated by threat Intel or data
science and then passed off to the right
operations team that know our community
standards policy and can decide whether
or not something should be taken down
I think one of the strengths of having
everybody in the same place together is
just the speed with which we were able
to act between detecting a problem in
the first place and eventually taking
action and typically we found through
our experience with the first round of
the Brazilian presidential election just
a week ago being able to go from
detection to action in just a couple of
hours so ever since the 2016
presidential election Facebook has
obviously been trying to prove to the
public that they are better prepared for
the upcoming elections and they have
been in the past but we'll have to kind
of see whether or not this is enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
