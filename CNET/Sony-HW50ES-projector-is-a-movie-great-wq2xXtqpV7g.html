is a look at the sony vp LHW 50 es
projector if you're looking for a model
for a dedicated home cinema there are a
few options available to you while you
may think of Sony is mainly a TV
manufacturer it takes W 50 ES projectors
should put it in contention this is not
a cheap projector at four thousand
dollars it's more expensive than most
TVs but the images it is capable of more
than return on the investment as far as
higher-end projectors go it's still
fairly large but it's also quite
attractive in a monolithic type of way
we've pitted this projector against the
JVC dla X 35 and there's very little to
separate them in terms of picture
quality but the most obvious difference
was in the number of accessories that
were bundled with it
the Sony includes two pairs of 3d
glasses while the JVC doesn't and you
also get an extra lamp which saves you
an extra 300 bucks another positive in
the Sony's favor is that it's easy to
set up with the manual lens shift
controls also just set it into reference
mode and you'll get a very cinematic
picture black levels shadow detail and
colors are superb and it gives most
televisions a run for their money
especially when you consider than 100
inch TV will cost you ten times what
this projector and a good screen would
well it would be difficult to pick
between the sony HW 50 ES and the JVC X
35 they are both stunning projectors and
well worth the money this has been ty
Pendlebury foreseen it
