role in creating this platform for
entrepreneurship around the world I know
that's something they even thinking a
lot about to me entrepreneurship is
about creating change not just creating
companies and you know the most
effective entrepreneurs that who I've
met care deeply about some mission and
some change that they're trying to
create and often they don't even start
because they're trying to create a
company right and you know that's how I
think about you know my connection to to
all of us here is when I was getting
started I um and I want it I care deeply
about giving everyone a voice right and
giving people the tools to share
everything that they cared about and
bringing a community together and it
started small and in one University and
I didn't think it was going to be a
company at the time as a matter of fact
I was pretty convinced that at some
point someone would build something like
this for the world but you know I
thought that that would be some other
company that you know already had
thousands of Engineers and was used to
building stuff for hundreds of millions
of people around the world and you know
what ended up happening was you know
that no one built it right so we just
kind of kept on going right I mean
people said it each step along the way
you know what you're doing alright maybe
college students like it but no one else
is going to like it and you know there's
not going to be any money in doing this
so alright so you only really do it if
you care all right if you're passionate
about doing it and and then it started
growing and people said it would be a
fad and it would never be a good
business but you know you keep going
because you care not because you're
trying to create a business and you know
then there's the shift in mobile where
people thought that it wouldn't be a
sustainable business and you know each
of these things you entrepreneur so I
think build things that last for a long
time keep going because they care
fundamentally about the change that
they're trying to create in the world
and they're not in it just to build a
company and you know I carry that with
me today you know so you know today we
have we live in a world with more than
seven billion people but more than four
billion
of us or not on the Internet and you
know we talked about having an equal
opportunity to be able to create a
change in the world and I think that's a
really hard thing to do if if you don't
have access to some of the basic
infrastructure and technical tools that
are necessary to to build this kind of
technical these kind of technical
products so you know I kind of think
about what we're doing today I'm very
similarly to how I thought about where
we were at the beginning you know it's
you know I give people all the time who
come to me and say all right well you're
investing billions of dollars in trying
to put Internet connectivity and places
where you know we don't get paid for it
it's not something that will that will
make any money from for a very long
period of time if it works out but you
know it's this deep belief that you're
trying to make a change you're trying to
connect people in the world and I really
do believe that if you do something good
and if you help people out then
eventually some portion of that good
will come back to you and you may not
know up front what it's going to be but
that's just been the guiding principle
for me in the work that we've done and I
hope that some of the work that we do
can play a role and empowering you and
so many more entrepreneurs to build the
next great companies Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
