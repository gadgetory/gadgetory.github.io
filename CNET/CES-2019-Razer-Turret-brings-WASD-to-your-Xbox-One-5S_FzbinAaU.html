the old game panja's isn't cutting it
for you you may have heard about the
addition of keyboard and mouse support
officially for the Xbox one and one of
the key brands involved in this is Razer
they previously announced that they were
making a device called the turret which
is a keyboard and mouse combo built in
together it's a gaming keyboard little
mouse pad slides out from the side and a
mouse sits on it now we can tell you
that it is going to cost two hundred and
forty nine dollars and it is available I
believe anytime now we got to try a
hands-on demo session at CES 2019 and
the thing that was most impressive about
it I think is that the mouse is magnetic
and it sticks on to the mousepad just
lightly there's actually an area right
around the edge where the management is
stronger you can tilt it up and it won't
fall off but you can still move it
around freely when you get to the edge
it'll make sure you don't drop it onto
the floor cuz the extra magnetic power
there it works with a dongle you plug
into your Xbox one and of course if you
want to play games on a PC as many of us
do you can pull that dongle out plug it
in to your laptop or desktop and use the
same equipment there the razor turret
it's coming very soon for two hundred
and fifty dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
