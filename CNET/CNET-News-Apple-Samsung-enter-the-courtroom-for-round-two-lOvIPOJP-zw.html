current smartphones like slide to unlock
and Siri have landed to tech giants in
court for a second time and the jury's
verdict could impact how your phone
functions in a second patent
infringement trial Apple and Samsung are
accusing each other of copying features
used in their popular smartphones and
tablets including the iphone 5 and ipad
mini as well as Samsung's Galaxy s3 and
Galaxy Note on the Samsung side they
have accused Apple of copying patent
that they have related to like video
calls so that would apply to something
like FaceTime both companies are asking
for damages Apple wants about 2 billion
dollars from Samsung and Samsung wants
about 7 million dollars in royalties I
don't think it was ever really about the
money I think it's this battle to
dominate the mobile industry or
consumers the verdicts could force
changes to your phone it's really the
mobile operating systems you know kind
of battling here one thing that we could
see would be Google changing some of the
Android features if these are found to
infringe and that could make its way
through you know all of the Android
devices on the market while the witness
list includes executives from Apple and
Samsung it may also include Google
programmers and engineers a lot of the
patents and a lot of the features are
Android features they're not things that
Samsung has it's almost more Apple
versus Google the previous trial in 2012
favorite apple samsung was ordered to
pay apple nearly 1 billion dollars in
damages for infringing on patents in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
