Chang I'm
Joanie Salzmann I'm alfred hang our 5g
package continue to steam along today
we've got a look at how 5g might change
video Joan tell us about this scary
utopian future 5g might actually bring
it's a scary it could be awesome it
could be amazing it depends on your your
perspective but yeah tell us about this
idea of 5g potentially customizing video
on the fly well the idea is that 5g
opens up the ability to have video
that's much more interactive than we've
ever really known before and interactive
video up until this point has been
really clunky it hasn't been super
popular it's been interesting but not
not very certainly stops you have to
push like a bundle a lot of it is most
of it is kind of choose your own
adventure or style stuff where the story
line pauses and it's like does the
character go to the scary woods or go to
the castle to fight the dragons stuff
like that
5g has the capacity the capability of
potentially creating videos where the
plotline changes depending on how you
react to watching it on your phone it
could have VR and AR could explode
because of the capabilities of having
that real-time exchange of information
happening with your phone that 5g can
handle that previous technologies
couldn't that opens all kinds of crazy
price concerns right because if it's
like constantly watching you for your
reactions right
while you watch everything with a ski
mask on dude so yeah hockey mask it's
yeah we're in a time right now we're
hyper not hyper aware but we're more
aware than we have in the past about how
technology compromises our privacy in
order to give us things that delight us
right as some companies like to put it
so with this one it's the same situation
people that I talk to are like one great
thing is how with 5g we can use your
cameras to be taking in all this visual
visual information that will further
advance the ability to have interactive
television but the downside is that your
camera would be taking in all this
visual information
all around you all the time so there's
always it's good we're gonna have to
figure out a way to strike compromises
that don't creep people out all right
well speaking of privacy the EU is
holding a big privacy conference in
Brussels
I'm Katie Collins is out there but offer
to get some of the details on what Apple
and Facebook have said at this
conference right yes so Tim Cook spoke
at it earlier today and he's actually
the first tech CEO to speak about
privacy and aus data privacy law this
has been brewing for some time now but
usually through a privacy officer or
some lawyer for you know Amazon or
Facebook or Google
so Tim Cook is the first tech CEO to
actually comment about this and he
basically you know criticizes the tech
industry and talks about all the issues
with privacy that we've already seen
through the last year you know companies
using your data and things like that and
then he laid out basically apple's plan
or what Apple wants in a u.s. privacy
law which includes the right to have
your personal data minimized the right
to know what is being collected about
you the right to control you know you
can edit or delete what data a company
has on you and then security as a
foundation for all that making sure all
of that is stored on a secure server the
interesting part is that he criticizes a
website or you know you criticizes tech
companies out there doesn't name any of
them right you know a lot of it is what
Google and Facebook does and if you look
at Google's privacy framework it's
almost the exact same thing Facebook
didn't lay out their their you know
whole plan for what they want on us data
privacy law but Mark Zuckerberg
basically went out there and said hey
you should trust us yeah that's that's
that's what I'm gonna do
trust mark alright lastly in the time
that we had last time we have I just
want to give a shout out to Maggie
reruns exclusive interviews with FCC
Chairman occupy and Commissioner Jessica
rosenworcel who talked about the dilemma
facing rural broadband and how they can
agree and sometimes disagree on some of
the solutions to fixing that problem for
a full coverage sugars on CNN I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Jody sawsan I'm Alfred Inc
thanks for listening
like this weird they barely touch the
surface that's true I mean okay thanks
everybody for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast of the
359 you can subscribe to that and the
links down below until then keep sending
in your questions and comments so we can
keep the conversation going
let's go ahead and jump into the hot
button issues Tammy Thompson and Dean
Jones say bye-bye privacy Alex Mitchell
says this is an episode of Black Mirror
coming to life but guess what the next
Netflix interactive series is going to
be yeah but it's not like facial
recognition
she shows up I just wish that like with
the advent of 5g on this that have you
ever watched a movie of somebody and
like they're clearly on their phone the
whole time yeah where's like you'll pay
attention to this part I hope that the
facial recognition can notice that I'm
like hey this is an important part you
should be watching the movie just stop
it's like a Broadway play like when you
have your phone out like right usually
like you don't do that because the
actors are like right there now I can do
that well this would so this would be
more effective on phone right like if
we're really working a movie theater on
your TV like it's really watching mobile
video I may be the video and your phone
stops and like pay attention or
something that's crazy really
they were like after you finish 20
episodes the actors are stopping like
hey you should probably take a break
look I see the dead look in your eyes
before you show up can't wait till we
can do that for our viewers as well hey
look man look you look kind of tired
maybe you shouldn't be watching the show
right now man whatever really it's cool
I mean there's just so many ways that 5g
I mean this is just one of the kind of
like most had trippy ways of yeah I mean
I didn't even the story doesn't even
touch on the fact that 5 G's
implications for driverless vehicles
also has second wave effects for
entertainment you know when you don't
have to drive anyway yeah what are you
gonna be doing in that car you're gonna
be able to watch more movies more music
in addition to other things but you know
so much
hot dog we can eat so many hot dogs as
well as Reeboks
maybe what if the books can also tell
your facial recognition like coming back
at you and they change like the next
chapter based on how poor Hugh are I
mean that's like that's like I'm
physiologically a lot easier yeah I feel
like that's feasible now yeah yeah
probably everything is also sexy because
we don't talk about 5g probably what
questions do we have staying on the same
vein life improvement says they already
know what you're watching wasn't there a
story a while back about Netflix
tweeting about someone who watched the
same movie on repeat for two years
straight or something like that right
then they volunteered that information
now yeah what the difference is right
now think of the information that
anybody has about what you're watching
as sort of like what a second grader
could understand you know what I mean
like it's like Netflix knows the title
that you're watching and it knows when
you start and it knows that you started
it it knows how long you watched it when
you dropped out and if you continue to
the next episode that's really like all
that they know and so they're algorithms
and the profile the taste profiles that
they build for you are based on that but
what we're talking about here is that
potentially Netflix or other video
creators could know like what your eye
color is so they could change the
protagonists eye color to more closely
match yours so you it makes them more
label they could know if you're super
shocked by what just happened and give
you more shocks like that in the future
it's know it's knowing if you're in
transit on a bus and they could have the
character be in transit on a bus to make
it like the the mobile phone gives you
so much more data about who you are what
you're doing than anything that we have
right now and five g's what's unlocks
the capability to harness that data and
analyze it in real time which is the
crucial thing yeah it's the whole idea
of low latency right this no basically
no lag time between you know network
speeds that would enable like things to
be changed on the fly because right now
with even with our current network that
just there'd be enough of a life that
doesn't really
work son feasible at all but with 5g you
can get that instantaneous reaction
which again is scary I don't I'm not
down to this I don't like this this is
pandering at its best
like I don't tune into content for
someone to essentially help me
self-serve I'm more into something like
that I've latched on to a story as
escapism I kind of want to find this out
to the chat do you really want them to
frame content that's more like you
because that'd be really boring like if
I'm watching a show and suddenly
homeboys slamming whiskey and down in
two chili dogs just like I am I'm
changing the channel I love it when the
algorithm just says like hey if we
figured that you hate yourself so here's
a character that also I mean just from a
more basic level like this kind of data
will will let the content people know
when you're like when you're into this
stuff when you're like based on based
off of the phones that the cameras
picking up that your your data it like
it'll actually know whether like what
are the I guess the hot moments in a
show and allow them to replicate that
better so they do that like more so like
in real time then be able to replicate
some of that in real time I mean because
they would have to have shot a lot of
this stuff ahead of time like another
kind of scary prospect is as this is
already happening as characters become
increasingly computer-generated I mean
how many movies are there were like
almost the entire cast or the entire
cast is computer generate it makes
actors live actors be not a need to have
for certain like but let's like the
caveat to all this is it's not like
there's all opera is still around like
there's always gonna be theater there's
still gonna be traditional storytelling
via video like that's not gonna be going
away like ever it's the idea that to be
a little bit more optimistic about it
assume that maybe they work out all the
privacy stuff so that it's not
compromising in like a really offensive
way just go with that it does open up
the possibility for having really cool
experiences like Coachella could be like
completely different Bernie
I could be totally different if you
don't alive events when you have in a
way that like people that do live events
haven't really even figured out what the
possibilities are very curious what this
also means for like advertising yeah
it's like digital billboards out there
that gee I wonder if that was on their
to-do list
that already exists like one of the
companies I talked to why are wax they
have technology where you you can have
interactive layers on video and if like
outside the window there's a billboard
you can digitally and seamlessly put a
personalized ad on that billboard so
like that's already here like hey this
guy looks like he's sneezing while he's
watching our show clearly you have a
cold your eyes are red your nose is red
and you're coughing love it love it love
it babe I'm just a stir by the thought
that Netflix and chill could quickly
turn into an actual porno shoot come on
Kobe I'm wrong you're wrong I'm not
wrong well because Netflix doesn't have
porn so yeah I think I think it's that
the cameras would be pointing at us sure
let's move on I like that it was brought
up lost legacy pointed out that Netflix
already kind of experiments with
personalized customization that's kind
of redundant isn't it and how they
change their thumbnails to appeal to you
like your actual iteration with
interaction with the interface results
in thumbnails that tend to appeal more
to you like if you watch more of the
episodes with actor B actor B thumbnail
shows up for you thumb something like
that so that's an interesting thing to
keep in mind they've already gone down
this path pretty far and there's no
slowing them down yet so for Craig and
many many many others myself included
let's give a quick rehash on what
exactly 5g is and how that in fact plays
into this outside of the fact that like
it's powering the the data the cameras
going back in real-time what what
exactly does 5g take on what role does
it take in this place I mean 5g sort of
axes that that bridge connecting you to
those services that offer by Netflix or
Hulu and you
it's five G stands for the fifth
generation of cellular technology
supposed to be much much faster much
much more responsive less lag time and
that connection speeds supposed to be
able to enable a whole number of
different echnology is like self-driving
cars or the prospect of sort of
on-the-fly variable video and so it's
yeah for the most part it's basically
the bridge that allows these content
producers to contact makers to deliver
customizable video to you on the fly so
while we're still on the topic of 5g
kozma Plex asks are there any potential
adverse health effects of millimeter
wave 5g networks has there been research
done there so it's hard to say there has
been there's been some part of the
problem is there aren't a lot of
millimeter wave deployments out there to
really test the the adverse effects
there have been a range of studies sort
of looking at this sort of the general
risk of having a cell signal so close to
you at least the official stance so far
like there isn't a heavy at respect
although you Publishing's take your
phone and your head too often although
we do that now a lot but in terms of 5g
it's silk of unclear there isn't a lot
of testing for that I know I've talked
I've talked to a bunch of researchers
who say there aren't any more
significant health risks to it but it's
still early days so we can't really say
for sure yeah I like that life
improvement has jumped in and included
that when you start getting to the far
end of the spectrum blue light
ultraviolet that's when things start to
get dangerous but those are inching
towards actual particle but not quite
obviously it's still still light but
that's when the when the waves get their
densest so yeah I think we're fine I
mean even - in the chat says oh I lost
it after 20 years now amazed that people
are still afraid of cellular technology
everything out there has its own
potential risk factor to a very small
degree but would it be so mass-produced
if there was legitimate danger I doubt
anyone actually wants to endanger their
their audience base I mean the history
is full of examples where yeah yeah I
think it's less that anyone wants to
purposely endanger it's you know we're
forging ahead on this technology and
we're we're looking at sort of the
prospects that come from it and not
necessarily looking at the potential
risks that said I mean Wi-Fi runs on a
fairly high frequency everyone seems
comfortable with Wi-Fi but like it's the
research isn't there isn't enough
research and there aren't enough
deployments out there to really see how
big a risk this is so it's still kind of
one those to be determined things from
APEC when 5g becomes available can
phones change back to 4G or 3G are those
going away yes for sure I don't know
about 3G I think the carriers are
starting to like kind of clean up that
the older network but though there's
definitely gonna be plenty of fallback
to 4G and I think that's that's point
one a lot of the experts have told me is
the 4G to 3G to 4G transition kind of
sucked because when you fell back to 3G
it was like falling back to dial-up it's
really a terrible experience what
they've been trying to do now is bulk up
the LTE technology so it's kind of on
par with 5g not quite like the drop
won't be a significant like you'll be
going from one gig to like 400 or 300
Meg's per second which I mean still is
fast enough for you if you're just you
know browsing the internet or streaming
video so yeah there's definitely gonna
be plenty of 4G there's a lot of legroom
for 4G to go on for a while so it's not
like once 5g is upon us they shot
everything else down all right we're
almost out of time but I really love
this question I want to take from
Matthew who is going to build this type
of content referring of course to this
interactive invasive Netflix is watching
you content who has the servers and
resources to spread this content well
initially it's gonna be really expensive
to make so you're gonna be seeing you'll
be seeing a lot of big companies make it
so that means like Netflix Verizon is
very interested in supporting people too
but like I said why are boxes come one
of the companies that I talk to you they
make a sort of like like an Adobe
Creative Suite for interactive video
sort of model and so they have stuff
right now where you can
as kind of like semi-professional not
gigantic huge brand content creator get
access to some tools to insert
interactivity into video that you that
they're already making so it's not just
it's kind of like how VR content is
right now like it's something that's
really expensive to make and so unless
you are a giant company or you're funded
deeply then it's hard to make really
splashy stuff but that's not to say that
there aren't people that are scrappy and
making stuff on their own you know kind
of like duct tape and Springs and
sprockets putting it together very
curious if Apple would get into this or
be interested in it just because they
certainly have the platform for it if
all those with like the IR cameras on
the end like facial recognition based
off like the iPhone 10 yeah and then
trying to expand more into like making
content like it's not Apple TV but it's
like I forgot the name well there's a
streaming service yeah next year yeah
but also directly conflicts with all the
privacy we are at the end of the line I
just like this closing thought from Alex
Mitchell that says we need a personal
information company that contains
controls all your personal info on
websites and apps that way you know what
info was where and you can be aware of
what's out there instead of hiding I
thought that was kind of an interesting
thought and I'd like to see if anyone
else thinks that's an interesting
thought oh so instead of like instead of
like like you go into Google I'm finding
out how much data Google has on you then
you have to go to Facebook and then like
download your data they're like because
one that has everything like your entire
internet yeah that's kind of a slope
they're just putting all your eggs in
one basket but I'd be interested in the
concept and see how it could actually
flesh out we want to go in does
something like but then you would have
to opt in for that you would basically
have to sign in to that website from
Google and Facebook and all this stuff I
mean I also thought that's all yeah yeah
all right we are out of time we are out
of time go ahead and take it away Roger
