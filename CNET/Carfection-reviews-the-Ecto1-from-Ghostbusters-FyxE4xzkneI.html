positions where we're getting to drive a
very special car not necessarily
something with the highest amount of
horsepower nor maybe something that is
the most valuable from history but a car
that is extremely exclusive and highly
sought-after nonetheless because today
I'm driving ecto-1
today is one of those fantastic days
where I get to sit behind the wheel of a
car that just makes you feel so much
more special than anything you can get
from a current showroom there is nothing
quite like a car like this to put a
smile on your face haven't felt this
happy since I drove the DeLorean the
ecto-1 from the original 1984 movie was
a 59 Cadillac ambulance this however is
an 84 cadillac fleetwood wagon with a
eureka hurst body so the car from the
2016 movie is from the same year the
original movie came out 32 years ago the
five liter small-block v8 is good for a
slightly underwhelming 135 horsepower or
at least it was when it was new and 190
foot-pounds of torque all connected to a
four speed automatic gearbox the we go
see hood ornament on the front of this
painstakingly crafted replica of the
movie car has in fact been cast from the
original movie prop Cadillacs of this
era were built for comfort not speed and
the preposterous ly comfortable interior
is unlike anything you can buy today
which is good as it's going to be a
while before you get to your paranormal
incident the reaction that we're getting
to this car is quite phenomenal
obviously I felt like Ghostbusters
without this remake already had a
phenomenal following and a phenomenal
fame across the world and ecto-1 is
right at the core of that but now with a
new film in full swing which is coming
out July eleventh by the way this is
just doubled in attention with everyone
being primed for the film and just eager
to take in the sight of this ekta one
cruising around the streets of London
one obvious slight difficulty with a car
like this is that it is an American car
from 30 years ago and with that it's the
size of a boat trying to thread it
through London streets is slightly
tricky
and with all the looks that you're
getting you can't really get away with
any mistakes so I'm trying to make sure
that this ecto-1 stays in pristine
condition right up to the movie premiere
and doesn't actually get dinged and
scratched by London's finest Cabot but I
kind of like the attention wearing this
boiler suit may have been stepped too
far but really that's just the kind of
person I am as famous screen cars go the
original ecto-1 was right up there with
the DeLorean kit and the General Lee so
it was vital to keep the legacy in the
new 2016 movie whether or not this car
will become as iconic as its predecessor
remains to be seen but for now we can
all rejoice that the Ghostbusters and
ecto-1 are back on the big screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
