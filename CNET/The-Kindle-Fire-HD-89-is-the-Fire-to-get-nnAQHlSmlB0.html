ambiguous Evan inch Fire HD it has the
same basic design with a front facing
camera volume rocker power button and
headphone jack micro HDMI and microUSB
the powerful clear speakers are still
located on the back the interface is the
same one used on the seven incher which
included many upgrades from the original
kindle fire check out the 7-inch kindle
fire HD first look or the full written
reviews of either kindle fire HD tablets
for details on some of those changes I
will say that the interface feels more
at home on the larger screen where the
big high-res icons are able to really
pop and more of the navigation tabs can
be seen without having to scroll also
the faster omap 4470 processor makes
navigating the sometimes very busy menus
much smoother and zippier than it was on
the seven incher the 8.9 inch screen has
a 1920 x 1080 resolution and this really
makes everything from magazines to book
text look that much crisper one new
addition since the fire HD s launch is
free time a downloadable app that allows
parents to set up parental control
profiles for the kids the content for
each profile can easily be limited and
even daily limits for each content type
can be set there's even a useful blue
background that lets parents know that
their kid is still using free time and
hasn't hacked his way into the full OS
3d games performance was good noba 3 ran
at a good clip as did need for speed
most wanted but Riptide it seems took a
bit of a dive in the framerate
Department the 4G version delivers
incredibly fast speeds even besting
Wi-Fi during certain tasks the fire HD
8.9 starts at two hundred and ninety
nine dollars for 16 gigabytes of storage
and three hundred and sixty nine dollars
for 32 gigabytes a 32 gigabyte version
with 4G LTE starts at 499 and 599 for 64
gigabytes those prices may seem pretty
high but there are actually pretty good
deals considering
what you're getting thanks to his great
performance and fantastic looking screen
this is the best kindle fire yet once
again this is eric franklin and this has
been a first look at the amazon kindle
fire HD 8.9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
