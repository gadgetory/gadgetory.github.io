that Chuck being honest with ourselves
is really important but sometimes we
tell ourselves little lies to justify
some behaviors I worked out really hard
so I can have that donut right sure my
credit card bills really high but I need
that new phone so for this top five
we're counting down the top 5 tech lies
that we tell ourselves at number five
selfies are okay selfies are so popular
that the word itself is now recognized
by the Oxford English Dictionary however
unless you're with the group or in front
of something amazing we all know you
took 30 different photos before you
posted that one selfie online you ever
walk by someone taking a selfie outside
well there's nothing special going on do
you know how silly this is they're
making faces that thing at number four
it's okay to reuse that password no it's
not okay to reuse that password you
think it's okay because what are the
odds that a site would be compromised
and your password would leak so why not
use that password again and again and
again it's a terrible idea
stop lying to yourself number three you
don't have to check your phone just
because it buzzed I've seen it all the
time phone buzzes on a dinner table and
your lovely dinner date you begin that
little dance you look at each other one
of you looks at the phone on the table
that's facedown and this continues until
one of you snaps usually me there is
some kind of sick compulsion to check
your phone when it buzzes why is the
buzz worse than a time I don't know
either but it is at number two you're
not a digital hoarder
you think you'll watch every movie and
TV show you have on your Netflix watch
list you think you'll try out every new
app you've downloaded you think you'll
play every steam game you pay for it
maybe even you use all those Groupons
yeah you're only fooling yourself there
will be a day when you do all those
things it's called a 30th of February
think about that one yeah I mean never
before we hit the number one tech lie
you tell yourself let's see what you had
to say that's right it's time to check
Twitter Jay said I need the removable
battery in my note 4 Colin says he lies
to himself when he says I'll do that
task and not just stare through
minder on my home screen all day and the
link says he lies when he says I say are
you serious for everything but I
actually don't thanks to everybody for
all of your dirty dirty lies on to
number one and the number one sec lie we
all tell ourselves is our private
information will stay private
you set your Facebook profile to private
and you think no one will ever see your
photos meant for a select few you texted
someone a picture that you'd be
embarrassed to see somewhere else yeah
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news
but it's almost impossible to scrub
something off the internet after it's
been on there it's like trying to get
food crawling out of water now to be
clear I'm not saying that people who
share photos of themselves are fair game
to hacks or unapprove sharing of photos
they're not we're all entitled to our
privacy what I'm saying is that
believing whatever you put online can be
private is one of the biggest lies we
tell ourselves I'm sorry there you have
it the top 5 tech lies we all tell
ourselves you agree or disagree let me
know on Twitter I'm at is for more top
fives like this visit top-5 to Netcom
thanks for watching and I'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
