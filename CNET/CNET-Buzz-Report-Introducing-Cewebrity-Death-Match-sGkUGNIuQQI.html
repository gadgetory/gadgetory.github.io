report this week a buzz report special
so web-ready deathmatch where people who
are famous on the internet fight on the
internet we've got an intense matchup
today but first let's get to some
headlines this week Apple iPhone owners
felt the uncomfortable sensation that
comes with knowing there's a kill switch
set to nuclear applications at a
moment's notice Steve Jobs himself
confirmed the security measure is hidden
inside the iphone luckily hackers
quickly posted a fix that lets you
deactivate the switch on a jailbroken
iphone funny how the iphone starts to
feel more and more like jail but if you
want to buy your way into jail it was
also announced that Best Buy will start
selling the iphone this September and
that should help ease the crowds at the
apple store so at least you won't have
to line up to get into jail that's just
embarrassing and finally twins cameron
and tyler winklevoss best known for
accusing mark zuckerberg of stealing the
idea for facebook from them are in the
rowing finals of the 2008 Beijing
Olympics and that's good news for them
since their Facebook lawsuit isn't going
so well but since there's no chance of
them messing with my ninja score I can
safely root for them to take home the
gold you go winklevosses okay and
speaking of conflict it's time for the
main event
please welcome sir Webber T deathmatch
co-host and color commentator brian Tong
looking for a good match today Abraham
you know I've refereed a tunnel price
life I have never seen anything like
this today's round pitches Andrew Barron
the founder of rocketboom against Jason
Calacanis founder a weblog zinc
publisher of engadget and now the CEO
the search engine Mahalo the two were
locked in vicious battle dishes battle
vicious battle on Twitter let's get
right into the fighting it starts early
the morning of August twelfth Andrew
Barron loves the first grenade
interesting I just noticed that mahalos
being completely flat for the last five
months but new growth that doesn't seem
too bad to me what do you think Brian
that's not too much just just a little
flesh catch scratchin thing a little bit
little scratch but calc canvas doesn't
like it he starts with statistics but
quickly moves on to attack mode thanks
for caring August is on track for a
record month that's the slowest month of
the year congrats on Daddy's investment
/ lawsuit in RB oh snaps what RV Jason
Calacanis of course referring here to
recent reports that Andrew berends
father loaned him money to start
rocketboom army then took his own son to
court to make him pay it back a low blow
some might say but oh he gets lower a
lot trust fund baby had your barrage
trying to start trouble with someone
like me who worked his way up why don't
you go suck on your daddy's tea baron
whoa did he just say teat I don't think
that's how you spell that no that's how
you spell teen along with a whole
facebook you got served Molly well it
was all downhill from there and a
one-sided battle it was barren responds
mildly just because I pointed out
mahalos flat growth for six months I
don't see why you're defending the site
but attacking me personally but calc
anas keeps the pressure on like a fat
lady on a little man you're here and
always will be Connie told me if Andrew
hates and let them hate and watch the
money pile up the good life welcome to
the
put your speakers on 11 and kiss my ass
I made mine he was giving yours word oh
my goodness Kanye's in Kanye's and it's
a triple threat match work no way I'm
super lazy and I've never done anything
in my life I just drink beers all day
and hang out on the tube clearly you've
done little but spend daddy's money
shouldn't you be getting another
graduate degree and nothing right about
now oh that hurts hit the guy right his
graduate degrees all over them like
white on rice 11 my speakers don't even
have an 11 Molly and finally calc Anna's
goes for the numbers kill to record
months in the last four months is not
flat August will be three out of five
recognize so please go back to begging
daddy for some more RV budget Oh give
him the pan died and finally Baron goes
for a job if you can even call it that
one final point unrelated to address
Jason calc anuses personal attacks he
has many sugar daddies that gave him
tons of cash to start Mahalo that's an
order for a chalupa with weak sauce
Molly well we've reached the end of our
match I gotta say Brian Cal Candace
comes off like a hyper-aggressive
wackadoodle here but when it comes to
celebrity deathmatch that's how you win
that's how you do it on cal hit it and
that's it for this week's show everyone
I'm Mollywood and this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching
