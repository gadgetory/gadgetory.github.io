the CES convention hall we're here at
the kind of gold parking lot this is
outside the north on we're going to show
you here we're here at Ford's vehicle to
vehicle detection system they're going
to show a demo off and we're just going
to show you two things that makes us
really cool this is kind of the future
coming to your cars but the first thing
that we want to talk about is a reveal
right you have these cars a situation
for example where you have three cars
driving down in a line now what happens
is we have a lead car down in the back
and you'll see it coming up a lot of
times if you have three cars in row and
you're that far back card you don't know
that there's actually one more car in
front of you all of a sudden car number
two peels out reveals that car and then
your car stops now what happens in this
detection system is that there's an
array of LED lights that warn you
there's an audible sound and also when
cars are near you there's a vibration
system in the seats to let you know
whether cars on your left side or your
right side so this is just one of those
cool examples here that they're
showcasing off the technology now Ford
is working on this in partnership with
eight other OEM so this is not just
specific to fort it's their driver
assistance system and so we're going to
want to do now is kind of show you we're
going to jump in the car maybe kind of
explain this a little more when we get
inside but let's just kind of go this
way guys this is cool stuff before we
hop in I just want to point out one
thing about this technology up here you
see the shark fin here now this is a
transmitter that transmits 10 times per
second instead it includes Wi-Fi and GPS
data and what this does is these this
system talks to other cars again it's
not manufactured specific it is still
being it's still in the works this is
not a prototype though this is getting
pushed forward and it all it takes is
for the National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration to push this
through as a standard but this is this
again this is not anything beta or a
hacked up project this is going and
moving forward and this is really the
future of cars across multiple
manufacturers so what we're gonna do now
is jump in this car and show you one
other demo to show you how this all
works ok so give us up we're gonna I'm
going to jump in the front Charlene
Sarah's gonna jump in the back so just
bear what's for a second we're gonna
load up ok guys
look I'm right look I can see you guys
still okay now i will do the talking
here Nick our driver he's going to be
you know he's here he needs to pay
attention to the road obviously so we're
going to check this out this is um I
guess this is a demo where if you're
driving at an intersection and you're
going to be at a stoplight you may not
see oncoming traffic so we're going to
do is we're here inside the car you
might be able to use a light sign on our
left side what happens is we can't see
anything on our right side because we're
being pretty much covered by a Penske
moving truck so we're gonna go give it a
second for this demo don't go on and
then you'll see how this all comes
together all right green means go ok so
here we go let's see what this looks
like I should buckle up to haha safety
first guys all right whoo there's some
speed
oh okay now you guys just saw that you
heard the audible noise I actually felt
that Rumble in my chair that's
indicating the driver to stop as well as
a LED array lights up to let you know
that you need to slow down so again this
is Ford's demo of their vehicle to
vehicle system you know detection system
warning system for drivers and again
just one of the cool demos you guys can
check out here at CES these are going to
be coming down the road there's no set
date right now again this has to be
approved to push through but this is a
standard that's coming a car soon and we
will check you guys out more of a CES
