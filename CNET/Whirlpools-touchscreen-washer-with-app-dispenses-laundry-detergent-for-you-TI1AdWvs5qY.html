we're taking a look at their new smart
front load washer and dryer so some
things look the same from washers and
dryers of days pass from whirlpool but
some things are different one thing that
I really like is the integrated touch
display on both of the models so this is
the companion washer and dryer unit and
for the washer they've also incorporated
the load and go system so that basically
means that your laundry detergent is
already inside in a larger tank so that
you don't have to constantly pour
detergent in and it just automatically
dispenses the correct amount for you
they've also updated the app so there's
a new enhanced stain guide so that if
you spill spaghetti sauce on your shirt
or mustard or some other kind of
horrible difficult to remove stain this
guide is supposed to help you through it
it also asks you for the actual fabric
so if you have silk or wool or cotton
what kind of poly blend it is and it's
supposed to give you a customized guide
basically to how to treat the stain that
the most effectively so these models are
pretty pricey they're gonna cost around
$1,500 each and they're due out later
this year but one thing I'm also really
excited about is the Alexa integration
so it's already worked with Alexa in the
past but you had to use the invocation
term asked whirlpool to do something now
you can just say hey Alexa
what's the status of my washer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
