hotel in Manhattan we're about to head
up to a roof to check out a sprint cell
tower and talk with the sprint executive
iya taurasi about his progress in 4G LTE
why it's taken so long to get LT here
let's check it out
we're on top of a building in New York
on fifty-seventh Street this right here
is a cabinet for Network Vision inside
it you will see equipment that's both 3g
and 4g two sets of spectrum 801 dot 9
and this basically is a cabinet that's
pre-built for lte-advanced it is the
cabinet that we use to launch our LTE
service and we're doing literally tens
of thousands of these around the country
a thousand plus in New York at the same
time this right here behind you is the
cabinet that is equipped today for wimax
40 and it's being upgraded as we speak
for LTE on the top 5 spectrum I asked
Ian why sprint is taking so long to
deploy 4G LTE in Paris in the
competition there's a lot to do we're
upgrading 3g we're upgrading 4G we're
integrating two flavors of 4G or are
creating the backhaul and at the same
time we're investing significant
capacity when we started this program a
couple of years ago we calculated that
there will still be a lot of 3g devices
customers were still carry a lot of 3G
and voice will still be on 3g things
like 900 testing have to be done we
upgrade the back call we upgrade the
equipment a lot of work now at the same
time we truly understand that customers
want the service and wants us to finish
as soon as possible and would like the
construction cone out of the highway as
soon as possible we recognize that and
no one at sprint understands it's better
than the network team and all the effort
energy or putting in to get through this
transition as soon as possible the
network rollout a big city like New York
is complicated but he odd said the
company's making progress 4G is coming
to New York this month we're announcing
today the Bronx and Brooklyn we feel
that enough deployment has happened in
these barros where you get to see 4g in
a lot more times and you're able to
expect it and see it and depend on it
however if you go anywhere else in New
York you'll see a lot of 4G active and
you're able to use it we're just not at
a point where we feel enough of it is
out there and these other boroughs that
we can tell you depend on it and see it
then expected for CNN news and Roger
Cheng
