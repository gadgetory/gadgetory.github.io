don't have any money that's why I love
hearing about what's free on PlayStation
and Xbox let's start October off with
free sony stuff PlayStation 4 owners
will get to play broken age the lovable
point-and-click action adventure game
starring Elijah Wood they'll also get
super meat boy a brutally tough
platforming game where you play as a
cube of meat both of those games are
going to be on Vita as well hitting both
the playstation 4 and ps3 is
unmechanical extended a lovely puzzler
that forces you to think outside the box
the music fighting mashup game kickbeat
will be available to ps3 and Vita owners
in October as well and speaking of
martial arts kung fu rabbit will also be
around for the same platforms in October
finally the physics-based couch co-op
game chariot will be available only for
the PlayStation 3 so let's switch gears
to Microsoft free games for xbox one
start off with valiant hearts the great
war it's an emotionally charged
narrative-driven story that will be
available all month long starting the
16th to the end of October xbox one and
360 owners will get access to the
walking dead season 1 which is of course
the gripping thriller from Telltale
Games xbox 360 owners can also play
metal gear solid 5 ground zeroes for
some phantom pain backstory and that'll
last only the first half of October that
does it that takes care of all of
october's free games as always a small
caveat you do of course need to be a
member of PlayStation Plus and xbox live
gold to access these free games and
these memberships they cost a little bit
of money but let's be honest they're
totally worth it that will do it for
this month I'll be back in the beginning
of november for a new list of free games
we'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
