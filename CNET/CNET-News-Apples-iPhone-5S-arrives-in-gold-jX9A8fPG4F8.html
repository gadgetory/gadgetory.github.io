high-grade aluminum with diamond-cut
chamfered edges perfectly matched glass
inlays the team is carefully considered
every detail to make this the most
beautiful phone ever made and it is the
gold standard in smartphones it comes in
three metal finishes silver gold and a
new Space Gray and there are so many
innovations inside it I'm going to tell
you about three major ones today the
first is performance we all want great
performance and our devices and the
iPhone 5s is a huge leap forward in
mobile computing performance it starts
with a brand new system on a chip from
Apple called a 7 a 7 is 64-bit this is
the first ever and a phone of any kind I
don't think the other guys we've been
talking about it yet there's a 64-bit
desktop class architecture that means we
can use a new modern instruction set an
arm instruction set that's more
efficient than the others use it has a
lot of great technology in it the number
that just stands out above all else
there's over a billion transistors in it
and this fits in a die that's about the
same size
it's the previous generation a6 it's
about twice as many transistors it's
remarkable you've heard a lot about iOS
7 but what we haven't told you yet is
it's also been completely re-engineered
for 64-bit at the same time there's
64-bit kernel libraries and drivers and
all the apps that come with your iPhone
5s they've been re-engineered to 64-bit
as well this will be an easy transition
for developers as we've updated our
tools with Xcode to support 64-bit so
they can make 32 and 64-bit apps easily
it runs OpenGL ES version 3.0 the latest
graphics standard
this means that graphic intense
applications can bring their console and
desktop level 64-bit graphics easily to
the iPhone platform now an Infinity
Blade 3 you play as two characters this
is ISA a spell thei warrior fief each of
these environments is huge extremely
detailed and filled with rich and
rewarding gameplay and each of these
areas is as big or bigger than the
entirety of the first Infinity Blade now
this is all running real time with each
of these complex environments being
loaded almost instantly that's over five
times faster than on an iPhone 5
now watch will literally just fade to
black unload this and boom load in an
entirely new world just like that we
have a completely new part in the iPhone
we call it m7 it works alongside a7
there's a motion coprocessor so what
does that do well it takes advantage of
all these great sensors and it
continually measures the data coming
from them without even having to wake up
the a7 chip and measures from the
accelerometer the gyroscope and the
compass and with new software and
applications you're gonna get a whole
new level of health and fitness
solutions never before possible on a
mobile phone the great team at Nike is
creating a new application called Nike
Plus move it's all about helping
athletes stay motivated to be fit and
active throughout their day it uses the
new m7 chip in core motion API as well
as GPS help keep track over the kind of
activities you're taking part in
throughout the day and where you're
doing it it gives you Nike Fuel points
and let you compete with friends over
Game Center all in service of having you
have a more healthy and active lifestyle
throughout your day it's really cool
what about battery life we're really
happy to tell you the team has done a
phenomenal job they do have battery life
that's equal or greater than the iPhone
5 had 10 hours 3G talktime eight hours
3G browsing 10 hours of LTE browsing
Wi-Fi browsing
video playback 40 hours of
music listening up to 250 hours of
standby so that's the first of our
breakthrough technologies in the iPhone
5s a 64-bit class architecture an
incredible performance of a7 and m7 it
starts with a 16 gigabyte configuration
at just 199 32 gigabytes a $2.99 the
massive 64 gigabytes at 399 again on a
standard two-year contract in addition
to that the team has made set of cases
that fit the character this phone so
well they're leather cases died in these
5 gorgeous colors just $39 each and is
also a beautiful product red one as well
it's really great like all of our
products it's really important that we
design iPhone 5s to be environmentally
friendly others don't talk about this
but we're going to continue to because
it matters so much arsenic-free display
glass mercury-free display BFR free PVC
free and highly recyclable with its
high-grade aluminum and glass so now
you've seen our two new phone lines
iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s the 5c and these
gorgeous new colors 5s these beautiful
metal finishes and packed with these
forward-thinking technologies the 5c
starts at just $99 the 5s at $1.99 we're
also going to keep a model of the iPhone
4s an 8 gigabyte configuration in the
line many carriers will be offering that
for free with their two-year contracts
so this is the first time we're
launching and rolling out two new lines
of iPhone so how are we going to do that
well starting on Friday September 13
that's this Friday you'll be able to
order the iPhone 5c pre-order it online
then a week later September 20th let's
start there to purchase both the iPhone
5c and the iPhone 5s and channels in the
United States Australia Canada China
France Germany Japan Singapore and the
United Kingdom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
