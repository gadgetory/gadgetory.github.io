reality since pretty much the very
beginning and they mostly just have
consumer headsets except for the
enterprise level of HTC vive Pro now
they're going to get harder Enterprise
with a new headset the HTC vive focus
the vibe focus might be new to the US
but it's actually been available in
China since late last year and it's
actually one of the easiest to use and
where VR headsets I've ever used put it
on is kind of like just wearing a hat
you put it on and there's just a tiny
strap in the back to adjust tension and
you're done it's on it's comfortable and
it's lightweight the vibe focus might be
new for international markets and the US
as an enterprise device but its stats
haven't changed since its original
release that of course includes at 28 80
by 1600 display between both eyes a
snapdragon 835 processor and up to three
hours of battery life most importantly
it's a standalone headset which means
there are no wires and no needed PC to
run it the entire VR experience is in
this one single device in fact it's so
good it's almost a shame that the US
release of this is purely enterprise in
fact all the demos we tried with the
focus so far our enterprise and training
focus specifically we did a demo that
taught construction workers to make sure
to wear their hat and be safe while on
the construction site as well as a
training exercise for Volkswagen workers
to make sure they know how to scan on
their ID and sort parts into the
appropriate bins there was one gaming
experience however but it wasn't
directly to the end-user its enterprise
as well a company called modal was
showing off a simple racing slash
dodging game that's not designed for
people to download and play at home but
it's designed to be installed in our
case but HTC wants to take that to the
next level which is why they also
announced today a vibe focused developer
kit that has
to six degree of freedom tracking
controllers giving the standalone device
capabilities more close to that of the
original HTC vive there's no word on
when that more advanced version of the
bio focus will be available but the
regular version will be available to
developers starting now for $5.99 and to
enterprise customers for 740 miles
there we go
