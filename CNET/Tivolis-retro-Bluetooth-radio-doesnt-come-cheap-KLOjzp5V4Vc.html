for cnet.com and I'm here with the
typically Audio pal BT that V T stands
for Bluetooth and this pal radio has
been around for a long time it's one of
my favourite portable radios it has a
built-in lithium ion rechargeable
battery and gives you about 16 hours of
battery life and now typically has added
bluetooth streaming capabilities to it
the only issue I had with it was its
price tag it cost $300 that's a lot of
money to pay for a portable speaker the
step down pal without bluetooth is $220
this one sounds basically identical to
that model with the bluetooth streaming
it's pretty decent it does sound
slightly can this is a mono speaker and
it sounds a little bit restrained but it
sounds good for a Bluetooth speaker and
there's a lot more competition in this
price range right now you have the bose
soundlink bluetooth mobile speaker 2
here at $300 as well as the jawbone big
jambox
so this just isn't a good value at this
price it is a good speaker however a
couple of other features worth
mentioning this does have a retractable
antenna it does hideaway in the back and
there is an auxilary input if you want
to connect a non-blue 2 device to this
as well as a headphone jack so you can
plug in a headphone to this speaker it
does come in a few different colors and
has that interesting retro designed to
it with a analog dial on the front when
you are pairing with bluetooth you
simply turn the knob to the BT and the
speaker goes into pairing mode and one
of the nice things is that when you do
turn the speaker back on into Bluetooth
mode it does remember your device and
it'll repair automatically if you're
within range that's really all there is
to it really the only drawback to the
speaker is the price otherwise it is a
nice speaker and it still is one of my
favourite speakers but it's just a
little hard to recommend at $300 I'm
David Carr noise and as the Tivoli audio
pal
