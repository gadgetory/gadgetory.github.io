on Amazon I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update say goodbye to Facebook
gifts you may have seen prompts to buy a
gift when your friend is having a
birthday you can purchase a gift card
that they can redeem digitally but the
gift shop will officially closed on
August twelfth it's not the first time
Facebook has tried its hand with
shopping back in 2012 you could buy
actual physical gifts like teddy bears
and chocolates and have it mailed to
your friends but that ended about a year
ago it seems the gift cards are not very
popular either but Facebook is putting
more focus on helping advertisers sell
things right from inside a post using a
Buy button so maybe in the future you
could see an ad in your newsfeed to buy
a gift card when your friend is having a
birthday speaking of online shopping
amazon is trying something new with
Prime members prime is a subscription
service that costs one hundred dollars a
year and it comes with several perks
including free two-day shipping but if
you choose not to use two day shipping
and instead wait longer for a package to
arrive amazon will reward you with one
dollar free in credit to spend on a
digital video purchase this new option
is called no rush shipping which takes
five to seven business days it seems
like this new incentive is to help ease
some of the financial burden of the
prime freebies because last week amazon
reported a second-quarter loss of 126
million dollars xbox one owners will
have a new option for getting the latest
games Electronic Arts has launched EA
access it's a Netflix like subscription
service for some EA games it costs five
dollars a month or thirty dollars a year
it's being rolled out as a beta test now
to some users but it will launch for
everyone soon the subscription also gets
members ten percent off purchases of EA
digital content and members get access
to free trials of new EA games up to
five days before the release date if
this is successful you could be seen
something similar offered by other
publishers the industry rather sell you
digital subscriptions than
you buy a used disk at gamestop which
makes them no money and while you're not
playing games you'll want to check out
the updated linkedin mobile app profiles
have been redesigned to make it easy to
scan information about a person right up
top you can see what you have in common
with another person like the people you
both know or your interests it's also
easier now for you to make changes to
your own profile on the app and you'll
know how other users found you under
who's viewed your profile you can see
people did a search for your name that's
your tech news update you can find more
