look at the new 2013 version of Apple's
13-inch MacBook Air now of course this
looks a lot like the 2012 version even
kind of the one before that the big
differences this year are on the inside
three main points to keep in mind the
first and most important one is that
this guy moves into Intel's new
fourth-generation core i series cpus you
might have heard of them under the
codename as well and that means faster
application performance although you
know most consumers don't really need
their CPUs to be that much faster more
importantly you get better battery life
apple claims of this guy is going to run
for 12 hours without needing a recharge
and based on some of the early Haswell
laptop some other PC makers that we've
tested those battery life tests came
back really impressively so there's
certainly a very good chance that we
will at least get close to that 12 hours
of promise battery life from this new
guy once we finally get around to
testing it you also get an upgrade in
the wireless 280 to dot 11ac of course
you're going to need one of the new
faster routers and Apple has this built
into some of their hardware as well in
order to take advantage of that but it's
a good way to sort of future proof your
setup and apple claims that the flash
stores are using is also faster than the
previous generation I think that the
upgrade or update to the macbook air
that I like the most is that they've
taken this 13-inch model and it now
starts at ten ninety nine which is a
hundred dollars off for last year's
model and that means you've got two
pretty decent choices now you can get
the 11 inch model for 999 and that
actually includes a 128 gig SSD while as
the previous version only at a 64 gig
one still so they finally move that up
to 128 or for 1099 you can move up to
this guy the 13-inch MacBook Air and
even though it doesn't have a lot of the
high-end features that we'd kind of like
like a Retina screen or edge-to-edge
glass over the display or a touchscreen
it's still one of the most universally
useful laptops you can get and now it's
a hundred dollars less i'm dan ackerman
and that is the 2013 apple 13-inch
macbook air
