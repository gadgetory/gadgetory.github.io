HTC phone but can't afford the luxurious
flagship One m8 cast your eyes over at
the Desire 610 it's a four point seven
inch plastic bodied android kitkat phone
that comes with a much more affordable
price tag
the 6/10 plastic body is nowhere near as
sleek and stylish as its all-metal big
brother but it feels nice and firm and
the navy blue color doesn't look too bad
either
like most of HTC's phones it has the
dual front-facing boom sound speakers
above and below the screen that provide
a decent volume for your podcasts or TV
shows one thing I'm not keen on is the
fake black bezel that surrounds the
screen makes the display look rather
squashed in and means the body is fatter
than it really needs to be I actually
found it quite difficult to use in one
hand the display itself has a
disappointing 960 by 540 pixel
resolution which is lower than you get
from the 4G motorola moto G which is bad
news when you consider how much cheaper
the Moto G is it's not particularly
bright either which can make it awkward
to use under bright sunlight it arrives
have Android 4.4.2 kitkat onboard over
which HTC has slapped its sense 6
interface I quite like sin sticks at its
clean minimalist interface is simple to
navigate and easy for even Android
newbies to get to grips with you'll find
the blinkfeed news aggregator off to the
side of a home screens but you can get
rid of it if you're not keen it's
powered by a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor which while not exactly
lightning fast has enough power to
manage for critical tweeting Facebook
trolly and Netflix streaming if actually
didn't put up a brilliant fight in my
test but with fairly careful use you
should be able to get a day out of it on
the back is an 8 megapixel camera which
I found to be mostly decent but could be
a bit hit-and-miss depending on
conditions it's simple interface is easy
to use though and is at least good
enough for some cool Facebook snaps
although the Desire 610 does come with
an affordable price tag its uninspiring
specs in particular its low resolution
display means it's still not cheap
enough it offers very little over the
Motorola MOTO G which also has Android
KitKat and a quad-core processor but has
a higher resolution
and a much cheaper price tag unless you
desperately want the boom stand speakers
all the slightly better camera the moto
G is the much more sensible option

HTC Desire 610</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
