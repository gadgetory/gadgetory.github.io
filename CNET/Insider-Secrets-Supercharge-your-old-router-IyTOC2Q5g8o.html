old Linksys wrt54g s just lying around
now but rather than ditch it I'm gonna
give it some new life with new
third-party firmware it's pretty easy
I'm Tom Wright from cnet.com I'll show
you how to do it on today's inside your
secrets every router like this one has
software that runs on it and what we're
talking about is changing that software
from the factory default to an
open-source version and whether you're
replacing your old router or you're just
frustrated with your new one there are a
few reasons you might want to do this my
links is here can only act as an access
point for turning my internet into
Wireless then the Tomato firmware that's
the firmware I'm gonna put on here will
allow it to act as a bridge allowing
machines in my house that don't have
Wi-Fi access to the network wirelessly
it can also act as a site survey tool
giving me the strengths of nearby
networks and letting me know which
frequencies they occupy now in a crowded
neighborhood this can help you reduce
interference on your network
tremendously tomatoe also has a
bandwidth usage monitor if your ISP has
a cap on bandwidth this is indispensable
and telling if you're close to the cap
there are also other features like
wake-on-lan static dhcp and more so how
do you do it well there are many
third-party firmware out there some work
better with specific routers look around
a dd-wrt free wrt Tarifa and others to
find one that works with your router I'm
going to use tomato which says it works
with the Linksys wrt54g s versions 1
through versions 4 look underneath your
router for a serial number or more
specific model number to match it up
then download the firmware extract it to
a folder read the readme file to
determine which file goes with your
router then connect your router to your
computer open the routers admin screen
as described in your manual or just look
it up on a search engine click
administration click firmware upgrade
select and upload the correct firmware
for your router you're going to want to
wait for about two minutes while the
firmware is uploaded and flashed then it
should reload
to the tomato screen now tomato advises
you you may want to reset the settings
to default to avoid any minor
incompatibilities between the Linksys
firmware and the tomato firmware also
probably want to browse around the FAQ
at polar cloud comm for more info on how
to use the new firmware that's it for
this insider secret I'm Tom Merritt
