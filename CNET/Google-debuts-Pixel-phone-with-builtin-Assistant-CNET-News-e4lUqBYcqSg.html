to a new phone made by we call it pixel
we designed everything about pixel from
the industrial design to the user
experience everything is simple and easy
to use
something Google has always stood for I
really love how this phone looks and
feels the rear glass creates a bold
iconic element that gives pixel
personality and character the polished
aluminum case gives the phone a distinct
look and there's a subtle wedge from the
top to bottom that keeps it thin where
your hand most naturally grips it and
there's no unsightly camera bump let's
switch to a demo the first thing you'll
see with a new pixel launcher is round
icons access to all of your apps just to
swipe away and a clean polished look
show me my photos from last October it's
pretty cool right with a quick voice
command my assistant found just the
right pictures from a google photos
collection and it doesn't just work with
dates you can search for people places
and things to show me upcoming events at
the Greek Theatre in Berkeley so let's
talk about what just happened there not
only did the assistant recognize the
venue I asked about but it was able to
serve up relevant information thanks to
Google's knowledge graph play me a song
by the Lumineers playing music now the
assistant knows I like to listen to
music on YouTube so that's the app it
opens up watch this the assistant can
also help get information based on
what's on my screen so I'll do the same
long press gesture on home and then
swipe up to get contextually relevant
information
so here's what just happened the
assistant recognized the restaurant and
lisas text message and assembled all
this useful information into a single
card from the apps I have installed on
the phone there's actually industry
group DxO mark that rates camera quality
and almost all popular DSLR and
smartphone cameras on the market so let
me just put that score into context this
isn't only the best camera we've ever
made it's the best smartphone camera
anyone has ever made
for instance smart burst is a feature
that lets you capture just the right
moment by holding down the shutter
button you can capture a continuous
stream of images and let Google
intelligence select the sharpest
clearest photo of just the right moment
and then there's HDR plus it's built to
work in any light so you get clear vivid
pictures as in this example preserving
both the dimly lit people in the
foreground and the beautiful sunset
behind them and finally my favorite
feature are incredible video
stabilization it means that videos turn
out smooth even if you're not so let me
tell you how this video is captured we
mounted two cameras side-by-side hit
record on each and then started walking
the one on the left has video
stabilization turned off the one on the
right has it on just look at the
difference this works by sampling the
gyroscopes at 200 times a second to
figure out exactly how the camera is
moving even even accounting for the
rolling shutter and instantaneously
compensating each part of the image so
you can avoid that jello effect you see
with other forms of image stabilization
so as a special bonus for pixel owners
we're including free unlimited storage
for photos and videos at original
quality that's all your photos and
videos at full resolution including the
rich 4k videos you can take with this
phone finally pixel comes in two sizes a
five inch and a 5.5 inch display all the
great features you've heard about today
work on both
and both of these sizes come with all of
these amazing hardware specs pixel is
available in three colors descriptively
named quite black very silver and a
limited edition really blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
