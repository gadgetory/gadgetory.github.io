and I'm standing next to the Dyson dc40
origin vacuum I know that the Jetsons
had a robot vacuum because after all
Rosie had enough to do with her free
time which was none but if they had had
an upright vacuum I think it would look
something like a Dyson with this really
sleek design and the bright colors this
is an attractive looking vacuum as you
can see and Dyson has put a lot of
thought into the outward design however
some of the design elements that make it
a really attractive looking vacuum are
the very things that give us pause in
terms of durability as we mentioned in
the review and I know Ryan talked about
it when he discussed the DC 41 animal
there are some concerns with locking
upward and the rear axles that we worry
may not be durable enough to withstand a
lot of use if your family is anything
like my family where the vacuum tends to
the get carted up and down the stairs
bumping against everyone every time
that said I really like the rollerball
in that it offers the DC 40 as well as
other Dyson products a lot of
maneuverability the ORAC touch bagless
has similar maneuverability and while I
found it easier to steer overall it was
a lot heavier to use so the DC 40 might
be a really good option if you need a
lightweight vacuum that performs well
but is also easy to push around and easy
to get around your furniture I know that
my grandparents in particular would
probably find this really easy to use
it's a good performer there are better
and there are better for less money
which is what it really comes down to
it's a nice vacuum but it's lacking and
a lot of extra features and it doesn't
have the stellar performance that I
would expect from a Dyson's product
based on the brand's reputation so if
you're looking for a vacuum that
performs well but is equally
maneuverable I would look at the $199
shark rotator Pro lift-away but if
you're looking for something more sturdy
kind of like the vacuum you grew up with
the Electrolux precision brushroll clean
is a really great option that's what the
DC 40 is a good vacuum and if you have
it in your home you're probably happy
with it
first thing that I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
