button but it's not a button that's
right no more clicks on the new HTC u12
plus the sleep/wake button and the
volume up/down buttons are nothing more
than haptic feedback illusions Apple did
something similar when it replaced the
home button on the iPhone 7 and 7 plus
with a touch sensitive area that
simulates the look and feel of a real
button but HTC has taken it a step
farther and replaced all of its buttons
when the phone is powered off the
sleep/wake button still works
apparently the digital button requires
so little power that it will work on a
dead battery getting rid of mechanical
buttons reduces the risk of a part
breaking and it allows the phone to have
a dust and water resistance rating of
ip68 then there's a left and right sides
of the you 12 Plus which are squeezable
much like last year's u 11 and Google
pixel to which HTC manufactured HTC's
squeezed technology gets an upgrade now
you can squeeze short squeeze long or
squeeze and hold each squeeze triggers a
different action which you can customize
you can have it open an app turn the
flashlight on or open the camera and
take a picture among other things the
sides of the phone are touch sensitive
which ATTC calls edge since 2 they can
receive tap for input for example you
can tap with your thumb and index finger
to minimize the screen for one-handed
use the you 12 plus can even tell which
hand you're holding it with and offset
the shrunken display accordingly the you
12 plus comes with four cameras two on
the front and two on the back both
enable boquete mode which lets you take
portraits of people with a blurry
background you can adjust the focus
point before or after you take a picture
to change the blur the rear camera also
has a 2 X optical zoom and a nifty
feature called sonic zoom during video
recording it uses the four microphones
to focus in on your subject as you zoom
in for better audio the u12 plus shoots
HD and 4k video at 30 and 60 frames per
second it also shoots slow-motion video
at 240 frames per second in 1080p the
u12 plus has an 18 by 9 6 inch quad HD
display with minimal bezels and no
not the fingerprint readers on the back
it runs on a snapdragon 845 processor
with 6 gigabytes of RAM and it comes in
either 64 or 120 gigabytes of storage
the phone comes in three colors flame
red which looks like Iron Man's armor
ceramic black which isn't actually made
of ceramic it's still Gorilla Glass and
translucent blue which allows you to
actually see the inside of your phone
the HTC u12 plus is available for
pre-order now and will tip in mid June
in the US the 64 gigabyte model costs
$7.99 and the 128 gigabyte model 849</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
