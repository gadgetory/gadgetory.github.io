to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week I phones on the loose a high
five and a what what for the Department
of Justice and when there's no more room
in tech Hell the Dead will walk the
earth but let's begin with the gadje of
the week the gadget of the week is the
samsung galaxy s2 epic 4g touch yes it
was announced this week for AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile and Sprint where it will be
known simply as the samsung epic 4g
touch anyway the samsung galaxy two epic
4g touch pad pad has a 4g support 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor a
rear-facing 8 megapixel camera that
takes HD video a ten percent bigger
battery and a Super AMOLED touchscreen
plus the samsung galaxy two epic 4g
touch 3d hurricane will run the latest
version of gingerbread with samsung's
custom TouchWiz interface on it and it
will include a bunch of new enterprise
features the ability to connect to your
computer and other devices over Wi-Fi
for like Wireless transferring and
texting more voice command support and
you can even take screenshots on the
phone finally awesome the samsung galaxy
two epic 4g touch hypnotized Firedancer
flying squirrel honey badger has almost
as many features as it has words in its
name and now for the news top story of
the week the US Justice Department also
hates AT&amp;amp;T or at least it hates the idea
of the 18 t t-mobile merger just like
the rest of us the DOJ filed a lawsuit
this week to block the proposed 39
billion-dollar merger the agency said
that merger would substantially damaged
wireless competition it would lead to
higher prices worst service and less
innovation especially in rural areas and
for low-income customers and the DOJ
gave a nice little present to t-mobile
saying that they had been totally good
for competition because their innovative
and spunky and they had the first
android phone and the first high-speed
data network man it's almost like the
DOJ has been listening in on our
conversations about the merger and
reading our
tweets and emails and stuff and just
this one time I'm totally cool with that
but do not call this story over not by a
long shot because don't forget if this
merger doesn't go through AT&amp;amp;T has to
pay t-mobile three billion dollars in
cash plus spectrum and Airwaves deals
that add up to a total break up package
of about seven billion dollars so don't
look for ATT to go away quietly I mean
when do they ever and other top news
this week apparently another iphone
prototype was left in a bar this time in
San Francisco no I'm not joking we have
no idea if it was an iphone 5 prototype
or some other iphone what version of iOS
it was running or any other specs we
only know that it was taken from a
Mexican restaurant and bar it might have
been sold on craigslist for two hundred
dollars and when the police tried to
find my iphone feature on it they
tracked it to a house searched the place
and couldn't find it and then the guy
who lived there said he didn't know
anything about it even when Apple
employees reportedly offered him cash on
the spot for the phone back no questions
asked I love this story and it kind of
just goes to show that Apple employees
are human too I mean they get wasted and
lose their phones and bars just like the
rest of us does anyone have an advil or
my phone I need my phone also this week
the HP TouchPad tablet or zombie after
HP sold thousands hundreds of thousands
of touch pads in a $99 fire sale earlier
this month the company announced it will
manufacture just a few more touch pads
and sell them for the same price except
at retail stores where they can price it
whatever they want and then after that
though then webOS and the tablets are
dead for real except that there's a
software update coming for webos for all
you knew touchpad owners so it'll get
better and then of course there were
rumors that Samsung might buy webOS and
then you have the executive vice
president of HP's PC group which may or
may not get spun off telling the press
that sure HP might totally get back into
the tablet game all I know is this time
I'm getting one of those 19
dollar touch pads and I really hope it
doesn't eat my brain the way it
apparently eight Leo Apotheker spring
and finally speaking of doom let's have
a look at what's clogging the tubes the
Cornell creative machines lab posted
this video on YouTube that they say is
what happened when they hooked an
artificial intelligence chat bot up to
itself and then let it have a
conversation with itself prepare to
panic I am the report yes I'm not
together they're robots I'm not a robot
I'm a unicorn what is God to you not
everything not everything could also be
something for example not everything
could be half of something which is
still something and therefore not
nothing very true I would like to
imagine it is odd you say you are not
helpful therefore you're a meaning how
you say it or team that does not make
sense so do you want to have a body sure
or if one you should really go watch the
whole video at youtube but I think the
first comment are there pretty much
nailed it quote so when you let robots
talk to each other they instantly
identify their own kind start discussing
God and their wish to have physical
bodies yeah let's not do this again end
quote and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm Hollywood and
thank you for watching
can we go full this this this feels like
it should be a Ron Burgundy moment I can
we go full screen on some hayseed so I
can just do a pickup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
