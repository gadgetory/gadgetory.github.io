crave and here's what's happening this
week on CNET's crave wha just wanted to
put a friendly reminder out there that
you can see the Lexus hoverboard in
action
August 5th according to a short video
posted on Tuesday by the luxury car
manufacturer Lexus released a 19 second
video showing off a little more footage
of the breakthrough hoverboard along
with a short video featuring
professional skateboarder Ross Bergeron
who is also credited in the video as a
hoverboard test rider
make sure you put a reminder in your
phone August 5th Siri remind me August
5th about the Lexus hoverboard coming
out ever wonder how do they launch a
nuclear weapon well physicist Derek
Muller was able to get a walkthrough of
the process for his educational youtube
channel veritasium I probably said that
name wrong Muller was invited to tour
the tiny missile silo in Arizona which
at one time housed a nine Megaton
thermonuclear warhead which was 650
times more powerful than the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima the video is right
three two one
turn keys and hold green light turns on
says launch enabled
for all intents and purposes that should
say welcome to World War 3
it'll slide through security radar beam
it's that I'll peel off prevention start
and we'll build up trust pop the hold on
bolts off you go
nASA has released a copy of their golden
record on Soundcloud which contains all
the sounds they sent into space along
with the twin Voyager 1 in two missions
in 1977 the sounds were recorded onto a
12-inch phonograph disc made from copper
plated in gold nASA released the entire
recording this week which includes
everyday sounds we hear here on earth
like a dog barking crickets and frogs a
train and of course a mother kissing her
child you can listen to the entire album
at soundcloud.com slash NASA now you can
take a Google Streetview style tour of
the International Space Station the
European Space Agency posted a bunch of
high-res photos from inside the
International Space Station that have
been stitched together seamlessly in a
way so that users can move around within
the modules you were able to zoom in
spin around
move forward and navigate around the ISS
using a map on the right hand side if
you're using full screen mode you can
get a good glimpse at what life might be
like aboard the ISS ESA astronaut
Samantha Christopher Eddie took tons of
photos during her 199 days aboard the
orbiting laboratory and thanks to her
efforts we can now view what the space
station was like during June of 2015
when she took most of the photos there
she is the virtual tour was improved
with the help of Thomas Rauscher of
Vienna Austria who carefully stitched
the images together for some of the
modules
