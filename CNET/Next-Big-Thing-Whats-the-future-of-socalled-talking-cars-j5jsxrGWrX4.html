about so-called talking cars it's got a
tour of a lab where automakers and
government researchers team up to create
new technologies that help cars
communicate with the world around them
and with each other they can tell you if
an oncoming vehicle is about to run a
red light or if a car is coming around a
blind corner or if a detour would help
you save some time and gas
this gives cars our 360 degree awareness
of nearby vehicles common navigation
systems are not precise enough we needed
a localization that can give us exact
position on a centimeter base the system
can also alert drivers to approaching
emergency vehicles if a crash is
detected emergency crews can be
dispatched drivers can be diverted
immediately to alternate routes each
traffic light has to be correctly
identified in the oil weather and
lighting conditions this car is stopped
the car two vehicles behind it can't
tell because of traffic in the middle
but thanks to vehicle to vehicle
communication the driver in the back
it's a warning to break even though he
couldn't have seen it humanely
the technology is called DSRC dedicated
short range communications it gives
vehicles a new built-in radio if you
will that operates in the 5.9 gigahertz
band and allows them to communicate to
each other in a very specific way to
tell each other where they are the
direction they're heading and the speed
they're going it's largely focused on
preventing accidents a bi research for
example predicts that about 10% of new
cars shipping will have the SRC by 2018
and that goes up to 70% by 2027 some
pretty good numbers in the United States
as of February 2014 the Department of
Transportation announced that it will
announce a pending date soon by which
all new cars must ship with DSRC radios
enabled the goal 70 to 80% reduction in
accidents in Europe it's even more
ambitious they're looking for a 100
percent accident free zone by 2050
thanks to DSRC but specifically how
would these DSRC enabled talking cars
get to those lofty goals well let's
consider some of the scenarios that have
been tested at the University of
Michigan's safety pilot program in Ann
Arbor Michigan intersections cars at all
four directions would signal their
position and preceding movement to each
other to avoid collisions t-bones and
right-of-way screw-ups rear-end
collisions the DSRC equipped car in
front of you would always tell your DSRC
equipped car that it's stopping and how
fast it's doing so passing oncoming cars
would signal their direction and closing
speed to your car so you'd always know
when it's mathematically disastrous to
try and pass ending the crude
white-knuckle guesses that human drivers
make all the time pedestrians and bikes
DSRC radios could also be pocketable or
even integrated into future smart phones
to make pedestrians and bikes part of
this crash avoidance scenario as well
now all the above can be manifested in
two major ways active and passive
technology active technology means the
information from DSRC is sent to the
cars computers which control braking
acceleration and even steering to
automatically avoid a collision passive
of course merely gives the driver
indications on the dash about what's
about to happen that they want to avoid
to alert them to do so the nice thing
about passive is it could conceivably be
retrofitted
millions of cars already on the road now
beyond the enormous accident reduction
goals there's another benefit to DSRC
and that is increased efficiency of fuel
consumption and roadway usage through
several means the first of which is to
communicate traffic phase and timing to
cars the DSRC information would tell the
car how long the current traffic light
collar will be in effect and when it
will change allowing the car to adjust
its trajectory for best traffic flow
fuel usage and momentum conservation and
linking where our private cars would
form on the freeway for example little
ad hoc road trains following each other
as little as maybe three feet nose to
tail which makes vastly better usage of
the existing road infrastructure we have
and also could gain some nice
aerodynamic benefits for the cars in
that train now the hurdles first of all
we're talking with the car industry here
so you know proprietary is part of the
game that needs to be overcome because
DSRC is one of those things that will
benefit most by working out spectrum
bandwidth and coding to be global and
universal in markets around the world
spectrum DSRC in cars is in a bit of a
spectrum battle with another technology
innovation called uni I wear wireless
carriers want to open up a lot more
Wi-Fi that they would use for
smartphones to move their data traffic
to but it's also in that 5.9 gigahertz
band automakers don't like the idea of
sharing any wireless space with another
service like that they're afraid it's
gonna lead to breakdowns in cars keeping
themselves safe they don't like the
liability or the bad PR that could come
from that for their part the wireless
carriers say look we can learn to work
with you and make sure that our wireless
traffic always yields to automotive
traffic to make that top priority the
FCC is gonna have to decide that one
infrastructure many of DSR sees benefits
like traffic signal phase and timing
would require traffic signal and control
center upgrades by perineal II broke
municipalities there's the fleet issue
DSRC is gonna work best when virtually
all cars have it but we have a half a
billion cars already on the road in the
US and the EU alone that don't have it
it will take decades or generations to
turn them over DSRC is often described
as a moonshot and that's not overstating
it it would dramatically change the
relationship between cars on the road
toward the goal of safety as well as
efficiency of road
and fuel consumption and it would
certainly do a much better job than
almost all scenarios of the often bored
distracted ill-trained or drunk vague
where we know as the human driver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
