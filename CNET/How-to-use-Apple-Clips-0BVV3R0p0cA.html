Apple's first crack at a video editor
for your social apps or your phone clips
looks like Instagram or snapchat or
other phone apps to some degree it's not
a social network though it's an editor
for your clips hence the name clips it's
free and it works with iPads or iPhones
or even the iPod Touch here's how you
make a video you can record video
directly into clips you could just
record an eclipse just like that right
now and just put your score video in
there but I recommend you use your
library instead pre-recorded photos and
video can be cropped and inserted into
new videos keeping the original safe
still photos can be turned into clips by
pressing and holding how many seconds
you want them added for older video
clips it's the same thing you hold and
record how much you want to add then you
can re-edit your clips later don't worry
about your finished product it can all
be edited individual clips can be edited
or dragged around in any order effects
and filters can be added afterwards the
whole project can be tweaked as much as
needed before sharing live titles are
Clips best feature you can talk as you
record a clip into Clips and whatever
you say can be transcribed into text
captions that time up perfectly with
when you said it but with Scott thinking
when this photo is taken
we'll never know you can turn off your
original record audio and leave just the
text or edit the text later live titles
come in a variety of styles all the
videos though are square Clips makes
everything square this must be easier to
share on phones but frame your photos
and videos accordingly and be ready for
them to look a little weird on all TV
add a soundtrack by tapping the music
icon and picking one of Apple's included
tracks which fit the length of your
project automatically or you can pick
something from your music library
the soundtrack layers over the whole
project though so pick carefully share
clips by tapping the share button on the
bottom and you can pick where you want
to send it or you just save it to your
photo library and figure it out later
what does a clips video look like welp
see for yourself
that's how to use clips
in clips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
