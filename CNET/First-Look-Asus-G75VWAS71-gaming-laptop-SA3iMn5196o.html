gaming laptops I'm still not sure if I
do if you do then perhaps you'd be
interested in this which is the Asus g75
in their high-end gaming laptop branded
under the republic of gamers tag now
there are a number of other big gaming
laptop manufacturers you got origin main
gear alienware and these things are all
gigantic you know they're about 9 pounds
plus they're very heavy they're loaded
to the gills very powerful very
expensive and what asus laptop brings to
the table is a lower price in general
this comes in around 1,600 1,500
depending on where you find it but it's
not as stacked specs wise is what you'd
find on one of those super high-end
alienware origin laptops this is still
no slacker it's got a quad core i7
processor 3rd gen intel so that
ivybridge new generation processor
nvidia geforce gtx 660 graphics which
are very very good but you can tell
doing a sponge mark side to side that
this thing is not a screamer gaming wise
but it's going to provide you some great
mainstream gaming performance at 1080p
speaking of which the 17 inch screen has
a really nice display its matte which is
not the normal but it's becoming more
standard in laptops once again and it's
nice and bright and looks good for both
blu-rays and games yes this does come
with a blu-ray drive and one of the nice
bump ups from last year's model is in
ports and that's going to happen with a
lot of Ivy Bridge laptops because USB 3
is better supported this has three USB
3.0 ports and Thunderbolt so that really
amps up the speed of your data
connections now you wouldn't guess it
from a laptop this big but it's actually
slimmer and lighter than last year's
it's still nine point five pounds and
about two inches thick at its thickest
point so it's not something you're going
to tuck away into your bag easily but
we'll take what we can get overall it's
a good laptop it's a very good laptop
specs wise but if you want something
that's all the way at the top of the
line you might want to consider
investing a little bit more or ask
yourself do you really need a gaming
laptop with this much under the hood for
that much money
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
asus g75vw gaming laptop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
