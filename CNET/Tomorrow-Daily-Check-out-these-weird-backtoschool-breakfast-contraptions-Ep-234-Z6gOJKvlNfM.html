creates new ways to eat breakfast and
kill and I discuss our favorite things
at PAX Prime 2015 sera daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley skele join me as always pip boy
kalyan onimous it's time for the purge I
hope you're ready I'd that I'm actually
a little freaked out by your fire visage
the last I moved the more scary it is
that is actually really accurate anyway
anyway get right to it I think we should
talk about pax prime at the
headlines all right that's a terrifying
mask is I look I'm the biggest fall
outfit in the world but leaving when I
got that I was like well probably not
gonna wear that very often yeah I was
scared to bring it like to the airport I
thought the airport was gonna stop me
and be like oh no you can't have this on
the plane you're too scared this is ted
kennedy stuff ken okay so pax prime
which is a giant convention for gamers
happen in Washington there's several
packs of that happen at different point
East Australia all kinds place but
there's a big one big PAX Prime and you
get to demo a whole bunch of new games
not like incredibly far in the future
but some new games and then also there's
panels of your favorite YouTube
celebrities there's parties like it's
it's just everything's a big celebration
yeah we discussed it it was kales into
it last week and we discussed like
basically this is like the big
convention to go to if you're a gamer
and you don't go to e3 or you can't go
to e3 so I think there are 70,000 people
they said that was like the estimate of
attendees so I was a huge show some
homeless guy told me it was a hundred
thousand I he also you know maybe he
pigeons were trying to kill him that's
true oh also may be true so I so uh some
of the stuff that you saw the show that
you really liked what was like I mean
what did you enjoy the most I had
already seen every all that stuff at e3
so for me it wasn't really the floor um
I went to go check out the you know that
just they have a room where you can rent
any console and any game and just hang
out and play with your friends or
whatever so play smash brothers the only
new thing I checked out was this game
called dog sniffing butts or something
like that we have a photo of it I think
we have a picture of this it's like a
pug isn't like pug something plug
sniffing butts but sniffing pubs okay
yeah there it is
so there's butt sniffing pugs and it's
like the controller it has a butt on
there too like a dog but I don't get I
didn't get it I didn't get it even after
playing it I still don't know what the
rules were or how to play it uh yeah
they're trying to get my camera there
right there trying to get a Kickstarter
I still don't get it I wouldn't
recommend it but maybe they'll figure
that um yeah and then the other well I
guess I'll save it for the end but I
actually have a video about oh that's
right yeah we made a little a little
short video um well she show it now
ready yeah okay so here I she and I made
you a video from pax yeah we did that's
it how's our video so really informative
I thought I thought we I remember us
saying a lot more interesting stuff than
that do you yeah I thought we'd sit was
looking like a five-minute break down of
what the white gaming industry was
moving into the 22nd century but yeah no
I mean I I do remember that I just that
was the fun that was the fun part of the
video I thought uh kind of tell you what
I liked about pax know what's your
second story my second story well no we
don't i want to talk about pax Kayla no
you're not gonna take this away from me
I had a really great time uh first of
all I've never been a pax prime this is
why I was very excited about it I've
been other pax pax I pecks texts and I
really liked obviously the indie games
there's a lot I'm very surprised by that
because Eddie three this year will Eddie
three this year almost all flagship
games like the indie the indie scene at
e3 is very small because of all the
major titles that are getting dropped
this they would just be completely dark
yeah and so I really liked about pax
they had not only do they have indeed
mega booth which was its own big thing
they also had upstairs a whole other
expo hall full of independent tabletop
gaming developers which is kind of odd
to me because I always considered sort
of tabletop gaming to be in indy thing
so to see that industry kind of start
splitting off a new major developers now
and because it's exploded so much in the
last few years um that was really cool
and then I really liked there was a game
called gang beasts which I've never seen
before until this weekend you're like
these weird jello people
and you're put in precarious situations
you just fight each other it's like
really random and it's so silly but it's
also hilarious and there were huge
crowds around this game in indy may lose
and they were just laughing and cheering
for the people playing people are just
really excited about this game so it
made me stop and I want fusing looking
super confusing looking I didn't even
get my hands on it I just enjoyed
watching other people play it and then I
also really liked party hard which is
that served 8-bit game you your
neighbors have a party at 3am it's
really really loud so you do what any
normal person would do which is you
decide to go over next door and kill
everybody so they have like you know
you've got a certain number of people
and partying in these houses and
everything and then you have to take
them all out but it's a puzzle game yeah
it's like a weird puzzle game and
there's like there's like different ways
to evade and it's very strange but also
really fun and funny like I just enjoyed
that very much and then the cosplay was
really great and what was the last thing
that I was in doing here some of this is
some of the cosplay that we saw at the
show there was some really good destiny
cosplay downstairs like oh really think
destiny cosplay that I saw I summit some
really great stuff it's more than ever I
saw fallout cosplays there's a lot of
people in vault jumpsuits but yes but
good one because I've been to several
conventions and nobody gives a crap
about how hard they work there look yeah
about how hard they work on like the
yellow part I'd never seen him to get
that right but I ran on that bear like
three times that bear i ran into while i
was leaving a bar and it was just like
he was just hanging around but because
he can't like the person this i didn't
talk he kind of just like turned and
then turned away and walked away yeah
that that guy and then another point
what was the other point I was walking
by a booth and he was there I'm like hey
what's up bear and he turned all the way
around to look at me and then turned
away again and so now I'm afraid he
followed me back to pax like but the
ghosts from the hunted manage I could I
love that so much he's followed you home
I mean the last thing that I really
liked which I don't know I'm sure I
think you've done it comic-con which was
the HTC vive demo which I did try i
hadn't i haven't actually um I
time to go and check out the vibe and it
was first of all amazing to mind-blowing
three controllers a plus plus really
impressive stuff that they have going on
over at HTC and an valve they it was a
want to say like eight demos or maybe
ten it was there was your favorite light
painting you could like paint I love the
controllers were like wiimotes so you
like hold them in your hands and they
have triggers on them and that put then
instead of instead of what am I thinking
of instead of like some six they have
touch pads circular touch pads on nice
and you can move that you know things
around and i was like i did a cooking
thing and then i did it reminded me of
so much of the things that we talked
about on the show but in demos so i did
like a cooking thing I was in a sunken
ship and a whale went by I was in a dota
the Wizards like Hut and then I was able
to sort of like make myself really
really tiny and check out different
parts of the hut and then the last thing
was the aperture robot repair lab which
is do that I got to do that and it was
amazing and when Gladys came down and
called me a sack of ham like I literally
squealed and glee i was just like like
it evokes so much emotion which people
was awesome I sure cool so that was
packs that was packs it was great but
yeah the vibe experience I think for me
was like so it's the best heads and
trying you know I haven't tried oculus
touch so I feel weird comparing the two
because now that oculus touch exists and
there are is a control scheme I would be
hesitant to say it's the best out of the
three but so far that is the best
experience I've had and I was able to
see a lot more of like they serve like
what a triple a title would look like
because that was literally like being in
portal which was pretty cool pretty
amazing alright guys let me talk about
one more story really quick and then
we'll jump to break we only did two
stories today there's a guy kill his
name is Dominic Wilcox he is a little
bit weird a little bit of an eccentric
man he invents crazy wacky things that
are kind of whimsical and Kellogg's the
serial maker decided to hit him up and
say hey we know that some people today
are going back to school
I are you know around this time go back
school I've young kids so can you make
us some like really weird breakfast
inventions and he's like yeah of course
I can so that's exactly what it did so
here is the serial killer cafe where
they have a bunch of cereal they
unveiled this and he made six very a
kind of pee-wee's Playhouse s designs
it's what it reminds me up there's a
soggy ometer that lets you know when
your cereal won't be crunchy anymore an
amplified bowl that makes your cereal
noise is really loud this is the drone
delivery system for your cereal or your
umbrella this is the soggy ometer ringer
so you put your milk in and then it
tells you as it gets less and less foggy
there's this which is amazing it's a
it's a little helmet with a crane that
is powered by you and you can serve
yourself cereal a little robotic spoon
that wakes up with you as you eat your
cereal a amplifier that makes your
stomach growls really really loud which
is that tuba that he's wearing are there
like to bow with a bowl on the end of it
and and then there was he mentioned a
watch but it wasn't in this video so I'm
not really sure what that was but super
super silly stuff like but hilarious and
he used a lot of repurpose material but
for the crane specifically he actually
3d printed like a laser cut oh wow like
yeah he custom designed this whole thing
and sort of figured it out um it's
actually a really great video and it's
fun to work no can I just say that he
cast like the perfect actors and
actresses for this they all of like
group gigantic expressions and now
vibrant colors and like definitely got a
redhead bars oh you know it's well done
all the way around yeah we're well done
it looks fun super well done and he
joked that in 50 years time he was like
oh everyone's gonna have a serial crane
helmet and a robotic spoon no doubt no
doubt about it like he's just so it very
funny like very tongue-in-cheek cool but
I figured that would bring us to our
hashtag of the day which would be TD
breakfast and what what what amazing
weird breakfast tech can you think of
like come up with something really
really great hmmm I mean he already took
six of the Great's obviously but I don't
know I i have a feeling like for me it
would be something along the lines of
something with my something with eggs
like scrambled eggs or something so they
go very back to the future esque where
it's like the alarm clock like makes all
my breakfast and eggs like that's what I
would want my yet i think i'd have to be
like some sort of like like bacon gloves
or something so that like i'm driving on
the way to work and I just eat my gloves
and then by the time I get to work the
gloves are all going hands are greasy
just wash your hands and then you're
good to go but still yeah that's stage
two we're still a Kickstarter 0 point 0
it's 15 hundred dollars gets you the
bacon gloves amazing one pair of
everything I'm end up back at one
hundred percent uh alright guys we're
gonna take a quick break and speaking of
crowdfunding we'll be right back with
back at her Hackett's don't look away
it's tomorrow daily I will Livi the very
best no one ever was
to train them in my home
welcome back to the show we returned
it's Monday which means we like to talk
about crowdfunding and specific projects
that catch our eye for better or force
this is back at her Hackett I may have
actually chosen this one because of its
ridiculousness as opposed to like
something I'm like oh I gotta have that
this is actually kind of weird you kind
of run the gamut of which ones you
choose I know what to expect is is that
much about I'm actually I really want
your opinion on this cuz I don't really
know how you're gonna respond is it
bacon gloves no okay that's good for me
what are you still on your idea thus far
like I've seen this is called the
ginzvelo and there it is it looks like a
little car but it is actually powered by
you it's an advanced tricycle with a
shell on top okay so there he is writing
about um here's the interesting thing
about this this little vehicle which
they're calling a human electric hybrid
because as the moniker would suggest
there is a 500 watt motor and a 48 volt
battery so it's an electric vehicle as
well as a bicycle and they're saying
that the size and function of it still
makes it a bike so you can use bike
lanes you you don't have to like ride
this in the road but you could if you
wanted to as long as it was legal to
ride your bike in the road and then also
they said 75 to 100 mile range with this
thing and it can get up to 20 miles an
hour without much of an effort because
it's an electric vehicle as well as a
bicycle oh okay so you can go 20 miles
an hour which is you know a standard you
know speed on a side street or something
like that like a little you can get up
to I think they were saying they also go
up to 30 miles an hour but 75 200 miles
on average if you're writing about 20
miles an hour on a single charge it's
lightweight enough to peddle without a
whole bunch of extra weight feeling the
extra weight on you I think the whole
shell weighs like 85 pounds is pretty
lightweight keeps you obviously keeps
you dry keeps you dry you can put some
grocery bags or a backpack in the back
there and then it uses this is the thing
that I thought was really interesting it
uses regular
parts so if it breaks you don't have to
like special order at peace you just go
down to a bicycle repair shop and you
can repair it okay which I thought was a
very big plus for this something like
this it has head lights brake lights
turn signal lights and they want only
fifty thousand dollars okay to
manufacture some of these a weight in
total like the total that's about what
they want us the goal and they have
about 23 days left and they have raised
just over six thousand dollars so
they're all about a tenth of the way
they're a little over the tenth of the
way there so how much would you pay for
this now mind you you at all so you have
to buy the bike too because it's a
specialized trike there are two kinds of
compatible trikes that work with this
and if you have them it's a little it's
about half price so how much did you pay
for this if you didn't have the trike I
live in LA well if you lived in a place
where there were about where I could
bike around yeah soon we're gonna take
its work i paid about 700 for my bike
which is like a like me I've really
liked bike okay so I'm gonna say mmm a
thousand maybe a look like maybe a 1200
most who okay well here gonna be
surprised by this it is six thousand
dollars for one bike for one ginzvelo
without the bike or with the bike like
3,000 if you just if you already have
the trike the two one of the two
compatible trikes this does go faster
than a bike though it does so it's it's
electric and you it literally has like a
75 200 mile range which to be fair I
mean you can look you can find electric
bike for like maybe like I think the
most of every single is two grand I want
to say yeah like 1500 2 grands yeah I
don't know I mean three times that cost
and you look like you're floating in an
egg you look like you're in a space egg
um they've mentioned in the video that
they were like oh there's a lot of you
get a lot of public interest in it and
they talked about maybe major advertised
people wanting to advertise on the sides
of these things maybe we'll see him at
comic-con next year I guess little like
petty it takes it would it gets in the
way it's just as big giant you she had
they hear they're even like
it rode by the bike thing it's like look
isn't it better than a bike like no you
can lock your bike up there you know
yeah we're gonna how you'll lock it
that's a good question yes somebody you
did I guess somebody really couldn't
like run off with it yeah yeah but you
even if I wrote it to work where do I
put my egg yeah where do you park your
egg that's true i didn't use a parking
space but yeah it's a kind of odd I feel
like I just thought I so really
interesting what I'm trying to tell you
is I'd Beckett you're you're in I'm out
I say I say no but that's because uh
that's because I just I look at it and I
think of the apt era I don't know if you
remember this it was like a
three-wheeled car and it looked like a
paper almost like a little rounded paper
plane egg and it was supposed to be like
30 grand it was totally amazing and that
I was really excited about it then it
ended up being a big disappointment so I
feel like this is also good Logan would
you back this no I dozen eggs though
that's what I thought sure if you love
eggs this might be a great choice for
you feel bikes and eggs future this is a
great great option all right aside from
that what's up let's talk about our very
last bit of the show which is you guys
it's time for user feedback we asked
everybody to use the hashtag TD unbox to
talk about force friday which is this
friday what did they want to see like
Star Wars thing unboxed on what kind of
toys Rick Rhoden said bb-8 miniature
version which I can control by my phone
which also works as a portable hard
drive alright tag why not I think you're
asking for too much that's that's too
much yeah two ish no I do like that
though portable hard rock air or Roger
maragon writes it and said I would love
to see a Death Star and try saber
rolling c-3po hahaha basically I want to
see the full 18 hours like he's just
excited to watch the whole livestream
wants a Death Star toy I wonder if you
had a smaller to scale def star if it
can blow up something little like God if
it was equal scale couple of something
else a little bigger please yeah 18
hours is a lot of toys well in each life
each unboxing is almost an I think it's
a theory chat however long there's 14
unboxers oh good are we gonna eat yum
box like 10 things so like one toy I
could see you max out at like
because you like look at the box they
always like appreciate a box they're
like oh look how well made it is unpack
your stuff on the back here's other
stuff when they unbox it then they kind
of check it out and then use a little so
maybe ten minutes each so yeah like
that's like six toys make five to six
toys on average that's a lot uh and then
lastly Justin Rose an email and said now
you all are making me feel nostalgic I
do not want to see a specific toy since
i'm sure it will all be made at some
point but i would love to see the magic
of the toy stores of the 80's brought
back this is very I like this email he
said in this picture put a few pictures
said back then everything was not at
your fingertips he had a search to find
stuff and often found lots of fun
surprises since we did not have access
to the internet and could research the
stores entire inventory online prior to
a visit you constantly found lots of
cool stuff to your parents said no to
LOL i would like my stepson to be able
to experience that magic instead of just
shopping online are going to big box
stores don't get me wrong I'm an IT guy
and I love technology after all time I
make my living but sometimes those
things changed i can take away from the
magic of the past that could never be
brought back PS my favorite all-time toy
was my yoda action figure he had a cloak
a snake and his staff and lightsaber
that was a lot of accessories you play
that most just had a blast her
lightsaber there we go he wants the
magic old box wasn't come with a snake
sure I'm not really sure maybe this may
be a stick maybe as a typo that makes
sense but still kind of staff so that
also wouldn't be it so maybe it's a
snake from Dagobah a poisonous snake
from day one just a dub snake I remember
the scene was the 70s and people were
crazy people toy designers may have gone
a little overboard back then
merchandising with such a new thing in
the late 70s early 80s come on alright
time for a very last piece of user
feedback start for our phone tog refer
the day
I think you'll like this picture remick
sent it to us you said hi guys I took
this with my 1+1 whilst on my holiday to
Poland love the show and I like that it
just it looks so tiny what could I leave
all of the tilt shift in this is perfect
and the oneplus ones are really kicking
butt on the show it really is people I
don't want to say our two most submitted
phones are iphone 6 or 6 plus and the
oneplus one those are like the two most
submitted and most chosen i would say
because of the quality really good i
don't know if there's a correlation
between people buying high quality
smartphone cameras and understanding how
to take good pictures or if those
cameras on those smartphones inherently
take better pictures and therefore make
the food photographer better or most of
their pictures are terrible so they take
more pictures therefore they have better
pics yeah more and have better because
that's playing devil's advocate no
that's also a really good point it could
be just statistically they take more
pictures therefore they get more better
pictures more better to get better
pictures more often there you go alright
guys be my sending your phone tog raphy
you can do that you can email us
tomorrow cnet com with that our story
ideas you can also find us on social
media if you want to keep up with the
show post things you can find us on
Tumblr Facebook and Twitter but really
