combustion engines they're not real
efficient in fact your car's engine is a
better heater than a motor over 60% of
the gas you buy goes into creating heat
and exhaust put another way next time
you do one of those $75 Philips realize
that about 56 bucks of it isn't used to
move your car but to heat it with that
depressing thought in mind let's see
what's going to save fuel in cars that
already burn it so inefficiently number
five adaptive battery charging about a
three to four percent savings here your
alternator charges your battery it's
driven by a belt that drags on the
engine all the time that hasn't changed
in the better part of a century but
today new systems like BMWs
EfficientDynamics only engage the
alternator when you break or are
coasting that means kinetic energy keeps
the thing spinning as opposed to
combustion energy very smart
number four electric rotating
accessories of five to six percent
savings here talking about your power
steering and water pumps your air
conditioning compressor those are all
little parasites driven by belts that
SAP the engine electric power steering
is already taking over in cars as we
speak and electric water pumps you
should start seeing those around 2014
now electric air conditioning
compressors have the added benefit of
keeping the car cool even when the
engines off and that brings us to number
three start/stop technology it can save
you six to ten percent when you come to
a stop the engine shuts down until you
lift off the brake to get moving again
that reduces not just fuel waste but
also emissions in congested traffic this
trick used to be confined only the
hybrids but now it's spreading to gas
engine cars Mercedes BMW Mazda Ford just
some of the car makers using it in five
years or so I'm willing to bet it'll be
as common as a parking brake number two
8 and 9 speed automatic transmissions
with a fuel savings of 10 maybe 15% if
you think a 7-speed automatic is
overkill here a couple of
shifts behind the eight speeds are here
the nine speeds are on the way
like ZF 9 HP transmission first adopted
by Chrysler the idea behind all of these
is simple internal combustion engines
have a fairly narrow sweet spot for
efficiency and the more gears you have
to choose from the more likely you can
keep the engine in that spot before we
get to number one here's the real number
one saving weight this isn't one
technology though it's a combination of
carbon fiber parts high tensile steel
frames aluminum body panels and
suspension parts lighter seats and
plastic everywhere when you take weight
out of a car you don't just improve its
fuel economy but also its acceleration
its breaking its cornering just about
everything except perhaps how it does in
a collision with a Ford Expedition the
number one fuel saving technics out
there right now and has a huge future is
direct injection and forced induction a
couplet here up to 20 percent fuel
savings direct injection delivers fuel
directly into the cylinder where it's
needed
which believe it or not cars never
actually did until very recently and
forced induction like super charging or
turbo charging that does wonders when
it's coupled with direct injection all
of this is about getting more power out
of a smaller engine using less fuel look
at the 2013 audi s5 for example by
dropping last year's normally aspirated
4.2 liter v8 and going to a smaller 3
liter supercharged direct injection v6
the MPG went from an abysmal 14 22 to a
pretty good 17 26 the car lost its gas
guzzler tax uses some 600 bucks less
fuel per year and still gets up to 60 in
a quick 4.9 seconds for more car tech
top fives like these go to CNET on cars
comm we do one in every episode of the
show i'm brian coulis thanks for
