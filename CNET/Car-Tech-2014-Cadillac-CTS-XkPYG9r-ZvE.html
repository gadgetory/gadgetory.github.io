they go after the Germans and teach them
a thing or two I'd have to say the
Cadillac CTS has the best claim to
actually doing that and so when General
Motors the Cadillac division redoes the
CTS a lots at stake let's see what the
2014 looks like it's right here behind
me start with the face the more
pronounced sort of a large grille nose
it comes out more and is less flush with
the car easy to spot of 2014 as is this
interesting LED detail on the corner
running up the front and along the
strikes at the top of the fender again
easy spotters trick there also notice
how low the hood presents as it comes to
the windshield that's something that you
see a lot in modern cars that tend to be
very high and thick at the cowl this car
is about for some odd inches longer
overall two and a half of that is in the
wheelbase a little bit longer bulkier
rear overhang as well but the car
presents wider even though it's actually
a little narrower because it's come down
and gotten longer and underneath all
these styling cues I'm showing you is a
big weight loss story they pulled some
300 pounds out of the weight of this guy
from the 2013 using mostly some aluminum
structural components that's a big
weight loss for a vehicle that has
actually gotten longer but stays in the
same size class now what's more fun
after you take out 300 pounds from a
cars weight than to add a whole mess of
power to move that around that's a good
formula here's the other part of the
story this is the new top-end engine for
the CTS this is before the CTSV comes
out there'll be a new one of those
coming but right now you can get this
twin-turbo v6 420 horse 430 foot-pounds
of torque those are great numbers also
going out to an 8-speed very advanced
automatic transmission that has
programming logic that will let it jump
a gear as it goes up and down to the
gears if that's more efficient because
as the gears get so close sometimes it
doesn't need to go four five six seven
eight
it can hop one or two interesting logic
there and note this design feature this
car has got a cast and exhaust port not
a separate exhaust manifold here where
the turbo attaches that means that as
soon as the exhaust valves open and
expanding gases are coming out they are
driving the turbo almost immediately not
having to wait to pass down through an
exhaust manifold and then get there this
should lead to much reduced term
Lag and of course that's one of the key
things in a motor like this inside the
new CTS following another Cadillac trend
going all LCD in the cabin that means
not just the big head unit where
Cadillac Q lives but also over here the
instrument panel becomes fully virtual
and those gauges and indications can do
a presto change-o to change what they're
showing you as well as the look of how
they're doing it now still coming after
this vehicle hits the road a little bit
later in 2013 will be a coupe version a
new cts-v version and of course Cadillac
is still working on electrification the
ELR we saw rolled out recently so a lot
of things were happening that have
significant engineering changes for
Cadillac and as you can see big changes
in the skin as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
