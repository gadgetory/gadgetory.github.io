I'm here with the new nuke glow light
plus this is Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's first
ereader in two years and yes the Nook is
back this is a device that excuse very
much towards the paperwhite in terms of
aspects it has a 300 dpi screen it's a
little heavier than the old Nook at 6.9
ounces it has two point six gigabytes of
memory and it also is waterproof that's
one of the key differentiating features
here it is ip67 rated which means you
can actually drop it in your bathtub and
completely submerge it it's worth noting
that the back of the device is made out
of aluminum it is kind of a bronze color
and while it looks like classy it is
actually metal as far as the built-in
light goes it's supposed to be a little
bit more uniform than the previous light
in the older nook Barnes ennoble is
calling it built-in ambient light and it
does appear to be a very nice lighting
scheme the previous Nook glow light was
also a white device this one doesn't
have the kind of rubberized finish on
the sides it is a smooth metallic finish
as I said so it's a little bit slippery
but bars Moe is selling some cases of
course the last feature I should
highlight is the fact that this has a
capacitive touch screen and not the
infrared touch screen that the previous
model had capacitive touch screens are a
little bit more responsive and overall
the device should be a little bit
smoother particularly because Barnes and
will has revised the software that this
device runs on is also revised its apps
this is a hundred and thirty dollar
eReader it's Wi-Fi only no cellular and
is available now I'm Dave Carney and
that's the Nook glow light plus thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
