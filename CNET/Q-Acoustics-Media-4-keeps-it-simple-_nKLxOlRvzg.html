familiar with speaker manufacturer on
cue acoustics the brand has only just
arrived in the United States the media
for sambar is one of its first products
and I must say it's a really strong
beginning the media 4 is a stereo sambar
which incorporates a rectangular six
inch subwoofer on board while the Sonics
can't compete with sound bars with
separate subs the media 4 has excellent
dynamics compared to its Samsung and
ZBOX competition the Q acoustics is
relatively large for a sambar and
features a trapezoidal shape this helps
to make room for the connections at the
back especially when wall mounting the
media Ford doesn't offer HDMI but it
does have optical two analog inputs and
Bluetooth be aware that if you use the
speaker on a tabletop it's three and a
half inches tall so it may block your
TV's infrared port we found the sambar
was equally good at movies and music
though it could sound a little closed-in
with voices there was also no real bass
to speak of and so the Z Vox SB 500 is
better there however if you want to add
a sub you can there is a subwoofer
output you can also add the matching Q
acoustics model for an extra 300 dollars
but the media fors main attraction is
its simplicity
no modes to mess with is turn it on and
it sounds really good it's well built
and it's relatively good-looking it's
definitely one to look out for at its
$400 price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
