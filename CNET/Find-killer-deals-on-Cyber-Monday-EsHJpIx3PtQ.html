course in finding the best shopping
deals online for Cyber Monday with these
tools you can say some serious money and
maybe even score some free shipping now
the best deals out there requires some
patience here a lot of talk about Black
Friday and Cyber Monday but the truth is
there's deals to be had year round if
you know what to look for and that's
really the first step you know what
you're looking for there are plenty of
sites out there to offer bargains on
things you never knew you needed but
there's a good chance you'll end up
blowing your budget on juicers and
Snuggies so name some products even if
it's something generic like a new TV or
a new video game having a list will help
you stay focused
next do some research if you're looking
for a new TV or a tablet or a camera but
you don't know where to start use a site
like CNET to check reviews and roundups
try to become an instant expert on the
product category that you're shopping
for once you've done your homework it's
time to get specific and zero in on the
products that you'd be happy with let's
say that I'm in love with this canon
sx260 point-and-shoot it's got great
reviews from the critics and users but
it's a little pricey at $349 retail so
the next thing I'll do is get a basic
idea of what the street price is sites
like Google calm slash shopping or price
grabber
well let me plug in the product name and
show me all the different prices from
around the web but to take things to the
next level you can install a browser
extension that will show you price
comparisons for anything you're shopping
for on the web two great options for
this are invisible hand and price blink
I've got price blink installed here on
my computer and it picked up an eBay Buy
It Now offer on that camera for two
hundred and twenty-two dollars plus free
shipping assuming it's new and the
sellers legit that sounds like a great
deal but what if you want an amazing
deal well if you've got more time than
money you can set up a price alert on
any product that will automatically
email you when the price drops below a
set amount sites like deal news price
pinks or decide will do exactly that
once you've tracked on a price you're
happy with there's a good chance you can
still nickel-and-dime that price down a
little bit more there's a place to enter
a coupon code go to a site like current
codes Ebates or RetailMeNot to see if
there's a valid code that you can use
another way to save some money is
tract on a site that will offer you the
best price with free shipping Amazon in
particular offers free two-day shipping
on many items if you enroll in their
Amazon Prime program but it cost $79 a
year unless you know a few tricks
there's a free one-month trial that can
get from amazon.com slash prime but if
you're a parent anas on.com slash mom
will give you a three month trial and if
you're a college student
amazon.com slash student will give you a
one-year trial but the best way to get
on Prime is to find someone in your
family who's already paying for it
Amazon allows up to four family members
to share one Prime membership of course
they bury this feature under the account
settings but it's there if you look hard
enough
finally counter to what I said at the
beginning of this video if it's the
holidays and the pressure is on and
you're stumped for ideas try a daily
deal site these are clearing houses for
random stuff but the deals are legit and
it can be great when you're at a loss
for what to buy someone sites like woot
cyber monday got a deal slick deals and
fatwallet
they're all worth a shot if you're in a
pinch so there you go those are my best
online shopping tips for the holidays or
year-round for cnet.com i'm donald bell
go spend some money
