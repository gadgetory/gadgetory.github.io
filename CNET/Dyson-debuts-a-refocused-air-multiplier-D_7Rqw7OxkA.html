is the Dyson Am oh nine hot and cold
bladeless fan this is the latest air
multiplier in their line of those
products and just like the old ones it's
got no blades it's a fan that circulates
air through this hoop here it does that
with a fan that's in the base shoots air
upwards it goes around the outside and
comes out the front the cool design it's
been around for a while
this one doesn't bring much new to the
table in terms of that design it's
pretty much the same product as the AML
5 with a couple of distinct upgrades
what you get with this one is what's
called jet focused control that means
that you can switch between a wide
stream of air and the more focused jet
that'll go longer distances for sort of
aimed directional heating and cooling
you'll also find that there are less
buttons on the thing all you get is the
power button down here and the remote
control to control it with now I kind of
wish they hadn't done that the old model
had distinct buttons on the device for
the temperature control for the fan
intensity now those are all relegated to
the remote and the remote alone so if
you misplace this or you lose it you're
stuck with just that power button you
can hold it down to change the
temperature but that's about it
that might be a bit risky if you were an
idiot like me who always miss places
remotes you know I'm at the other
upgrade to you are pretty minor just up
ticks and efficiency and heating
performance and as a cooler it's not an
air conditioner it's just a fan and it's
just gonna blow air out so it's a pretty
normal device despite the very nice
packaging there's also a new dedicated
cooling button on the remote just press
this blue button to turn the fan on
that's a lot better than before you had
to crank the temperature all the way
down to the minimum setting of 32
degrees to go into the cooling mode so
much easier now I also wasn't thrilled
with the amo Nine's noise performance it
is rated by the noise abatement Society
as a quiet mark product so it's supposed
to be very quiet but compared to my
chief little small space heater at home
it seemed like the louder appliance take
a listen for yourself
this is a incremental upgrade over the
amo five and at a price of four hundred
and fifty dollars more than the amo five
originally retailed for I think it's
kind of hard to justify buying I think
this is probably too pricey for all but
the most devoted of dice and loyalists
thanks for watching check out my full
review of the dyson amo1 air multiplier

right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
