serious time to shine and all the big
announcements were expecting at this
year's Developers Conference we're
getting to the core of Apple news and
rumors and this week it's all about WWDC
there's a lot to cover so let's get
started with animals Worldwide
Developers Conference just days away
there's a lot we already know about what
they're going to announce but there's
still a few unknowns so let's start with
the facts this year's convention will
start on June 4th and will be held at
the McHenry Convention Center in San
Jose for the second year in a row now
generally speaking this is where Apple
shows off its latest software updates
iOS 11 brought big changes to the iPhone
but it also brought a bunch of bugs and
controversy after Apple admitted it
purposely slowed down old iPhones so iOS
12 will be all about performance
improvements
aka bourree but that's okay according to
Japanese blog site Mac o Takara it's
also rumored to be getting faced ID
support for horizontal unlock and more
an emojis and just like iOS will bring
bug fixes Mac OS this year we'll double
down on security after last year's Mac
OS High Sierra flaw let users log in
without a password there's a lot more
questions about watch OS 5 there's
rumors about round watchface support but
that may be more wishful thinking on my
end
there's rumors about face ID and
FaceTime support but that involves new
camera sensors that might not be
happening what's more likely are better
health tracking features and perhaps a
focus on women's health like this year's
mid bit
and the home pod just got the multi-room
audio and stereo support that Apple had
promised at launch with airplay to on
the latest iOS 11.4 release but the
biggest and most welcome upgrade could
come to Siri Apple's digital assistant
needs to get a lot smarter to compete in
the artificial intelligence realm
alongside Google assistant and Amazon's
Alexa so we're hoping to get a major
Siri announcement
what about hardware this is where we
first met the home pod last year so
Apple may have a few surprises in store
for us we're going down the list from
most likely to least likely starting
with computers now Apple just refreshed
its line of MacBooks but it may give
them a power boost
until recently announced its 8th gen
core i9 processor which will likely make
it into Apple's next batch of computers
it's just a matter of when what's more
likely is a sequel to Apple's budget
iPhone there's been a lot of rumors
about a second-generation
iPhone se with similar specs and a
4-inch screen or even a full-screen
version but that one is a little bit
less likely and they have to set a
launch date for that air power charging
pad which has been m.i.a since they
announced it almost a year ago in
September now this would allow you to
power up all your wireless charging
enabled Apple devices in one spot now
here's the long shot Apple could mention
it's mixed reality headset that's
rumored to be in the works
last year they gave us a clue by
announcing the platform with a our kit
but it could be that the matching
headset may not be ready until 2020 and
now a little something from the Apple
archives at the 2008 Apple Developers
Conference Steve Jobs takes the stage to
announce the iPhone 3G we've learned so
much with the first iPhone we've taken
everything we've learned in more and
we've created the iPhone 3GS
and it's beautiful this is what it looks
like it's even thinner at the edges it's
really beautiful it's got a full plastic
back it's really nice great battery life
now one other thing that benefits from
fast data of course is GPS and we've
built that into the new iPhone 3G as
well so that's it for your preview but
join us next week to see which of these
predictions came true we're unpacking
all the big news from WWDC and breaking
down the latest rumors about the next
batch of iphones remember you can also
catch this show in spanish on CNET and a
spend yawn or catch me on twitter at
