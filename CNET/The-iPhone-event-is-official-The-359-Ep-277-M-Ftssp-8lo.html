worth it because we got the scoop it's
the 359 podcast featuring Ben Fox Ruben
Roger Chang and Scott Stein and we are
in all sorts of weird moods right now
everyone's all Drive deep Eva we're
excited Wow yeah I don't like we were
gonna talk about evening wearables
initially but Apple just basically thin
the invite drops
yeah the invite drops and they basically
said hey we're gonna take the show now
yeah you wanted to be on the podcast
yeah so we're gonna we're gonna talk
about Apple their big event is gonna be
September 12th and we'll also get to a
couple of things about wearables
especially from the official related to
Apple anything and all the other stuff
yeah and Scott's our big wearable expert
which is why we're yeah yeah all right
without further ado let's get to the
podcast send in your questions and
comments BBG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show all right
let's make them try he'll try let's
let's do it all right Avery go for the
recording we'll be back see in the chat
in three minutes 59 seconds four three
two welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben
Roger Tran and today we have improv
impresario reviews King Scott and
reviews King Scott Stein big news just
lightweight occasions around him reviews
King they're like a whole bunch of yours
outside we don't have any time magician
big news that just hit apple's iphone
event will be on september 12th at the
new Steve Jobs theater Scott you just
wrote about this how big is this gonna
be huge and because it's going to be at
the new campus first of all so nobody
has really seen except for a few people
at the Steve Jobs theater and it's the
new iPhone iPhone 8 that's from a he's
from sir mathematic point of view but
it's a smaller venue right from what I
understand apparently from what we
understand yeah so that's true by
interesting to see how many how they
deal with the ally deal things but oh
this is
this is a big a product launch the
iPhone is a signature event for Apple
every year this is their big thing plus
it's gonna be a lot of associated
products we're expecting apple watch
we're expecting maybe Apple TV updates
update maybe maybe it may be new more
news on home pod I think we're gonna
hear a little bit about air pods because
that's the thing you connect all that
stuff okay well Mary I'm setting myself
up to be a little bit disappointed that
there's been so many rumors flowing
about the 10th anniversary iPhone is
this really gonna live up to the hype I
think it's kind of a hard time doing
that because I agree with you when it
comes to phones we always talk about how
many more updates we've been really put
in phones and I think you know we've
seen so many leaks about this already so
again if it matches that you'll feel
like expectations were met and that's it
and and also you know what what next
generation thing can you put in a phone
to really take it to the next level
a ours is really big but that won't be
just on the iPhone 8 yeah really the the
the massive redesign I think if there
weren't a lot of rumors I think that
would be a lot bigger deal o total in
fact the essential phone kind of has
that design already yes people have
already there are phones out there that
kind of look like it and the Galaxy
phones we're talking about you know
contactless charging you know removing
the bezel all that sort of stuff that's
been out there so it's it's not gonna
meet the hype there I don't know if it's
gonna be disappointing it might be
anticlimactic that's not gonna affect
sales right we're just gonna bigger buy
these things they are in about these
things although it's gonna be anything
about wear positions because the talk is
that there might be three iPhones there
might be an iPhone eight and maybe
iPhone 7s and 7s plus if that's the case
and that almost sounds like a move to
what they've been doing with MacBook
swear you know the type I wonder if it's
a touch bar move where the touch bar is
is an optional high-end upgrade and then
you have these other models maybe
they're gonna position the iPhone 8 as
even a little more of a premium slightly
out of range thing assuming that not
everybody will want it or be able to
afford it alright I also want to get to
a lot of the wearables news that's been
coming out this week especially as the
ephah tech show and Germany has been
going on what's the the big one that
people should pay attention to it's the
one from Samsung right it's definitely
Samsung because they're a huge player
and I think the other interesting thing
in that space between Samsung and Garmin
Samsung made is really an update where
they added swim proofing
and finally edit downloadable Spotify
Garmin added payments now that's also
like Fitbit who added payments those
those mobile payment platforms are on
the rise a lot of these are getting swim
proofing but again will you use it
Garmin and Fitbit also have their own
app platforms so to Samsung he's a Polly
you expect them at this big event to say
something about the Apple watch maybe a
Series three right-right series three so
you wonder what they could do LTE is the
big rumor so you've seen phone equipped
wearables fail Apple would have its work
cut out for it explaining how that would
work actually interesting but the new
Samsung watch removed LT yes make it
smaller yes they took it out is
backtrack in there does suck out your
battery and make sure to watch a lot
bigger that those are two things that
are you know big issues with users yeah
and Android wear has moved away from it
mostly almost completely so maybe Apple
could figure out one thing I hate about
LT Watchers you have to pay an extra
amount per month maybe Apple could
figure out a way to circumvent that
maybe they work I deal with carriers or
the question is how much is a drain your
battery maybe there's like a standby
mode they'd also have to explain why
you're gonna use that yeah you people
don't really get it so that has to be
explained by explanations always been
out there so you could use your watch
without your phone people don't seem to
care that much about them cuz they're
always with their phone anyways apples
that'll be apples elevator pitch for it
alright we're gonna call it at that
point if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox ribbon okay I'm Scott Stein
thanks for listening
boy howdy we got a busy chat today I
learned everything about technology just
now I mean I know all the tag trying to
remain great in fast
I gotta go spelunking for comments so
you guys talk amongst yourselves all
right
hello there's nothing left to talk about
we're done there's God covered
everything will tell me about the ionic
you have that yeah I'm wearing a on ik
now I have to say we're under this kind
of like in between zones so like we've
done hands-on impressions but we're not
to have a full review on it yet it's its
pre-release I really like the design of
ionic I think it's it's if you've ever
worn a Fitbit like one of the smaller
fit bits it feels like that it's a
better feel than the blaze which was a
clunkier design but it's clean I saw a
lot of people that hate the look of it
too I mean a lot of people just hate the
way smartwatches look I think you wrote
that it's at least intended in some ways
to look vaguely like an Apple watch
they're trying to hit yeah premium to
you how much is it it's like discount I
mean that's cheaper than the top-end
Apple watch but there are a lot of Apple
Watchers that do fall in that range yeah
Android wear is less expensive in a lot
of instances so that's gonna be tough
and also the thing you can't tell yet
with this is how the apps are gonna work
yeah cuz the app platform hasn't
launched I mean are people actually
gonna make yeah that's the Samsung has
its own platform Tizen no one makes I
mean they're very companies there are a
lot of things out there but few now in
fairness to that it's funny because at
first I thought what the heck are they
doing making apps but as opposed to
phones where you have really solidified
really useful Android and iOS or app
platforms as you say with wearables who
uses app some wearables and I kind of
have stopped using them on Apple watch I
think a lot of times use notifications
and want to just because they're not
useful yeah mostly they're not useful in
they're annoying so maybe the the
doorway still open for these companies
if they can come up with just a few
useful apps and not go crazy and watch
faces then it's not a crazy idea I think
Fitbit based on the information we got
from them we were at a very high level
conversation
about enterprise and health but I think
that's exactly it Fitbit is aiming for I
mean Larry Dignan was talking about this
with me at ZDNet enterprise play so I
think you're talking about corporate
wellness type stuff like apps like that
it's a no let's move on to Bryan we got
some questions we do Collins got a
question you're never gonna guess what
it's about star wars in cero worse
Friday how about that mini Mac Mini max
well what why be that's the question
is there any update on refresh - the old
Mac Mini line Oh none of that stuff will
be at this event
however I'll be shocked maybe you never
know know what not new years i think
they ever knew Mac stuff they had a venn
okay rarely you have Cathy combined i
phone and associate iOS products
yesterday at one event yeah it's been a
long year but if I recall correctly
wasn't her an event in March that was
the MacBook refreshes so yeah but there
was no Mac Mini refresh right they said
it's dead but it hasn't been mentioned
there was no March event this year I've
got March it was there was still gonna
be DC that's why our brains are all
scrambled WWC turned into a product
event right yeah which not doesn't
normally happen that's when they
announced the home pod date everything
they'd home pod they had iPad pro you
max I'm confusing the MacBook thing we
pause for a moment wonder no because it
is it does get confusing and usually WWC
is software so the max all came out then
that's why you shouldn't expect anything
this is all iPhone maybe Apple TV the
question about the Apple watch Apple
watch and I think it I thought I have a
bet about like air pods because I just
feel like air pods were kind of runaway
hit even though you know we're all
laughing at them they've been successful
I think and talked about actual numbers
but there's there you know there's like
a sense that they're still sold out
they're hard to find they're interesting
whatever all right I just like they're
also gonna try to sell you like more of
that stuff do you see a lot on the
street these days what so what are the
questions do we've got new Maya wants to
know if there are going to be a new
updated design to the air pod I think it
would certainly help because I don't
really could they change
just making them shorter don't don't
make the giant vape pipe they look like
little novelty pipes but they do even a
little filter like where the year you
know it's I feel like that's they
actually are they double as and even the
charging thing kind of feels like that
so I think they can fix the design
there's other things not just color
would they put a heart rate into them or
not because other ones like Samsung's
icon X do the other thing would be
controls because it's impossible to
control volume with air pods it's really
annoying the final thing I think would
be how much do they improve Wireless
because they are they drop out a lot
they drop out a fair amount and with
Bluetooth 5 you're dealing with a
different protocol that could have a
longer range and a throughput yeah so I
feel like with these new phones you're
probably gonna have better Bluetooth
then it would make sense to have a
better more improved thing or maybe and
finally fit because we talk about how
they fall out people's ears maybe the
ground support tips maybe they call the
mare pods for sport tips sport tips
I guess who's sport tips sounds like
tips I got some tips on this boy guess
what tips podcast coming up at two all
right
more cues so that's those that's my
guess I just think air pods at this
Skippy roots feel weird all right
more question Ramon we're trying to slam
through these Michael Brown tweets man
hey what are you most excited about in
the upcoming iPhone 8 Pro Edition X etc
etc etc he's looking for personalize
personally the excited about notches I
like notches answer that the fact that
they're actually gonna upgrade to an
OLED screen finally to me makes a lot of
sense
unfortunately it's such a premium to
your price that I'm probably not gonna
go for that specific phone I'm excited
about hand feel I love they feel I I've
hated how large the plus has been to
hold so if they can get a compact phone
with a larger screen thank goodness
that's a wish the back was a bit more
curved like not only a fan the flat back
because I mean looks nice
like it sucks the whole right hand feel
yeah I'm really excited about with that
new phone
I'm care for such 3d touch field so I'm
excited I'm curious to hear what they're
gonna do about no home button if that's
true
yeah curious I'm not like excited about
that it could be like a headphone jack
thing where you're like why did they do
this but I am very intrigued about
camera developments because I think
between like 3d mapping on the front how
that might be able to help with
augmented reality Apple says that AR kit
is only the rear camera for now for the
existing phones but that doesn't mean
that a future phone couldn't have a AR
on the front and what would that be used
for well like snapchat snap already is a
huge player in AR with all the face
filters and all crazy stuff I could get
into some of those AR function face felt
you know you know what I mean right I'm
gonna go back to the fire phone and all
the front-facing camera facing camera
they were onto something with that they
were they didn't know to a certain
extent yeah some of those features are
starting to reappear in different places
and phone as scanner Bixby is trying to
explore that but they haven't really
gotten that going yet but I think the
degree to which with computer vision
everything else
AI the ability for a phone to recognize
where you are maybe in terms of position
or in terms of intelligence I feel like
the iPhone can make strides with that
where the camera is not just for taking
photos it's like gonna help you when
Scott gets going it's hard to get in
stop the office so we've talked about
what you're interested in excited about
curious about Margo wants to see the
flip side what are you gonna be really
disappointed over if they leave it out
or what are you gonna be disappointed in
this is my perspective if they actually
go through with it
I'm more annoyed by the lack of things
with the iPad now because I feel like
that's the one I need to be a computer
at this point but with the iPhone that's
not gonna be all though they've already
refreshed yet yeah but I still feel like
it needs to go further I feel like it's
not but that's a side thing iPhone the
point being that if you like the iPhone
is has solidified a lot and to the point
where I think phones are pretty great
across the board so I
not really dreaming of all that much do
I want to push the envelope sure but
there's nothing I really need phones to
be maybe I'll be disappointed if they
don't really make good strides with like
contact obviously they don't have
contactless charging or if they don't
have like if you know I think these
things were expecting one thing I want
to see if I don't see it I'll be
disappointed the dual camera moving that
down to all the models so it's not just
but make sure that base every model the
new iPhone should have a dual cam like
that's basically par for the course for
a lot of these high-end phones so to not
have a dual camera lens on the base
model i 7 iphone 7 s would get kinda
crap that being said is that right is
that in the cards I don't know I don't
know I think it could make sense I think
a key could happen then if you don't
want that you just get the older iPhone
7 right I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say I hope they talk more about Siri
and home pod I think ultimately they're
gonna talk a lot about Siri good good
because Siri needs a lot of work and I
think that them talking on stage about
Siri means that they're actually putting
some emphasis and some money behind that
voice assistant because it does the it
needs more work so squeaking it's a good
point there's that's a perfect bridge
into some of the wish lists that are
coming down through the chat Michael
Brown says you have to see some updates
to Siri as well Val dear is looking
forward to a circular Apple watch do you
think that's possible and lastly tell by
one I totally want Apple TV stick good
idea w-where to get iTunes content
because it's impossible otherwise unless
you buy an Apple TV as well add that to
the list a wireless charging is almost
wireless you want to assume to be part
of the new iPhone and we've talked about
that for years yeah and it looks like
they're finally getting on it yes
my biggest wish list item is for the
Apple watch has nothing to do with the
hardware it's a watch face store they
keep the shoes off and it's bizarre and
you can only get the the handful of
watch faces that Apple includes why
can't you gave why can't I get my New
York Jets watch face i I mentioned Roger
I a jet is it
I want my crying New York Jets wash face
okay no from the rumors also wear touch
ID is actually gonna be located and if
they get rid of the home button one
weird rumor conspiracy guess was like
it's over the Apple logo or something in
the back really wait
so I would be disappointed if touch ID
was hard I sexy isn't Dark Crystal
anyway I don't think so I think that if
it would be that'd be a real
disappointment if it goes way sorry
my impression is is that touch ID is
probably not gonna be under the screen
as we were all hoping it would be that's
probably not gonna come for another year
or two
yeah and all the phones and all the
phones fingerprint sensors so we'll see
where they put it yeah that Qualcomm
tech was interesting that when they when
they had I haven't demoed it but when
they were talking about how that under
screen tech for fingerprint sensing it's
using a notic thing and it's slower and
main abuse but I be curious
I just feel like to not have touch ID at
all on the iPhone eight would be crazy
they'll have some yeah you got to have
it also because now everybody was gonna
want a face cam it'll be a dongle don't
make you pay we've included the touch ID
dongle in the box and it is the most
pretty dongle but if you lose it it's
like fifty dollars to buy a dog and you
can't get your you can't get to the
phone with the attaches to your
lightning headphone it's on the air pod
it's on your eyes that is great word is
a touch ID ago more questions questions
are Alex Ortiz will the iPod be phased
out or will it possibly get an update I
think it's already been shuffle is the
lining law yeah no the iPod line except
for the touch is gone oh right and I
really say that I will talk about that
we're talking about that earlier that
the Nano
for sure yeah so that's how basically
everyone feels and they haven't talked
about the iPods on stage now or black
brings back Apple watch one thing that's
really broken on what on watches across
the board is music you're like why would
I use music for well it looks like an
iPod Nano Apple watch is supposed to it
does technically play music yeah nobody
actually knows that and I feel like most
people wouldn't even know how to set it
up it's really slow it's not good it's
not ideal and Samsung Google all of them
I think are really bad at it
Apple is improving music playback with
with watch OS 4 they've already gone
over that so I got sync playlist I think
that they're gonna push more of that and
try to push the Apple watches music
player the question is is that of
interest okay going back to the original
question the iPod Touch apparently is
still on sale and I thought I know is it
still available but they killed off a
couple of the other iPods everything yes
yeah it's basically just that we did
write about this yeah yeah you could
still get them on a variety of
e-commerce websites I will not mention
place is not gonna plug them all right
all right places to questions what else
we got
razor 204 8 wants to know if Apple's
considering adding a headphone jack to
the smartphone nope sorry no but it
would be so great if they do know it
would be super happy that Samsung
decided to keep their headphone jack on
their phones
it looks like the Google pixels though
are gonna get rid of it yeah I know it's
a bummer yeah
I can't by the way I'm still bummed
about the headphone jack being gone I I
want to write about this I'm not okay
with it I'm still upset about it early
totally forgot
happy birthday it's good alright that's
why we had you on the show not your
wearable expertise but the fact that
it's and in it's been a great birthday
true to form I accidentally lots of
investors camera out in that shot while
he wished him happy birthday
everybody or no omen I don't know yeah
Buell invited happy birthday Scott nice
might is very wood no sirree we need
some space
terrifying but yeah it's it's been a
it's been a good one we gotta get some
lunch yeah someday questions questions
questions
yeah all right we're almost out of time
here but let's let's crank through
something else
Christopher USBC our lightning for
iPhone eight charging lightning
lightning I mean that's yeah it's
definitely not gonna be us that would be
nice USB see that would be fantastic
interesting I'm not entirely
oh not gonna happen the question would
be would be lightning to USB old-school
or USB see in a don't what way the other
on the on the court oh god no I know
what'd be great we came in the box of
the USB see immediately find your own
way with a new adapter yeah ugh yep that
would be so that would be like totally
so that would mess with your mind
so Apple cuz actually that's Google the
pixels like that yeah both ends of his
USB see which seriously sucks if you
have like it's this other plug it's
possible I just think at some point
there is the question of like USB sees
on so many other Apple devices at this
point I don't know how that resolves I
mean or just eventually lightning just
goes away to be replaced by contactless
charging and wireless right now in place
by nothing differ in the chat is
lamenting about how in like ten years
kids are gonna go what's a cord like
cords gonna compete I don't know why you
went from I was in your forward to that
cordless will not disagree maybe lament
wasn't leh exact right where I don't kid
like yeah kids you you don't know what
you like how bad it was all these cords
tangling up in your pockets there nor
the crap out of me
okay a thing in the past we used to get
these free core cords strings and ropes
made out of electronics that came with
our products Apple is obviously trying
to get a little bit closer to that world
but in the transition in the bridge that
we've been experiencing since last year
it's been pretty crummy I mean like the
fact that you can't plug in the newest
iPhone to the newest MacBook
right without a dongle it's so strange
and there have been that lately it's
like these two different formats and
then you might have contact lists and
it's all just got to come together maybe
they'll get one step closer this time
they might and I mean that's something
if you have contactless charging I think
about well the entire family be
supported will you have that but watch
will it may be a new version of air pods
that's another thing you have
contactless charging case something like
that where you could put them all on one
surface or who knows what I just think
the moment you have all these sprouting
octopus of lightning things I don't
think that works like the one charge the
device - and what kind of voltage good
it can't output the same can you I guess
he could build one that would I mean it
wouldn't like work anywhere but you
could potentially design right I don't
know I just think at some point you have
to deal with again the sprouting squid
of lightning cable I was just thinking
about I still want that be able than
everything in there I will never make it
to the market although if you put your
keys your metal keys in there all right
we got to wrap it up soon but let's
address the one major elephant in the
room Scott with an elephant what do you
think greatness - loser - do you think
the rumors are true about the delayed
release date for the iPhone 8 great the
lizard great name yeah that's been here
before I think it's entirely possible I
disagree
well I think it will be it'll be on time
the supply will be so limited I agree
with want to be able to say that it'll
be available in certain of some certain
date that's close to the launch and we
sold out yeah we sold out because we've
only made five of them like see Apple
has done has announced products that
have come out later air pods for
instance it may be that we get a preview
peek now and the iPhone 7s comes out now
and the iPhone 8 comes out in October
they've done that with iPads they've
done
lot of things were they had staggered
releases so it's totally in their
wheelhouse to do that yeah and if they
did that what what problem would anyone
have with that they'd be annoyed some
somewhat but it's it's happened a lady
hilariously anti-climactic if they
wanted on the iPhone eight because
that's the one that a lot of people that
would explain spec thing yeah but that
would explain why they have two lines of
products because then you couldn't have
iPhones available and it's also like
they've sometimes had delayed launches
of features like portrait mode came
later Apple pay came later yeah but when
those phones long features and those are
accessories really about the iPhone an
actual like high profile profile product
launch also exists because that's that's
how they their bread gets buttered
that's all the money that they made tell
you what let's draw a little thing
around this we'll come back after the
event we'll see who is right okay I lied
we got one more first up mr. legend said
thanks for the shoutout been for sure
and Margo wants to know what are the
projected storage capacities for the
iPhone oh good question
well they're currently calf at 256 eight
gigs I think 512 is totally on the table
for the high-end yeah the eight will go
up to 512 also with cameras you know
requiring more storage because I know
there's gonna be that much in storage
it's more like sensor processing that's
true it's because they're they're just
basically using similar graphics so may
not be a camera if you were doing nor if
you're doing some sort of 3d scanning
that that would be I mean that would
take a lot of your memory so what is do
you know off the top of your head what's
the lowest tier iPhone I'm not talking
about the se what's what I get it starts
with their two right yeah well so it's
32 128 256 yeah I think they're probably
gonna stick with 32 is the baseline even
on the big anniversary no no anniversary
I think will probably start at like 64
128 there we go I think the I think the
eight could even start at 128
yeah I mean that's I think is yeah your
your you're starting you starting big in
that territory $5,000 price tonight
hitting also the other thing that the
cameras could do you mentioned about
storage and everything else is we've
seen this with other things like like
google tango the ability to do 3d
scanning microsoft talked about this 2-3
scanning on your phone like what is that
for
there are applications and Apple could
have a phone in the iPhone 8 that would
do interesting 3d scanning stuff that
could have uses maybe it's pro uses but
and I would take up a huge amount of
storage yeah so not impossible and that
type of stuff is interesting and is
related to AR and 3d and VR and gifts
like that so oh man oh man oh man there
