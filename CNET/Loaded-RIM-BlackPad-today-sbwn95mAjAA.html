its blackberry line of smartphones may
be venturing out into the tablet realm
rumors have been steadily pouring in for
quite some time and some analysts are
predicting rim could announce something
as early as today don't expect this
black pad to run blackberry OS six

acquired qnx software systems we're
going to have more on this as it
develops the highly infected computer
worm named Stuxnet has corrupted Iran's
first nuclear power plant well there
doesn't seem to be any serious damage to
the integrity of the complex there are
worries that future attacks could leave
the power plant vulnerable to remote
hacking Stuxnet exploits three holes in
Windows computers that are running
Siemens industrial software systems over
1,000 eager customers mobbed the apple
store in Beijing's Joyce City the iphone

continues to find success in the country
following the debut of the ipad back on
September 17th the company does have
some catching up to do though as it was
only the fifth largest mobile seller in
the second quarter of this year in more
apple news the company has updated
itunes to add better interactivity with
the social music service pink before the
update users had to visit ping directly
to recommend songs to friends but now
they can do so directly from their music

definitely one in the right direction
