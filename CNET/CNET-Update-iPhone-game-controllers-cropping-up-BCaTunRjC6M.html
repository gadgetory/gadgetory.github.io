I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
updates logitech and other companies are
working on creating game controllers
that will work with iphones and ipads
with iOS 7 nothing has been announced
from a logitech but a photo of a
possible logitech controller has been
posted to Twitter by the account efflux
who has proven to be a credible source
the controller is like a case that hugs
the iphone it sports a directional pad
for action buttons and shoulder buttons
and on the back of the casing there's a
hole for the camera and this isn't the
only game controller that was teased the
case maker clamcase showed off a design
for the ipad mini that can potentially
also work on the iphone 4s and later
there's no word on price or release date
but it's a Bluetooth device that slides
on the iPad and it will allegedly have
its own battery supply also in the world
of gaming Nintendo made a few
announcements regarding games coming to
the Wii U and 3ds super mario 3d world
will feature a few new power-ups for the
multiplayer game along with a catsuit
that lets players climb walls and
scratch there's a double cherry that
gives you duplicate characters and you
can keep adding another clone of
yourself every time you collect cherries
in a demo I tried I was able to get 5
Princess Peach's on the screen shooting
fireballs it was pretty amazing another
big holiday game will be wii party u
which comes out october 25th it has more
than 80 minigames and it'll be sold as a
bundle with a wii remote plus controller
and a new horizontal stand for the Wii U
gamepad which can be used for several
two-player tabletop games that only use
the gamepad and Sonic is spinning into a
few games there's sonic lost world at
the end of October and he'll be with
Mario in a new olympic winter sports
games edition that has an online feature
for competing with other players around
the world to win points for your home
country and sonic will also be coming to
Super Smash Brothers next year and how
about some gaming nostalgia for those of
you that had a windows 95 computer you
might remember the game hover it
came with windows 95 and that game is
back but now updated with better
graphics and playable on a web browser
Microsoft revived this capture the flag
hovercraft game to highlight the perks
of its latest internet explorer browser
but it can be played on other browsers
as well just go to hover IIE to play and
here's a little hidden easter egg when
you get to the main single or
multiplayer choice page just type bambi
on the keyboard and you can relive the
original game that came out 18 years ago
that's your tech news update but you can
get more details at cnet com / update
