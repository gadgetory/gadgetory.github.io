Carey and this is your cnet update folks
are buzzing again about Apple this time
there's a report that it might buy the
traffic app waze it's a social
navigation app with about 30 million
users TechCrunch has a source saying
that the app is asking for 750 million
dollars but Apple so far is only
offering 500 million Apple of course
would be interested in buying a
direction app to help strengthen its
troubled Maps app but apples got another
trouble this week the company said
there's a glitch with its new Do Not
Disturb feature and it won't be fixed
until Monday this feature on iOS 6 lets
users silence incoming calls alerts and
notifications but just for a preset time
window for example you might want to put
a Do Not Disturb on while sleeping so a
text message alert doesn't wake you up
but somehow the Do Not Disturb function
remains on past it's set time so people
are missing messages unless they
manually turn off the feature looks like
Sprint is planning to launch its own
prepaid service on january 25th with
four phones at least that's according to
a document leaked on the blog android
police these aren't the top phones and
smartphone plans cost 70 dollars a month
Sprint's prepaid business has always
come from its sister stores boost mobile
and virgin mobile boost and virgin had
better monthly rates but they do limit
download speeds when you hit a certain
threshold expect prepaid to be a bigger
area of competition in the coming year
especially with tmobile about to merge
with metro pcs and there's a new
operating system coming to the party
lubuntu which is an open-source
operating system for PCs and televisions
is launching a system for smartphones it
has several swiping gestures for
navigation it might remind you of webos
from the old palm phones this isn't
something you probably see for another
year but it will be on display at the
Consumer Electronics Show next week in
Las Vegas also at CES will learn more
about the smart evolution kit for
Samsung televisions last year samsung
said it was working on this device that
you stick in the back year TV to give it
a system upgrade so you can get the
benefits of the latest TVs without
having to buy a new one it's like a TV
brain transplant well samsung says such
a kit could cost between 200 to 300
dollars and we'll finally get more facts
on Monday at the show you want to keep
to seeing it all week for continuous
coverage of CES but our live video
coverage begins Monday and on Thursday
