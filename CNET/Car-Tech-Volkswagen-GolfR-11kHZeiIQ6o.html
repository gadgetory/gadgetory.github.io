cnet.com on the floor at the 2013
frankfurt motor show taking a look at
the new Volkswagen Golf R now this is
goes on the seventh generation golf
platform that just debuted and it's the
second generation of the Golf R well
fourth generation if you consider the
r32 models that came before but don't
get confused that's a lot of numbers the
important numbers are under the hood
it's got the newest generation of
Volkswagens 2-liter TSI turbo charged
engine that's going to use turbo
charging in direct injection to get you
296 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of
torque now that's pretty much subaru WRX
evo territory right there and like those
two vehicles is going to put the power
through all wheels via the 4motion
system this is VW 5th generation of poor
motion and it can do some pretty cool
things for example it can decouple the
rear axle when you're just cruising
around at highway speeds and don't need
the grip on the rear end so you don't
get the hit in fuel economy you normally
get with all-wheel drive systems but
then when you stop the pedal and really
neat that torque at the back end it can
send up to a hundred percent all 280
pound-feet to the rear axle when needed
and that power is also going to go
through the newest generation of VW SDFG
system or you can actually shift it
yourself with a six-speed manual in here
now this newest generation of the
Volkswagen Golf is actually going to go
on fill in the United States sometime in
late 2014 probably the 2015 model but
it'll be on European road sometime later
this year I've been and so on Goodwin on
the floor 2 2013 frankfurt motor show
taking a look at the new golf bar
