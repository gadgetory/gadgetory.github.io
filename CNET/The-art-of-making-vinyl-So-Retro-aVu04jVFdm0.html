record there you know dropping that
needle down on to the record taking it
out of the jacket stuff mainly kids and
when I say kids under 30 who have
discovered this new thing called the
records
you
so rainbow started in 1939 by a
gentleman by the name of Jack Brown I
joined rainbow in 1971 we didn't get
into conventional record-pressing until
the 50s that's pretty much the process
hasn't changed much at all matter of
fact some of our equipment out there the
record presses are 40 to 43 years old
and some of our other equipment goes
back to the 50s and 60s it got pretty
soft you know of course CDs came in in
the mid to late 80s pretty much wiped
out vinyl on the retail side so once you
got it out of retail stores and of
course our production went down we kept
our vinyl equipment knock on wood and
there was during the 90s it was very
very slow I mean it was maybe we were
making seven ten thousand records a week
in the early 2000s has started to
increase a bit and then towards two
thousand eight nine ten it was
increasing some more and then 2011 we
saw tremendous 10 11 we thought a big
increase
the current pressing the vinyl hasn't
changed a whole heck of a lot the first
step in making a record is to cut a
lacquer we do not do that here it's
either done in the studio or we order it
for customers
once that lacquer is cut it goes into a
plating tank
it's an electroplating process and we
spray it with silver to make it
conductive electricity and then it'll go
in and we'll make a negative off of the
lacquer which is a positive and then
we'll put that negative back in the
plating tank and that negative is now a
nickel plate and we'll put it back in
the plating tank and we will make a
positive off of that which is called a
mother and then that mother is used for
future negatives which are the stampers
that will then be prepared to go on the
press and that's what presses the record
then the record of course is a positive
our average day is about 23,000 records
and we run 24 hours a day five days a
week
I love the manufacturing process of it
um I'm more of a mechanical guy and so I
like the mechanics of it I like seen you
know a swing arm go in and deliver the
vinyl and it trim off and then just to
produce that piece and then to play it
and how great they sound is what I enjoy
I think vinyl will be around a long time
in the 80s I said I think vinyl will be
around longer than CDs I never expected
vinyl to have the resurgence that it did
you know it certainly didn't have a
crystal ball but I there was always the
audiophile guys who loved vinyl and I
always thought there'd be some vinyl
market but no I never had the
expectations of what's happened the last
five six
