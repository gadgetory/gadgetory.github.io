and this is the show where we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space now we
all love taking pictures with our
cameras but have you ever wanted to
transfer photos wirelessly and quickly
from one device to another well that's
why you're still watching this and I
have a couple of apps for both Android
and iOS that will do the trick now
you've heard of this first app called
bump it's free it works cross-platform
and allows you to send photos and
contacts from one person to another if
both people are using the app select the
pictures you want give them a little
bump and voila the pictures are received
on the other end it's real world proof
that Android and iOS can get it on but
my personal favorite app to transfer
photos is called photo transfer app
that's the name the universal app on iOS
costs 299 and it's 199 on Android now
you might not like paying for apps but
there are several key things that make
it worthwhile you can still send photos
from phone to phone cross-platform but
what about sending pictures from your
phone to view on a larger screen like
your iPad this app allows you to do that
you'll have to be on the same Wi-Fi
network and you'll pick which device is
the sender and which device is the
receiver I like how it organizes your
photo collection into groups of 100 to
keep tracks of the ones you're sending
and not only does it transfer photos but
video clips as well you know bump they
just can't do that now the other killer
feature is you can also send your
pictures or videos directly to any Mac
Windows or Linux computer by going to an
address on your web browser that the app
creates for you bottom line photo
transfer app is we're dropping the money
for now if you guys have any other after
you like us to tap send them to tap that
app at cnet com i'm brian Tong thanks
for watching and we'll see you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
