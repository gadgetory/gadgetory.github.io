I'm scene at CRC boy joined by senior
rider seth rosenblatt and seth are in
the middle of Mobile World Congress
right now in barcelona and google has an
interesting offer that's starting to
bubble up over there it's called a
project tango project tango it's perfect
for Barcelona tell us a bit more about
that so project tango is a really
interesting a new 3d mapping tool for
mobile phones and it's based on a new
processor that allows the phone to see
the world render it so that the phone
can understand it and then spit it back
out on your screen in a way that you can
understand it all in the blink of an eye
alright sounds cool but how and why
would I ever use this sure this could be
really really important for people who
are vision impaired helping them cross
streets helping map the interior of
buildings as they're walking as they're
moving through a new building for the
first time it could tell them this is a
wall here's the door here's the elevator
that you're looking for this also has
gaming implications to be able to turn a
real world space especially an indoor
space into a game again in the blink of
an eye and of course it has you know a
lot of fun implications to you can map
your room simply by waving your phone
around and then you can go to Ikea and
get whatever furniture you need so
that's what I'm picturing you're gonna
hold your phone and is it through the
camera that's how we create camera yep
okay and just to be clear this is not
available immediately this is not
available immediately but the CEO of the
company that makes the chip that's
partnered with google has told me that
this is coming in the coming quarters
this isn't something five years down the
line this is maybe two years down the
line if not sooner and do feel like
Google is doing this out of pressure to
what exactly to just develop their
camera app even further or to compete I
think this is Google's attempt to do a
lot of different things that it comes
from an interior group at Google that
they picked up from Motorola that has
roots in DARPA so they're really
interested in pushing what the
technology can do but of course Google
is obviously looking at this from its
traditional wheel houses and it's saying
oh well this is mapping Google does
really well with mapping
indoor mapping has been something that's
been challenging and difficult for not
just Google for everybody in them in the
mapping space so for them to get a leg
up especially on something like this is
phenomenal I guess what you can see how
it could also be paired and partnered
with all sorts of other apps to offer
what 3d models of the inside of shopping
malls for example or stores you know you
go into a bookstore where do you find
that specific book exactly exactly to go
into especially like a used bookstore to
use your example and to know exactly
where the fiction is or the cookbooks
are because you know used bookstores are
all different so something like that
could have a lot of very basic but very
helpful applications and now I'm seeing
the partnership between this and Google
glass mm-hmm imagine if you didn't even
have to hold up your phone exactly
exactly so if it's tied to glass if it's
tied to other wearables the implications
are really exciting I think so the fact
that this project even exists it's
coming out expect big news coming months
in the i would say probably within
within two years if not sooner and and
the fact that they're working with
existing phone makers they're working
with Google and Google Android and
they're working with chip makers this
isn't something where they're going to
compete with existing chip makers this
is an entirely new kind of hardware chip
so again this is going to change a lot
of things for a lot of different
industries anything else getting you
really excited out of a Mobile World
Congress you know there is one
interesting thing and that is that this
push at Mobile World Congress especially
this mobile world congress to develop
smartphones for emerging markets for the
developing world Microsoft and Nokia
just released their nokia X and that's a
version of Android that runs Microsoft
services that's aimed again at people
who've never had smartphones and Firefox
OS from Mozilla the people who make your
firefox browser have come out with a $25
smartphone very basic their dairy
somewhere but they are working with
partners and they've come up with some
very low-end hardware for people's first
smartphones because currently we've got
about two billion people on the internet
and all these vendors are looking at
where the
two billion are coming from and it's
going to be smart phones Nate great to
hear about some of the less publicized
news out of Mobile World Congress yeah
samsung who Seth Rosenblatt I'm cars too
