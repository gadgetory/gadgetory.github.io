can do all of our chatting with BOTS I'm
Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
dear viewers I don't mean to cause a
panic but I need to alert you that the
choppa inversion has begun and Facebook
is just the latest company said to be
incorporating BOTS into its messaging
services and no get out of here I'm not
talking about those BOTS talk about chat
bots bots are software programs that
will do your bidding to book
appointments or fetch answers from
different services so you don't have to
open up a different app for every task
you can think of it like a personal
assistant inside a text chat window on
Tuesday Facebook will announce that it's
putting bots inside of the messenger
chat service and that's according to a
report from TechCrunch the tech site
says Facebook is giving some developers
an early look at the tools to build live
chat BOTS for business clients so you
could just have a chat with a brand spot
when you need something instead of
calling a 1-800 number these chat BOTS
could pull up info about your online
order or even make a restaurant
reservation Facebook has tinkered with
the concept recently right now you can
book an uber car inside of messenger
while chatting with a friend and if you
fly with airline KLM you can look up
your flight information inside messenger
the social network is also testing
artificial intelligence with a personal
assistant called M which is similar in
concept to Apple's Siri or Microsoft's
Cortana in fact BOTS were the big topic
at Microsoft's Developers Conference in
March
Microsoft pushed programmers to make
BOTS to work inside Skype and with the
Cortana personal assistant one example
was the bot that booked you a hotel room
and another ordered pizza from dominos
and it doesn't have to be all with text
chat Skype can also have BOTS in video
form so basically Microsoft is building
a Max Headroom other competing chat apps
started embracing BOTS the app line
which is popular in Asia is allowing
programmers to test BOTS on its
messaging service and the app kick
launched a bot store just the other day
these chat BOTS for businesses are added
to your contacts sometimes the same way
you would add a friend but instead of
friendship
it's for news and customer service
facebook wants businesses to do more
with messenger but it's not all about
BOTS messenger also launched user names
for businesses as well as scannable
codes so a customer could use a phone to
scan a code and quickly jump to a
business page get ready to hear more
about bots on Tuesday at Facebook's f8
Developers Conference you can follow
CNET's live coverage of the keynotes
starting at 10 a.m. Pacific 1:00 p.m.
Eastern that's all for this tech news
roundup from our studios in New York I'm
