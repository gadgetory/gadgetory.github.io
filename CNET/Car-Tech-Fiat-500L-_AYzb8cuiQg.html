page out of the mini playbook and what
did many do they immediately went maxi
with like more models that are bigger
than they have that went smaller from
the original well now we have the Fiat
500l that is doing a similar walk 26 x 6
x 6 that's all you got to know 26 inches
longer 6 inches wider six inches taller
like a forty-two percent increase in
interior space that's a big jump in fact
the interior is like freakishly large
now to move around this big old chunk of
Italian you got to have a bigger motor
it's not considered a sport model but
they have equipped it with the sport
motor from the a barf the turbo version
of the smaller 500 that is a standard
power plant 6-speed manual or one of
those dual clutch I tend to like
dual-clutch transmissions on more
expensive cars go for the manual gearbox
in this guy inside a lot of nice
creature comforts including a very
unusual available panoramic glass roof
not on this car here on the stage but
that would be a nice touch in a vehicle
of this interior spaciousness why not go
all the way right now finally some 500 s
are getting good cabin tech this guy
will offer the 5 inch or the six and a
half inch version of the UConnect system
that's the big LCD touch version of what
is generally a really good rig from
Chrysler now in the Chrysler application
it has garmin navigation built in with
enormous usability ratings i don't know
if they're gonna get that in the 500l or
if they're gonna get that separate
TomTom unit that I really hate in the
smaller 500s anyway we now have a second
500 in the line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
