this chance to road test three action
cameras we have the eye on air pro to
the swan bolt HD and of course the new
gopro hero3 one of us will wear each of
the cameras will compare their ease of
use their image quality their overall
durability and their general action
Jackson awesomeness so our model and
tester for the GoPro hero3 is our
producer Sarah Harbin we finally it took
its a while but we figured out the
mounting system for the helmet here
we're just going to snap the sucker on
you kid it out you like a little GoPro
model girl epi skiing alright I'm going
to test the swan bolt HD and that
actually has a pole mount so Nick here
is helping me outsmart the mounting
system we're going to put it on the pole
and our PA / stuntman mchenry is going
to try out the eye on air pro 2 he's the
only one of us on a snowboard so we
actually get to try out the board mount
alright let's get it protected whoa
don't screw it up we're probably going
to gaff rotate these on a little bit
because we don't really want to lose
them although I feel like if you were
actually testing this losing it would be
pretty likely
yeah no hug no help at all
alright it's day two of the always-on
reindeer games and I have a little
update on our action camera shoot out
road test first up the hero 3 which was
a pretty good performer as long as you
can remember which button is which like
this one's power and this one's record
and listen for the beep then you'll know
what it's actually doing I on air pro 2
did not have a good day you saw us mount
and duct tape this thing to Nick
snowboard the first run he took and the
first ball he had it popped right off
and the mount totally failed the sticker
didn't work on top of that this thing
apparently froze we couldn't stop it
from recording but then all the video it
had was corrupted and wouldn't play
we're going to tape it back on and try
it again on that snowboard but I don't
have high hopes for I on ok and finally
the Swan bolt HD now I mounted this to
my pole yesterday after we reviewed the
footage we realized that you probably
only want to do that if someone else is
filming you with the pole the footage is
not that impressive so today I'm going
to try it on a chest mount and we'll
actually going to be moving the GoPro
from Sarah's helmet to a chest mount
also just for a little different video
but other than that this performed
pretty well the video looks ok except
that it has this awesome 1980 style time
and date stamp in the bottom I'm sure
there's a way to go into the magical
settings on your TV and like change that
but we couldn't figure out how and I
think it's kind of funny so we're going
to leave it we'll see how these guys do
today
alright it's time to review some of the
footage from our action cameras right
now we have the GoPro plugged in and we
know that GoPro generally speaking
usually a pretty good video quality but
let's see let's open up one of these big
eyes Sarah groans no warden oh look at
the sunshine all right that is
good-looking video so the upshot here
GoPro video looks good all right let's
see if today actually worked
they're digging like long ways yeah
really shaky i feeli taking bets on your
pork okay that actually that video files
to be good but it's sideways but it's
sideways crew this camera for a second I
couldn't help but notice that the camera
is round it's a round camera what why
would it ever be shooting sideways or up
ways or whatever and not just like one
it's round all right let's check out
mine The Swan the bolt HD looks okay are
you get pretty blown out like there were
no the GoPro and I on both you could see
the detail in the snow this is just sort
of a blinding white so this looks all
right from my mind the want the camera
that proved the easiest to use in the
most reliable despite some battery
issues and it pretty difficult for a
more upgrade how did we go pro yeah I
hate to say it I usually pull for the
underdogs but exactly it's not like we
don't love them but they're just you
know there they've been the winner for a
long time you know these guys are coming
up and I think they'll hopefully work
out some of these kinks for me it's go
pro then the ion despite the problems
that it had the salon to me is just like
that's not for some reason just not
complete actually you know what that's
not true screw the ion and it's sideways
video a round camera should not take
sideways video hi I'm is this it's all
about Swan you're the boss so you can
yell pro I can't disagree sideways to
know GoPro wins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
