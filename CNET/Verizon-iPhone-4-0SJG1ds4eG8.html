cnet.com today we take a first look at
the Verizon iPhone for indeed I was very
happy when Verizon and Apple announced
this phone in early January sure it's
great that ATT is no longer the
exclusive carrier but I'm more excited
that long discussed rumors finally been
put to rest so what is the Verizon
iPhone well the answer is the Verizon
iPhone is almost the same device as AT&amp;amp;T
counterpart there are a couple of
differences and one that's pretty
important but it's still the same phone
in most regards I'll start with the one
difference in the design to accommodate
the CDMA antenna the bringer switch has
been moved slightly closer to the volume
rocker also the gap that's currently on
top of the AT&amp;amp;T handset has been moved
to the top left side Apple would have
discussed the specifics of the redesign
but employment area testing we did an
account of the death group that we found
on the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone unfortunately though
the antenna change means that many
current iPhone cases like these here
won't fit so they need to buy new ones
also because it runs on CDMA the Verizon
iPhone doesn't have a SIM card slot
otherwise the Verizon handset is exactly
the same you'll find the same controls
camera features headset charger Jack's
speaker and microphone and Retina
display verizon says it will carry the
white iPhone but we still have no idea
when that will be last time I heard was
just signed in the spring now inside the
Verizon iPhone is one major difference
unlike the AT&amp;amp;T handset the Verizon
iPhone can function as a personal
hotspot for up to five devices you will
need to activate the hotspot
functionality with Verizon first but
once you do it will appear in the
settings menu so after you set a
password and you turn on the feature you
can get started you can connect devices
through Wi-Fi Bluetooth and also a USB
cable it's really nice as you can use
all three connection types at once
another difference is the Verizon iPhone
currently runs iOS 4 to 6 while in
comparison the 18 T iPhone runs iOS
4.2.1 Apple said 42.6 is a version
unique to the Verizon handset and the
only change that brings our CDMA support
and hotspot feature the other features
in the device are exactly the same so
expect to see no changes from the AT&amp;amp;T
phone of course there are a few things
the Verizon iPhone can't do unlike a TTS
handset it can't perform simultaneous
voice and data if you're on Wi-Fi it
does do that but if you're on a cell
network now and it doesn't offer global
roaming for Gia
some networks also the Verizon is
growing its LTE 4G network it's
currently Verizon iPhone tops out at 3G
we're still in the midst of testing the
device you'll have to read the review
for our full performance analysis voice
quality however we noticed few
differences but this is preliminary
testing so we want to emphasize that
whatever our results though I have to
stress that you shouldn't expect the
Verizon iPhone to be a miracle device
you'll see differences no doubt but
don't expect it to completely cure your
reception woes you're still using a
cellular network that will vary
according to your location interference
and how many people using it at one time
the expectations for Verizon iPhone are
immensely and ridiculously high and this
handset I have to say runs a big risk of
not living up to him that's why it's
important to keep those hopes in check
just recognize as a phone it's still
going to have problems once in a while
more importantly though the less
smartphone landscape is very very
different than it wasn't 2007 when the
first iPhone went on sale not only are
there are many other hand fantastic
smartphones on the market but also there
are a lot of people that are perfectly
happy with their non Apple device and
don't want to buy one the iPhone is on a
new care that's great there's more
customer choice and it remains a very
good phone but it remains just one
player in a very competitive field I'm
