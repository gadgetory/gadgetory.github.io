we have two products that could be
called phones or they could also be
called tablets but we like to call them
phablets it's a prize 5 punch out
between Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 and LG's
and tuition our judges for this fight
our senior editor Jessica dual-core
associate editor Lin LA and myself to
strong tone will take all three judges
blind scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth of a point the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
busy round 1 is designed the galaxy note
2 brings a familiar Samsung design
aesthetic but this time with a 5.5 inch
screen no doubt it's large and awkward
to hold at first but then you start
getting used to it with its curved edges
that make it easier to hold its s-pen
stylus slides right into the notes body
so you'll always have it with you and it
still passes my front pocket test now if
you think the note 2 is awkward to hold
then you haven't tried the LG intuition
its 5-inch screen changes it up with a 4
by 3 aspect ratio that makes it wider
and more difficult to hold its form
factor is a little harsher with squared
off corners and a textured back side now
it's not an ugly design but it just
won't value and its biggest flaw is
there's no place to store the stylus on
the intuition in fact someone might
actually ask you whoa what yeah what is
that a stylus in your pocket why yes it
is the Galaxy Note 2 gets a poor and the
intuition gets a 3 next round is user
interface and controls the note 2 brings
its own Samsung OS on top of Android
jelly
to enable the use of its s-pen it's kind
of a mixed bag because although you get
the benefits of the Google now services
and jellybeans awesome voice search and
commands and swiftkey flow keyboard for
tracing characters on a keyboard it's
straightforward and easy but it also
becomes more complicated when you throw
into the dual screen mode to run two
apps at the same time and then on top of
that throw in specific features for the
s-pen like air view for hovering over
items to preview them it's also annoying
that you're primarily using the stylus
you still have but then you have to
physically touch the backlit buttons on
the bottom so you'll be switching
between the stylus and your hand back
and forth now if you want to keep it
simple it's great and if you're willing
to learn more you can with the S Pen but
it can sometimes feel like there's a
little too much going on here now the LG
intuition really keeps it simple with
its Optimus UI three point 0 on top of
ice cream sandwich now you won't get all
the new jelly bean features but you'll
still have a lot of androids
customization and it's still snappy and
easier to use it also makes using it as
a notepad real easy with the button on
the top that throws you directly in the
quick memo mode for writing notes or
drawing sketches on top of the current
screenshot or standalone notes now you
don't really need the stylus you can
just use your good ole finger and it's
truly the easier of the two phablets to
use and that helps it here but at the
same time we really miss some of
jellybeans features under the hood the
Galaxy Note takes this round and just
edges it with the four and the LG
intuition gets a 3.7 so after averaging
two rounds the note 2 takes a strong
lead next round is features
Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 brings a
quad-core 1.6 gigahertz processor with
16 gig 32 gig and 64 gig storage options
it brings all of jellybeans goodies that
we hit on earlier and also has NFC for
beaming content from two different
devices and true multitasking with the
multi windows feature that I was
honestly impressed with its s voice is
all right but google's voice features
are much better now its biggest feature
is its s-pen stylus that brings a whole
new level of functionality to a device
that already acts like a phone you can
crop pictures from your screen with the
S Pen and then you're able to access
multiple brushes by selecting them on
the S Pen for sketching and note
projects or even jotting down ideas and
adding voice memos on top of your notes
this is the most productive phone or
phablet we've seen if you're willing to
learn the system now the LG intuition
brings a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor that's no slouch and it really
doesn't feel like it lags behind because
it has a simpler OS that's not as
demanding the intuition also brings NFC
but it's quick memo feature is what
makes it unique and makes note-taking
easy but it's just not nearly as robust
as the note 2 Samsung takes another
round with the 4.7 and the intuition
gets a 3
83 next round is web browsing and
multimedia the Galaxy Note 2's HD amoled
screen is massive with its 1280 by 720
resolution that looks killer for
watching any type of multimedia or
playing games and surfing the web the
intuition brings a 1024 x 768 resolution
and it handles surfing the web just fine
but you lose so much screen real estate
when you're watching widescreen
multimedia content and having to
manually go into the settings to correct
the aspect ratio for certain games and
apps is annoying every time now the
Chrome browser runs great on both
platforms and it's still our top pick
for one of the best mobile browsers both
phablets bring 8 megapixel cameras with
1080p video capture but when comparing
the two the no 2 brought slightly
sharper pictures with richer colors
compared to the intuition the Galaxy
Note 2 takes its 4th round in a row four
point seven two four and after averaging
four rounds Samsung has a solid lead the
final round that decides it all is
called quality and performance
these two phablets are big but let's not
forget they're still phones and your
call quality and LTE speeds will vary
depending on carrier overall call
quality was great on both phones and
data speeds were excellent now both
bones were very snappy when flowing
through their interfaces but we might
give a slight edge to the slightly
snappier note 2 and when it comes to
battery life in our cnet battery drain
test we were able to squeeze out 12.5
hours of video playback on the galaxy
note 2 compared to nine point nine five
hours of juice with the intuition for a
big screen that's impressive and again
the Galaxy Note takes this round with a
perfect five and the intuition gets a
4.3 so let's average out all five rounds
and this would be no surprise with the
note 2 dominated all rounds and takes
this prizefight 4.5 to 3.4 and is your
prize fight winner this might seem like
a butt whooping but the LG intuition is
still a legitimate option it was just
Samsung's feature and power pack note to
that really had a chance to flex its
muscle in the battle for phablets ooh
privacy I'm Brian Tom thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
on another prize
