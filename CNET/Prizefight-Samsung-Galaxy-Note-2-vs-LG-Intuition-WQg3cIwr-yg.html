have two products that could be called
foams or they could also be called
tablets but we like to call them
phablets it's a prizefight punch out
between Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 and LG's
and tuition our judges for this fight
are senior editor Jessica dual court
associate editor Lynn LA and myself
- strong tone we'll take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth of a point the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system let's get busy round one is
design the galaxy note 2 brings a
familiar Samsung design aesthetic but
this time with a 5.5 inch screen no
doubt it's large and awkward to hold at
first but then you start getting used to
it with its curved edges that make it
easier to hold
if S Pen Stylus slides right into the
notes body so you'll always have it with
you and it still passes my front pocket
test now if you think the note 2 is
awkward to hold then you haven't tried
the LG intuition
it's 5-inch screen changes it up with a
four by three aspect ratio that makes it
wider and more difficult to hold its
form factor is a little harsher with
squared off corners and a textured
backside now it's not an ugly design but
it just won't value and its biggest flaw
is there's no place to store the stylus
on the intuition in fact someone might
actually ask you whoa what yeah but it's
not a stylus in your pocket why yes it
is the Galaxy Note 2 gets a four and the
intuition gets a three next round is
user interface and controls the Note 2
brings its own Samsung OS on top of
Android jellybean
to enable the use of its s-pen it's kind
of a mixed bag because although you get
the benefits of the Google now services
and jellybeans awesome voice search and
commands and swift key flow keyboard for
tracing characters on a keyboard it's
straightforward and easy but it also
becomes more complicated when you throw
into the dual screen mode to run two
apps at the same time and then on top of
that throw in specific features for the
s-pen like air view for hovering over
items to preview them it's also annoying
that you're primarily using the stylus
you still have but then you have to
physically touch the backlit buttons on
the bottom so you'll be switching
between the stylus and your hand back
and forth now if you want to keep it
simple it's great and if you're willing
to learn more you can with the s-pen but
it can sometimes feel like there's a
little too much going on here now the LG
intuition really keeps it simple with
its Optimus UI 3.0 on top of Ice Cream
Sandwich now you won't get all the new
jellybean features but you'll still have
a lot of androids customization and it's
still snappy and easier to use it also
makes using it as a note pad real easy
with the button on the top that throws
you directly in the quick memo mode for
writing notes or drawing sketches on top
of the current screen shot or standalone
notes now you don't really need the
stylus you can just use your good ol
finger and it's truly the easier of the
two phablets to use and that helps it
here but at the same time we really
missed some of jellybeans features under
the hood the Galaxy Note takes this
round and just edges it with the four
and the LG intuition gets a 3.7 so after
averaging two rounds the note 2 takes a
strong lead next round is features
Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 brings a
quad-core 1.6 gigahertz processor with
16 gig 32 gig and 64 gig storage options
it brings all of jellybeans goodies that
we hit on earlier and also has NFC for
beaming content from two different
devices and true multitasking with the
multi windows feature that I was
honestly impressed with it's s voice is
alright but Google's voice features are
much better now its biggest feature is
its S Pen Stylus
that brings a whole new level of
functionality to a device that already
acts like a phone you can drop pictures
from your screen with the S Pen and then
you're able to access multiple brushes
by selecting them on the S Pen for
sketching and note projects or even
jotting down ideas and adding voice
memos on top of your notes this is the
most productive phone or phablet we've
seen if you're willing to learn the
system now the LG intuition brings a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor that's no
slouch and it really doesn't feel like
it lags behind because it has a simpler
OS that's not as demanding the intuition
also brings NFC but it's quick memo
feature is what makes it unique and
makes note-taking easy but it's just not
nearly as robust as the note 2 samsung
takes another round with the 4.7 and the
intuition gets a
three next round is web browsing and
multimedia the Galaxy Note 2's HD AMOLED
screen is massive with its 1280 by 720
resolution that looks killer for
watching any type of multimedia or
playing games and surfing the web
the intuition brings a 1024 by 768
resolution and it handles surfing the
web just fine but you lose so much
screen real estate when you're watching
widescreen multimedia content and having
to manually go into the settings to
correct the aspect ratio for certain
games and apps is annoying every time
now the Chrome browser runs great on
both platforms and it's still our top
pick from one of the best mobile
browsers both phablets bring eight
megapixel cameras with 1080p video
capture
well when comparing the two the no2
brought slightly sharper pictures with
richer colors compared to the intuition
the galaxy note 2 takes its fourth round
in a row four point seven to four and
after averaging four rounds Samsung has
a solid lead the final round that
decides it all is called quality and
performance
these two ballots are big but let's not
forget they're still phones and your
call quality and LTE speeds will vary
depending on carrier overall call
quality was great on both phones and
data speeds were excellent
now both phones were very snappy when
flowing through their interfaces but we
might give a slight edge to the slightly
snappier note - and when it comes to
battery life and our C net battery drain
test we were able to squeeze out 12.5
hours of video playback on the Galaxy
Note 2 compared to nine point nine five
hours of juice with the intuition for a
big screen that's impressive
and again the Galaxy Note takes this
round with a perfect 5 and the intuition
gets a 4.3 so let's average out all 5
rounds and this would be no surprise
with the note 2 dominated all rounds and
takes this prizefight 4.5 to 3.4 and is
your prize by Twitter this might seem
like a butt whooping but the LG
intuition is still a legitimate option
it was just Samsung's feature and power
pack note 2 that really had a chance to
flex its muscle in the battle for
phablet supremacy i'm brian tom thanks
for watching we'll catch you guys next
time on another private
