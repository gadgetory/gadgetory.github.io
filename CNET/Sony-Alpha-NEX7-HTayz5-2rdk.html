CNET and this is the sony alpha nex-7
this may not be a perfect
interchangeable lens camera but the NEX
seven comes closer for enthusiasts than
almost any I've seen thus far that's why
it's earned an editor's choice for this
class of camera the NEX seven has almost
everything built in flash and OLED EDF a
large sensor tilting LCD and relatively
serious video features its innovative to
dial system takes the predominantly
screen based NEX operation and moves a
chunk of it back to the hardware
controls where enthusiasts want it
um while the price is high for a non
professional model given the package it
doesn't really seem ripoff high in part
that's because I really enjoy shooting
with the camera partly because it's a
perfect size with a comfortable grip
it's not so small that it gets
overwhelmed by the lenses as the smaller
NEX models do but it is small enough to
be less conspicuous than a DSLR for
street photography the some of the top
and back buttons are hard to find by
feel when you're looking through the
viewfinder overall everything can be
customized for the most fluid personal
shooting experience possible like some
of Panasonic's ILCs
the NEX 7's pop-up flash can be tilted
back for a bounce or effect
unfortunately the fluid experience comes
to a dead stop when you have to go into
the menu system to change something that
you don't use on a regular basis the
neatly organized top level of icons
bligh the unsorted Anarchy below I swear
some of the options move when I'm not
looking in part it's because Sony throws
everything that doesn't fit into one of
the 5 other categories into the setup
menu the 24 megapixel resolution of the
sensor helps to compensate for the other
processing the extra pixels help retain
detail in the face of otherwise heavy
luminance noise reduction and while it's
not super fast all around the camera
delivers good to excellent shooting
speed overall but more important the EVF
refreshes quickly enough to make burst
shooting and panning comfortable an
excellent camera for advanced
photographers that's fun to shoot with
the NEX 7's few flaws don't seriously
detract
from an otherwise winning package I'm
