here with the Samsung Galaxy s5 we're
going to take a look at some of the new
software features and some of the new
camera tricks Samsung describes the new
interface for the s5 as very clean and
that all begins with the lockscreen
which gets a cool new bubbly animation
once you unlock it you'll see that
things are looking a little bit neater a
little bit flatter and a little bit
square as well one thing that's new is
this new settings menu so if I open the
Settings app here you can see that
everything is a lot more pleasingly laid
out it feels a little bit less dense
than this menu used to something else I
want to mention is what Samsung calls
the OneTouch toolbox that is this
movable little dot down here and
whenever you tap that it brings up a
series of shortcuts if you don't like it
though you can turn it off entirely as
well as a slightly new look for the
icons of all the regular default apps
there's a new notification panel that
again looks a lot cleaner you get these
rounded icons along the top if you're
thinking of giving this phone to
children you might want to turn on kids
mode this basically puts the phone into
a version that's safe for kids and it
has all these kid-friendly versions of
apps so if I tap this little monster
with the camera here you get this
kid-friendly camera software so there
are some nice aesthetic changes but what
about this phone is going to make your
life more easy on a practical level well
fire up the settings menu you might be
interested to check out this power
saving mode and if you turn that on it
turns the phone's display monochrome it
dims the whole display and it restricts
the Galaxy s5 to just a handful of basic
apps including the phone and messages
samsung says this mode will get you 24
hours of standby time with the phone's
last 10 percent of battery finally I
just want to mention a little bit about
the camera this is a 16 megapixel camera
samsung says it's got a sensor that's
even bigger than the s4 and it's got a
couple of tricks up its sleeve one of
those is a very fast autofocus samsung
says this phone focuses in naught point
3 seconds
and that's the fastest ever autofocus on
a smartphone testing it out here in
quite dim tradeshow conditions it
definitely seems to be finding its point
to focus very swiftly so like other
Samsung Galaxy phones this thing has so
many camera modes it will be impossible
to cover them all right now but one
thing I do want to focus on focus get it
is this the selective focus mode now
what this does is it lets you select
your subject and then when you take the
picture it automatically blurs out
everything else keeping it out of focus
and the idea is that you get a more
professional photo once the photos
processed you can then choose what part
of the photo you want to be in focus we
found that when we were trying it in
here it didn't work particularly well
all the time but we did manage to get a
couple of nice snaps so maybe what it
demands is a bit of trial and error
Samsung's also added a new HDR feature
and what that means is that when you
turn it on you can see how your HDR
photo will look you don't have to wait
until you've actually taken the photo
what do you think of the galaxy s5 are
you tempted to buy re feeling a little
underwhelmed let me know and check out
