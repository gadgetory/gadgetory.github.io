of products we're expecting from Apple
before the end of the year let's get
down to the core of Apple news and
rumors
September is shaping up to be a busy
month for Apple if you believe the hype
and it's not just iPhones we're talking
about long time Apple analysts michi
quote detailed at least five other Apple
products slated to make their big debut
before the end of the year
iPads Apple watches MacBooks air pods in
the air power map and some of these
coincide with the new products Apple has
already registered with the Eurasian
Economic Commission as highlighted by
French side console Mac so let's break
it all down iPhones we definitely know
we're getting new iPhones a 5.8 and 6.5
inch OLED models and a 6.1 inch model
with an LCD screen all of which we can
now see in this leaked from Ben Gaskin
which shows the thicker bezels on the
LCD screen
screens made by LG this time and not
Samsung according to a recent digitized
report and Apple is apparently betting
on that cheaper model the report also
says Apple has ordered 20 million LCD
screens compared to the 3 to 4 million
OLED screens we don't know the official
names of these phones yet but they have
been registered as a nineteen eight
twenty and a twenty one next there's
iPads a new twelve point nine and eleven
inch iPad pro resembling the iPhone 10
so face ID instead of home button and
those barely there bezels 95 Mac
published these mock-ups so we can start
to get a feel of what these will look
like - the notch which I don't think
we're gonna avoid on these products
either now Apple watches the series 4
will apparently come in two sizes a 1.5
7 inch display and a one-point 78 inch
display this means the smaller one of
these would actually be bigger than the
current large model of the series 3
following this trend of slimmer bezels
of course as shown in this 9 to 5 Mac
mock-up air Potts
we're gonna get a sequel with hands-free
Siri and that wireless charging case
that will take full advantage of the air
power mat that's been m.i.a since last
September which we will apparently see
finally in this next launch just note
that the air pods and the Apple watch
did not
make it in the register at least not the
one published in console Mac so take
that as you will and lastly Mac books
two of which Apple has just announced
but it has registered more who also says
it's still planning an iMac update a Mac
Mini update along with a budget notebook
to replace the air so they're still hope
for that the question here is timing
there are so many products that Apple
may choose to divide them up between two
launch events one in September and the
other one in October or November
or maybe just launch them on the DL like
they did with the pros last week Apple
announced a refresh to its MacBook Pro
lineup which our own Dan Ackerman has
already tested out new Intel chips new
RAM and storage options a true tone
display a new teeth to processor for
security and encryption and a hands-free
Siri but on the outside you would barely
be able to tell that he's talking about
new MacBook Pros because they look
exactly the same and what about that
faulty butterfly keyboard that Apple has
been in the hot seat for looks pretty
much the same although according to
Apple its third gen keyboard is designed
for quieter typing so they did not
address the main issue or did they
during a traditional teardown site
iFixit discovered a thin layer of
silicon under their controversial
butterfly keyboards that would get stuck
with just the tiniest speck of dust
according to the site this thin layer
does in fact protect the keys from this
problem and it could be Apple's way of
admitting that there was in fact a
problem in the first place the company
has offered to replace some of these
faulty keyboards that has not
acknowledged a design flaw iFixit also
found that they have a larger battery
and speakers and a trackpad that's
easier to repair
but what you're looking for is more
productivity on the iPad this next bit
of news maybe for you
rumor has it Photoshop will soon be
coming to the iPad according to a
Bloomberg report Adobe has long had
companion apps with some functionality
on iPhone and iPad but not like the
Microsoft Surface tablet which is able
to run the full version this software
developer is planning to unveil this new
Photoshop app at its annual Mac's
creative conference in October
maybe alongside new iPad pros with the
apps slated to hit the market in 2019
according to the site and this week was
national emoji day and to celebrate
Apple teased out just a few of the
newest members of the clan that we can
expect to come to the iPhone and iPad
later this year in a victorious win for
gingers Apple's new lineup includes a
redheaded option no seriously this is a
big deal there was even a change.org
petition for it other hair options
include white hair curly hair and no
hair a Colden party smiley face lobsters
kangaroos and my all-time favorite fruit
which is finally worthy of its own emoji
mango according to Apple there will be
70 new emojis coming to its devices in
one of its iOS updates not clear which
one or when but apples love of emojis
did not stop there
the company swapped out all the
headshots of its top executives with
their meme og version some like Johnny
and I were pretty spot-on as you can see
while others let's just say they were
more flattering versions of themselves
guys we are weeks away from the next
Apple event and we still don't know what
the iPhones are gonna be called what do
you think they should be named sound off
