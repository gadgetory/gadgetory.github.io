probably familiar with the irobot roomba
line of robot vacuums but our robot
actually makes a ton of cleaning
products they make the scuba the Roomba
and also this Brava this is the Brava
380 T it's not a vacuum and won't suck
things up into a bin but it does have
cleaning pads that you can stick onto it
like this dry one or this microfiber wet
one so you can do wet cleaning or dry
cleaning with this thing taking a look
at the design of the Brava it's small
its lightweight easy to use easy to
manage it's got this handle in the back
so you can just grab it from the back
and pick it up like that I don't love
the handle though wish it was in a
different location because that Brava
uses this vertical charger so you'll set
it down on the same side as the handle
you can't use the handle to pick it up
then and when you're setting it down
you're carrying it like this you have to
flip it over anyway so it's kind of
inconvenient I wish it was on the top or
some other place where it didn't get in
the way of the docking process another
problem I have with the braava is that
it has to be in this vertical dock it's
not a dock like the Roomba that the
Roomba will automatically find its way
back to you have to start it and when
it's done you have to put it back in our
test I found that the dry cleaning cloth
that comes with the braava wasn't
terribly effective for dust type
particles we spread some cornstarch over
a Florida get an approximation of a
really dusty floor and then set the
Bravo loose on dry sweeping mode and you
can see the floor looks pretty clean as
it goes about but all that white
cornstarch just really gets pushed to
the side however when we switched over
to the wet mopping mode and repeated
that test the braava did much better we
also tried using the braava to clean
more messy messes things like pasta
sauce mud and splattered oil stains the
braava did ok but mostly it just smeared
things around especially on tile where
it's really smooth on the ceramic tile
we tested it just didn't clean much of
it up and it left a lot of it behind in
the grout that said on vinyl surfaces
the braava did pretty well we spread mud
all over the place and take a look at
the pictures before and after almost
spotless did a very good job in this
test the irobot braava 380 t retails for
$300 and that's considerably less than
the Roomba 880 and also less than the
iRobot scuba their other floor washing
robot that said the cleaning performance
of the braava didn't blow
away it was just so so and it varied
greatly from surface to surface so
unless you have one of those surfaces
that it does particularly well on I say
pass and wait for something else for
seeing that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
