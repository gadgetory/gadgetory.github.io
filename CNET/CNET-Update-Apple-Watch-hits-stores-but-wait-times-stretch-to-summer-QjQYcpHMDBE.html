an Apple watch but not yet take it home
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your seen
that update if you have not yet ordered
an Apple watch you may have to wait
until the summer to own one on Friday
apple began taking pre-orders for its
first SmartWatch and supply went so fast
that within an hour the delivery date
was pushed to may in June for some
models the first orders will be
delivered in two weeks on friday april
24th but if you want to feel it for
yourself before the launch the watches
are now on display as stores around the
world for you to try on I stopped by the
New York City flagship apple store on
Fifth Avenue to see the fitting
experience first hand very few people
were lined up outside to get
appointments when the store opened at
9am some were up at 3am ordering online
and came by to touch and feel what they
just paid for others were Apple fans
that didn't pre-order but stop by at a
curiosity to see it in person in the
case of this 16 year old on spring break
trying it on convinced him to pre-order
right there with an employee at the
store now you can make an appointment
for fitting online or by walking into a
store if you want to try on the luxury
$10,000 gold edition model keep in mind
that not all stores carry it so check
ahead online the fitting gives you a
chance to see what the different bands
are like but the watch itself will loop
a demo and you can feel the taptic
feedback this is not a buzz like a phone
vibration it really feels like a tiny
tapping on your wrist I tried on the
mid-range stainless steel Apple watch
thirty eight millimeter size with a pink
modern buckle strap the total price
seven hundred and fifty dollars I also
tried on the same model with a Milanese
loop strap that's six hundred and fifty
dollars now both felt comfortable around
my tiny wrist and certainly getting on
your wrist makes it so tempting to order
one right there the process is very
personalized like picking out jewellery
even if you don't have an appointment to
try it on you can still see what the
watch is like in stores with demo models
that are affixed to tables you can't
take it off the table but you can scroll
through the screens at your own pace the
experiences were similar around the
globe the first stores to offer
were in Australia and in London in
France some high-end department stores
have special Apple sections next to
other luxury watch brands like the
Galeries Lafayette in Paris and
selfridges in London is the only non
apple shop in the UK where it can be
seen on Friday apple also began taking
orders for the new ultra thin gold
colored macbook which starts at thirteen
hundred dollars not long after going on
sale the wait time for delivery for a
gold model was pushed three to four
weeks but silver and Space Gray ready to
ship within one to three business days
