here just happening this week that's
great the light bandit sucks natural
light into your home and allows you to
redistribute it using a long straw-like
fiber-optic tube you simply place this
square box shaped device into your
window and well up you have a light tube
that will pour natural light into any
space of your house for free the box
according to inventor Duncan Earle
contains nearly 100 tiny mirrors that
rotate very slowly to reflect the
sunlight toward a focusing mirror which
concentrates the sunlight into the
optical fiber the light bandit is
currently raising funds on Kickstarter
and if you act now they'll throw in a
handheld light bandit device for showing
off to your friends and a light and at
lightsaber sound effect on the Mars
levitating speaker features a UFO style
disc that floats above a sleek black
subwoofer column and that's not all the
Mars bluetooth speaker made by the
company crazy baby which they probably
are is a two-part speaker the
cylindrical sub frequency for music and
the floating UFO looking thingy is also
a speaker pumping out the high and
mid-range frequencies the floating part
otherwise known as the Mars craft uses
magnetic technology developed by
levitation arts to float you can take
the Mars craft with you making your jams
portable and the entire unit will raise
its volume or lower it based on how far
away you are from the planet the sound
comes out of all types of the speaker's
filling your area with tunes and it
includes two USB ports for charging your
devices
maybe while you're on a conference call
using the Mars feature right now you can
pre-order your Mars speaker for $149 at
crazy baby calm a team of researchers at
the University of Bristol in the
department of computer science are using
ultrasound technology to create a
three-dimensional shape in midair that
can be touched and seen by a user
ultrasound produces an effect known as
acoustic radiation force which the
researchers found can be focused into
complex patterns in such a way as to
cause an air disturbance
using this property of ultrasound the
researchers are able to create 3d haptic
shapes in midair so that users can feel
those air disturbances on the skin
moreover those patterns can then be
formed into different 3d shapes
according to a paper published by the
research group and the journal ACM
transactions on graphics this approach
applies to the principles of acoustic
radiation force we're by the nonlinear
effects of sound produced forces on the
skin which are strong enough to generate
tactile sensations the user perceives a
discernable haptic shape then the
corresponding acoustic interference
pattern is generated above a precisely
controlled two-dimensional phased array
of ultrasound transducers I don't know
does this look real I don't know leave
leave a comment tell me if you think
it's real all right guys that's a show
