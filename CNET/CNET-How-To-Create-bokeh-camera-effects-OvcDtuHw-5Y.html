with your DSLR is to create a bouquet
effect
okay comes from the Japanese word for
blur and you've seen this effect all the
time in portrait photography the
foreground subject is in sharp focus and
the background is a beautiful hazy
dreamy blur if you've been wondering how
to get a shot like this I'm going to
show you how the trick to getting the
shot is to crank your camera down to its
lowest aperture setting for example the
zoom ones that came with my camera
states right here that the lowest
aperture setting is a 3.5 a lens with a
1.8 or a 2.3 would be even more dramatic
but let's make this work I'm going to
put my camera into manual mode or
program mode or aperture priority mode
where I can set the aperture manually on
this camera I can set the aperture using
this dial bringing it all the way down
to a 3.5 once the lens is letting in
this much light the image tends to blow
out if your camera isn't compensating
for that automatically bring the ISO
down until the exposure looks normal
finally let's focus in on our subject
and when you do you're going to notice
that the background gets nice and blurry
and then you can take the shot
to see if we can take this further let's
try another location and another lens
this is a 50 millimeter prime lens which
means no zoom a fixed focal range and in
this case a 1.8 for the lowest aperture
setting which is ideal again well dial
in the lowest number which means the
widest aperture in this case 1.8 and
then adjust the ISO maybe even the
shutter speed to get the exposure right
focus and shoot
now--if bouquet is so pretty why not use
it in every situation well you're
basically obliterating the background of
anything you're shooting if you're
shooting your kids birthday party or
vacation photos you want to have the
background you want to have the context
that's the whole reason for taking the
shot second when you have the aperture
open this wide it's very difficult to
hold focus there's very little margin
for error so maybe the subjects nose is
in focus but things start to get fuzzy
around the ears and if you're shooting
something that's moving forget about it
bouquet is great for shooting portraits
it's great for shooting artsy photos of
inanimate objects anything that's
standing still and now you know how to
do it so go out and give it a try i'm
