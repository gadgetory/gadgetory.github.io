CES 2018 in LG displays booth behind me
is one of the coolest things I've ever
seen
this is a rollable OLED television 65
inch TV the LG Display has developed as
a prototype to show to other
manufacturers this is not something
that's coming out right now but it is
something that could be easily coming
out in the next few years the idea here
is the TV rolls up into a little tube
about 100 millimeters in diameter and it
fits down into this little box now of
course that makes the TV completely able
to disappear it will and of course you
can bring it down a little bit or all
the way and the TV itself actually
changes the amount of video on the
screen right now I'm going to show you
the 21 by 9 mode we can actually have
the TV display 21 by 9 wide aspect ratio
movies without the black bars there's
another mode where you bring it all the
way down and the TV has a few apps that
appear on the top so you can just have
the TV peaking up a tiny bit and the
rest of the space doesn't have this big
ugly black box of course this is a
mock-up here we're looking at a
prototype this little box on the bottom
here LG says for example you could build
it into a piece of furniture you could
actually make it portable they told me
that there's actually a mock-up that
they have with handles on either side
they were toting it around to different
rooms to test how it works so the again
the idea is making this TV much more
versatile making a large screen portable
and small so you can take it wherever
you want so that's a quick look at the
amazing rollable 65 inch OLED display
this is from LG displays booth at CES
2018 here it goes this might be the last
you see of it for a little while but
again one of the very coolest things
I've ever seen and one of the coolest
TVs at CES 2018
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
