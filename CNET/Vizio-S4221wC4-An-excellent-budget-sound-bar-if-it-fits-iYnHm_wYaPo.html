and today we're taking a look at the
Vizio s 4221 WC 4 this is a 2.1 sound
bar system and it's currently selling
for 250 dollars the Vizio style doesn't
stand out much but that's generally a
good thing when it comes to sound bars
there's a large black speaker grille on
the front with a thin strip of silver
running along the bottom on the far left
there's a series of LEDs that do give
you a good job of visual feedback on the
volume level the included subwoofer is
Wireless which means you have some
flexibility on where you place it
although you'll typically get the best
sound quality if it's within a few feet
of the sound bar one drawback to the
design is that it might block your TV's
remote sensor if you place it in front
of your TV it's a significant problem as
you'll find yourself holding the remote
in the air angling to get the remote
signals to your TV if you're considering
the sound bar your best bet is to find
your TV's remote sensor and break out a
tape measurer to figure out if the 3.74
inch high cabinet will get in the way
the included remote is excellent it has
a substantial feel and a minimalist
selection of buttons that fall easily
under your thumb even better is the
built-in display which lets you look at
the remote right in your hand rather
than squinting across the room at a tiny
display on the sound bar on the back
there are four inputs optical coaxial
mini jack and analog that should be
enough for all your gear as long as
you're using your TV to switch between
devices
there's also built-in bluetooth which
means you can wirelessly stream audio
from the vast majority of smartphones
and tablets for sound quality we had
resident audio file steve guttenberg
give the system a listen and he was
pretty impressed especially for the
price the physios DTS true surround mode
helped create a wide soundstage on most
movies and the subwoofer was able to get
deep while staying well defined it even
held its own with stereo music which is
typically tough for sound bars now
overall it wasn't quite as good as a
sony HTC t2 60 which is our favorite
pick at this price but it was a very
close match between the two systems so
altogether the
just not much to complain about on the s
4221 w it sounds great it looks good and
it offers all the features I consider
important for a budget sound bar my only
hesitation is that the design will block
your TV's remote sensor in many setups
but if you can get around that quirk
it's an awfully good value for two
hundred and fifty dollars I'm Matthew
