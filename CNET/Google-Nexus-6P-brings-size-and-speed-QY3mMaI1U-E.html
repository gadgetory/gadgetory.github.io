made by Huawei now it has a 5.7 inch
AMOLED display there's also forward
facing speakers for sound and around the
back is the same twelve point three
megapixel sony manufactured sensor
camera right here now it has a pixel
pitch of 1.5 5 micron pixels this means
that the pixel sites are generally
bigger than those found on other mobile
cameras and google says this negates the
need for using optical image
stabilization basically because the
pixel sites can gather a lot more light
which makers it ideal for low-light
situations the fingerprint sensor around
the back is also a key to the Nexus 6p

whole bunch of different features such
as Android pay and also going into the

information depending on what app you're
in and you long press on the home button

messaging app

talking about and then give you a whole
bunch of different information such as
bars and movies locations and two
options to create things like calendar
events around the front as well is the 8
