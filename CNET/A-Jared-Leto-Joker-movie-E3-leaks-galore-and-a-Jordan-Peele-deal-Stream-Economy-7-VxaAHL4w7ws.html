Emma and your time is money and that's
why I'm looking at all the biggest news
across movies TV and games and telling
you where to put your fan investments
let's kick things off this week with
movies specifically this Joker right
here Oh
earlier this week Variety reported a
pretty big exclusive sources told them
Jared Leto was set to star an executive
produce a standalone Joker movie
branching off from Suicide Squad oh you
guys are probably wondering the same
thing I am which is why would Warner
Brothers give the worst Joker his own
standalone movie I don't know you're
probably also wondering what's that
Suicide Squad kind of a terrible movie
yeah yeah it really was
and you're also probably asking yourself
hey didn't I hear about a standalone
Joker movie with Joaquin Phoenix
starring in it yes that is true that
movie is still happening but Warner
Brothers says it's under an origins
banner that is completely separate from
the DC Cinematic Universe this is a mess
a mess not unlike the last season of
hoarders this is you DC this is you at
the end of the day nobody wants this you
know we do want we want more Wonder
Woman we want a detective Batman movie
that I'm dying for I also can't wait for
the birds-of-prey movie starring Margot
Robbie as Harley Quinn that's a Suicide
Squad spinoff I can get behind this is a
dub Servier and at the end of the day
dumpster fires must be sold off it's a
fire sale everybody needs to get out
don't ever watch Suicide Squad again
it's the worst I've gotten out my rage
so let's move from kind of angry
inducing movie news to really good TV
news during peels making money moves
Jordan peels production company monkey
paw is officially signed to a first-look
TV deal at Amazon I realized that a lot
of you don't work in the industry and so
you might not actually know what a
first-look deal is specifically so I
figured this is a good time to educate
you so a first-look deal is with one
party in this case that would be Amazon
gets first dibs on anything that the
second party which in this case would be
monkeypod Productions is cooking up so
monkey paw is making a show or they're
developing
something Amazon will always get first
pick on whether or not to make that show
happen so if they don't like it if they
pass on it monkeypod can take that show
anywhere else but Amazon gets first dibs
so for now monkey paw is actually
already working on two shows for Amazon
they're working on a Nazi hunting drama
that's called the hunt and they're also
working on a Lorena Bobbitt documentary
which is kind of surprising but at the
end of the day Jordan Peele is coming
off a huge Oscar win for get out and if
you haven't seen get out get out that's
what I say to it honestly Jordan Peele I
would buy anything that you sell me so
get all in on monkey paw productions
they're making great stuff they're
awesome
oh my god speaking of excitement III is
here it's time to speculate crackdown 3
has been officially delayed until
February of 2019 which is a huge bummer
for fans hoping the game would finally
make it to Xbox one by the holidays this
game was originally slated for release
on November 7 2017 meaning it's well
over a year late it's been delayed twice
already and if I'm being honest I'm not
really sure what Microsoft's gonna do
with their press conference if this was
their big exclusive for the year
honestly we're all gonna have to cross
our fingers for a surprise halo 6
announcement my favorite rumor is that
CD Projekt RED will bring cyberpunk 2077
to the show this game was announced six
freaking years ago and CD Projekt RED
says it's a quote true RPG regardless of
all the hullabaloo CD Projekt RED will
be at e3 and they are supposedly showing
off an RPG for both consoles and PC now
if it looks like a duck walks like a
duck quacks like a duck it's a cyberpunk
2077 that's what my grandma always used
to say so I'm gonna go ahead and guess
that that's what it is but who knows
maybe they scrapped everything and
they're gonna come out with an entirely
new game I have no idea other rumors at
e3 a lot of good ones hitman 2 just
cause for an n64 classic could be on the
horizon for tonight force which pretty
much leaked and on top of that somebody
was saying online that there could be a
star fox racing game III is like nerd
Christmas it's gamer time it's the best
time of the year and I'm gonna say you
gotta buy
all of our e3 coverage you got to watch
all of it it's gonna be so much fun
and I'm gonna tell you who the special
guests on stream economy are gonna be in
next week at the show so I love you
three and you love e3 but how does Marx
Errol's feel about e3 his answer might
surprise you all right all right sue I'm
