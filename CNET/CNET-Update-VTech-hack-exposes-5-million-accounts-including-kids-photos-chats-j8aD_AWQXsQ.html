I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update if your kid owns a VTech learning
toy a hacker could know their names
birthdays and where they live the App
Store for v-tex Learning Lodge was
breached a little over two weeks ago and
according to a statement from VTech this
exposed the names emails passwords
mailing addresses and download history
for five million accounts but it goes
way beyond that
a hacker also was able to pull up the
photos taken of kids and their parents
along with chats and audio recordings
made with the kid connect service that
discovery comes from motherboard which
was the first to report on the hack
motherboard has been talking with the
hacker involved who provided the proof
the hack data also includes names gender
and birthdays of more than two hundred
thousand kids the hacker reportedly
found tens of thousands of photos on
VTech servers and says there are no
plans to publish or sell the data
motherboard consulted with a
cybersecurity expert on the breach data
and it appears that VTech did not do
enough to encrypt customer data or
passwords to guard it from hackers VTech
sells tons of kids learning toys like
tablets phones and even smartwatches it
also sells baby monitors when you have a
company as big as VTech not doing the
basics when it comes to security and
protecting your data it should show you
we have a huge cyber security problem on
our hands
companies need to care to invest in
security before they get hacked not
after so what's more worrisome than your
kids toys getting hacked how about
flying delivery drones swarming the
skies because it's a future Amazon
believes strongly in and the company has
released a video showing off a new
design for drones that can get a package
to your door in 30 minutes or less this
prototype drone for prime air loads a
shoebox size package from underneath the
craft it's lifted into its belly and
then it's sent flying off to your home
now what you're seeing here is actual
footage from a working prototype amazon
says there are sensors onboard the drone
to prevent the craft from hitting other
things in the sky when the
Prof gets near you get an alert to make
sure that your yard is clear for landing
and you have to put out a big plastic
Amazon logo landing base so the drone
knows where to drop your package Amazon
first started talking about delivery
drones during the holiday shopping
season of 2013 but this project will not
be taking off in the real world until
the US Federal Aviation Administration
says rules on how to handle commercial
unmanned aircraft and personally I'm
more curious to learn how Amazon plans
to deal with neighbors that will shoot
these drones out of the sky because you
know that's gonna happen that's it for
this tech news update and there's more
as cnet.com from our studios in New York
