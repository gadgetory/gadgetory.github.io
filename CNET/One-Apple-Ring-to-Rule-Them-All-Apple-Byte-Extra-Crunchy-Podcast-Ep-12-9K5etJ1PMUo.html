days ago but things change things happen
we can kind of elaborate more on the
topics and this is where this show is
all about it's what's for you so what we
want to do also is to make this an
interactive experience if you guys want
to be a part of the show give us your
thoughts your input throw out your
questions the number to call and leave a
voicemail is 1 800 61 62 63 8 all right

still working on potentially bringing
some live calls to the show if you guys
think that's a good idea let us know
because we can hang we can hang with the
best of them right Beach that's right
yeah Steven Beecham running the show
always gotta show low gotta show love to
him all right thanks for the love here's
the first story of the day I mean this
is a story I'm just gonna shake my head
but I'm gonna tell you what the story is
all about if you haven't read or heard
already a patent filing a patent
application by Apple was recently
released and revealed and shows that
Apple is working or is has an idea in a
concept for a ring an apple ring a ring
style wearable device look at that
diagram that is the size of the dudes
middle section of his finger it's pretty
big it's like a Super Bowl ring it's
bigger than that it's a wearable device
with voice control haptics cameras and
more and you know what I say to that to
an apple ring make the apple watch
really useful first
like seriously before we get in all this
ring stuff give me a reason to love this
Apple watching the most telling thing to
me is that when I throw stuff like that
on Twitter the Loyalists get really
pissed off they get really but hurt I
only got two people saying I find mine
very useful yes everyone else is like
everyone just kind of says I like it
it's cool but it could do more like
everyone says the same answer really
like man so let me tell you some
specifics because this is a detailed
patent application that Apple is filed
for based on this Apple ring now not
only will you be able to it'll have like
you know the ability to do some sort of
level of gesture input for example like
it can be detected to use with a TV I
mean these are all these things that
they are talking about here want to know
how to charge this thing Steven what you
might need to charge this I know you
haven't seen this yet no idea the actual
ring is proposed to be compatible to be
charged by a steering wheel of a car
like an area of your steering wheel will
wirelessly charge the Apple ring that's
kind of cool that's kind of that is cool
you need an apple car you're in your car
all the time you need an apple car to
charge your apple ring by an apple car
get an apple ring man talk about being
in the ecosystem well the other
disturbing thing about me is in if you
look through this article there's plenty
of drawings there's buttons there's
physical buttons on this ring could you
imagine how big this ring has to be not
only that it's kind of weird and a
little awkward to me okay fine the ring
has voice voice control has a microphone
the ring also is proposed to have a
camera on it you know where all you
don't want to put a camera on a ring
hahaha that's creepy man that is creepy
I don't know if any of you all love this
idea me I in a weird way I think it's
kind of fun and kind of neat cuz it's a
tech gadget but come on it's gonna be
you know people are going to buy it
though you know some rich dudes I'm
going to be like I need that Apple ring
there are uh I just it's pretty
interesting that this is out now in the
public again it's a patent filing it
doesn't mean apples going to really do
it the way it's described in the patent
filing is basically it's like an Apple
watch but for here remix it looks like
that's the funny thing about it's
basically like an Apple watch but for
your finger yeah it's the Apple watch
nano that's what it is so that's out
there thrown to the universe figure out
if you like it or not tell us what you
think about this thing it's crazy 1 800
61 62 63 8 we I honestly want to hear
your thoughts on this whole apple ring
idea you know there's got to be some
like prior art argument someone guys
gonna have like a movie like like The
Hobbit movie or something be like here's
my prior art I've got all kinds of jokes
lined up for the show with this thing
I'm not even gonna drop him on here I've
got all kind I was like just writing
them down like let's do this let's do
this I got this Photoshop I got this one
Oh who's gonna be the first to uh to ask
their their girlfriend to marry them
exactly oh my god exactly you know
they'll be covered on the news too oh
this is the world we're living in
everybody this is this is the world
we're living in all right let's
transition a little bit over to the
iphone and guess ya later in the show we
will we will talk about the iphone oh
goodness the iphone 7 I don't know odd
that's just gross ah the iphone 6s just
came out i love the iphone 6s for the
record I phone news apple announced more
than 13 million iphone 6s and 6s plus is
sold in the opening weekend that's three
days what makes this impressive for all
you haters apple sold tell 10 million
last year for the six people that are
poo pooing this phone always seem to
forget that there are two groups of
people that are on alternate years of
upgrading no matter what's right yeah
they always there they always they never
they forget that yeah so that's why the
numbers are so huge 13 I went from a six
to a 6s I personally think the tech in
here is awesome the 3d touch everyone
who says 3d touch is a long press
they have never used 3d touch and
they're just a hater they don't they
just think it's this simple thing is
it's very early it's in its infancy it's
going to get better I'm sorry it's a
game-changing you I I can't wait to try
it out I have I'll let you try and touch
college I'll let you i'll let you 3d
touch me okay after the show please and
then i'll let you use my phone okay cool
i'm looking forward to it I'm I'm I just
I love 3d touch I think it has huge
potential when you see it it's more than
what you have to look beyond the surface
the developers are going to blow this
thing up and the 7 is going to be
probably ridiculous with what they do
with the software there as well in an
iOS I guess that would be iOS 10 by then
all right also apple's iphone lineup
there are rumblings there's a patent
finally know that Apple was looking to
put some level of water protection on
the iphone they've been blown apart
taken apart by I fix it in others and
their show it shows that there is a new
gasket kind of like a little rubber
lining around the edge of the 3d touch
display to prevent water from seeping
into it and then in addition to that
they've covered some of some of the
circuits and wirings with silicone seals
to prevent water from seeping in greatly
reducing the water damage Apple for the
record has not claimed that this is a
waterproof or water resistant device but
people have done some fun test there's a
gentleman by the name of Zack straily
who online put in a 6s and a 6s plus
underwater in bowls they lasted for an
hour and still worked perfectly fine wow
I did see a lot of news articles when
the last like couple days that's saying
the iphone is waterproof I'm like what
it's like yeah it's like water resistant
yeah but not waterproof other people i
think it was like AI device help dropped
it in a inhibit they put it in a pool
basically four feet below and then i
think just the overall water pressure
really seeped in there and the screen
you know the phone itself got messed up
yeah i had a friend who had a galaxy s6
and he dropped in the bottom of a hot
tub and it still worked it's like hell
you are phone users say you gotta get a
samsung galaxy s6 you could drop it in a
hot and
hot tub oh man now maybe we got to do
the hot tub test with the iphone 6 i'm
personally tired of doing the shirt this
become this weird this weird thing
amongst producers and coworkers like hey
brian do another shot in the shower but
it's like not a serious request it's
this weird thing I'm why do I have to do
that anymore like what's the point
chi-ching chi-ching I don't think so
fuse video view negative negative
dislikes dislikes alright also in use
obviously everything's not fine and
dandy with the iphone 6s there's always
things that tend to happen tend to
surface some iphone 6s owners are seeing
their phones randomly shut off since the
iphone 6s and 6 plus been available some
users users have been reporting that it
will randomly turn itself completely off
even if when it's left unattended with
more than enough battery power it's
unknown what actually causes the shut
off most are believing that it might be
related to iOS 9 and how it talks to it
they say the home button feels warm I
know for a fact ones i have one of those
brackets that you put on your AC to
mount your phone which looks really nice
for gps and when it gets too cold my
phone just shuts off really yeah i was
surprised i thought my battery was
faulty but then i realized wait it's
like ice cold and i started connecting
the dots and it's pretty much because
the AC it hits whatever tolerance levels
like okay I'm shutting you down now wow
that's pretty crazy yes so that's going
on with that also people some people
been complaining about low-light photos
not looking that good with the iphone 6s
power user tip people say try turning
off live photos a lot of times right
everyone's trying to use this new
feature the live photo feature what
happens is live photos takes an image
every 12 frames per second it doesn't
allow the exposure to be open long
enough to let light in so some of those
low low low light pictures that you have
been taking don't look as good so just
turn off live photos okay just want to
give you a helpful hint a little a
little chipper oh thanks thank you very
much okay let's get to it let's just
spit this out I don't want to talk about
this this long iphone 7 rumor
good lord supid uh we can we leak out an
iphone rumor ourselves yeah what like to
stop with one put it on some random
webpage let some random other person
pick it up and then it's gonna be gold
iphone 7 rumor to be waterproof and
possibly adopt a non metallic casing
material for iphone 7 so nonmetallic
case may be some sort of ceramic they
better not Duplass no no plot no iphone
see no iphone secretly would they do
aluminum or something like that you
think um because I can I bully I believe
it it is a it is a type of aluminum
right now okay they should just make it
solid gold solid gold solid gold do like
that that's what I want to see okay but
in addition to let's play on this stupid
speculation apple recently granted 28
patents in a big old chunk one of them
was an iphone with a glass wraparound
design ok this is this has been out
there I think a couple years ago it
might have been filed but this is a it
reminds me of the ipod nano it had that
kind of rounded edge and the connector
was on the bottom and it looked a little
bit like a oval if you looked at on its
a narrow side but the glass would wrap
around the edges it looks a lot like i
said honk phone I totally like like
Sam's I did it samsung did it but that's
this is from Apple this actual patent
application really a wraparound glass
phone I think that's just a matter of
time where we're going to see that we've
seen look everyone copies everyone
Samsung has a foldable display to the
edge phone Apple will probably
eventually do something like that down
the road it's gonna drive Sarah Mitch
rough insane because she said she
doesn't like phones that that like roll
around on the table you know oh yeah
yeah rock man that's exactly what this
thing's gonna do see I fell rocker this
iphone drive me insane man it would
drive me insane so there that's all
we're gonna do for the preview of what
might come in a year I it just drives me
crazy that someone's trying to get
theirs and is already like hey go
waterproof hey stop it it's funny all
right this is a cool advancement app
that Apple is working on just more of an
acquisition story apple buys uk-based
speech technology startup vocal IQ why
are they so important vocal IQ is a
startup whose artificial intelligence
software helps computers and people
speak to you to each other in a more
natural way this is according to people
familiar with the deal this is from the
Financial Times technology could help
Apple improve Siri which I love Siri has
gotten a lot better Syria yeah big time
I actually now pretty much trust sory
for my voice dictation text messages
where in the past it was all over the
place it feels like it's about 90 ish
percentage right now yeah it definitely
she definitely can hear me better but I
just I still haven't gotten used to the
no beeping sound so like I lied only
turn it on it'll be like talking and
then it didn't hear me so that kind of
drive they should bring that back
honestly it's a cute it should be an
option where you can turn it on it's a
nice queue right yeah it is yeah to be
like okay now I can talk exactly instead
of now it's just like that it's like oh
ok it does have a cool little those cool
flowing logo II yeah I do like that I do
think that is cool not that it really
matters series still has the worst jokes
though I can't stand why wait why are
you asking her to tell I'm not to ask
like if I just tell it set a timer for
two hours or something right and he'll
say I've set your timer for two hours
but remember a watch clock never boils
or so she says some stupid like she says
it to me all the time and I just want to
throw my phone I just I say shut up Siri
people probably see me talking to my
phone saying shut the hell up hahaha so
you don't like snowball I love Siri but
she can get on your nerves like anyone
else I've never had see I don't use her
for much other than setting alarms
because I need to take like power naps
because I'm so yeah you for like I can't
tell you how many times randomly in
videos people are like dude what's wrong
with your eyes are you high or dude have
you been sleeping like dude get some
rest there's like always a comment about
my eyes right it's funny because like
sometimes I have me
yeah me too man major bags are
affirmative we work in we working hard
we work hard we gonna party yeah so it's
just like whatever but i don't i don't
use Siri all the time so she hasn't
dropped a joke on me within my normal a
user all the time and to leave reminders
like oh I'll tell her to leave a
reminder like right in front of someone
someone be like can you come to this
meeting later today at two and i'll be
like Siri remind me to go to meeting
tomorrow today at two or something you
know I talked her all the time and uh
yeah she ever e I I'd say twenty percent
of the time she has a stupid joke twenty
percent of the time she'll come back and
say something so talk back to me don't
talk to it back to me Siri slappers do
what I say do what I say Siri do what I
say also just to talk about this vocal
IQ acquisition what makes this really
cool is with their speech processing and
machine learning technology it could be
incorporated into other devices from
wearables the connected home but also
the company get this connect the dots
the company was particularly focused on
in car applications so we might see this
integrated into basically talking to
your car in a more natural way they were
working with collaborations with General
Motors we know Apple is big on this car
project now they're pushing it forward
vocal IQ is a uk-based company who they
just acquired to help them in those
efforts it's gonna be like KITT from
Knight Rider it would be fun if it was
like kids yeah like they should get rid
of they should leave serial devices and
give a whole new personality to the car
but if you could just say Siri can you
drive my car to me please and then it
just drives over to you that would be
badass I would rather say hey kid yeah
if you can change the name and for all
the kids that don't know KITT is the car
from Knight Rider yes David Hasselhoff
yes I forget we can be older remember I
went that's a generational thing man I
know I know I'm for some people like
who's KITT I met you on Paris kabila who
is kid look it up I remember going to
universal studios when I was like 10 and
sitting in kit it's like the most
exciting thing ever yeah just talking to
me
was talking to me that's right he had
like you brit who was the voice of him I
don't know but he had the British voice
right yeah but he knew what I was he
knew what I was wearing I was like oh my
God he's really talking to me they do
that as like that they do that
Disneyland rides do they really we're
like some of the characters for example
toy story mania the mr. Potato Head at
times it doesn't happen as much right
once the rides out a long time they have
someone who's looking through a camera
at you and then directly um talking to
people that's awesome the slug lady I
can't remember what her name was from
monsters inc yeah called out my hair but
I did you know she's like yeah yeah you
you the one with the thing in his hair
I'm like it's real but that's always
pretty awesome I'm so excited next week
I'm programming note i will not be here
so i don't know if we're gonna do we may
not have an edgy what might not be an
extra crunchiness what the thing is that
i'll be gone the next week I could do it
from Hawaii though do you want to do one
it from holy cool if you do it from the
beach Skyrim toll a jealous you're
sitting on the beach with a mai tai all
rights just Elise hahaha there's Eric
evidence I told that would be cool all
right I might do that that'd be fun
sun's out guns out guns out I hate I
thought I know we're gonna random
tangent but I saw dude one of that tank
top of the gym like just see it's
awesome if you wear to the gym it makes
it you know it's ironically cool yes
it's still weird okay some quick Apple
TV news developers have their hands on
the whole apple TV kit we know that
there was a lottery from WWDC or was it
yes was it no no not WWDC from apple's
most recent announcement in September we
still don't have an official release
date for the Apple TV although they say
will be coming by the end of the year we
also don't have an official release date
for the ipad pro it's targeted for
november we don't know when exactly but
this news story says the new apple TV
only supports to bluetooth controllers
at once this is based on developers that
have been using it that I've been trying
to figure out their apps you can use the
single remote and 22 Bluetooth
controller so at least we now know it
supports up to two players can you plug
into two more like USB possibly possibly
but probably not I mean maybe but I
probably
doubt it yeah okay look how much this
looks like an Xbox controller though
that's pretty much what that's pretty
much what the proposed controllers are
going to are going to be there's already
some on the market that'll be compatible
right on the bats cool okay people
wondering also with the Apple TV any
word on the broadcast deals I can tell
you right now no sign I really do feel
it will get done by next year I don't
even think that we should think it'll be
done by March it's got to be after
summer these deals apple just wants it
their way and the labels content
creators they're not going to give them
their way because they can make money
and other platforms now or just put it
on their cells yeah it's the same story
every time until it gets done it will
get done so how are those strong-arming
people it's one of those stay tuned it's
one it's until apples really really
feels like we have no choice let's just
do what the deal that everyone else does
I see that's it's stubbornness on both
sides right yeah yeah these are mega
billion-dollar corporations enough
fighting over pennies yeah it doesn't
make a lot of sense on that note should
we get to a call to drum shot yeah
should we check out all we've got some
phone calls again the number you guys
can call us at is 1 800 61 62 63 8
that's the number to call us you can
also tweet us send us emails but really
we want you to be a part of this show so
we show you love we put in your phone
calls you do it right you get on the
show yeah Geo so yeah let's listen to
some phone calls this first one I don't
know if he left his name so lets just
hear what he has to say hey guys this is
blair and west holly lair ah i stood in
line for 10 minutes before store opening
for pre-order of the phone and was out
in 10 minutes long like 20 people in
line to the apple financing so it went
great also Beecham thank you very much
for that tip on the headphone being
coupled covered by applecare i hope they
don't charge me ninety nine dollars each
time i want to replace it but I go
through at least six headphones a year
that's a lot of headphones man
c'est clair headphones what are you
doing boys he like swinging around I
last saw on the rodeo guys like come on
just head banging with them on
constantly that's that's not that six
headphones that's that's a lot so what
they're like each thirty bucks you
thirty bucks he lost him they last him
two months and then he has got it yeah
30 29 99 I believe a pop but how many
times have they do they continue to swap
out your headphones or does their point
where they're like dude stop coming back
now know they after a while like when I
was doing this pretty often with the
older headphones I have to I have to say
the older model you know not the new one
yeah a little cooler um they just had
like a stockpile of them they were just
give them to me like didn't even ask for
my applecare anything oh that's nice
these headphones are broken and be like
okay here yeah they didn't they were
kind of so unofficial about cuz it's
like I don't want to sell the paperwork
there's no that's a known yeah so
alright we have some more right now
let's listen to this alright what Apple
come out with new course for the iphone
6 and other phones because the Lightning
cord it's all right let it sink in let
it breathe they're not gonna change the
cord you don't think so not anytime soon
I think look Apple makes a whole bunch
of money off these little cables could
they wrap them in some sort of like you
know there's certain chords that are
wrapped in actual like a cloth material
that's we've that's a lot sturdier and
nice yeah why is Apple going to invest
in that when they just keep it rubber
gouges knows everyone's gonna buy them
and knows everyone's gonna continue to
buy them yeah why not why not why would
you why would they change if they were
gonna get new cables they probably by a
company before they did that by the
company that made the cable right like
Mike maybe a company who makes
headphones like beets yeah oh hey oh it
happen it's weird how they really treat
them as a separate entity I wonder if
there'll ever be a day where they
basically call apple headphones and just
blend them together I know they won't
just from a branding purpose yeah but
it's like they just coexist on the side
and let I don't
we'll see the numbers of how successful
Apple music is how many people actually
renew I've got to imagine it'll be
around twenty-five percent of users
could be wrong I'm going to be wrong
when we get that number like within a
week or so right well we'll only get
that number when Apple tells us that
number Apple has never officially even
told us how many Apple watches have been
sold yet so we might have to wait till
the next keynote and then they could
just totally gloss over it or forget or
they won't tell us if the numbers aren't
impressive enough like look three days
after the iphone came out there like we
sold 13 million our record we're still
waiting to hear apple sales figures on
the Apple watch uh-oh just letting y'all
know mm-hmm I know I'm at least one of
one all right do we have any others yeah
do you want to hear this this is uh we
decided we're gonna play this call
because when we're just gonna play the
beginning of it because it's just like a
good example of what not to do when you
call the apple byte show so are you
saying this might be a bad apple this is
probably about Apple Oh Tong okay so
right away you know that this guy is not
serious and that she's trying to be
funny but it's not funny yeah Mickey
Mouse sounds like Mickey Mouse so this
is what not to do when you call the
apple pie extra credit on don't do this
this is a i do not know what's going on
here i would probably say go yeah don't
don't call back sound like he called on
some crappy android phone to what wow
that's hilarious so there you go we're
gonna wrap it up today man traffic clean
and keep it tight it's the apple byte
extra crunchy steven Beecham again
running the show making all smooth make
us making this thing work all right
everybody next week maybe if not the
week after that from Hawaii from Hawaii
Oh brah all right we'll see y'all guys
next time thanks for listening is the
Apple white extra crunchy piece
alright thanks everybody on the scope
errs thanks for hanging out with us if
you guys maybe I'll stick around the
skill for a couple seconds if you guys
have any other if you guys have any
questions I know sometimes you guys
asked questions within the show and I
can't get to it so you know I have to
lock into the actual podcast but you
guys have any questions I'll stick
around for a few minutes before we go
and get out of here how old are you I'm
not going to tell you that 23 why is
Apple falling off everyone brings up
that question but I think the fact of
the matter is Apple's not falling off
they're just not coming up with products
that are quote unquote changing
everything but their profits their money
their cash they're sitting on their
sales numbers are doing just fine phone
sales are plateauing but their sales
continue to rise right now ipad business
not that strong but tablets aren't that
strong I think if you everyone expects
so much from apple now and they're a
different company they're just a more
mature company and they haven't come out
with any killer great idea yet that has
florida's so until they do you might
think oh they're back but I think
they're doing just fine ipad pro or
macbook air if you want a pc desktop
based OS do not get an app ipad pro so
it comes down to look at us while we're
in the show says Gabe dude game I'm
looking like over here I'm looking over
there I guess yeah i'm i'm looking at
you now pay attention to you now that
should be good enough have I been to the
UK i have been to the UK once new iphone
name tell beach what's up Jerry Michael
24 sup Jerry Michael Jerry Michael shown
love do you think they should buy Tesla
no because well here's the thing with
their cash infusion help Tesla yes
because Tesla i believe is still not in
the black I believe they're still in the
red
just because it costs so much to build
these cars margins are really low I
don't think Tesla wants to be purchased
from apple they started what they
started they want to see it through it's
up to Apple to play catch-up do I pay
for Apple music no I did not keep my
subscription I don't I just Steven our
old school like that we like to buy our
music yeah wireless charging for the
iphone what do I think I think what's
more important with a phone personally
is that it has the quick charging
feature so you could debate that with me
I just like the fact that if I can plug
in my phone for whatever it was like 30
minutes or 15 20 minutes like some of
these quick charging phones out there
from like Samsung and even the new Nexus
has it and it gives me like pretty much
seventy-five percent battery power in
those quick moments that's more
important to me I think wireless
charging is nice but until it can be
super efficient then I won't do it also
you typically need more of a plastic
back for wireless charging and a lot of
these phones moving towards the metal
direction they don't have them any
issues with the iphone 6s nothing major
yet that sticks out of my mind it's more
OS iOS 9 stuff okay last question I
always have to answer this M Roman 86 do
you like that do I think that the Apple
watch is worth getting I'll never tell
someone how much something is worth to
them if you want to get it you want to
get it but do I think that if someone
said should i buy the Apple watch most
my most common responsibly probably not
but it depends on what you want what
you're looking for it's okay I give it
like about a five and a half six out of
ten it's alright but it doesn't really
do much if I didn't like how it look
looks I would not like this watch at all
okay thanks for hanging with us
everybody we will see you guys in a week
or so yeah right yep okay alright see
you later man see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
