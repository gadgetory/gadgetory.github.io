tomorrow daily the best we talk show in
the universe I'm Ashley skillet i'm jeff
cannata are you ready to get up to date
we got headlines for you we do you know
we have to learn to drive cars because
we are bags of meat but where do
self-driving cars go to learn how to
drive cars the answer is Cynthia
scientists at the computer vision center
in Barcelona Spain developed a
simulation for training self-driving a
is called Cynthia and this program can
help autonomous driving software
recognized hazards obstacles and
situations and also figure out how to
potentially react to them as a driving
AI uses Cynthia it can use virtual
cameras that mimic real-life car sensors
and data to decide what an object is and
how to react to it there's a weather
system pedestrians cyclists and more
inside the simulation and everything can
be tagged automatically instead of
relying on humans labeling every object
which is very very expensive there's
also a little simulated DMV guy with a
clipboard like marking down oh you
missed you didn't check your mirrors
Cynthia but does a self-driving car cry
when it fails the driving test did you
cry when you failed your driving test I
never failed my driving 20 but I should
have known that one walks right into
that like shooting fish in a barrel
speaking of cars you have heard about
car kits to upgrade your car will check
out these effects they take it to the
next level 3d printing company Stratasys
is collaborating on custom printed 3d
panels for daihatsu copen model the
process is now officially ready for
final testing here's how it works
effects skins are 3d printed car body
panels that you can swap on york open
depending on your mood the panels have
3d effects and other designs and colors
are available making a wide variety of
combinations for cope and drivers 3d
printing the panels takes a couple of
weeks compared to a traditional two to
three months and can be ordered for
coppens fenders and front and rear
bumpers the commercial roll-out is
planned for next year I think we're
going to see lots more of this yeah I
think so too and I love this idea of it
being kind
not quite a body kit where you have to
actually uninstall you could just learn
a pond just new stuff you can make it
look cool it's like geometric or I've
got textures and things I don't you
think this is really the next level like
why have a car that looks like everybody
else's car I can have a car that looks
like my own I mean I don't want to go to
like you know early 90s myspace page no
I get it but you could really create the
thing you want it's pretty it's pretty
simple now to do it I really dig that
and I think it helps with resale value
because you can just snap off that piece
and put on their original parts pretty
cool uh we're not doing a long show this
week guys we said yesterday i'll be at
VidCon yeah check out Ashley at VidCon
if you're gonna be there you're gonna be
doing panels and all kinds of stuff yeah
moderating panels i'll be doing some
let's play live on the show floor i
believe and i'll also be a panelist so
it should be really fun and but we still
wanna hear what you guys have to say
about this week's episode so please no

you guys to keep me company I'll be just
