first look at the parrot bebop drone
this is a small lightweight quadcopter
due out this year at an undisclosed time
for an undisclosed price we've got a
camera on the front here that captures a
raw 14 megapixel image and then
processes that down to be 2 megapixel
footage can capture both still images
and HD video content a neat trick here
with the camera is that it's a fixed
camera so you're not dealing with the
weight and the intricate delicate system
of a gimbal on the bottom of this thing
like we've seen in some other quad
copters use a fixed camera with a fixed
fisheye lens and by using that fisheye
lens it can reprocess the image inside
the camera so that you can kind of tilt
it around capture the image you want I
play around with it but without the
camera actually moving at all so that's
a neat trick and it helps cut down on
some weight and on makes a design a
little bit more sturdy some other
interesting things to know about here
you've got a replaceable battery pack
each battery pack will give you what
I've been told about 12 minutes of
flight time which is about average for
something as small as this got built-in
GPS and with that GPS you can use the
app on iPhone iPad Android tablet you
can use the app to navigate a flight
path that will fly you can use the GPS
on here to trigger to automatically
return back to you if you're a little
bit confused about which way is forward
and which way is backward on the
controls itself that's a neat feature
we've seen that some other a quadcopter
some competing products too but it's
nice that pair is including that on here
another interesting feature that Paris
built in here that's the first I've seen
is that it will automatically detect if
there's something intruding on the
propellers so say you've got a finger in
here it's going to automatically detect
that and shut down all the propellers so
that you're not going to get totally
named that's a good feature to have
really the whole system is designed to
be flown indoors as well as outdoors
you're flying this indoors there's a
pair of bumpers that attach this that
it's not going to
you know bump the propellers you fly
into a wall you fly it into the ceiling
so that helps protect the propellers the
hope is controlled over Wi-Fi using a
tow 2.11 n or AC that's going to be
communicated to your tablet either an
Android tablet or iPad you want some
extra range or some more advanced
controls they're also selling a
remote-control rig that kind of docks
your tablet and also extends your Wi-Fi
range and also has the benefit of being
able to integrate with an oculus rift or
they were just generically saying some
kind of video goggle system with that
you can get a literal bird's-eye view of
what you're seeing through the camera
and be able to control the camera tilt
with your head really cool again we
don't have pricing on this we don't know
when it's coming out this year but we
are told it's coming out in 2014 so that
is a first look at the parrot bebop
drone a very cool lightweight quadcopter
that I'm excited to see this year Tina
