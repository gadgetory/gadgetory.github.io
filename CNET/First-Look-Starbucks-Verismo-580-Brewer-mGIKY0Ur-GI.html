verismo 584 coffee machine from
Starbucks now the verismo has got a
really elegant look it's got this pretty
piano black finish also comes in other
colors as well the minimal design of it
is really really appealing and it's kind
of striking the restraint that Starbucks
showed if you look at this device
there's not a Starbucks logo on it
there's not even the word Starbucks
anywhere all you've got is the word
verismo edged into the handle up here so
the minimal design of this also carries
over to the interface if you look it's
only got three buttons on the front and
this power button up top you look at the
three buttons on the front you've got
this small cup for espresso this black
cup which is coffee and the white cup
for milk and those are the three types
of pods that's a Starbucks where is Moe
uses and you've got the coffee pot here
the espresso pod and the milk pod and
this kind of limits the machine and only
brews verismo pod it doesn't prove
k-cups it doesn't brew ground coffee it
doesn't prove anything else so all
you're gonna be able to do are these
three pods now there are different
varieties of the coffee there's
Starbucks randa blend there's Pikes
Place roast but it's all Starbucks all
the time so if you like other brands of
coffee or like experimenting you're
probably not gonna like this machine
that much the downside here are the milk
pops the milk pods are made out of a
dehydrated white fluff that used to be
milk and is that all the liquid sucked
out of it and the verismo puts that
water back into it and Starbucks calls
this a gentle tasty process that makes
sweet frothy creamy milks
but it does not taste like that it
tastes really bad we didn't enjoy the
lattes at all because of that that said
the coffee that makes is very very good
if you like Starbucks it tastes just
like what you get at Starbucks and the
espresso we thought was really good as
well it doesn't just taste good but if
you make a shot of espresso it looks
good it's got crema it's got the right
layering it's just a good-looking shot
so when you're using the verismo you're
gonna want to fill the reservoir up
first and this is a 1 liter reservoir
that goes in the back here it's a little
smaller than reservoirs
other single-serve coffee makers that we
tested also I think they probably wanted
to keep the design symmetrical which is
why they put this in the back but I'm
not sure that was the greatest decision
if you're using this flush against the
back of your wall it's gonna be tough to
get this reservoir in and out so might
not have been the best design choice
after filling up the reservoir just lift
up the lever drop a pot in push it back
down and press the button of the drink
that you're making another downside of
the verismo is it cleaning is a bit of a
pain when you want to clean it which
you'll have to do pretty often you pull
this entire unit out and this here is a
bank that holds all the used pots and
it's got multiple parts that all kind of
drip together everything uses and it
just kind of has a lot of little nooks
and crannies to clean and they're hard
to get to this is a really narrow
opening with a lot of sludge in there so
you're gonna be reaching in with your
arm and the sponge it's just a little
cramped and awkward so the verismo looks
really nice it also feels good if you
pick it up and look at here it just has
a nice solid construction just to the
touch it feels durable and that's right
in line with what you'd expect from a
device that cost about $200
we like that the verismo looks so good
and it makes really good Starbucks
coffee but for people that are looking
for different brands to experiment with
or they just don't like Starbucks it's
probably not the machines for them so we
don't recommend it for everyone but if
you're a Starbucks addicts this could be
the best machine you'll ever own so give
a consideration if that's you with the
verismo 585 Starbucks I'm Rui Chris
