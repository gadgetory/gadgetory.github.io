on the front door ok
alright let's do it all right let's go
hello everybody i am lindsay Turrentine
editor-in-chief of cnet com and i am
excited because today i am going to sit
down for a chat with jeff joseph my
friend at the CTA formerly the cea now
the consumer technology association hi
Jeff how are you Lizzie I'm great thank
you merry christmas happy holidays thank
you and to you too Jeff just so you know
is the senior vice president of
communications and strategic
relationships at the CTA and Jeff he
knows everything about what's going on
at CES I know that everybody on cnet is
just like they're like forget about the
holidays I just want to make it through
all the food so that i can find out
what's gonna happen at CES so we are
super excited to be here thank you for
joining us oh please i always love
talking with you thanks for having me
excellent first off I just want to get
this right out of the way where can
people find out more about ces Jeff I
know that you've got the best twitter
handle lever for CES which is at CES all
right and the website is CES web org
that's right that's correct that's
exactly right the websites a great place
to find all the information if you're an
attendee if you're an exhibitor or if
you're just simply a consumer who wants
to understand what's going on at the
show because I show is business only so
no consumers allowed sorry you have to
follow lindsay and RC net team to get
the best and latest out of out of cs but
you can find all that through links on
our webpage and of course twitter for
real-time updates we're going to do some
live video capture we do some
periscoping from the floor so just
follow those links and you'll get a
great CES experience great it's great
thank you Jeff um ok so I was just
spending some time on that website
looking things over and we've been of
course planning all of our coverage here
at
at cnet and we get really excited about
launching our big CES package what got
me really excited right off the bat is
the lineup of speakers here we've got
some really good ones tell us a little
bit more about who you picked and how
you picked them for for the keynotes
because there there's some really great
people here I think it's cool and I
think the keynotes they really tell a
story about how the show has changed
mean when you and I first met so many
years ago the show really was about
hardware and so you saw that in the
keynote errs we had large consumer
tonics companies from around the world
and as the show's changed so is our
keynote stage as the consumer technology
is now a part of everything we do what
our cars but really mobile consumer
technology platforms so we're excited to
have dr. DISA head of a BW as one of our
key notice we have Mary Barra from GM is
one of our key know ders to really talk
about the future of cars and and
introduce some BW is expected to
introduce a really cool new electric
vehicle which either can be really fun
and exciting we have the president
Samsung and we'll talk about less you
sort of talked about the Internet of
Things and how and Samsung's visions
vision of how that's coming together
excited to hear from him we have Reed
Hastings of netflix now content is such
a big part an important part of the
consumer technology experience so we're
excited to hear where they're headed and
of course we'll have a youtube and of
course our own Gary Shapiro who's going
to talk a bit about really would we
think about technology we think about
all these things we love we love our
smartphones and our tablets but but
there's so much more than that now right
there they're they're really changing
the way we live change away the work
really changing the world making the
world a better place that's gonna be one
of the themes that the gary will address
so this is great you to automotive
manufacturers speaking in the kiddos i
think that that's huge and really
interesting and you know we're thinking
a lot about how technology ends up in
the cars we drive and how ultimately
maybe the cart it ends up in the cars we
we don't drive do you think that that
there will be much self driving
technology chatted about at the show
when we're hearing some some stuff that
we're excited about it is that something
that gets you x
I did it I'll guess the excited but ya
know you know that we've seen that the
last few years and I think we'll see the
most recent advances um I we projected
we are maybe five or a few years away
from really seeing many of these
vehicles out on the road of course
there's an entire infrastructure that
has to be built to support these
vehicles and we have to think about how
we transition from from driver lead cars
to to driverless cars but but I'm
excited to go to CS and sort of see how
far they've come how far they've
advanced you know automotive it's really
a huge story at CS again this year we've
got Faraday who says are going to
compete with with a Tesla with a really
cool electric vehicle they're gonna play
planned unveil their car at CES we have
a medic nine of the top ten auto
manufacturers we got a number of
conference sessions we have a keynote
keynote session panel with the Secretary
of Transportation so it really has
become a place again not just for sort
of the handheld devices and traditional
consumer electronics devices but really
from health and fitness to automotive to
drones on and on on the cs has really
become these sort of the launch pad the
center stage of everything that can be
considered consumer technology so in
these keynotes you know we're talking on
automotive but we've and we've also got
a samsung keynote do you think they're
gonna be some pretty big announcements
happening during the keynotes is that
something people should be paying
attention to watching a live stream of
course they should watch the live stream
absolutely yeah you know that the I'll
say two things first like one of my
biggest disappointment so I think this
job's I thought we'd get like all this
cool it's like for patient up front liat
nothing oh wait look it so I can't sit
here and say Samsung's gonna do a B C or
D but I do know that you asked earlier
about sort of what we look for we look
for keen owners and one of the things we
ask is that they bring really cool
innovations that they make major
announcement from the stage you know
it's from the cs keynote stage that we
saw the introduction of the xbox and
over years ago we've seen injection of
tablets and and whether it's faster and
better processors to breakthrough
products to even the the beginning of
the Internet of Things of course was
recently these concept cars and electric
vehicle
an unmanned vehicle so it really has
become a really cool place to sort of
see what everyone's going to want next
holiday season or the years to come so
uh you know you say that you don't you
don't find out things ahead of time we
actually do get some pre briefs and i
will say they're gonna be some exciting
announcements or at least things that i
I'm really excited about Yeah right
course I want to tell you they don't
want to tell me as much yeah well so you
know stay tuned to all appropriate
channels to find out more and but we get
really excited when we start to think
you know we seen it we've been really
really focused on the smart home lately
we get really excited when we start to
think about the ways in which the
Internet has really brought the home
into a new era and and I'm actually
gonna be moderating a panel about the
smart home with some really great folks
is there what what along the lines of
the smart home like are you finding that
interest in smart home categories you're
getting more and more more and more of
the show floor dedicated to things that
you that might have surprised us in the
past like I don't know refrigerators
washing machines you know big like big
big home electronics yeah so one of the
things we do at the consumer technology
association we're a major trade
association that produces CS we also
lobby and promote the industry and one
of the things we do is take a look at a
variety of product categories and
forecast what those sales are going to
be over the coming year really what
consumers want and we'll announce those
right at the show right at CS but one of
the things that one of the early
indications is that one of the
fastest-growing categories is that broad
category of a smart home of a connected
home of tech home whether it's smart
door locks whether it's the thermostat
heating and cooling units and whether
it's a white goods appliances it's
really just growing it's such a rapid
place and one things we try to do it CS
is identify those fast growing
categories and we create what we call
marketplaces and you know the cs is so
big we're gonna have between 150 hundred
and seventy six thousand people there
which is larger than most cities and
it's cool to wander around and sort of
have the serendipity of finding things
but if you want to come and try to find
a specific thing like smart homes if you
want to find that product category
we create marketplaces so you can go
there we have a number of exhibitors so
you can really focus in on what you're
particularly interested in and the the
checkout marketplace is one of our
fastest growing and largest marketplaces
this year where is where's the tech home
marketplace gonna be located which which
hall for anybody who's actually gonna be
on the ground there and I know that
that's kind of the lucky few but for
those of you gonna be there you need to
know where to go right right right right
it'll be in the end the sands which
we're very excited about so you now CES
has gotten so huge Jeff that there are
you know there's a there's stuff going
on in the sands there's there's tech
West generally which is sort of away
from the convention center there's the
convention center with North Hall
central hall south hall there are
meetings going on all across the city of
Las Vegas how what is the best way for
people to see as much as possible when
they're on the ground in vegas walk fast
comfy shoes the company she is not out
it is awesome you know we do as you
noted we have the three venues we have
new this year CS south which houses what
we call c space which is home for the
intersection of content advertising and
marketing that'll be at the cosmo and
the end the area hotels but we recommend
the best system of shell bus system
again removing hundreds of thousands of
150 hundred seventy thousand people
around Las Vegas it's it's so difficult
to to to try to bring your could get
there no part there's no parking so no
you're driving from California just
leave your car at the hotel they'll try
to drive a convention center but the
shuttle buses work well they run
regularly throughout the day they start
early and right after after closing so
you can get your own fro we have a
number of cattle lines at the major
major locations to we try to move those
quickly what one insider tip if you want
we talked about today is that go to the
front of the cab line and yell where you
going and you may be will may be able to
double up and buddy up with some people
so you have to wait as long the line
yeah good tip it's like it's like
homegrown uber make it yours that was
that a segue did you set that up on
purpose no but it is it's a really good
one what kinds of service and what kind
of feel like service industry trends do
you expect at CES this year based on the
exhibitors you're seeing yeah well I
think the most
for an announcement is that I'm that we
will now have uber and lyft in in Las
Vegas which is fantastic we've been
pushing for ride-sharing services in the
city we did CTA been working hard to
promote ride-sharing and make sure our
attendees have that option so when you
get to the McCarran Airport you'll be
able to call up the ride sharing
services now because of the way Las
Vegas works there'll be special staging
areas but that'll come up in the app
when you pull up the app until you where
to go so so we're very very excited to
talk for that transportation on a option
to our attendees this year yeah that's
that's really great news and and my
general tip after having been to CES for
I don't know longer than I can I even
care to share um leave yourself a buffer
because no matter what its gonna take
you longer to get where you think you're
going than you think hundred percent
yeah if you've ever been to Vegas before
take transit times that you know and
like triple them because it is so full
of people which is exciting it's
exciting and bring patients because it
will take the tick long it's just a
matter of trying to move that make up
around and we've gotten much better
again there are more options more places
to go but it will take take take time to
get get around absolutely all right well
let's talk about some other some more
technology what do you think is gonna be
the most unusual new category and people
ask me this all the time and my head is
so deep in the consumer technology right
that I'll say you know if I were to go
for it i would say probably you'll see
some really interesting wearables yeah
in new formats right not just bracelets
are fobs but integrated into your
clothing or your shoes there's gonna be
a lot of that automotive technology that
we talked about we're getting really
excited about VR and in fact we're going
to do a little bit of broadcasting in
360 VR format but what from your
perspective what sort of the most
unusual category that people should be
paying attention to that maybe they're
not paying attention to already yeah
yeah I'd say I'm not sure if it's
unusual but but I'm with you on on
wearables and I'll go a little further
you know one of the great trends of the
show you can come to the show you can
see all the the big sort of finished
product
X and products and through see where
they stand but I also enjoy sort of
looking at the components and trying to
figure out where pieces are going to fit
and what that tells for the future so 34
years ago as you might recall we start
to see sensors and in smaller and
smaller hard drives and and and SSDs
coming up to the show for and the
question was ok what does that mean now
almost every device has some sort of
sensor everything is connected its
powers gone as power capabilities have
increased as a battery life or alternate
source of power of increase we're seeing
those sensors embedded and in clothing
and shoes and sporting equipment in
autumn oh and in cars in hats and
gardening equipment in white kids and
just on on and on so I'm really excited
to see so ok what's next what else can
we make smart what else can we connect
we're gonna have a really interesting
panel on smart cities and what is what
is all this connectivity what does the
advent of the sharing economy mean for
the future of the city so I'm really
excited sort of you know think again not
just about the products themselves but
what does all this connectivity mean
what all these sentiment a sentient
devices that we now have what do they
mean for the future of transportation
for the future of cities for the future
of urban planning I'm from the future of
Halton and healthcare yeah I think it's
a fascinating topic I was actually just
coincidentally talking to the CTO of La
briefly this morning about this and
there are so many pressing questions
when you think about things like I don't
you know cameras body-mounted cameras
for police and emergency systems which
we've obviously been talking about a lot
and the way that all of the sensors in a
city might integrate with say the amulet
system a hospital system there's it's
just a really rich set of topics and I'm
excited to hear more about that because
I think it's going to impact the way we
all live our lives I think about like
building to building rooftop to rooftop
drone delivery and how that then frees
up space traffic within a densely
densely populated urban environment you
no longer have to have large trucks you
have a freer flow of traffic or even
there's a rise of ride-sharing services
as we have a better sense of traffic
flow and traffic patterns throughout the
city and you could really really
urban spaces add more green space you
know really a maximized parking is we
already see with some of the parking app
so those are the things that give me
excited it's not just the individual
products but how do they work together
to tell the larger story that in 10-15
years we may see society completely
transformed by the technology we side CS
and 2016 you know that you're mentioning
drone deliveries made me think of Amazon
and that made me think of the fact that
on our smart home panel we're going to
have somebody from the Amazon Alexa team
the product manager there this is the
first time the amazon has actually been
kind of stepping up and willing to
participate in a panel like this which
has gotten us really excited and they're
also going to be we're going to be
talking a lot about voice control that's
something that I'm really interested in
CNET's really interested in and in fact
our next big thing super session which
is always a pact super session at CES is
going to be addressing what we're
calling the end of typing well you know
we're going to be talking a lot about
the new ways in which we interact with
computers and interact with technology
and the way that we speak and gesture
instead of just you know using a
keyboard to input words that are written
down I don't know how you feel about
that if you have any thoughts about that
but but I'm super excited about that
topic and I think it's gonna be sort of
a sleeper hit it see ya it's against
good inside I think Jan I talked about
that like a year ago at our five text
watch session but absolutely i think uh
you imagine what i think will be really
cool will be interesting i agree that
that different ways we interact with the
technology and in think about again I
keep trying to go bigger picture like
I'm some Sun but I guess I want to be a
visionary some sort but I'll keep
pretending but that's right access for
the disabled for the elderly and how
these technologies these these new
applications these new ways that will
interact and interface with our products
sort of expand the accessibility for so
many people it's an amazing thing if you
think about those applications I'm also
excited about robotic show it's been fun
to see the development of robots over
the past couple years from sort of you
know in 10 years or so ago eight or so
ago they were really in the toy area and
now they become really cool and
sophisticated parts of our lives whether
it's the robotic cooker
we had last year that you put in the
ingredients and it had paddles and arms
to sort of prepare your meal for you to
fist acade robots that actually resemble
resemble humans and have human features
that again can help the disabled and
help the elderly so I think robotics is
gonna be really cool as well yeah I I
seem to remember a robot bartender at
some point that's really useful to
people haha if we can make you drinks
and getting their linking your driver's
car and I it's about Hardy robots but
seriously I there are their robotics
categories it might surprise people I
mean we've read a lot about caretaking
robots like you mentioned we've we all
know about vacuuming robots those are
great what are some other kind of
interesting uses or do you think that
we'll be seeing some some I know you
don't know everything that's gonna
happen at the show but some sort of
creative exhibitions I always seek good
stuff from Intel along these line yeah
I'm excited suit in saw static that's
exactly right i think that the president
has talked about the Internet of Things
the last couple of years when he's
keynote and I think they're going to now
expand and move into some interesting
develop salon robotics lines I think
part of it will be again it's it's the
sometimes you have innovation that comes
in huge leaps you have the introduction
of a tablet you have the introduction of
a smartphone and sometimes technological
innovation comes along and just slow
increments that sometimes you don't even
notice and I think that maybe one of the
things we see in robotics am if you look
at some of the robots through their last
year or something worse still a bit
clunky they click they clearly were
robots but I think we'll see them
sophistication and expanded use as well
I think caretaking is a huge huge area
both in terms of serious caretaking of
the ill the elderly as well as just sort
of having that that personalized Butler
which I'm totally psyched for oh it's
all example great as well as the the
toys women talked about 3d printing
which is going to be huge and not again
just as a a home device to to create
home goods and sort of support the whole
maker effort but but the increased use
of 3d printing to create prosthetics for
for humans and animals
to create food and and at lower and
lower price points as well absolutely I
mean three I feel like every year 3d
printing is kind of hovering in the
background and there's every year
there's a new 3d printer that prints
something else right we've never seen
before right like come see the 3d print
I think last year it was either last
year the year before we saw a printer I
guess not necessarily 3d printer but a
printer that was printing fingernail
designs right it was actually a nail
polish printer which you know it made me
not the most world-changing printer but
we see printer was creating clothing
like you and food like you mentioned any
other categories are not thinking about
are we going to see any any sort of
printers that print in biological matter
I think you'll see some of those
absolutely phenomenal stories coming out
it will see some advances there I think
if we you know you're familiar with you
reek apart your part for those of you
who haven't been in the past is an area
at the sands that focuses on our startup
community were gonna have more than 500
companies this year it's gone from a
couple hundred just a couple years ago
to over 500 now they have the latest
that they're really small startup
companies and I know a lot of them that
I've looked at the list or focused on on
3d printing as well as a wide variety of
other services and applications that's
so cool what we found when we cover the
show is that you know we there's
excitement that that goes throughout the
entire show so we always have great
preview content that comes from what we
cover at CES unveiled which is a press
event that happens the day before press
day and then press day we've got you a
great wall to wall coverage but then we
also get really excited about the
smaller companies we find just walking
around the show floor and covering in in
you know the days that are of the show
that are open to all attendees and I
just I just kind of want to give a shout
out for a second to the smaller
companies that bring little unexpected
things that really for us often end up
being the gems and I'm sure that that's
an exciting part of the show for you too
Jeff well I think that's that's my
favorite part of the show that you talk
about what gets me excited I love I'll
go and I'm shopping for 4k uhdtv so i'll
be looking at those walking before i get
excited about the robotics and the in 3d
printers and the driverless cars but the
best part is just the Serendip
right how cool is it to walk the show
floor and stumble upon something and say
wow I had no idea that that is so cool
or again to sort of project and see what
the what the future use might be this
this story's going to date me so bear
with me but I remember walking the show
floor gosh maybe 15 years ago and
wandering around to the back of North
Hall and coming across small company
that was selling one of the first of the
USB memory sticks key fobs and I'm ever
thinking the time like that is so cool
what a smart idea and now look right the
ubiquitous they're you know they're
disposable so that's sort of serendipity
that sort of fun of exciting that next
new cool thing whether it's something
small but but totally utilitarian like
that it's something really big and
revolutionary that's part of the fun of
the shell is just you never know what
you're gonna find it's it's so great I'm
really really looking forward to that
part and I always try to make sure that
i carve out some just time on my own at
the end of the show and I'm not busy to
just to just walk the show floor or
whatever part of the show floor I can
make it to be back um Jeff before we
wrap up we just have a few more minutes
but I want to give you a chance to
highlight anything else that you are
particularly excited about this year or
that you really want anybody who's gonna
be viewing this from the outside to know
yeah well there's so much um so some of
the other good everything we talked
about is awesome and you can tell I'm
excited I can tell you're excited I have
to give a shout-out to it again to 4k
uhdtv and we're going to see the next
generation of 4k displays at the show
that include all these next sort of
really cool technological innovations
like HDR high dynamic range which gives
you amazing blacks and contrast wider
color gamut so that Apple on TV look so
good you can you can eat it we're going
to see some content announcements maybe
even some of the first 4k blu-ray
players which I think would be really
cool I'm an audiophile I'm really
excited about high resolution audio and
continue to see that evolution and and
next generation of products there and
then the intersection of Technology in
healthcare you know we've had the
fitness bands for for a long time but
we're really speaking to see sort of
deeper dive into now that you've
collected all that that data that
information how do you make it helpful
and beneficial how do you share that
across devices
share that with your medical providers
how can it help improve outcomes and
then the last thing I'll say is a sports
technology the intersection of
Technology and sports content we're
really excited to have a partnering with
Fox we're producing a day-long
conference on sports technology we're
going to have the Commissioner of
baseball and some other sports leagues
there to talk about how it improves the
fan experience how it improves and
allows them to better monitor athletes
health will be having a NBA live
broadcasting from the show floor as well
so there's like I can go on is go to see
us web wat cnet and and just get as much
as you can that's great and I want to
remind everybody that this show actually
starts january six in las vegas but cnet
will be on the ground much much earlier
than that we will be starting our
covered in fact our coverage launches
tomorrow so go to CES cnet com if you
want to see our coverage and um in and
really tune in early because we'll be
there in the days ahead of the show
getting ready and telling setting the
scene will be there on the ground at
press day reporting as only people who
are loud and depressed I can and we're
always super excited about that and we
will be live streaming keynotes so so
join us and and visit visit CES web org
visit at CES on twitter and of course
follows cnet thank you so much Jeff for
talking to me this is really fun to
catch up awesome Lizzy thank you so much
wrapping me thanks for all your great
coverage and I look forward to seeing
