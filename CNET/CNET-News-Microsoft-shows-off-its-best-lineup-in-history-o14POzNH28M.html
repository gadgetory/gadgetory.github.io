say he believes Xbox one's lineup is the
greatest in history well how did that
shake out Microsoft showed off
single-player campaign from halo 5
Guardians which will hit October 27 also
hitting xbox one exclusively this year
it's for two motorsports six reboots of
the original Gears of War a 30 game
anthology from developer rare and an
exclusive beta this December of the
division from Ubisoft
I must find a way rise of the Tomb
Raider will also be an exclusive this
year but only x which means you be able
to play it on other platforms down the
road microsoft also flexed its english
german trousers with debuts of IV at
xbox games with really impressive titles
like cuphead ashen tacoma and beyond
eyes phil spencer reinforced the
company's continuing investing in the
platform coupled with the announcement
of a new xbox elite controller that will
feature pro level customization your
xbox 360 game a big surprise was also
the announcement of xbox 360 backwards
compatibility where players will be able
to play a hundred titles from the back
catalog this holiday season digital
titles will supposedly automatically
show up and retail this will work as
well but your disc in download the game
and you're ready to go we're still not a
hundred sure how it will all work but
nevertheless it's a major announcement
Microsoft then pivoted into VR as well
telling us Windows 10 or be involved
directly with valves VR ambitions and
that hollow lens will feature a special
Minecraft version of the game we
actually got to see a killer demo of
someone viewing a virtual minecraft
world projected on a table the demo
absolutely stole the show he can walk
around the hologram pan around four
different viewpoints and even look
inside overall it was a solid effort
from Microsoft this year and we also got
a handful of teases from titles that
will be hitting beyond this year the
makers of metroid prime will be
releasing recore exclusively for xbox
one will also be getting a Gears of War
for which is actually demoed live at the
show
finally a new game from developer rare
called sea of thieves was also teased
Microsoft did what they needed to view
this year and that's giving gamers a
compelling reason to own an xbox one
that's it for me at the e3 press
conference here at e3 2015 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
