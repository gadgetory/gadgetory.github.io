Rick the cheapskate broidy here with one
of my all-time favorite money-saving
tools
cash back services you probably already
have a credit card that gives you back
one or two percent on nearly everything
you buy but if you want to double dip to
get even more money back consider using
one of these services I'm a fan of be
frugal Ebates and top cashback but there
are plenty of others having more than
one option when you're shopping will let
you choose the service with the best
cashback rate once you've signed up
visit the cashback services page click
through to the store you want to shop
then complete your purchase like you
normally would that's all there is to it
just remember though that the whole
cashback thing happens behind the scenes
in your browser you won't see any
indication of it in your shopping cart
but you should receive a confirmation
email from the cashback service not long
after you make your purchase some of
these services offer browser toolbars
that will immediately notify you of
cashback is available for any given
store you can then activate the option
without the added step of going through
the portal first in most cases you'll
receive your cashback payout and 90 days
usually in the form of a check or PayPal
deposit so yeah this is real money and
it does add up even if you save only a
few percent here and there after three
months you might be looking at a pretty
hefty rebate I know it sounds almost too
good to be true but I've used these
services for a year and trust me when I
say they work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
