destination for all those stories that
make you say WTF you know robots are
already beating our chests champions
they're solving Rubik's cubes in a
fraction of a second and now those
engineers over at MIT they've come up
with yet another game for them to ruin
they taught this robotic arm to play
Jenga and spoiler alert it's probably
better than you
its strategy is basically the same as
yours the robot uses a camera to look
for the ideal block to remove then it
carefully pushes against it using visual
cues in a device that detects force to
decide whether to keep moving that block
or push it back and move on to another
the robot actually learns as it plays
every time it's about to make a move it
weighs the possible outcome based on all
the previous moves it's made so what's
the point well right now robots aren't
very good at deciding how much force is
needed to accomplish a task so this type
of machine learning could be ideal for
assembly line procedures that require a
delicate touch kind of like threading a
screw on a cellphone you know the older
I get the more I feel like I'm
eventually going to need any surgery
after one of my weekends snowboarding
trips which is why it's actually
comforting to know that virtual reality
is helping surgeons learn to do their
jobs better before you ever even go
under the knife consider this like a
flight simulator but for surgery
designed by fundamental VR the Mayo
Clinic is already using it to train
surgeons
we've seen medical simulators before but
this is the first to combine the imagery
with haptic feedback
I can feel it going in that's Luanne
that means doctors actually feel
realistic sensations this is powered by
fundamental VRS haptic intelligence
engine that mimics the feel of medical
tools and human tissues and it's not
just realistic it's actually
cost-effective it costs less than the
price of one human cadaver now right now
surgeons can use it to practice final
procedures hip replacements and knee
procedures but fundamental says
simulations for laparoscopic surgery and
general surgery are also coming among a
few others
that could be the first engine to carry
humans to Mars in case you missed it
over the weekend Elon Musk tweeted
videos of SpaceX testing its new Raptor
rocket engine it's designed to power the
starship that SpaceX is working on to
take people to Mars
SpaceX says starship will launch from a
rocket it calls super-heavy which will
be powered by 31 Raptor engines no word
on when starship may actually launched
but SpaceX has said it hopes to get to
Mars by the mid-2020s meanwhile on Mars
the NASA insight Lander sent back these
pictures to remind us it's hard at work
its robotic arm put a protective cover
over the seismometer insight put there
in December the seismometer will give
scientists their first look at the deep
interior of Mars back on earth
expect traffic and much more of it why
am I talking about traffic on what the
future because self-driving cars are
going to make it much worse that's the
prediction of a researcher at UC Santa
Cruz he says as self-driving cars become
more common the actual owners are going
to avoid paying parking fees by just
sending their cars to cruise around
while they're off waiting a line for
avocado toast and doing SoulCycle under
the simulation see RAM just 2000
self-driving cars in downtown San
Francisco slowed traffic to less than
two miles per hour of course we're still
a ways off from it even being legal to
send your car off on its own all right
what makes you say what the future let
us know in the comments if you enjoyed
this video maybe give us a thumbs up
thanks so much for watching
