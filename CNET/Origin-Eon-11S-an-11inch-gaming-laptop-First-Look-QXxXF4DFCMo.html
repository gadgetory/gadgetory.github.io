look at the origin Yuans 11s this is a
rare bird indeed it is an 11 inch gaming
laptop you really don't see a lot of
these Alienware actually had one for a
couple years they've just discontinued
that model at almost exactly the same
time as origin has come in to fill that
hole by coming out with this 11 inch
model right here now if this looks you
know not like a super fancy light-up
Alienware gaming laptop that's because
smaller companies like origin where they
make a laptop they can't go and build it
from scratch themselves they kind of get
off-the-shelf laptop bodies often from a
company named cleveo and they customized
a little bit they put their own
components in in this case they put a
back panel on there that has their logo
in two little fins kind of Alienware
like on the back but you still have kind
of a generic look and when you're buying
something that's more than $1,000 you
know you may want something that's a
little bit fancier but there are not
that many choices out there if you want
an 11 inch gaming laptop what they do is
they put a a high end intel core i5 or
i7 chip in here we've got an i7 in here
and an Nvidia graphics card and that's
powerful enough to drive a lot of games
now the screen is only 11 inches it's a
1366 by 768 resolution you're not going
to need a lot of muscle to push a game
on that so I think what most people are
gonna end up doing is what I did which
is take the HDMI output and send the
signal to a big let's say a 24 inch mono
that's running at 1920 by 1080 and then
play your games like that I loaded up
the I'll blow through like that worked
great so if you want to throw this in
your bag take it to a friend's house
hook up to their big monitor or go to a
land party or something if people still
have those this is a way you can bring a
pretty decent gaming machine with you
but you're not stuck to just using the
screen here or the keyboard and touchpad
I mean they're fine for casual use but
for serious gaming you know the
keyboards kind of small the touchpad is
not super sensitive but you probably
hook up your own mouse and your own
external keyboard if you're connecting
to an external monitor there are a lot
of configuration options this actually
starts at 999 but I think you're going
to want to spend a couple hundred
dollars more than that to get a current
generation Intel processor
and the kind of GPU that you need with
this I am Dan Ackerman and that is the
origin Aeon 11s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
