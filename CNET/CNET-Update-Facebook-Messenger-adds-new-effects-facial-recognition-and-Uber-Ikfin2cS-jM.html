surprises this holiday I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update Facebook is
just cramming its messenger app with new
features for the holidays if you're
sharing photos of friends and family
over the chat app you're going to notice
that it can recognize faces and suggest
that you send it to them the facial
recognition tool that's in the main
Facebook app for tagging photos is now
rolling out to the messenger app but in
messenger it's there to remind you to
send the photo to that person now face
book calls it photo magic but if you
call it weird well you can tell Facebook
to not suggest your face to others in
settings or you can turn off suggestions
completely inside messenger the app is
also letting you set a color for a
conversation if you rather not have
everything be blue and white you can
also set nicknames so your mom can show
up as mom instead of her full name on
Facebook and you know that big thumbs up
you can send well you can change that to
another emoji to change these things on
iOS tap the name of the person in the
chat and it will open up a list of
choices on Android there is an info
button on the top right that makes these
changes and the other person is going to
see all the changes you make also there
are some winter surprises if you send
anything winter or snow or Christmas
related in a message you're going to see
snowflakes fall on your screen and for
Android users that still use chat heads
you're going to see snow falling in
profile bubbles or during the new year
it's going to show confetti now not
everything new is a silly effect
Facebook also made a deal with uber so
you can request a ride pickup inside of
the messenger app instead of having to
open a separate uber app type out and
address and click on it to request a
ride or you can tap the car icon now
when you connect your account to
Facebook the first write is free when
you use messenger well it's just a
twenty dollar value which could be
helpful for those holiday parties to get
it to show up you're going to tap the
ellipses more icon and go to
transportation Facebook implies that we
may see other ride services on their
tube and TechCrunch is reporting from a
source that competitor lyft could be on
messenger in January Facebook Messenger
is the fastest-growing app of 2015 and
that
according to a new report from Nielsen
the main Facebook app is still the top
smartphone app of all with more than 126
million average unique users a month but
Facebook Messenger has the greatest
increase of users from last year and
that's because Facebook forces you to
download it if you want to check
privately on mobile that's it for this
tech news update and there's always more
at sea Netcom from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
