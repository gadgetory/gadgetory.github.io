I'm taking a look at the Bissell bolt
ion two-in-one lightweight cordless
vacuum it's terrible like one of the
worst vacuums we've ever tested it does
have a few unique features you can get
under the furniture easily with the
pivoting handle and its edge reach
focuses airflow to get the sides of the
floor more easily I just wish it had a
button to help you I don't know vacuum
the middle of the floor cuz my gosh is
it bad at that on pet hair it tangles
everything and grinds it into the carpet
I'm Cheerios it makes crumbs it's
completely improperly balanced
especially with the hand vac removed
it's going to fall over front to back
constantly and the pivoting head means
even if you get it right front to back
it's going to dip to one of the sides
and removing the hand vac well let me
put it this way it's not intuitive at
all to the point where I challenged
everyone in our office to see if they
could figure out how to do it
intuitively everybody tried and tried
but without the instruction manual we
would all still be stuck the solution is
just to tug on the thing but tugging on
it feels like you're gonna break it
it's definitely not easy and you don't
want to get this vac for any sort of
elderly parent who doesn't have upper
arm strength and here's the thing ease
of use is supposed to be the point of
stick VAX you want a vac that you can
grab for a quick and easy cleaning not
only will this one take much longer to
get out pull out the pain-in-the-butt
hand vac to empty the dustbin clean off
the filter and put back on the
hit-or-miss
charging stand but most of the time the
way it tangles or flings dirt your floor
is going to end up worse than when you
start
pass on the bissell volt ion for the
same 180 dollar cost you can get the
excellent hoover linx
by comparison this thing is really not
worth it for more please be sure to
check out my full review in all of our
other vacuum coverage on CNET comm for
