know why you guys thought I was leaving
the Apple bite but I'm back from
vacation for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple now a lot of
you've been asking if I got that gold
iPhone 5s well you know I've got it I'm
digging it but the champagne color it's
so subtle that it looks like silver half
the time what a bummer all right it's
all about the upcoming iPad refresh this
week we still don't have any official
announcement date but Reuters reports
that production problems with the
rumored retina display for the ipad mini
2 means it will have limited quantities
if at all this year with full-scale
production in 2014 yikes now this
doesn't sound good at all and it also
means competitors like Amazon and Google
could have the advantage they need this
holiday to grow market share one source
says the delays were due to the strict
power-saving specifications put down by
Apple for samsung LG and sharp also a
lot of you keep asking me if Apple will
actually bring the touch ID technology
to the new iPads as well rumors
appointed to know so far so it's unclear
if they end up making it but just to
stir the conversation up a little bit
youtuber unboxtherapy tore apart in
iphone 5s and has collected the
purported front plate for the ipad 5 and
says the gold touch ID ring fits
perfectly inside which would make for a
real small home button in the ipad but
this is all for fun and i could be wrong
but my gut right now says no so you know
just wait for the ipad 5 s alright KGI
analyst ming-chi kuo also reports that
the next gen ipad in retina ipad mini
will bump up to an 8 megapixel camera
with a larger aperture for better
pictures one of the highlights of the 5s
is its improved camera so hopefully they
bring the same to the ipads and more
videos have leaked out this time it's a
hands-on with the ipad 5s housing in
space grey which is still a made of
color now the team from SW box calm
compares it to the design of the ipad 4
and ipad mini it's smaller thinner and
lighter and we pretty much know all of
that but we're just giving you guys a
little eye candy
now the iphone 5s has been out for a
couple of weeks now and you'll always
have some issues popping up here and
there now everyone's been talking about
how some people are experiencing vertigo
or dizziness from the new iOS floating
backdrop so if it's affecting you check
this out just jump into the settings
then general then accessibility find the
reduce motion option and turn it on and
it will turn off the parallax effect of
the icons that make them look like
they're floating above the backdrop in
hopefully it helps you out but if that
doesn't work the team at the Jimmy Kim
will show have a better solution do you
suffer from nausea headaches and vertigo
due to iOS 7 maybe you should try stop
looking at me dong every five seconds
stop looking at your phone every five
seconds is it safe and effective way to
get faster you before you Instagram that
photo update your status or check in on
foursquare try stop looking at your
phone every five seconds hey all right I
feel much better now apple says they
know about it in there working on a fix
with an upcoming software update they
said the issue affects a fraction of a
percent of users but I guess I'm one of
them I feel special all right to the
quick bites Apple is overtaking
coca-cola as the most valuable brand in
the world according to brand consulting
company interbrand knocking the beverage
company down from its 13-year rain for
the best global brands coca-cola
actually dropped to number three and the
other tech giant Google is number two
9to5 mac also reports the applecare
support staff has started training on OS
10 mavericks ahead of its expected end
of October launch and we've talked about
Apple's m-phy a game controller standard
in the past and here's a look at leaked
shots of Logitech's upcoming game pad
for the iphone you'll also see there's
an open space for the rear camera so it
could support augmented reality apps or
other games that use the iphone's camera
and this is a story I couldn't ignore
while I was gone on vacation in a recent
USA Today interview Johnny I've said
he'd like to design cups if he wasn't
designing gadgets for Apple
cups or iPhones or iPads like these cups
or these cups well you can make the call
but i'm just gonna wait to see what the
iWatch looks like all right let's
