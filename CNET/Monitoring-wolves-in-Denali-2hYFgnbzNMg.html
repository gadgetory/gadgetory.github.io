Wolverine picks at the carcass of a
moose
it is likely unaware that the wolves
that killed this moose are nearby a
camera scientist place near the kill
site records everything
it's a rare look at how wolves survive
in an untouched ecosystem
here we are in Alaska's Denali National
Park to find out what technology
scientists and other employees here are
using to track wildlife Denali is six
million acres of wilderness largely
unchanged by humans due to its
remoteness the wildlife here
caribou dall sheep moose and their main
predators bears and wolves make up a
rare intact ecosystem and a unique
living laboratory for biologists park
staff have been tracking Denalis grey
wolf since 1986 in an ongoing effort to
better understand their behavior there
are an estimated 75 wolves in Denali
separated into nine packs because of the
size of the park tracking them can be
very difficult trail cameras are an
effective way to keep an eye on them
without physically being there
scientists placed this one at a wolf
kill last February it also caught other
predators feeding there as the day's
wore on park wildlife biologists trekked
through the park off trail to locate
dens and set up the durable motion and
heat sensing cameras designed to
withstand temperatures as low as
negative 40 degrees they attached them
to trees pointing directly at dens that
were recently active hoping the same
pregnant female will return the
following year to give birth or that a
new pack will find it and use it the
cameras are battery-powered and don't
connect to a cell tower or a Wi-Fi
network they're completely off the grid
and the team returns to the site once a
year to retrieve the SD cards replace
the cameras and review the footage what
they find helps them gather additional
data about pack behavior how many pups
were born and more other wolf tracking
is even more hands on the team fits one
to three wolves from every pack living
in the park with weatherproof
battery-powered GPS collars each collar
provides the coordinates of a wolf's
last-known location within the last four
hours
along with GPS data the collars are also
outfitted with radio transmitters Park
wildlife biologists use a radio tracking
antenna to determine if there are any
wolves nearby when they're out doing
field work the range is roughly three to
four miles but it's reception depends on
the terrain all of this data together
helps the National Park Service better
understand an elusive species not just
wolves travel patterns in and around
Denali but also their ecological
significance in the park and how they
respond to climate changes in one of the
wildest places on earth
