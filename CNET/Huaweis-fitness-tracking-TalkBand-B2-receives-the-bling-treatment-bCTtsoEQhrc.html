almost every type of device imaginable
to stay above the crowd hallways torque
band b1 was a fitness tracker that comes
apart to become a bluetooth earpiece its
successor the top bun b2 is much for
staying but it does make a few key
improvements most notably that in the
style as you can see here the original
model was the unit essentially just
wrapped inside a rubber body but the new
model is a much more attractive looking
metal affair particularly on this model
that has the gold metal and also the
leather strap as we saw with the
previous model the taut band b1
essentially is the computer that pops
out of the strap now when it does this
you can use this as the bluetooth
earpiece and it sits quite comfortably
in your ear for you to take calls when
you're wearing it as a fitness band it
will use its gyroscope and accelerometer
to try and give you an idea of how many
steps you've taken and therefore how
many calories you've burned it will
actually also try and automatically tell
you what sort of activity you're doing
whether that's just a slow walk or a
more active run it will also try and
automatically work out when you're
sleeping and to give an idea of how well
your sleep went the screen sort of
appears from beneath the surface of a
unit which is fairly easy to read in
here although in bright sunlight that
might be a little more challenging one
advantage is though is that it's been
given touchscreen which makes it much
more easy to navigate well he hasn't yet
said exactly how much we're taught ban
b2 is going to cost although it
shouldn't cost a lot more than its
predecessor which retailed them in UK at
least and around a hundred pounds its
you to go on sale later this year
although we don't exactly know what date
but make sure to keep it C net for all
