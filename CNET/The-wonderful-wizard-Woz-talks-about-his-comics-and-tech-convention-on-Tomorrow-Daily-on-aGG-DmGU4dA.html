only see was Mia yes and you are you are
talking about Silicon Valley comic-con
cuz I've always loved fun things I've
always loved entertainment events I've
even put on musical festivals of my own
in the past yeah and so this is a big
deal yes this is very exciting and we
heard that this this came from a fusion
of two of the people that were most
influential on my life you and Stanley
listen I met Stanley about two years ago
and he's a hero to me and I'm a hero to
him we hit it off and they couldn't stop
us from pocket of each other we're so
excited we said we got to do something
we got to come up with something we
didn't come up with it right away but
other people around finally suggested
let's put a comic con together we know
how it's done we know how to do it and
stand I said go let's do it that's
amazing and it's really cool and one of
the things we really like personally for
tomorrow daily what we like about
Silicon Valley comic-con is your kind of
taking these really high concept ideas
in technology and science you're kind of
baking them into what is now mainstream
culture it's not you know being a geek
isn't a weird thing anymore you're not a
weirdo of your geek your your everyone
and so we really like this idea that
you're kind of bringing these things
together like what kind of what kind of
made you think like okay let's bring in
technology and let's have you know babak
from neff from JPL come in and talk
about space or you know any of the other
gifts that you guys have yes the dwell
genesis of the idea was largely we're in
Silicon Valley we have a lot of
technical people a lot of technol people
like the fantasy of the movies and that
science fiction and the comic heroes of
that imaginative and where people that
turn imagination into products but let's
not make it a technology fair there's a
lot of technology shows let's only
handpick types of technology that go
along with the pop culture so it just
made sense and it was suggested at first
cuz we're in Silicon Valley and we like
doing things different I don't like
doing the same thing as everyone else
ever I like to be first of things and
we're also going to do this technology
plus pop culture idea in Silicon Valley
Tokyo we're working on that one too
that's awesome because it makes sense
because there's Tokyo's known for a lot
of people at least in the past that
we're really
one muscle and tomorrow it's it's where
tomorrow happens there's robots there
that I still would like to meet to this
day I don't know we talked a lot about
future technology on our show and we
think it's really exciting and cool that
you're doing this comic-con as a way to
kind of merge all of your favorite
things like you said but also a lot of
other people's favorite things in a way
that is not just kind of pandering to
the math it's like hey we're going to
talk about one of the panels is you guys
super babies versus I bet your favorite
penalty well you know what after reading
the Martian and the way geeks kept all
the numbers on the fly and do all the
science yeah that seen Andy weir speak
to author of the Martian that's gonna be
good too but really I think the one I
want to go to the most is a i vs super
babies because all the time we're
focused on AI is where the goods where
the bads how does it come out for humans
yeah and I'm on the real positive side
right now you're the positive side of a
I'm very positive all right tell us more
about yeah tell us about that because I
I'd gone through the negative side okay
I've gone through the negative side if
machines can think independently program
themselves better than we can program
advance faster and they get smarter than
us well economically they'll replace our
best thinkers even our best scientists
they'll be able to think better our
times faster than us or something for
example economic I'm the big the big
financial trades of the world eighty
percent of them are computer to computer
in milliseconds because if you put a
slow human in the loop you lose money
well what if you set up a company across
the street from Apple building similar
products and you skip the slow humans
even a CEO and the company does better
economically could win so that's a fear
what if they're replacing higher and
higher levels of use of the real human
brain there is so much to do to robots
being a quantity of them and running
everything in the world and actually
being able to to be on their own know
the only their existence is going to
really depend upon us for a long long
time no matter how smart they are and
we're going to be working together
they're going to be at they helping us I
have a better life we don't have to work
as hard we've never worked as much and
maybe only one person has to work four
days a week to own a home in Silicon
Valley that's my dream that was my that
was my dream when I was a kid when we
took one person five days a week I was
hoping it would go to four but now it
takes two people full-time stress
jobs 18 they do it all right you can own
a home yeah same thing in San Francisco
so you would say did you see the new
updated atlas that Boston Dynamics post
this video Alice getting the box knocked
out of his hands with a hockey stick the
guy had a whole chicken kept like
pushing buckle your pants pokin and
knocking him over and stuff we just so
you would be technically pro robot in
that scenario you'd be like hey stop
pushing that robot around I don't know
I'm but I'd the robots I think we're
going to help us get a lot more done as
human beings for a long time and they're
going to realize that that with it's
better to be friends to us now as a gasm
I've had a law of robotics no robot can
harm a human being or by now collision
it's an action allow sounds good to
people who the people who think good and
don't believe in harming people that
sounds good but Isaac Asimov had it all
wrong a robot doesn't obey our rule of
Robotics if it thinks for itself a
thinking robot right feeling
consciousness it wouldn't that rule is
only one that was given to it it's a
slave to human rule so I have was his
law no human should harm a feeling robot
when a robot has a feeling and knows
you're killing it turning it off you
should not because then they'll take a
take us on as a type of enemy hmm no boy
like that wise is law yeah I don't hurt
the don't hurt the machines once they
feel do what they say 13 shadows on of
course will hurt animals but these
machines might be a little more than an
animal yeah well I mean and I think they
know if they were you know sentient AI
that we talked about a lot in science
fiction and even now we're starting to
talk about it in you know computing and
everything but they should see us as
partners and also I think that human
beings we look at the travails of the
world the hunger and poverty and Wars
and all that I think it comes from our
own lack of lack of being thoughtful so
we're kind of emotional and we react and
psychologists say it comes a lot from
our inner conflict of mortality
eyetality and we know that if I don't
win a contest on dying and he's losing
easily and he's living in yeah so that's
why I say don't harm the robots we don't
want to give them a sense of their
mortality even well we have a hard
enough time treating humans well it's
going to be tough treating machines
but I sure but i think that shades if
there's so much smarter than us they're
not going to make such a crummy world as
we've made i really want to believe in
my heart they're going to figure out
ways to cooperate and find a lot more to
lock cooperation and much less of the
travails we have and that they'll find a
way to have a world without work and
they'll realize the importance of nature
and taking care of everything including
humans that are a part of nature now
we're talking about this you brought
Isaac Asimov we're talking about this in
very much science fiction terms were you
always inspired by science fiction and
fantasy and genre always always I'd
rather read and watch movies their
science fiction than most anything yeah
well suspense is good too but so it
totally explains you know Silicon Valley
compound all these things the other um
so aside from super babies vs AI which i
think is probably one of the best panels
I've seen at a con what what is one of
your other favorite panel speakers
happening at Silicon Valley comic-con I
have always been very poor at anything
artistic in the normal sense of art
other than digital art and I'm afraid to
try it and show people pictures or
something like that so I want to go to
the cosplay events and find out what
they do I just as an observer quiet well
when you can cosplay would you guys play
it I would be so scared I'm so bad I
would be too scared of being busted I
think I can I think I can act the part
well yeah sure I really believe that but
wearing costume I don't know do you
think that might be a good way for you
to kind of get around on the show floor
sort of like um mm does it at cat san
diego comic-con he'll dress into her
amazing costume and be able to not get
mom I'm gonna be totally open going
around meeting everybody the whole time
I want to meet the attendees the
attendees are the important people to me
and I will but I will catch a few of the
panels that are important that's cool
that's really cool that you're gonna be
you want to also be a fan of the content
that's happening as opposed to just
saying hey right on this comic con I
don't even know who runs ever come it
looks like i'll probably watching a lot
of other plug people doing the cosplay
and all that and i'll learn from that
maybe i'll be ready for it someday yeah
hey listen I'd when you're ready to make
your cosplay just let us know what we
could debut it on a show you just and
where maybe we'll do a how-to you can
tell show people how you built it
because I think that ya think
you seem to really dig the how of every
little actually intellectually I'm ready
but emotionally I am so scared do you do
you step seeker Avery you still tinker
with stuff do you still work on things I
wish I wish I did but I have very busy
life but yeah I've some technology
companies going on and I've got a lot of
speaking tours I think that I know the
time I think about it all the time
though and what could I do to bring that
fun to other kids and I'd love to see
them doing it yeah yes I think cosplay
is an expression of that too that that
hands-on craftsmanship if you're into
something that's your passion it's in
your heart and I'm going to play it out
I'm going to be a big part of this in my
life and it doesn't even have to be
worth anything when we started with
personal computers it didn't have to be
worth anything just had to be something
we believed in and wanted to do yeah
it'd be worth money there's a big part
of the show as VR is that's a technology
excites you the vr-zone yeah is exactly
right for this because look at the magic
images of comic books and you know and
the visual effects of movies and how
powerful they are and we our computer
screens got better and better remember
8-bit 8-bit game but they look like
little cartoon characters barely like
like anything and it got more and more
real they started looking like a little
bit like characters in hand drawn
cartoons and then they start looking
like real football games and real people
in real movies that's where we've gone
with computers but this whole room
sunday could possibly be a screen yeah
and I'm in a whole different world and I
could press buttons and walk through it
and everything well that's what virtual
reality does for us now yeah oculus rift
and I think I can speak for us all when
I say we're all kind of ready and
willing for the holodeck but that's like
this thing exactly off the whole again
did you talk through what I'm describing
yeah yeah I love wait yeah we can't wait
thank you so much for talking to us
