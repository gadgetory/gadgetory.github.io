came with your camera is great for
getting started but eventually you will
grow out of it so if you're ready to
purchase a new lens I have a few
recommendations on exactly how to go
about it hands down my favorite lens is
the 50 millimeter 1.8 fixed lens it's
great for portraits food photos and
still life it is a prime lens or fixed
lens so it doesn't zoom which means
you'll have to get really close to your
subject in order to frame up but the
trade-off is huge
it's a fast lens with a wide aperture
which means super sharp photos even in
low-light the best part is that it's
only 100 dollars and that's not as cheap
as it gets when you're shopping for
portrait lens what you want is a lens
that won't distort your subject you want
the person to look like they do to the
human eye you also want that really cool
blurry background effect on a full size
sensor camera like the Canon 5d get a
lens with a focal length of 80
millimetres to 100 millimetres on a crop
sensor camera like this one that
translates to about 50 millimetres if
you want to go any shorter than 50
millimetres your subject will start to
look a little too stretched out so stick
with this range
for food photography you don't
necessarily need a zoom lens instead go
in the prime lens like the 35 millimeter
1.4 at this focal length the shots will
be just wide enough to get a crisp photo
of an entire plate of food without
distorting it since it's fixed you will
have to move around to get closer or
wider but really that's a part of the
intimacy of food photography when you're
traveling there's a good chance you'll
want to lens it'll take great landscape
photos letting you capture wide sweeping
shots of whatever exotic place you're in
if you have to choose one lens to take
with you on a trip the 18 to 35
millimeter 1.8 is the way to go
and its widest you'll get great sweeping
views of landscape and it's still great
for close-ups of food and portraits of
people all around this is a great go-to
lens
