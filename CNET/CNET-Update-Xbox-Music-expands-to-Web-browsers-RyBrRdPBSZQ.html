reservation with Groupon I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
Microsoft's Xbox music can now be
streamed from a web browser xbox music
first launched in october for windows 8
and xbox 360 users but now the streaming
music service can be accessed from the
web it lets you stream millions of songs
as well as by songs and access the
tracks on multiple devices it's free to
try for 30 days but you have to give
your credit card number to try it out
and you'll want to turn off automatic
renewal because after the trial you'll
be charged ten dollars a month a year
long pass costs less in the long run at
a hundred dollars it'll be coming to
Android and iOS devices sometime later
this year groupon has added a new way to
get deals on restaurants the site
launched groupon reserve where users can
reserve tables at the best restaurants
in their city at discounts of up to
forty percent and you won't have to show
a voucher the discount is just applied
to the check a while ago Groupon
acquired the website savored and this is
the same thing as savored groupon
reserve is in 10 markets to start
eventually it'll also feature deals at
spas salons and hotels the company
that's certainly not happy about all
this is open table which also does
online reservations we have another clue
that the Apple iWatch could be coming
out soon Apple has filed a trademark in
Japan for the name i watch the filing
was first reported by Bloomberg AT&amp;amp;T
could be working on self destructing
emails ATT filed a patent for an email
system that will destroy a message in a
given amount of time regardless if it's
ever opened but of course someone can
always copy save or forward an email so
a message can always come back to haunt
you still it could be an interesting
concept if it becomes a reality and the
Twitter universe may be getting smaller
thanks to a language translation tool
being tested some users are seeing
tweets automatically translated into
English on twitter com and in the
Twitter Windows Phone app but it's not
an official feature yet there are
smartphone apps that help you hail a cab
in
order a luxury car to give you a ride
but now you can use an app to order a
helicopter yeah at least you can on
Wednesday if you live in New York City
the app uber is offering helicopter
service those wanting to get away to the
Hamptons for an Independence Day holiday
at the reasonable price of three
thousand dollars but if you rather just
order a car service to the popular
seaside resort of Long Island uber is
selling rides throughout the summer at a
flat rate starting at three hundred
dollars how charming that's your tech
news update you can find more details at

New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
