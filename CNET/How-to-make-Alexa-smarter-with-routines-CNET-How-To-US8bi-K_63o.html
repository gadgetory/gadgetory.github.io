smart speakers to date is having to
speak multiple commands to perform a
simple task for instance changing the
color of smart bulbs locking the door
and adjusting the thermostat temperature
used to take three separate commands now
you can do it with just one using
routines on your Alexa speaker here's
how to set it up start by opening the
Alexa app on android or iOS tap the
hamburger button in the top left corner
and select settings scroll down to
accounts and tap routines next tap the
plus sign in the top right corner here
you can choose between when you say
something or at scheduled time if you
select when you say something type in a
phrase such as good morning or movie
time if you select at scheduled time set
a time and choose which days it should
repeat then click done to continue next
tap add action for actions you can
choose between news traffic and weather
which will play just like in your flash
briefing however you can also choose
smart home actions these actions include
turning on a scene or controlling
individual devices such as turning on or
off smart lights or locking a smart lock
click Add to finish adding an action and
repeat until all actions are added to
the routine
finally choose which speaker the routine
will play audio from if you use a
scheduled routine you will have to
select a specific speaker but if you
create a routine based on a phrase you
can select a specific speaker or you can
specify that you wanted to play audio
from whichever speaker you speak to to
finalize the routine click create once a
routine is created you can edit it by
going back to settings and routines in
the Alexa app and tapping on a routine
there you can remove or rearrange
actions add new actions change the time
or day the routine runs or change the
phrase you can temporarily disable the
routine by tapping the toggle next to
enabled and if you tap the three dots on
the top right corner you can manually
play a routine or permanently delete it
sadly there is one unfortunate caveat
with routines you can't have a routine
where you say something like storytime
and dim the lights and listen to an
audio book or your favorite podcast you
can't have a routine stream music or
start a skill either still this should
reduce the overall number of commands
you have to issue to Alexa to accomplish
what you want
and if nothing else it's a huge win for
Alexa users everywhere for more Alexa
