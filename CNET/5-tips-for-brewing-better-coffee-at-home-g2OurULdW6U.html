already know you can brew a great cup at
home for less than what you'd spend at a
coffee shop
it doesn't require any expensive
equipment just a few simple techniques
that can greatly improve the taste of
your coffee regardless of how fancy or
basic your coffee machine is here are
five tips and tricks to improve the
taste of your coffee at home a cup of
coffee is only as good as the beans that
you start with so if you're purchasing
bags of pre-ground coffee from your
local supermarket you're doing it wrong
instead buy fresh whole bean coffee and
invest in a coffee grinder coffee is a
perishable item it reaches its peak
flavor just a few days after it's been
roasted and it tends to go stale a month
to a month and a half after its roast 8
and that's the major reason a lot of
Coffee Roasters don't put the date which
the coffee was roasted right on the bag
the stuff you find in your supermarket
has probably been on the shelf for
months your best option is to try to
find a local coffee roaster and buy the
coffee when it's still fresh just a week
or two weeks off roast and try to finish
that bag before about a month after the
roast 8 if you're buying fresh coffee
you might as well do what you can to
keep that coffee as fresh as possible
for as long as you can and the way you
store that matters a lot the core size
jar is perfect for storing a 12 ounce
bag of coffee but you can also downsize
as you go through the bag to a pint size
or even a 4 ounce jar for single
servings experts say that coffee begins
to lose its flavor just thirty minutes
after it's been ground imagine a bag
that's pre ground and has been sitting
on the shelf for months your best option
is to grind your coffee just before you
brew and it doesn't require a very
expensive automatic burg rinder you can
actually get a hand mill for relatively
cheap making better coffee is often
about eliminating as many variables as
possible and one way to do that is to
use the same ratio of coffee to water
every single time you brew using that
scoop to measure your coffee is a pretty
ineffective way to do that instead what
you want to do is weigh your coffee
volume varies from coffee to coffee
especially on different roast levels a
common ratio found in coffee shops is
one part coffee to 20 parts water some
people find that a little weak and will
go as high as one part coffee to twelve
parts water but other people find a
little too strong so they'll go
hello as one part coffee to 30 parts
water a crucial step that a lot of
automatic coffee makers skip is
pre-infusion also known as the bloom in
this step you prep the coffee for
extraction by pouring hot water over the
grounds this helps release any remaining
carbon dioxide left from the roasting
process if you skip this step the carbon
dioxide left in the grounds can actually
repel the water leading to under
extracted coffee or effectively a weaker
brew check to make sure that your coffee
maker has a pre infused option and that
it's enabled if not you may want to heat
up a little water and pre infuse the
coffee grounds on your own before you
start the automatic brewer for more on
