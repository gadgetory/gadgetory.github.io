franklin and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumors and vote on what
sounds likely and what's probably not
true and remember that you can vote on
all the rumors too so keep your eye out
for the pole in the interactive player
if you're watching on Cena first up
according to Macotakara Apple's iPhone
5s and rumored low-cost iPhone could
come in a rainbow of colors wait that's
the rumor and haven't we heard that
before yeah but wait let me finish so
these possible colors could be pink and
green and blue and yellow orange but
they're already like tons of cases with
different colors what does Apple get the
yellow orange in real life steampunk
rumors Google could soon use blimps and
balloons to bring Wi-Fi to remote parts
of Africa and Asia according to Wired
dubbed high-altitude platforms or haps I
guess these flying machines will
reportedly connect roughly a billion
additional people to the Internet it
will also bring us closer to some kind
of cool steampunk-inspired future Oh
like BioShock Infinite yeah or Watchmen
or skies of arcadia or the adventures of
baron munchausen that's a really good
one batman the animated series they also
use it really well they're blimps are
cool really really cool or the new Three
Musketeers movie know the one done by
Paul WS Anderson not the one from a few
years ago they did they did like have a
super to remake this wasn't that good
but the Paul WS Anderson was actually
really cool if you you know anything
about that and also there's kind of like
in other iphone news 9to5 mac is
reporting that iOS 7 will have a more
simplified look anonymous sources report
that Jony ive Apple's design chief has
decided to drop the textures the shiny
icons and the lifelike design features
in favor of a simpler interface because
he doesn't believe that software design
that mimics their real life counterparts
will hold up over time so he's calling
this look flat so the Notes app won't
actually look like a notebook and the
iBooks app won't look like a bookcase I
don't believe it this is a totally
anonymous source and until
jony ive is there with a white
background and the great t-shirt
actually saying this I won't believe it
I know and like what a waste of
resources how about fixing autocorrect
or adding some quick access toggles or
including some proper multitasking
features on well that's really all I
have well moving on with the reveal of
Microsoft's new Xbox one console last
week gamers especially the hardcore up
in arms about how the big MS plans to
handle use games on the new system after
plenty of cryptic responses from
Microsoft execs xbox live's Major Nelson
finally responded to clear things up the
ability to trade in and resell games is
important to gamers and to xbox Xbox one
is designed to support the trade end and
resale of games reports about our
policies for trade in and resell or
inaccurate and incomplete we will
disclose more information in the near
future so if we were in a relationship
with Microsoft this would be like us
asking where do you see us in six months
and it responding with I love you baby
your needs are so important to me I'm
thinking about them and have a plan for
us look for more news at e3 yeah pretty
much and if they just come out and said
that instead of giving us mixed messages
from the get-go then maybe we wouldn't
be so upset are we still talking about
Microsoft I don't even know anymore what
do you guys think will the next Xbox
play used games is that going to be a
deal-breaker is Eric going to be okay
don't forget to vote and leave us a
comment and we'll check in with the cnet
council the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by Cena or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the council's verdict is yes 425
editor's say that it will play used
games however one editor said it
probably will exact some kind of fee
that will make us all miserable that's
our show everybody please share your
rumors at rumor has it at cnet com or
call us at 1 800 750 cnet and tweet us
and tune in next week for more tech
rumors
