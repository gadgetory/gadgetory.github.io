gadgets of 2017 we can't predict the
future but we do have a general idea of
what's coming let's take a look at a
tech we want to see most at number five
is a Nintendo switch you've got to hand
it to Nintendo the company tries some
wild things its next console the
Nintendo switch is a hybrid a home and
portable console it's an interesting
idea
Nintendo knows the handheld market very
well maybe the lure of being able to
play a game anywhere to bring market
share Nintendo's way number four is the
Tesla Model 3 first unveiled in March
2016 the Tesla Model 3 is supposed to be
delivered by late 2017 the Model 3 could
be the vehicle that puts Tesla cars
everywhere
it starts at $35,000 and should go at
least 215 miles on a single charge
we'll see if Tesla can keep up with
demand coming in at number three is the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 no note 7 was an
awesome phone it was one of the best
phones CNET had tried out then came the
reports that batteries were overheating
and bursting into flames
Samsung has said it will not abandon a
note friend so the next Note will have
to be something amazing to shake the
stink off the note name I can't wait to
see what Samsung has in store number 2
is the Apple iPhone 8 2017 is the
10-year anniversary of the Apple iPhone
with the last three iPhones being very
similar to each other the 2017 edition
is expected to be a major departure
rumors say Apple is testing ten
different prototypes and the next iPhone
could have an edge to edge display kind
of like that insane xiaomi phone an
honorable mention goes to the LG w 7
series this is that ridiculously thin
OLED TV we saw at CES 2017 the 65 inch
model is 2.57 millimeters thick and
weighs only 18 pounds LG says to expect
this TV in march and get this it's
available for pre-order right now for
only $8,000 and the number one most
anticipated gadget of 2017 is the
Samsung Galaxy s8 samsung's phones have
left past Apple in the past few years
also there's no doubt samsung has heard
about those Apple rumors too the Galaxy
s8 should arrive before the note 8 so
Samsung will have to
damage control using the s8 the rumor is
there would be two versions of the s8
like the s7 but both s8 models would
have curved screens shouldn't Microsoft
souped-up Xbox project Scorpio been on
this list I don't know it's coming out
this year let me know i'm matt is on
Twitter and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
