welcome to tomorrow daily the best feet
talks over university and i'm jeff
kannada and guess what what dream time
is available our good friend sim sims ii
yeah i ivan since he was on our show
what last week two weeks ago two weeks
ago i think two weeks this Thursday
Thursday you can check out dream time
you literally can use a Google cardboard
you can use oculus VR anyone any PR I
just go to WJ Sims calm you can check
that out it went live today we had wings
yeah let's do it uh you know autonomous
vehicles aren't just the future of how
I'm gonna get around it might also be
the future of Motorsports Robo race is a
concept race series from Daniel Simon a
designer who has experience with
futuristic vehicles he worked on Tron
Legacy and used to be senior designer at
Bugatti Robo car is the concept vehicle
Simon created and it takes advantage of
being a driverless car in its design
races without drivers can help push
forward human controlled racecar
technology which we're guessing is the
point of Robo race but this concept is
still render for now Robo race plans to
host a series of events starting later
this year I kind of feel like if there's
no driver in the car they can push these
things to the limit right cuz safety
kind of goes out the window yeah and you
can make them super aerodynamic which is
exactly what this is I mean this concept
is so cool-looking I think humans being
inside so make it as fast as possible
it's not dangerous for people so I'm
super into that I love it alright guys
if you have ever wanted to spend a night
on the International Space Station
someday it might come true but we're
starting now this week with an
expandable module heading up there
SpaceX's CRS eight mission will lift off
this Friday to supply the ISS and if
everything goes to plan the Bigelow
expandable Activity module or beam will
be delivered with the rest of the cargo
beam is designed to test the viability
of expandable modules which would mean
living and work quarters for astronauts
that are much less expensive to launch
it's a two-year experiment and beam
won't actually be occupied most of that
time but if it is successful it would be
a really big deal for long-term space
exploration how expandable are we
talking here we talking vaulted ceilings
and a fireplace
I'm stock california queen beds no these
are very small workspaces i believe i
want to say it was like 5 maybe 5 feet
by 7 feet this space station master
suite
it's not huge this is like a capsule
it's a little expandable capsule think
of it as a small room i believe i got i
you can watch on the video there's a
good kind of idea of size but the really
cool thing is is it is a little bit more
meteor absorbent which which is great or
absorbing here right meteorite absorbent
and because the space station is hard so
it's really cool and I'm really excited
about the idea of it getting up there
and having I'm testing out the room I
live in now is not meteor absorbent no
so hopefully that doesn't happen hey
what are these stories do you think we
should talk about long-form for Thursday
I feel like we have to talk about we
have talked about beam yeah talk about
space I you know space is one of our
favorite topics so yeah let's let's
figure out if we can live there long
term if we can live truly actually live
the dream of living in space or at least
spending a night there where's the A or
B and BS exactly and you can participate
in that conversation we'd love to hear
if you think you can hang out in beam
long term that's right all you gotta do
is use our hashtag on Twitter and that
is hey TD yeah use hey TV tell us how
much you'd pay for a night in a beat in
the beam expandable module maybe use air
B&amp;amp;B m-- air B&amp;amp;B or my cat I love it
alright guys it's time for our photogra
for the day
we're continuing our theme of landmarks
points of interest monuments those types
of things this month in April with

the show and of course you have my
permission to use this photo Nathan did
all the right things he sent in a
picture of a landmark slash point of
interest yeah he gave us permission told
us what device he took it on and then
emailed it tomorrow at cnet.com and he
also gave us a cool little story about
it

tour in Chicago and I was there last
year it's fascinating
yeah really really cool stuff I had no
idea what's a beautiful city a beautiful
skyline but taking that tour and hearing
about all the history of all the
buildings it's I can't recommend it
