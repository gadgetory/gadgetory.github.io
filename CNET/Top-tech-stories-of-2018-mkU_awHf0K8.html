it is time to look back on the years
biggest tech stories and how events of
this year will shape our future in 2019
there's probably no bigger story this
year than the mess that is Facebook
month after month reports highlighted
the social networks mistakes with
leadership making poor decisions and
failing users trust the biggest blunder
was the data breach tied to Cambridge
analytic oh the political consulting
firm exploited loopholes and used shady
methods to collect personal data on 87
million Facebook users and that info was
harvested to make targeted ads that
would influence Trump's presidential
campaign in the 2016 election and
influence brexit in the UK we will enter
the New Year questioning Facebook's
influence in our lives and question our
trust in the communication tool or if
the tool needs to be treated more like a
utility with the government regulation
with all Facebook's mistakes we even saw
Apple CEO Tim Cook speak out against
Facebook calling for more government
regulation and speaking of government
oversight this year marked the start of
the general data protection regulation
in the European Union or gdpr for short
at its core GD P R is a new set of rules
designed to give you citizens more
control of their personal data privacy
and consent to what happens to their
data and if there is a data breach Mulla
company needs to promptly tell users or
else face large fines as a penalty but
GE PR didn't just make a difference for
folks in the EU many large online
companies that do business in the EU are
applying some of these transparency
standards to all their customers
regardless of location just a month
after the law was enacted reports of
data breaches increased dramatically
2018 was also a big year for massive
corporate mergers that will change her
tech and media landscape 18:1 its case
against the Justice Department to
finalize its 85 billion dollar
acquisition of Time Warner and Time
Warner owns HBO CNN and other Turner
networks so get ready for your ATT
service to push more Khan
from time warner programming Disney is
buying up the rights to own 20th Century
Fox film and TV studios along with some
cable channels like FX all for seventy
one point three billion dollars
it means Disney is the majority owner
now of Hulu streaming service you know
right as Disney is also about to launch
its own streaming service shareholders
approved the acquisition this past
summer the deal is expected to be
completed the 1st of January and that
means we are going to have to see how
Fox's franchises like the x-men and The
Simpsons fit into the Disney family and
after four years of trying to hook up
t-mobile and Sprint may finally get
together with a twenty six billion
dollar deal arguing that together they
could be stronger to invest in a 5g
network but it's not a done deal just
yet although it receives shareholder
approval the merger is currently on hold
with the Federal Communications
Commission as it needed more time to
examine the transaction that's not the
only thing changing in the mobile world
Apple is changing our phones by leading
the trend of the knotch
you know the dart cut out in the top of
the screen that holds the front-facing
camera speaker and other sensors now of
course the first phone with a notch in
an edge-to-edge screen was from a lesser
know start-up called essential founded
by the former head of Android but apples
the iPhone 10 was the first mainstream
phone with a notch and many folks poked
fun at it but this was just the start of
a new movement this year in cell phone
design the newest members of the knotch
Club include the LG G 7 the Xiaomi me
eight Asus zenfone 5 and the Google
pixel three XL get ready for more notch
action in 2019 but one technological
achievement may change our lives more
than we realize in the near future I'm
talking about Google duplex a human
sounding artificial intelligence system
that can talk to people over the phone
to do scheduling tasks for you like
booking restaurant reservations and
making hair appointments on your behalf
in a demo during the Google i/o
conference in May Google showed how
duplex was so smooth and natural
sounding filled with little quirks of
conversation like comes and a hose and I
gotcha
that a human Nina no they're talking to
a robot the wow factor became a creep
factor and to answer concerns Google
said going forward the system would
include a disclosure maybe introducing
itself as a Google assistant Google is
currently testing the tech in the
limited area but in 2019
you'll need to start questioning if the
caller on the other line is a real human
or a robot thanks for watching if you
think I missed something on the list let
me know in the comments until next time
I'm Bridget Carey and I'll see you next
