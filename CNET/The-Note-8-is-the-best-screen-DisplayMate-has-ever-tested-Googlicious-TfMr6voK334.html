by display mate reveals the note 8 has
reached record-breaking brightness
levels for a phone screen that's 22%
brighter than the s8 now for comparison
the note 8's maximum brightness level is
1200 nits
the galaxy s 8 makes out at just over
1000 nits and the current iPhone 7
registers in at a weak-ass 625 nits now
this is especially huge when you're
using it in sunlight unless you're in
Seattle or San Francisco where this
won't matter tear now Samsung's phones
have been all about the screen and it's
no different here with the node 8
certified for HDR and it also has the
full 100% DCI p3 color gamut seen in 4k
TV sets we haven't seen enough people
take the camera out for a real-world
test yet I love being able to take notes
directly on the screen at any time which
was part of the note 7 like I would
actually do that but this is a phone no
fans should be really happy about maybe
not it's 950 dollar price point give or
take in the US but that's the new price
point some of these flagship phones are
hovering around now and we got to get
used to it
and if you're happy about dual cameras
coming to the note line Keiji eyes Ming
cheek well reports Samsung will
integrate dual cameras similar to what's
found on the note 8 on to the next
Galaxy s 9 but there's more coming from
the Korean giant and they've teased that
we'd see new announcements at Aoife in
Berlin this week in an interview with
CNBC Samsung confirmed they will be
announcing a new gear s SmartWatch next
week the gear s3 was a solid and
great-looking one so we'll see what they
do next we've seen rumors that we're
also expecting to see a gear fit to pro
as well from Evan Blass plus we might
also see a gear 360 camera after was
revealed Samsung filed an application
for a new product referred to as the 360
round that's capable of capturing 360
photos and video ok enough about Samsung
what about the Google's new big thing
the next pixel phone
Evan blast says the new pixel 2 and
pixel XL 2 will be unveiled on October
the fifth and feature the all-new
snapdragon 836 cpu now the original was
the surprise phone of last year when it
swooped in with the Google assistant and
the best camera on a phone at that time
we've seen potential renders of the new
pixel Android Oreo is now out and it's
all coming together but there's no
official word from Google
just yet and get this Google glass is
still alive and well with this
enterprise edition the hardware will
continue to work on Android and iOS
after its companion app was recently
updated for 64-bit support after noting
for nearly three years okay on to LG the
unveiling of the new V 30 will be
happening this Thursday at Aoife it's
been anything but a secret which is
normal these days after a hands-on photo
that just leaked online features its
minimal bezels now LG is reportedly
going to use a P OLED panel that stands
for a plastic cover over the glass panel
which will allow the screen to have more
naturally curved edges that feel better
in hand we've talked about its f16
aperture the first ever and a phone LG
will also be using a 32-bit advanced
hi-fi quad digital audio converter to
cut down on sound distortion and you'll
also be able to use its audio receiver
as a microphone to capture loud sounds
without distortion so we'll get the
lowdown on this in just a few days at
Eva and finally Fitbit has released its
first SmartWatch called the ionic with
the promise of all its stellar finish
tracking and SmartWatch features
combined it has a pedometer built-in GPS
it's water-resistant with a heart rate
sensor and sleep tracking these are the
key things you expect but the fit pick
ionic will also have access to Fitbit
app store and will allow notifications
from things like Facebook Twitter and
Gmail but the surprise here
Fitbit pay with its NFC chip that let
you pay at stores that accept Android
pay and Samsung pay it's pretty sweet so
with the promise of battery lasting four
days or more and a starting price of
$2.99 as a fan of Fitbit stuff this
could really be a sleeper hit for the
holiday season and guess what Fitbit
really needs it alright that's it for
this week you can email me at Google
it's just at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for some
more of that Google issues
