rule them all I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your scene that updates when it's
time to buy a new computer there's a
question many struggle with do you buy a
tablet or a laptop tablets are light and
portable but laptops are just better for
getting real work done
well Microsoft says it has improved the
surface pro tablet so that this version
is actually worthy of replacing your
laptop the new model is called the
surface pro 3 much has changed with this
fully loaded Windows 8.1 tablet it's
larger with a 12 inch screen but it's
also thinner and lighter than before
but there are three improvements that
really matter there's the kickstand the
keyboard and the stylus pen the
kickstands more flexible it can bend
back to 150 degrees the pro type
keyboard cover snaps in place with more
magnetic support so it holds sturdy in
different positions and the trackpad is
larger with less friction the kickstand
and keyboard may actually make it
comfortable for you to use this on your
lap because it's so adjustable but
Microsoft is also pitching this as a
worthy replacement for paper and pen
it's hard to be paper and pen it's so
quick to use there's no fussing with
opening apps it works right away and it
feels nice well with the new surface
there's also no app to open when you
click the pen it unlocks the tablet to
write notes immediately a demo showed
off the fine details of the Pens digital
ink and the size of the screen is
similar to a spiral notebook Microsoft
will need to push these productivity
perks to help struggling surface sales
and maybe with this third version they
got something right keep checking in
with CNN as we test it out for our
review the surface pro 3 opens up for
pre-orders on Wednesday and the price
starts at $800 but if you want the
better core i7 processor that'll cost
one thousand five hundred and fifty
dollars and that does not include the
keyboard cover that'll cost another 130
dollars so Microsoft wants to fix the
tablet but Google's latest product hopes
to fix your photos specifically it
is the hassle of organizing a ton of
photos when you get back from a vacation
to share online the new Google+ stories
will automatically sort through your
photos and places you visited and weave
them into an interactive photo album you
just have to use the Google Plus app to
backup all your photos it tries to pick
the best ones by ignoring duplicates or
anything blurry but you can edit the
photos yourself before sharing it'll
roll out to Android and the web this
week with iOS coming soon that's your
tech news update you can find more on
these stories at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
