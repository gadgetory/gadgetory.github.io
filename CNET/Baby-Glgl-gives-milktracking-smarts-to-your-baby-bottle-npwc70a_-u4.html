CES 2015 with a smart baby bottle well
really it's a holder for any baby bottle
to make that bottle smart it's from a
company called slow control and what it
does is once you pop a bottle in its
able to sense how much liquid you're
giving your baby that's kind of
measuring the weight of the liquid and
it knows if you're feeding the baby air
or if actual liquid is going through
there's a little light that comes on
it's red if you're not holding it right
and perhaps air is getting in but it'll
turn green if you have it set right it
also sends that data to an app so you
can see exactly how often you're feeding
and how much you're feeding your baby
you don't have to recharge it it just
takes typical triple-a batteries this is
a prototype they're trying to shop it
around to see if they can get in a
couple stores and working with a couple
different bottle manufacturers but they
expect it to be about a hundred dollars
if it comes out later this year maybe in
June for CNN I'm Bridget Carey with your
first look at the smart baby bottle
sensor from slow control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
