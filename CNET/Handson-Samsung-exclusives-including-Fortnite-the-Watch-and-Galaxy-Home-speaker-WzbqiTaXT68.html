also got a new watch the Samsung Galaxy
watch with an unspecified price and
release date is here at Samsung's
unpacked event now if you've been
following Samsung watches there was a
gear sport last year and before that
other gear watches but there's a name
change now and the Samsung Galaxy watch
comes in two different sizes 42 and 46
millimeters this I'm wearing the 42
right now and it comes in black it comes
in silver and it comes in gold the 46
comes in black and silver now it has
kind of the similar dimensions on the
front to the gear sport it has water
resistance for swimming it also has the
ability to play music it has LTE if you
want it for a standalone connection and
the battery life is supposed to be
improved up to several days on a charge
through a combination of better battery
and a more optimized processor Samsung
is already partnering with Spotify and
in fact on this watch and it's also on
the Samsung Galaxy home speaker and the
idea is to integrate that through the
phone and have it all work seamlessly
there's also a few new health features
on here there are 39 different exercise
modes and there's also six different
auto detect exercises and there's also a
stress mode which might be good for me
right now that is able to measure my
heart rate in general stress level and
if there's a lot of situations going on
which there probably is it then
recommends that I start breathing also
like before their sleep tracking now
that's not a new feature Samsung's done
sleep tracking before but Apple watch
doesn't have sleep tracking and Google's
wear OS does not have sleep tracking yet
as a built-in feature so that's a stand
out here Samsung's bixby which is also
continually being positioned as an
all-in-one assistant across multiple
devices will be the go-to assistant on
Samsung Galaxy watch as always there's a
rotating bezel on top this has been
Samsung's most unique quality on its
watches and the watch has a nice clean
design were easily replaceable watch
straps it feels a bit thicker Samsung's
newest Galaxy watch arrives August 24
just before Google and app
are expected to reveal new watches of
the round it costs $330 for the 42
millimeter version and 350 for the 46
millimeter but that's just bluetooth LTE
versions would be sold at a later date
for an unspecified price smart speaker
space is getting pretty crowded Samsung
is entering it with the Samsung Galaxy
home this device doesn't have a release
date or a price but it was shown here at
Samsung's event in Brooklyn it looks a
little bit larger than the home pod and
almost kind of looks like a barbecue
kettledrum it's made along with EKG and
it has Samsung's bixby assistant onboard
for listening and connecting to the rest
of your home it has six speakers and
eight microphones it's meant to also be
able to follow you around the room and
direct audio it has Dolby Atmos and it's
going to be competing against Apple home
pod Google's smart speakers everything
from Alexa and Google home and just this
growing field of speakers Samsung's will
also have Spotify which is a partner
service that also works of course on the
note 9 but also on Samsung Galaxy watch
we're gonna have more on this to come
really all you can see here was a demo
of the units and seeing them all lined
up in a row it's four night four nights
hitting Android an open beta in just a
matter of days but if you were a Samsung
device owner you could download
fortnight now and begin playing it and
here it is on the samsung galaxy note 9
if you're curious
I'm sky diving and by the way I'm
absolutely terrible at fortnight but a
lot of other people might be better than
me it's been available on iOS for a
while Android owners are going to get
their hands on it and if you happen to
get a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or a tab for
you can also get a skin for fortnight if
you're into that the screen actually is
it's nice to play on a large screen and
crash into a tree I think some people
have actually been downloading fortnight
here even though they weren't originally
on the
nine phones so we found a unit that has
foreign aid on it and we're giving it a
play seriously the 6.4 inches this it's
much better to play on mobile I would
say on a screen that is basically about
the same size as a Nintendo switch it
goes without saying it's gonna hit
Android for everyone so for tonight is
not a reason to get a Samsung device but
it is available a few days earlier if
you're curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
