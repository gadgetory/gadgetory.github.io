this is the first time you've ever seen
the p8 Lite I'm tossing adult court for
CNET and this is a brand new phone being
announced for the US market Huawei says
it's built on a premium design ideal and
it does look pretty good it's slim it's
got straight sides it's got a white oak
with a little bit of texturing and a
gold rim around the sides I think it
looks nice it has a 5-inch 720p HD
display with a 13 megapixel camera on
the back and a 5 megapixel camera on the
front there is LED flash there are all
the capture modes like panorama and HDR
but there's also something called all
Focus which is kind of like shoot now
and pick the focus later there's also a
shortcut to launch the camera even when
the screen is locked by double-clicking
the bottom volume rocker button inside
there's a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon 615
processor that is octa-core the phone
supports LTE got a dual SIM option or a
single sim option with LTE on both you
can use one of those slots for a microSD
card up to 32 gigabytes if you're not
using it for the second sense now this
is a GSM phone so it will work with
carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile in the
US the phone costs $250 unlocked but
Huawei is giving you an option to split
that into three months six months or 12
months payment installments now you can
buy it directly from Huawei get Huawei
calm or at Amazon starting June 3rd
followed later by Best Buy and Fries but
right now it is not being announced for
the carrier this is something
interesting Huawei is going to sweeten
the deal and quell all of your fears by
offering a two-year warranty policy in
the US plus local repair with free
shipping both ways and a us-based call
center that you can call directly from
the phone this is an interesting
approach that Huawei is taking and one
that it hopes will sell more phones
through its direct channel and also
through partner distributors you can
