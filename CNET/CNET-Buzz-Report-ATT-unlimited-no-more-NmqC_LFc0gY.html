buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's be killing cell phones AT&amp;amp;T
changing its data plans and the new
iphone is coming hooray but first it's
the other gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the kodak playsport it's
one of those mini HD camcorders that
everyone so hot on so it's totally
portable and it shoots video up to 1080p
resolution good price to about the
standard 150 bucks but here's the thing
this one takes video underwater up to 10
feet I know perfect for snorkeling and
swimming plus just think of all the high
quality shark attack videos that are
going to start showing up on you too
and now for the news the big news is
coming Monday as Apple's Worldwide
Developer Conference kicks off with a
steve jobs keynote we're expecting to
find out whether the lost prototype of
2010 is actually the new iPhone and
there's some talk of a new Apple TV box
and hopefully a subscription music
service to replace the brutally murdered
la la but Steve is not waiting till
Monday to do some talking he got unsaved
at the All Things D conference to talk
to Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher jobs
answered questions on topics ranging
from satirical cartoons to flash on the
iPad and iPhone to the future of PCs and
even movies and he had these words of
reassurance for frustrated 18t customers
I am told that a lot of places are
getting a lot better you know certainly
by the end of this summer and I believe
the people that are telling me that
truly believe it and our high competency
people and if they don't then they won't
and that's that I guess speaking of AT&amp;amp;T
though may be part of their network
improvement plan is to just like keep
people from using the network very much
18t got rid of its unlimited data plans
this week even the one on the iPad now
there are two plans fifteen dollars a
month for two hundred megabytes of data
and twenty-five dollars for two
gigabytes of data and then they charge
you if you go over now almost no one
goes over to gigs so it's not as bad as
it sounds and if you already have a
thirty dollar unlimited data plan you
get to keep it and you have until june
seven to sign up for that plan if you
want to be grandfathered in that's right
june seventh WWDC day so clearly
something about that new iphone must be
a data hug like tethering yep you can
now do tethering with your AT&amp;amp;T devices
even the iPhone but only for an extra
twenty dollar a month fee and that fee
does not include any more data than the
2gig max so that is paying for the
privilege of not buying a crippled phone
and that is bullcrap the rest I'm
actually
okay with no shocker right moving on the
Financial Times ran a story this week
about how Google doesn't want employees
using Windows possibly because of
security concerns seems plausible right
although wow do you think they would ban
office too because I mean how could a
multi gazillion dollar company run on
google docs no they will never take over
the world using Google Docs anyway
Microsoft fought back with a blog post
about how windows security is not only
way better but OS 10 security is not
good at all and Microsoft's corporate
vice president of corporate
communications which is his real title
said that maybe the ban might have a
teensy little bit to do with Google
developing its own OS to compete with
Windows and then he tore into the
financial times on Twitter
which actually just as a little aside
Microsoft has been all about twitter
lately the corporate account debunked
rumors that Steve Ballmer might be at
WWDC with this tweet
see and I noticed that Microsoft is kind
of funny and cool on Twitter so maybe
they could try that in like the
commercials and the real world and stuff
just a thought how great it is to host a
lunch party you can use house burning
tools to build your guest list upload
your pictures which is his face right in
other headlines in the tech world
researchers in India say radiation from
cell phones may be killing bees which is
weird because I didn't even know bees
had cell phones okay I'm just kidding in
a controlled experiment the researchers
found that hives exposed to 900
megahertz gsm phones eventually showed a
reduction in population and the
radiation possibly confused the bees
navigation abilities bee colonies that
we're exposed to dummy phones showed no
ill effects now obviously more studies
are necessary Before we jump to
conclusions but when you read the report
it helps to just try not to think about
your brain very much and that's the bus
report for this week everyone I'm
Mollywood and thank you for watching
things in general when they start to fix
them get worse before they get better
that's what I'm told and if you believe
that things should be getting a lot
better soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
