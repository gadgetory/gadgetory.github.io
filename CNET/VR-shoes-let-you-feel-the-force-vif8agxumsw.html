I'm squelch against the mud and a puddle
this is the most ridiculous thing you'll
see all day actually wait it's supposed
to be these VR shoes
they're called tack limb and while
they're a prototype these are going to
be available as a full product coming
autumn 2017 so what they are are VR
shoes and gloves that give you haptic
feedback they run off a unity plug-in
that lets developers create content
freely so it's open source and all the
vibration data is made available the
shoes have eight tactile motors inside
to simulate a bunch of different fields
like grass water and desert were some of
the examples that I tried the gloves
have a nine axis sensor inside and can
capture movement and translate that to a
haptic output the shoes have around two
hours of battery life in them but what
does it actually feel like to use VR
shoes I tried them with the demo game
that they had available and went through
a couple of the simulations and while
many of the surfaces didn't feel like
they would in real life I have to say
the water one felt pretty accurate it
did feel like I was splashing around in
a puddle of mud it was a lot of fun and
these are still living prototypes so I
can't wait to see what developers do
with them when they come out to final
release and they're a full product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
