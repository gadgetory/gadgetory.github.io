CES 2013 this is LG's a little mini
booth right after their press conference
and right next to me is a exciting TV
that we didn't hear about before the
press conference this is a 65 inch ultra
high-definition 4k television LG is one
of the only companies shipping a 4k TV
right now that's 84 inches but this is
the first we've heard of a smaller
screen size this is a 65 inch there's
also going to be a 55 inch model of this
television so they're going to be
shipping in the summer time frame a
little bit later in the year I've been
told that this TVs still a little bit
preliminary so I don't have a model
number yet but the set will have the
same specs as the 84 inch including that
4k Ultra High Definition resolution
which is four times the pixel count of a
standard 1080p television of course the
real problem right now is that there's
no 4k content LG did briefly mention
that they might do something about that
we don't have any real details right now
you're gonna be watching mainly 1080p on
this TV and that means you won't see
much of a difference in fact even if you
do have 4k on this TV at this relatively
small screen size
Mette have a hard time telling the
difference so we're really waiting to
see what this thing looks like when we
get into the lab and be able to compare
it to today's 1080p TVs at the screen
size other specs include an edge lit
backlight with local dimming the set
also has LG's passive 3d so pretty much
all the bells and whistles you'd expect
including Smart TV from a 2013 LG that's
a quick look at LG's smaller 4k UHD TVs
this is a 65 inch here I'm David Katz
mark from CES 2013
