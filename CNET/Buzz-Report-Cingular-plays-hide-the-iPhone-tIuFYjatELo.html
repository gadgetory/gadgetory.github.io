Hollywood welcome to the buzz report
first the gadget of the week
it's the t-mobile wing sort of a
sidekick for grown-ups
it runs Windows Mobile 6 has a 2
megapixel camera Bluetooth Wi-Fi QWERTY
keyboard about all we don't like about
it is that it's kind of bulky and our
review says it doesn't have 3G data
t-mobile doesn't have 3G in 2007 it had
to be a typo so of course I got on the
horn to Kent German no it's correct
no 3G yet on t-mobile they're apparently
still cutting their food with stone
implements and attacking their
competitors with a bone but even if the
wing is a little chunky look at the
bright side you won't be because you'll
be running around from coffee shop to
coffee shop looking for a hot spot all
the time now the news a new survey from
Accenture came out this week says 75% of
high tech CEOs believe their companies
provide you with customer support that
is above average that's a very efficient
survey I'd say because it simultaneously
proved that 75% of high-tech CEOs are
high and the website The Inquirer rolled
out its list of top 10 greatest ever
technology names recently I enjoyed
reading it this week they conjured up
the IBM butterfly laptop with its novel
keyboard son a short powerful memorable
name and how from the movie 2001 with
each letter alphabetically adjacent to
IBM so you know what it's time for my
top 5 technology names that aren't near
as elegant as those shortened to a top 3
to avoid a skirmish with Tom Barrett's
trademark lawyers number three is
gateway 2000 a PC company from farm
country with a Holstein cow logo that
wasn't founded in the year 2000 so where
did they get gateway or 2000
number two buffalo technology Buffalo
that makes no sense oh wait I've got it
look at their Taiwan website there it is
it's an animation of two hands offering
up a great big steaming pile of Buffalo
oh that can't be it and the number one
wacky name in technology almost anything
open-source like Firefox what the hell
is a Firefox or GIMP nice name
or lame which stands for lame ain't an
mp3 encoder except that it is and after
about five months of monster publicity
telling consumers the hot new iPhone
will only be available on singular
singulars new parent AT&amp;amp;T is now rushing
to change the names singular to AT&amp;amp;T
just in time for the iPhone to launch
huh ah I get it
it's summertime an AT&amp;amp;T wants to take us
all on a ride through the high-tech
marketing funhouse we'll watch them
stumble through store naming musical
chairs then it'll be a wacky game of
hide from the revenue finally the old
favorite playing Marco Polo with those
iPhone shoppers before everyone gets a
box of Cracker Jack and a ride home on
the bus one damn long ride I'm Brian
Cooley this has been the buzz report
thanks for watching
