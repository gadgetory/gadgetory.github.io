yet unless you're one of those shameless
tourists that casually whips one out for
a quick snapshot however with a high-end
3d camera in tow on this bad boy dell is
looking to change that i'm Xiomara
Blanca for CNET here in San Francisco
checking out the Dell Venue 8 7000 this
8.4 inch tablet features a sharp 2560 by
1600 pixel resolution oh LED display HD
images on the screen look impressively
vibrant with deep contrast levels and a
rich range of colors the display is
framed by a pair of chic thin bezels
that complement it's super slim frame at
only six millimeters thick it matches
the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 8.4 as one of
the thinnest slates available the no
frills design includes a power button
volume rocker and microUSB port with the
stereo speakers on the thick bottom
bezel next to the front facing camera on
the inside the Android 4.4 tablet houses
a zippy quad-core Intel Atom processor
16 gigabytes of internal storage and 2
gigabytes of RAM during my time with the
tablet it performed fast and smooth on
taking photos editing them and quickly
switching from one app to another it
easily fits in one hand is comfortable
to hold and the aluminum bat gives it a
sturdy high-end feel that is more
comparable to the Apple iPad Mini than
the Samsung Galaxy Tab s however because
it's wrapped in aluminum it weighs more
than the plastic body of the Tab s the
Dell Venue 8 7000 is a unique addition
to the saturated tablet scene in that it
packs a 3d camera after you've taken a
photo with the depth capturing rear dual
cameras you can adjust the focal point
and depth of field of the photo as well
as how the layers and the photos are
colored all by using the built-in
software in addition photos taken with
the light-filled camera can be used to
measure objects captured within the
photograph The Venue 8 7000 is a sleek
high-end addition to Dells line of
tablets and it boldly pushes the
boundaries of mobile photography for a
more in-depth look check out my hands
on cnet.com once again i'm Xiomara
blanco and this is the Dell Venue 8 7000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
