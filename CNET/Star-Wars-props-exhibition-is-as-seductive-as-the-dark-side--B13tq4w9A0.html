Star Wars identity's exhibition in
London packed full of original props
costumes models and early artwork from
the collection of George Lucas himself
talk us through it
we met with Leila French from the
Lucasfilm Archive the items for this
exhibit were really chosen based on
first that we were going to tell the
story of human identity or the science
of human identity and once the
scientific committee that we worked with
kind of out laid that framework and then
we overlaid it with the Star Wars story
of Anakin and Luke it kind of
immediately just made it obvious what
objects we had to have also I always
want to include all the main characters
because that there's an expectation when
you come to a Star Wars X question we
want to hit all the right notes for the
superfans they have expectations and we
want to meet them and actually I want to
surprise and exceed them with things
they don't know about for the casual fan
or those that haven't seen Star Wars we
need to give them sort of the Star Wars
101 introduction and then that we get
down into the more deeper content we can
add in some unusual pieces and that's
where it gets fun in the original films
you know you have to remember 1977
people didn't save everything from a
film that they made you know they made
the movie everything went away or was
returned back to the costume department
or was borrowed so for George to save
even the models that he did was unusual
and he had the foresight because he's
very innovative to know that if he knew
that if a new hope was gonna be a
success he'd have two more films to make
and he didn't want to have to Reese make
certain ships from scratch so he kind of
was saved everything hoping it was a
success which it was and then he got to
reuse those same ships and make more
ships for the new films and then he
saved some costumes and things like that
so for that time period what he saved
was quite a lot the main collections at
the archives at Skywalker Ranch which is
where George who you know helped make
his new movies episodes one two and
three but it's a very large collection
probably one of the most complete film
collections that exists today is because
George had the foresight to save quite a
bit from the early
films and we saved almost everything we
could from the new films so for the fans
that collect there certainly is Holy
Grail items I know that if they got in
my archive they would probably faint
quite a few of the items are very sturdy
the models in the ship case you know
they actually held up beautifully over
the last 40 years they every now and
then the tiny bit will fall off and we
can restore it the costume fabrics are a
little more fragile so we have to be
careful about lighting and we use museum
quality conservation and museum
standards for exhibition surprisingly
from the new films episode 2 there was a
scene set on you too pal where are these
beautiful set designs these little
miniature model buildings and they were
gorgeous and we tried to tour them and
they immediately just crumbled they were
not built to tour in the same way that
some of the stuff from like a new hope
vampire was so sadly they were sitting
at the archive and the death star is at
the archive I'm too fragile to tour so
there's a few things that we know that
we can't really just ship
you
