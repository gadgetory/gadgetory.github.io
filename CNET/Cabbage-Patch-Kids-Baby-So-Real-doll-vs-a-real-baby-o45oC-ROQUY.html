another one of those high-tech toys okay
Cabbage Patch baby so real interactive
baby lifelike just like a real baby
we'll see about that
how can a high-tech baby compared to a
real baby to find out I put it to the
test at our CNET labs let's start with
those eyes it's the main attraction to
the Cabbage Patch Kids baby so real doll
priced at nearly $100 the LCD screens
animate expressions indicating if the
baby is sad laughing surprised or happy
glowing eyes mean you'll never lose your
baby in the dark to compare my real baby
adds more expressions the more you play
with her I can expect software updates
for the rest of my life no need to
decipher baby cries the doll tells you
exactly what it wants with cutesy
phrases you're in fact she will stop
talking asking for diaper changes
bottles burps and tickle she'll even do
it when she needs medicine with glowing
red cheeks my real baby cries out when
she needs something but at least she'll
give you a break in a smile when she's
feeling better the doll finds
nourishment in a special pink plastic
bottle which must be placed in just the
right spot in the mouth for the sensor
to activate feeding sounds my real baby
is a boss she can hold her own bottle
although the experience can be a little
messy diaper changes with the doll are
simple there's a sensor on the waistband
that knows when a diaper is removed and
put back on the doll but the doll lacks
that realistic diaper charm getting the
doll to sleep is simple rocket in your
arms or just leave it on a table and
walk away slowly until it starts to
snore the doll does have an off switch
in the back but real baby does not come
with an off button or removable
batteries for when you need a break if
you need some guidance on how to make
your doll happy you can open up her
smartphone app it connects to the doll
via bluetooth an animated version of
your doll tells you what the doll needs
real baby does not come with an app
or Bluetooth or any tooth for that
matter but of course when you add
technology to toys there's more room for
things to go wrong off-camera
I accidentally dropped the doll and
broke it the eyelids wouldn't open and
close anymore if it happens to you the
company said it will replace the doll
because the toy was designed to
withstand three-year-olds from our lab
tests we can conclude that we're
entering a new era for playtime I'm not
sure if stuffing a doll with sensors
necessarily makes for a better toy for
now I'll be keeping busy with my real
baby and maybe in a few years when she
asks me for her own robot baby I hope
it'll come with removable batteries for
