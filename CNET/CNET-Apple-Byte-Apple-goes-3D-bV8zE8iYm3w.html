welcome to a little show we call the
alpha byte for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple the 3d
revolution is happening too whether you
guys like it or not and Apple's making
sure they'll be a part of it now do you
really think Steve Jobs likes wearing
those silly glasses
well the Cupertino kids were recently
granted a patent for a method that
projects a 3d image without glasses an
image would be projected onto a
reflective surface then bounced into a
viewers left eye and right eye
separately creating the 3d effect it
could also sense the location of both
eyes of a viewer and multiple people
could watch from a variety of angles
redonkulous now could you imagine the
Apple byte in 3d come on we would get so
many more viewers now iOS 4.2 has been
out for a couple of weeks now and it's
been revealed by Nokia Siemens Networks
that the new OS supports technology to
reduce network congestion and improve
battery life at the same time it's
called Network controlled fast dormancy
technology and put your phone in an
intermediate state so it can wake up
more quickly conserve more battery and
reduces the number of signals needed to
start a data connection ncfd has to be
implemented on a network to take
advantage of it but this could really
help lighten the load on AT&amp;amp;T and also
make Verizon look really good if its
network sees little impact from the
iPhone when it arrives
now airplay has been a feature people
were drooling over an iOS 4.2 there's no
doubt its innovative but I find it slow
to display full movies and media content
like videos in Safari videos you
recorded with your iPhone camera or
media and third-party apps can't be
viewed from your device to your TV so it
makes for an inconsistent and half-baked
experience yesterday addressed the issue
to her MacRumors reader through what
else but Steve mail and he said yep hope
to add these features to airplay in 2011
now most of us aren't using paying
anymore but now there's a reason - for a
day Michael Jackson's do you
posthumously released track much too
soon as being streamed exclusively
to MJ's profile page even though the
service is still too little too late now
an iPad news or you can call this one a
rumor right now digit Times is reporting
that Taiwan sources are claiming that
larg on position is the sole supplier of
the lens modules for the next iPad
there's no word of how many megapixels
we'll see or if it will be a
front-facing rear-facing or both but
we're really close to having iPads
replacing cameras look good Tiger OS
Tiger get me Tiger yeah your MacBook
crash your said he says oh right there
or not now over the holiday break
patently Apple's website showcased
Apple's new iPad design patent that
confirms a landscape dock connection in
addition to the dock connector that's
currently there it opens up a whole new
ecosystem of accessories so it's a
strong bet that will see this in the
next gen iPad all right let's take a
breather and check out a few tricks you
might not know about that you can do
with your iphone hi I'm Sharon Vaknin
and I'm here to show you how to make the
most of your iPhone with some useful
shortcuts and tricks longtime and recent
parents of iPhones listen up I guarantee
you didn't know at least one of these
useful tips so you know your iPhone is
equipped with the very useful alarm
stopwatch and timer what you may not
know is that you can use that timer to
put your iPod in sleep mode open the
clock app select timer and adjust it to
the duration you'd like the music to
play before it shuts off then tap when
timer ends scroll to the top and select
sleep iPod click set start the timer and
play your music a lot of you iPhone
users are aware that you can zoom in on
an email photo or webpage by double
tapping with one finger
well this function isn't always
available especially within apps so go
to Settings General and select
accessibility click zoom and slide it to
on now you can zoom in anywhere by
double tapping with three fingers and
like every phone the iPhone is equipped
with a calculator for doing all the
simple calculations like adding and
subtracting but those of you who need
more advanced functions like finding the
square root of a number or using
exponents can turn to the built-in
scientific calculator just rotate your
phone to landscape mode and voila well
there you have it a few tips to help you
use your iPhone to its full potential
for cnet.com I'm Sharon Vaknin see you
next time
well hello thanks for the tip Sharon and
I will be looking forward to more of
them now on to the quick bytes guys a
recent report by change wave has found
that Apple continues to gain share in
the e-reader market while amazon's
kindle losses it the ipad jumped from a
16 percent share in august to a 32
percent share in November while the
Kindle dropped 15 percentage points from
62 to 47 in that same time the iPhone
has finally just edged out rims
blackberry 4 smartphone market share in
the US by just half a percent the
Nielsen Company study also found that
females leaned relatively strongly to
the iPhone / Android as their most
desired phone while men on the other
hand tend to prefer an Android phone
well what does that say about me hey we
need you in the studio right now well
but my eye and in one of the best
replications of Steve Jobs you'll ever
see em I see gadgets SJ figurines
immediately sold out of their first run
of 300 it features his smirk the black
mock turtleneck blue jeans and New
Balance shoes you can even write your
favorite sayings on speech bubble cards
but like all things it was just too good
to be true and the big a forced them to
stop selling the figurines citing
copyright infringement
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show Center emails to the Apple
buy the sitcom i'm brian tom thanks for
watching and we'll see you guys next
week for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
