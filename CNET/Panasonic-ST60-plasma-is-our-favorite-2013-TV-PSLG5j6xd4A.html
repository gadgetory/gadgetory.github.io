standing next to Panasonic's st 60
plasma this is a 55 inch version but
there's a bunch of different screen
sizes ranging from 50 up to 65 inches
this is my favorite TV for 2013 the
reason is because it provides excellent
picture quality for the money the
50-inch air starts to around $1000 of
course the largest are a lot more
expensive than that but compared to
competing LCD TVs the picture is gonna
be a lot better for that price the
excellent picture quality is do a lot to
the TVs very deep black levels when you
turn out the lights and watch a dark
movie it gets really nice and inky and
when you turn on the lights the screens
filter does a really good job of keeping
the image nice and bright with high
contrast all things considered it's one
of the best forms we've ever tested and
again the best value of the year another
reason why this TV is a little special
this year is because panasonic has
announced that it's not going to be
selling any more plasma tvs going
forward so this truly is the last of its
kind that in addition to its excellent
picture quality for the money makes the
SD 60 an even stronger buy during the
holiday season I like the understated
design of the ST 60 although it's not
quite as slick as some of the LCD TVs
out there its feature set is right up
there however including Smart TV 3d
compatibility and plenty of inputs I'm
David Katz Maya from CNET and that's a
quick look at why I like Panasonic's st
60 as my top picking TVs for 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
