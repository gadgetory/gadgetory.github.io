Bakalar from the 404 i'm joined today by
two very funny men jay chandrasekhar and
kevin heffernan you guys are from the
the new movie the Babymakers it's a very
funny film tell me a little bit about
the film and how you guys got involved
with the project the film's about a
couple trying to have a baby it's paul
schneider and olivia munn and you find
out that paul is shooting blanks and
then you find out that he used to have
good sperm back when he used to donate
to a sperm bank when he needed extra
money for his wife's ring and so he goes
back to that old sperm bank but they
only have one sample left they've
already sold it to another couple and so
he decides to put together a crack team
of his buddies his stage a sperm bank
heist a lot of people are comparing this
movie to oceans 11 with sperm right
which is a different sort of angle yeah
look at George Clooney yeah don't you
think I think so the Indian version I
like it yeah our characters are a little
more two-dimensional like his is a crazy
indian dude like they he plays like the
first indian mobster in the history of
American side okay who like used to
drive a cab what was the rack you'll
think Indians can only drive a cab and
fix your computer well I did drive a cab
and I can fix your computer but I can
also cut your throat that's pretty good
there yeah that was my one of my
favorite lines it's a great imitation of
that guy in the babymaker yeah you guys
are going to be in theaters this Friday
Vogeler did release and then it's also
at the same time going to be out on
iTunes and on-demand distribution as
well is this the first film you've
worked on where that's getting that sort
of treatment yeah super troopers and
beerfest in these movies we're not big
theatrical movies right people went to
the way we just saw them but it really
caught on home video this platform works
pretty well for us because if you want
to go on a date with your wife you can
go to the movie theater or if you want
to watch it with your buddies on the
couch in your living room if you want to
watch it your bathroom you want you
wherever you download it whatever you
want to do I watched the wire Breaking
Bad walking dead Downton Abbey all on
treadmill on a
I bet really people are experiencing it
how they want to I mean it's probably
going to be more fun in a theater sure
but you know smaller movies are going to
have to find a car a way to carve their
own way would you agree that you know
maybe some of the 3d stuff is more or
less an attempt for the big studios to
be like all right people are they have a
60-inch Plasma non why are they coming
up see yea yea theatre event t you know
they want to make it this sort of
spectacular experience I don't really
like one of those glasses and no they
make it darker see it's always dark
everyone who says to me oh don't worry
it's not like any more but it is what it
is you're not fooling anyone you're
lying to use its 3d I'm not going yeah
except for jackass 3 and 3d which is
amazing I didn't say God it was amazing
it's the best 3d movie ever even better
than ever I believe it jackass 3 and
better than avatar it's crazy crazy a
brilliant will you ever flirt or
entertain the idea of making a 3d film I
hope not ok that's good to hear we were
pitched in we were pitched for the
slammin salmon likes this company wanted
to talk about it and they're like it's
great you can be in the restaurant and
food can be flying through this thing
serious there and you're like wait a
minute we're making this low-budget
movie I feel like why not just film
about a restaurant right or sperm yeah
