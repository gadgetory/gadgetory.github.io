childhood has come crashing back into my
life but this isn't the same teddy
ruxpin I fell in love with 30 years ago
his mouth still moves but his brown
plastic eyes are now blue and animated
on LCD screens gone are the cassette
tapes now his stories are downloadable
on an app for 5 dollars a piece there
are no more printed picture books kids
now read along with every word synced to
an app the parents will need a fiddle a
bit with the bluetooth pairing his push
button pause cycle through stories a
button on his vest skips ahead sections
oh and about that vest
he looks hipper now and he's more
squishy but he still sounds the same he
has the original voice recordings just
slightly tweaked from the 1985 version
and hearing his songs after all these
years prop X so many memories rushing
back into my brain the tug of nostalgia
is strong but if they want to win over
today's young parents with nostalgia why
did they change so much about him to get
some answers I visited Kari Volpone the
designer of the new teddy for wicked
cool toys which bought the rights to
bring back the bear it took a little
over a year to make Teddy 2.0 and in
that time designers cycled through a
number of outfits snouts and fur we
looked at you know possibly having it
wear glasses
like it could have been a hipster teddy
it could've been a hipster teddy we
didn't go that way then yeah yeah you
could have been sort of a surfer teddy
in a t-shirt as well the company mission
was to make the old bear trendy for
today's iPad toting toddlers his new
price tag $100 all the old book art is
used for the app which of course does
not match with Teddy's new threads we've
had a lot of fans ask us why we changed
teddy at all why don't we go back to the
original design of Teddy Ruxpin and it
was sort of tried
in 1994 didn't really work at the time
we think that we needed to update the
technology and make him speak to a
modern kid who didn't have the
experience in 1985 there are more than
40 AI animations that pair with what he
says in the books giving him a
cartoonish personality it's not the
first time the company has tinkered with
screen eyes as revealed in this
prototype for last year's Cabbage Patch
Kids baby so real doll the Cabbage Patch
dolls eyes were pretty far back
protected by moving eyelids wind turned
off but teddy has no eyelids when he's
inactive and turns off his eyes become
empty nothings parents may find it a bit
creepy but she says kids don't see it
that way I think kids are so open to
things like that does your TV creeped
you out when it's turned off does your
iPad creep you out when it's turned off
the more I played with him the more the
eyes grew on me but this isn't really
about me or my memories of his clothes
not looking the same or his books not
being real books in the end the whole
reason to get him is to pass down
Teddy's adventures to your child and we
live that joy you had through their eyes
