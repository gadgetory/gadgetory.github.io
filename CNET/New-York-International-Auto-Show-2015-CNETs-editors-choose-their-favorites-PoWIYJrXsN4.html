new york international auto show i'm tim
stevens i am antuan goodwin and I'm
weighing cunningham and this is the
unscripted part of the show where we sit
around and kind of talk about what we
like on the show we didn't like about
the show and then we humming ha a little
bit and we pick our favorites and I
think you know not really any big trends
this show but the closest thing that we
could have I think would be the return
of the big long luxurious American
luxury sedan and it's about time yeah
sure it's our companies are getting will
swagger back the sales are up so that's
good cadillac i celebrating with the ct6
unveil what you said to go look at yeah
i've been waiting for that one for a
while this is their new big luxury sedan
you know in the past they haven't had
actually big luxury sedan for a little
while you know say that the Escalade was
sort of filling that gap for them but
they haven't had anything to compete
against the mercedes-benz s-class or
lexus LS those are the 2 i've been
really comparing this with so the CT 6
is a total totally new model meant to
compete in that class but interestingly
enough it doesn't come with a v8 which
is sort of been the you know you need a
v8 to compete in this class no they're
gonna try to get by with a v6 twin-turbo
though so 400 horsepower it is a
interesting move I mean the expectation
is that everyone's gonna go there at
some point some sort of forced induction
for sure Cadillac I guess being the
first to take the plunge with this
all-new car wouldn't be surprised we see
others going there too but it certainly
looks very nice looks like a you know
overgrown CTS I suppose a little bit
longer 4-wheel steering on it which is
an interesting take to give it a little
bit handling yeah there's a lot of
interesting and handling technology
things out there and I think they're
going really tech forward with this car
like an adaptive suspension so for a
comfortable ride but good handling they
still want to readily claim to that
sport area to which they haven't really
been that successful and then grabbing
at least not in the public reputation or
you know public perceptions got carbon
fiber on the dashboard I mean yeah
primordia in here but I you know I sat
in that car and it's actually a very
comfortable experience you know we
haven't actually driven it but certainly
you know the doors feel solid everything
feels good it's got that those luxury
materials inside and it's also has 34
speakers in the audio system that's what
I'm scared yeah does that Bose pan or a
system it's a new thing that they're
trying out I haven't had a chance to
hear it yet either but hope it will get
a chance to do all that when we go in
for review and then just not too far
away from that Lincoln unveiled the
continental concept which is something
of a no return to form from Lincoln
maybe it's very different styling design
we've seen in current Lincoln's doesn't
have that big chrome winged grill that
we've seen on a lot of their current
cars also doesn't have a name that
begins with M K which is interesting
long and low a lot of people say it's a
little bit derivative of Bentley perhaps
but I think it looks quite nice then the
big chrome grille certainly makes a
strong statement the big story though in
that car is actually in the rear seats
this is a car they're really designing
for the Chinese market more so than the
American one where rear seat luxury is a
premium so big reclining seats it's got
this kind of work bench that pivots out
even has leather loafers that come with
it again we're just talking about a
concept at this point so probably not
expected loafers to come with a
production model but Lincoln has
promised a new full-size sedan coming to
market sometime next year so probably
look something like that anyone you what
I think's interesting about that is you
know how concepts transition into
production cars Lincoln doesn't have
anything right now is sort of build that
town car gap beside an MKT and it's just
you know a really big you know crossover
and it doesn't really sort of fill that
that talent our role I'm thinking that
when we see this concept gets dumb down
to production we're going to see
something in that sort of area maybe one
of the biggest talking points the show
the new Civic yes definitely it's
interesting seeing the civic well for
starters it's that I Syrian green it
which does not photograph well I promise
you it's much louder here in person than
it is
definitely internet and I'm seeing some
sort of i'm seeing a lot of echoes in
honda that we saw in forward a couple of
years we saw like a decade ago ford had
to cope at focuses okay first time yeah
so they had the European focus they had
the North American focus the European
focus was everyone loved it North
American focus kind of mint so what for
did was they decided let's just bring
that one over here and this city looks a
whole lot like the European Civic and
after all of the hullabaloo and the
emergency refresh of the current
generation North American Civic kind of
looks like they're doing a similar thing
yeah ha to emphasize actually designed
this car in the US and they actually
this is what they do a lot what a lot of
Japanese makers years they emphasized
the cars we've built in the US it's
designed in the u.s. so there's a lot of
us DNA in this car but it is definitely
looks like the European model and I
think they realized they really needed
to upgrade the look because it got so
boring recently I guess have not been
impressed by civic slightly and the
company as a whole seems to be kind of a
little bit at sea they haven't really
had a very strong direction and maybe
this is a sign of a new direction for
them I sure hope it is because they
could certainly use it the engine for
this new Civic they've actually expect
that out that's pretty interesting it's
a 1.5 liter four-cylinder I believe
turbocharged direct injection so that
should be enough power to move this
thing around pretty well not only that
there's going to be an SI version which
is cool yeah there's also going to be a
type r version a lot of people who are
big civic fans in the 90s or maybe a
little bit older may be looking for a
little bit larger car which this year's
but still get its hatchback and type are
in the u.s. turbocharged should be
easily upgradable so maybe it's the
return of the civic for the custom car
scene 10th generation so they got to do
something big for it I think and I'm
thinking we'll see a production version
of that this fall and I think it will
probably look a lot like the concept
we've seen because so honda is tended to
release the concept and then release
production version pretty close on after
that looks just like the
so hopefully that comes out very similar
we should also quickly mention the
Malibu which I know is not probably the
most exciting car it's the entry-level
full-size sedan for Chevy it actually
looks really nice it's got a rear end
looks little bit like an a5 maybe from
an Audi and this somewhat controversial
teen driver mode where you've got a
special key and give to your kids it
will basically send statistics back to
the parents on how fast the teams were
driving how often they went full
throttle even things like how often they
use the lane departure warning seek an
idea for their another paying attention
but I think it's a nice step forward for
the Malibu which is you know something
that a car that we would normally talk
about I don't think yeah for sure and I
definitely like that they're using the
sort of Chevy Volt hybrid technology to
get the really good fuel economy that
they're claiming in that it's good to
feed them sort of spreading that out to
more models and actually taking
advantage of the rd they put into it a
surprise are taking this long but 45
miles per gallon out of the full-size
car like that is quite impressive we
should also talk about the nissan maxima
which is just sitting here to our right
300 horsepower three half liter v6 lost
80 pounds from the last generation I
think it looks pretty nice yeah it's
definitely a big style it pretty
actually a very bold style people call
out some of the things like Kia Optima
cues I think on the advanced line and
yeah mazda hurt too yeah so you know the
style could be considered derivative of
some things out there but it does look
good it's definitely what I think modern
full-size sedan should be but you
mentioned the 3.5 liter engine that
sounds like they're kind of retreading
some of the same drivetrain territory
they've been in for a long time
absolutely and a little bit of news
ahead of the show from the miata finally
got a price figure definitely got a
price figure on the miata and it's
interesting because it's about twenty
five thousand dollars which means that
it's more expensive than the BRZ and the
FRS which means that when you start to
consider these sort of value of those
vehicles versus the sort of prestige of
the Miata is actually looking to be a
more tight sort of competition than I
thought that we'd get a lot of people
were thinking that the the miata would
show up at about the same price and it
would just below those two cars out of
the water as far as a low-priced sports
car but the miata have actually got a
lot of standard content on it I think
he's pushing the price up maybe we'll
see a stripped-down version in a year
you that'll bring the price down a
little bit alright let's wrap things up
weighing favorite car the show whoo
that's a hard call I've seen a lot of
good cars I got to mention the McLaren
570 yes this is a new sports series cars
it's still kind of unattainable they're
still saying I probably close to two
hundred thousand dollars fast car I was
thinking they might release something a
little more attainable at the show but
now it's but it's five or six new
horsepower its carbon fibre tub aluminum
suspension components but they say this
is the kind of car you can actually
drive to work every day then take to the
track on the weekends and probably blow
away every m3 on the track I suppose
that's what money that's true twice as
much money it's a good one though so i
think i'm gonna go with that one cuz
it's definitely a stunner from my
favorite car of the show you know I'm a
sucker for a roadster so it's going to
be the 2016 Porsche Boxster Spyder I
love the boxer and what they've done is
they've taken a lot of weight out of its
got a manual folding fabric roof it
doesn't come standard with a stereo or
air conditioning or navigation they
basically reduced the weight they edit
more power two hundred fiume 375
horsepower which means this would be
fastest lightest most hardcore version
of the box during for car that's got the
reputation that the Boxster has it
definitely could use a little influx of
hardcore well I was gonna go with the
five 70s myself so thanks Wayne but I
guess I'll go with the BRZ the tune by
STI brz edition which is not really a
huge upgrade over the the original
because he thinks just intake and
exhaust in a couple of tweaks the
suspension and a little bit other
niceties inside but a very nice looking
aero package I think and big wing in the
back which for a Subaru makes it good
needs gold wheels though definitely
needs gold will if you're gonna put that
FDI vents on it that man always right
well I add a turbo 555 details on the
side to are we gonna wrap things up here
in New York what's our next show we
going to germany next ya know yes
frankfurt its frankfurt it isn't right
yes I think frankfurt in a couple of
months I where we'll be looking at
other lovely European sports cars and
performance cars in concept cars we hope
you enjoyed our coverage of this the
2015 new york international auto show
we'll see you Frank for a couple months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
