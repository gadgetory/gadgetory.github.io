the way this time around the so fellows
cosmos possible worlds which is a very
it's almost spiritual in the sense that
we are presented options at all times
and also the knowledge that the
ecosystem in which we're embedded that
we're a participant of that echo system
we are not separate and distinct from
him and and when you bring a cosmic
perspective to that it changes you you
you look up at night and you no longer
say to yourself I'm here and that's
there you realize that we have become
one with the universe our knowledge of
the universe has made us one and there
are actionable steps you can take for
having learned about your relationship
to the universe and cosmos possible
world is a very powerful statement of
the hope for Humanity we need a dream of
the future we can work towards and we
live in a moment where everything is so
dystopic and so hopeless but I hope
cosmos this season of cosmos will light
people up I think often about the fact
that a hundred years ago if you asked
people what worries you most about life
on Earth they give a list that does not
exist today because those problems were
solved so 20 years from now 50 years
from now Who am I to judge what we learn
about this world that will require a
whole other level of creative
problem-solving that we cannot even
imagine so
I hesitate to venture what a future
cosmos would bring but I can guarantee
you that if we're still making cosmoses
and cause my because with plural of
cosmoses i'll let you decide we're still
making cosmos is 2040 years hence it
will have and address the central
problems that we face in this world so
that we can become better shepherds over
our our lives
and present for our descendants a world
where they can look back and say wow my
ancestors did right by us
things are about to get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
