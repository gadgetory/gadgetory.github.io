there are also activity trackers but
what would happen if you combine the two
well you would get something that looks
like this I'm Dan Graziano and I'm here
with the Garmin Forerunner 15 this watch
combines the GPS features found in many
popular Garmin running watches with the
step counting features from the
company's vivofit activity tracker the
watch track sir steps distance traveled
and calories burned with the GPS you can
also use it to track your distance and
pace when running the 415 is waterproof
up to 50 meters meaning you can shower
with it or even go swimming battery life
is very impressive rated at an estimated
five weeks in activity tracking mode or
up to eight hours while using the GPS I
really enjoy using the forerunner 15 I
think it could be the perfect watch for
casual runners who are also interested
in the daily step count the only major
downside is the lack of Bluetooth in
order to sync the watch with your
computer or mobile device you must first
connect it to a special charging dock
it's kind of a hassle luckily it doesn't
have to be synced every day because the
415 holds up to seven days of workouts
as a running watch it's very good it's
accurate
it supports heartrate monitors and the
GPS signal is acquired relatively quick
there are also some really great
features like virtual pacer which will
let you set a pace and be alerted when
you're running too slow or too fast or
auto pause which will automatically
pause the watch when you stop running
something I found extremely useful when
testing the launch in New York City the
415 is available now in two packages one
with just the watch which will run you
about $170 or even get the watch with
Garmin's heart rate monitor which will
increase the price to $200 for more
information be sure to check out the
full review on cnet.com I'm Dan Grazia
resina and that was a first look at the
Garmin Forerunner 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
