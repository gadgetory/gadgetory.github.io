Las Vegas at CES 2015 I'm here at the
Chamberlain booth to take a look at the
brand new Chamberlain notify this is
sort of a complete front door security
system imagine like a smart doorbell
with a smart camera with a smart light
bulb involved all kind of tangled up
into one do it yourself front door
security system so the idea is you have
a LED light bulb with an audio system
built into it that's how the system
draws its power you're gonna plug it
into a light fixture in your front door
like you see setup there and it's
tethered to a 720p security camera so
with these two things you can kind of
keep tabs on your front door and then
that is all tied into this front
doorbell so when someone hits the
doorbell the camera can come on they can
also detect motion the whole operation
is designed to let you kind of see who's
coming and going from your front door
talk with them through the audio thing
if you want to and it ties into Wi-Fi
via this bridge piece right here that
goes inside your house so this whole
operation sells for $1.99 which is a
pretty good deal we've seen smart
doorbells that don't have say the light
bulb piece sell for about the same price
if not a little more
it is only 720p camera so it doesn't
compete with some of the SE Dropcam
which comes in at 1080p but overall it
seems me a pretty cost-effective package
you're gonna have to wait a little while
if you want to buy it it doesn't come
out until q3 but we'll be interested to
get our hands on it and give it a full
review once it hit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
