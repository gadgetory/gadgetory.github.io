Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded there's drama brewing in
the streaming music space as 200 labels
pulled out of sharing music on services
like Spotify symph ir do and Napster the
labels are part of uk-based music
distributor st holdings it was spurred
by a report from NPD group showing that
more people are okay with not buying
music if they can access it anytime for
free on these services it's not going to
crush the companies by losing the
smaller artists but it remains to be
seen if more will also sever their ties
artists like Coldplay and Tom Waits
already are not distributing their most
recent albums on Spotify windows phone
marketplace is home to more than 40,000
apps according to a new study there's
been a developer rushed lately about a
third of the apps were added in the past
three months of those added in the past
month about seventy percent were free
downloads the larger the App Store the
more windows phone can compete with
Android and Apple devices the study
reports that 165 apps are added to
windows marketplace every day malware
attacks are at an all-time high this
year McAfee reports and malware
targeting Android devices continues to
search all the mobile malware that came
out in the third quarter targeted
Android devices and infections grew
thirty-seven percent from the second
quarter common attacks are through text
messages that collect personal
information and steal money from the
user some malware also records phone
conversations to collect data and if you
thought spam was down it is but now spam
attacks are just more sophisticated
targeting users more efficiently with
personal info making it harder to spot a
scam Electronic Arts the game maker
behind best selling franchises like
madden NFL battlefield and need for
speed is experimenting with a free game
business model for mobile devices EA has
four free games in the Apple App Store
but will expand that to about 14 by
March and instead of charging for the
game it'll charge for upgrade items in
the game like that extra energy or
better weapon apparently lots of people
spend money on in-game items there's a
freemium version of battlefield being
worked on but it won't be the
traditional first-person shooter right
now the market for app games is split 60
percent pay and forty percent free
Netflix is pushing to be a platform for
original content and to doing so by
bringing back the sitcom Arrested
Development airing brand-new episodes
that you can only get through netflix
streaming service earlier this year
Netflix also announced its airing an
original series called house of cards
starring Kevin Spacey the new Arrested
Development episodes will come out in
2013 Wow for once Netflix didn't make a
huge mistake those are your headlines
for today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet com
