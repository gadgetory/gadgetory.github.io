originally promised the Siri powered
smart speaker would arrive in December
but it's been delayed and now we'll land
on February 9th in the US UK and
Australia pre-orders begin this Friday
January 26th and it goes for 349 dollars
you see with a price like that you just
need to take a moment to breathe it in
even with Apple taking extra time to
work out the kinks not every feature is
coming at launch it will not ship with
multi-room audio and stereo support so
if you plan on buying more than one
speaker it won't work between rooms
until later this year whenever Apple
pushes out a software update now apples
got an interesting challenge first of
all it is way late to the speaker
assistant game with multiple Amazon echo
and Google assistant products having a
long head start
not to mention they cost less the home
pod was also not at CES a few weeks ago
Amazon and Google speakers and
assistants practically dominated the
tech tradeshow integrated with so many
various smart home products even showers
and toilets so where does the home pod
fit in Apple is saying this is for
people who care about a high-quality
music listening experience and it works
with Siri it lets you send text messages
with voice commands so of course that's
a perk if you own other Apple products
Apple also has a privacy advantage for
consumers that care more about
encryption and it's a valid concern when
you have devices always listening to you
in your home are you planning on
pre-ordering the home pod right away
sound off in the comments I'm Bridget
Carey and I've seen it we're happy to
deliver the latest tech news to you
every day on any speaker you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
