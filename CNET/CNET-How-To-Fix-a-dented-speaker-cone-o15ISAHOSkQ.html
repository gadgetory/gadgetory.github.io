speaker that just seems to cry out for
pokey kid fingers so if you're suffering
from the effects of a collapsed dustcap
here are a few tips to fix your speaker
using items from around your home one
commonly advertised way to fix this
problem is to use a vacuum cleaner
attachment to suck the dome back out you
could try it but it makes me a little
nervous
depending on how delicate your speaker
cap is it might tear the whole thing off
or just warp it out going the other
direction for a more controlled version
of this technique take an empty paper
towel roll place it over the cone and
use it like a giant straw I'll let you
use your imagination on that one another
technique is to use a slightly bent
sewing needle to poke into the cone and
then pull the dent out it's a good way
to go if you have multiple dents because
you can kind of address them all with
one little point of entry the bad news
is that you've got a hole in your
speaker now and possibly more if you're
not careful sonically a few holes in
your dust cap really aren't going to
make a difference but it doesn't look
that great so here's my favorite
technique and I've used this one a
couple times with great results you take
a q-tip chop off the top of it Midway so
that it's nice and flat then apply a few
dabs of super glue to the tip let it
soak in for a few seconds and hold it on
the dent until it can stand up without
your help now you want the glue to be
dry enough to withstand a good tug but
not so dry that you have a q-tip stuck
to your speaker for the rest of your
life I give it about five to ten minutes
and err on the side of less time because
you can always try it again if it falls
off now once the glue sets give it a
pull straight back and you should be
able to tug that dome back out and then
gently twist the q-tip back and forth
while pulling on it and the thing should
pull right off hopefully with a minimum
of glue left behind so there you go for
