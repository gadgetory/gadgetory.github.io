main constituencies owners of the Model
S who turn into an ugly mob if you dare
to criticize the car and an equally
vocal core of doubters who think the car
is overpriced unsustainable and not the
answer to anything I fall smack in the
middle the great car that needs a
clear-eyed look the Model S is what
Tesla makes a four-door sedan aluminum
body all electric of course we'll get
into that in a minute you've got two
seats in the front kind of two and a
half seating in the second row and
optionally two rear-facing seats with
little racing harnesses on them for your
sporty kids approach the car and you get
the first taste of a constant predictive
theme the door pulls surface to meet
your hand walk away and they disappear
as the car locks there are no lock poles
no place for a key now normally I'd get
in this car and immediately draw your
attention to the amazing 12 inch LCD
instrument panel but that's almost
boring compared to its friend the head
unit if you can call it that it's
actually bigger than your head a 17 inch
vertical format touchscreen that has
almost every control of the vehicle
embedded in its interface no other car
does this let's look at the layout first
you can do a split screen like you see I
have here top and bottom you can switch
which one of those at the top and then
when you hit this row of buttons at the
top that changes what's in the upper
screen you go to your media settings
am/fm HD radio satellite radio is
optional no optical disk in this card no
nonsense like SD cards or a hard drive I
think they've made the right choices on
media USB ipod and bluetooth streaming
of course media apps currently consists
of slacker for web streaming and TuneIn
for broadcast streaming you want Pandora
launch it on your phone and bring it up
as a Bluetooth stream it's not
integrated in the car which seems a step
out of pace with the rest of the world
now navigation is an interesting and
kind of complex story as you can see
here if I go to full screen big gorgeous
Google map you'll have this in
your Model S as a map for reference
that'll show you where you are but you
won't have turn-by-turn navigation
unless you get an option that brings
that in that will give you an a via some
Garmin technology which shows up on the
left side of the dashboard as well so
there's map base navigation and search
and turn-by-turn optional it's an
important difference now destination is
really elegant here you search like you
search for anything else out there on
the web and once you find the result you
want you just say I want to go there by
pressing it and off you go the nav rake
doesn't nag you to confirm and reconfirm
that you want to go there like almost
every other car on the market does thank
you you've got an energy screen for you
range and efficiency geeks most of us
won't use that this is the craziest
thing in this car the only car in the
world that'll let you surf the web and I
mean full screen there's no block out
while you're driving this is a full live
browser I can go to Cameron's Facebook
page while I'm on the freeway he likes
that I'm not sure I do
where this browser is restricted is its
lack of flash support so no YouTube
streaming no C net videos no streaming
from the Pandora site another
restriction of sorts is that we are
working off a built in connection that's
impressive but its 3G while other makers
like Audi and GM are already
transitioning to 4G we need Tesla there
as well your rear camera is the best in
the business big and high def this is
absolutely amazing you can pick up a
leaf or a pine needle that you're about
to run over on the downside though it
gives me no indication where things are
there are no guidelines for distance or
where my wheels are lining up that to me
is a failing because this is a distorted
wide-angle view it's not a true natural
ratio when it's looking like that the
last area of this amazing interface is
down here under control this is all the
stuff that used to be buttons in your
older car you want to operate the
sunroof there's nothing up here to do
that you go to this actual software
control you can move this slider or you
can just pick up a preset like Vince or
all the way open or anywhere in between
whether this menu based car is forward
progress or lateral innovation will
largely depend on your relationship with
displays versus controls
I kept yearning for a few more buttons
and knobs but only if done well like the
mercedes stall
on the steering column and window
controls on the door panels something
else only a Tesla has a firmware change
log something like two dozen updates
have been pushed out to these cars
already in the manner of updates to your
smartphone and they aren't just minor
things recent firmware upgrades have
added he'll hold breaking a new
streaming radio service new options for
cars with air suspension and even creep
when you lift off the brake now in case
you've been living under a rock let's
review a Model S is a pure battery
electric car not a hybrid or a range
extender it's in kimball of combusting
anything no jokes about some highly
publicized fires you charge it primarily
by plugging it in but it also
regenerates power when you use the
brakes or coasts it's rear-wheel drive
only at this point via a single motor
that sits between the rear wheels and
turns their drive shafts via a single
speed reduction gear the battery is this
massive flat metal mattress of a thing
that underlies almost the entire car and
these cars come in two battery
capacities the 60 model cars have a
range of 208 miles the 85 model cars
have a larger battery and 265 miles of
range between that battery and the motor
lies the inverter an inverter converts
the DC the direct current that is stored
in that battery into the AC the
alternating current which this motor
wants that motor then spins through this
one speed gearbox you don't shift
anything this is a reduction gear it
turns the very high rpms of this motor
into more usable rpms out to the axles
and the road wheels because we have a P
in front of our 85 model designation we
have a harder inverter that can flow
more current to the motor allowing even
greater acceleration the numbers 416
horsepower 443 pound-feet apart
rear wheel drive 0 to 60 is 4.2 seconds
which is pretty impressive for a car
that weighs over 4700 pounds the mpge
or miles per gallon equivalent is 18
now how long it takes to charge one of
these things is a question with many
answers from basically empty to a full
charge on our big battery car would take
an absurd 76 hours on a normal 110
outlet with the standard onboard charger
in the car now plug into a 240 volt 24
amp outlet in you're down to 14 hours to
40 40 amp and you get down to 8 hours if
you have a dedicated 240 volt 40 amp
wall connector you can option a second
charger in the car and that gets you
down to four hours or find one of
Tesla's superchargers out on the road
and you can get 150 miles of charge in
20 minutes
I said not simple
driving the Model S gets different even
before it moves as we saw you unlock it
by approaching it you start it by
pressing the brake pedal there's no
switch set the parking brake by putting
it in park the two are never separate
and its blessedly free of any sport mode
buttons and layers and settings that
have become a game of 3d chess on most
other performance cars you want to go
faster you push the pedal Conaway it
should be it's very simple now because
we've got the big boy here with the hot
rod inverter it's just got tremendous
power no matter what part of the speed
range you're trying to accelerate from
zero twenty forty sixty doesn't matter
it's always a grim the ride quality is
really outstanding benefiting from that
big heavy battery down in the belly
let's face it our sport suspension is
none too harsh I don't think and it's
interesting you would think this big
17-inch display is gonna be a massive
distraction for some reason I find that
it's not it's good clear interface hey
now I'm not an idiot I'm not gonna sit
here and browse the web while I Drive I
guess you could do that Tesla doesn't
stop you notably missing on a Model S is
any driver assistance tech adaptive
cruise blind spot warning lane departure
prevention forward collision warning
self parking assist all not spoken here
those and all-wheel drive are of course
things Tesla will need if they want to
fully compete as a mass-market brand
about the only drive controls you can
fuss with on this car the steering mode
comfort standard or sport
changes the weight and the ratio and the
regenerative braking is an interesting
performance tool if you have that too
standard it's actually quite heavy when
you lift and you get a nice regenerative
drag which is a great tool for getting
in and out of corners when you learn how
to play with it
okay let's price our Model S we of
course of a P 85 basically top of the
stack and weird about eighty seven
thousand dollars with destination - the
federal tax credit of 75 hundred but I'm
not factoring in any state credits
because they range from zero to
thousands depending where you live now
the options to make it truly CNET style
first of all we have Performance Plus
sixty five hundred bucks gets you a
sports suspension staggered wheel width
and another six to twelve miles of range
but that package also requires you get
the 21 inch performance wheels for forty
five hundred dollars more and requires
you get detect package for 3750 that
brings in full maps and navigation LED
running and cornering lights keyless
access memory seats and mirrors and a
power liftgate
Performance Plus also requires you get
the smart air suspension for twenty two
fifty for automatic leveling and height
dual chargers to speed up your recharge
or fifteen hundred bucks
park sensors insultingly are not
included on this car and they nickel and
dime you five hundred bucks for those
front and rear and finally ultra high
fidelity takes you to twelve speakers
including a powered sub and for twenty
five hundred bucks that's actually not
bad market price all in word about a
hundred and eighty six
CNET style though you can add a lot more
for creature comforts in some yes this
car is out of reach of most people and
yes it takes anywhere between fifteen
and fifteen hundred times longer to
re-energize than a gas engine car but
spend the day with it and all the other
cars on the road with their noisy oily
boxes of explosions under the hood and
seven eight or nine compromises known as
gears in the transmission just seem very
old I can't say this is the future but I
can say I'd enjoy it if it were</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
