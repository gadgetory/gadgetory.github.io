companies to include GPS in their
activity trackers polar to the reverse
and actually included activity tracking
in their latest GPS running watch I'm
dan Graziano and I'm here with the polar
m400 while you won't see any smart phone
notifications on your wrist this watch
can track your active time the steps you
take distance you travel calories you
burn and even your sleep at night the
GPS and other sensors give an extra
boost allowing me to track your distance
pace time and altitude while running the
watch is very smart it knows when it's
being worn when you're sitting standing
walking jogging or resting
there's Bluetooth onboard so can connect
with your mobile device or a heartrate
monitor it's fully waterproof so you can
shower with it or even go swimming and
it charges with a normal USB cord rather
than some specialized dock like most
trackers on the market there's also a
special feature on Polar's website that
lets you relive your past runs in the
form of a mini movie this includes
details about your time and pace and
even shows street view photos from your
route it's a little gimmicky but I still
think it's pretty cool the watch itself
is a little big for a lot of work
environments but this gives it great
battery life with an active GPS signal
you can expect to get about nine hours
which should be more than enough time
for most people to finish a marathon
when used only as a watch and activity
tracker that battery life jumps up to 24
days I got about 15 days of usage with a
mix of light jogging about 20 and 30
minutes five days a week and daily
activity tracking but your results will
vary based on how often you use the GPS
I did have trouble maintaining a GPS
signal in New York City and that's
something you should definitely consider
before buying this watch without the GPS
you can't get your pace or distance
which makes the m400 simply an expensive
stopwatch the polar and 400 is available
now and starts at $200 in the US 134
pounds in the UK and 230 Australian
dollars for more information be sure to
check out my full review over at
cnet.com I'm Dan Grazia prasena and that
was a first look at the polar m400</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
