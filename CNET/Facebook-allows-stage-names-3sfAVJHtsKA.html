Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded celebrities on Facebook
and now use their stage names in their
personal profiles facebook is verifying
celebrity accounts and allowing them to
post as their pseudonyms instead of a
birth name according to a report from
TechCrunch the point is to increase
subscribers suggestions when someone is
doing a search for a celebrity stage or
pen name Twitter and Google+ verifies
celebrity accounts with a badge but you
won't be seeing that on facebook in an
effort to make 911 emergency calls more
reliable all VoIP service providers must
now report network outages to the
Federal Communications Commission just
the same as cellphone and traditional
landline providers do now the FCC
implemented this new ruling to ensure
they can monitor what's happening in an
emergency and if consumers are even able
to call 911 this phone technology voice
over Internet Protocol is on the rise
about thirty one percent of residential
phone subscriptions are using VoIP
service the Chinese factories that make
apple products are better than other
factories in the country according to
the head of the fair labor association
the organization was tasked to inspect
the working conditions at Apple's
supplier factories following reports of
unsafe working conditions and an
increase in worker suicides the
Association president said the
facilities are first-class physical
conditions are way above average of the
norm and that boredom might be leading
to suicides the inspection is a complete
just yet though the group is using iPads
go figure to collect answers from
workers about how they're paid as well
as the quality of dorm rooms and food in
other Apple news the iphone maker sent
out a warning to app makers any app that
can collect user contact list without
permission is going against the
guidelines Apple said it is working on
an iOS software fix to prevent any app
from gathering data without first
prompting the user if it's okay to do so
the action comes after several apps such
as path Foursquare and Twitter or found
to be collecting info from address books
apps like path have since updated to
first ask before collecting data if
you're on the social network Google Plus
this might not come as
eyes but Google+ is a man's world
according to data gathered by the
service website monitoring sixty-seven
percent of Google+ users are male a
whopping majority of the users or
students and trailing far behind our
software engineers and consultants and
many are either from the US or India
Bangalore has the greatest number of
Google+ users followed by New York those
are your headlines for today I'm Bridget
Carey precita calm and you just been
