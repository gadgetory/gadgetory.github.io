cnet.com and I'm here with the bose
soundlink bluetooth mobile speaker 2
this is a slight upgrade to the original
Bluetooth speaker from Bose that speaker
was very impressive and earned an
editor's choice this one offers slightly
ever so slightly better sound
that's because Bose has updated the
transducers in the system it's also
adjusted the algorithm a little bit with
for its digital processing and that gets
it a little bit more refined sound aside
from that the only other differences are
the cover that converts into a stand now
has a bifold design it splits in half
and lastly this now remembers up to six
devices for bluetooth pairing so it
makes it slightly easier to pair devices
it automatically remembers them really
the speaker's claim to fame is that it
is very small and compact and it
delivers big big sound also pretty
refined sound so this is a very strong
compact bluetooth speaker there's some
other speakers that have come on to the
market in the mean time for instance the
jawbone big Jambox that model has a
speaker phone in it so if you're looking
for a speaker phone that's gonna be a
better option probably they offer a
comparable sound slightly different it
depends upon your taste which you're
gonna like better but they are very
close in terms of sound quality this one
I like the design better because it's a
little bit more portable I like how the
cover folds up and protects it the jam
box on the other hand does have better
battery life this one has about three to
four hours of battery life at very high
volumes at more modest levels it gets
about 6 to 7 hours that's pretty decent
as gonna get you through most of the day
if you're playing it at moderate volumes
all in all a very good compact bluetooth
speaker you can't connect non bluetooth
devices with this there is an input on
the back but you really expected to use
this with smartphones and tablets you
can use it with a computer but there is
no remote with it you will really use
your smartphone as a remote this model
does come in two different versions
there's one with a nylon cover that
retails for $300 and one with a leather
cover
retails for $350 there's a slight
upgrade in the finish when you go to
that leather cover and those covers are
interchangeable so you could upgrade
later to the leather but it would cost
you $50 the one thats thing is you can
try before you buy the speaker Bose does
offer a 30 day money back guarantee on
it a lot of people are on the fence
about which compact bluetooth speaker to
buy so it's nice to be able to have that
return option but I don't think a lot of
people will have buyer's remorse on this
I do like it a lot I'm David karna I and
this is the O's soundlink bluetooth
mobile speaker 2 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
