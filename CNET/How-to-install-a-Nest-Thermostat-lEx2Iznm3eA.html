how you live in a program your heating
and cooling to save you a bunch of money
its internet accessible it's real simple
to use kind of like an iPod on the wall
and it looks pretty cool but is it all
of that stuff two hundred and fifty
bucks worth
I'm Brian Cooley with a how-to we'll
show you how to get this guy installed
and get started using it let's go now
you know how cryptic and tedious modern
programmable thermostats are with all
those little menus and configurations
and buttons they just no longer make
sense in our world full of connected
devices with elegant interfaces the nest
includes the thermostat itself some base
plates now before you even get your nest
they make you take a little poll on
their site when you order it to check if
your system and wiring are going to be
compatible when mine arrived I didn't
like the silvery color you see mostly
around the body they say it picks up the
color of your wall and kind of becomes a
chameleon within your wall color
hey I didn't buy it and B I like to save
silver for things like the backs of
iPads not in my home so I painted it the
color of my home now this is almost
certainly going to clobber your warranty
but aesthetics matter you can separate
the ring from the body via four small
screws and a ribbon connector then mask
everything on the ring except that
outside part you're going to paint
luckily the paint brand I use on my
house also sells some of their popular
colors in rattled hands already mixed so
I got an exact match
now put the thermostat head back
together in the reverse of disassembly
be careful putting in those four little
screws the trick is to start them
counterclockwise till you feel them
click then go clockwise to tighten that
way you're not going to recut the
threads a second time and weaken the
assembly pull out the old thermostat
make a note of the terminal each wire
was connected to and now it's time to
start installing your nest now as you
can see I installed mine with a wall
plate you can go with this square one
there's a bigger rectangular one they
include or none at all it'll be a
combination of what look you like and
also what kind of holes you're trying to
cover up and of course I also painted
the wall plate to match the thermostat
and the house there's a little level
built into the nest backplate but I
found it wasn't exactly accurate so I
grabbed a real
and of course also eyeballed it
attaching the wires now is easy
especially for me since I only have two
in my forced air furnace but in every
case the wire terminals on the back
plate are tooless and clearly labeled
very nice
now just snap the thermostat head itself
onto the back plate and let it wake up
no batteries it's powered by the voltage
from your HVAC control circuit now the
cool part it asks you a bunch of
questions like how to get on the Wi-Fi
network and how you want to configure it
it's kind of like when you take a new
iPad out you set that thing up this is
not like any thermostat you've had
before it'll ask you for some mode
preferences minimum away temperature and
then let you know it's going to start
learning for the next week as you turn
it up and down at various times you can
also program it more traditionally and
it will learn on top of that now if the
thing goes black don't panic it does
that it'll wake up every time you walk
by it it's got a proximity sensor or you
can press the face to wake it up rotate
once you're there on that main menu
around the perimeter navigate to any
function press to select etc and perhaps
best of all changing temperature is the
old-school way you just turn this thing
totally intuitive no button button
button button to go up or down go to
nest comm to set up an account and then
you can access your thermometer from
there app or a browser to do almost
everything you can do here in person now
I'll be honest with you putting it in
was pretty easy just to find 250 bucks
not as easy I'm not sure it'll ever earn
back its price differential especially
not in the house it just has a simple
heater however for the remote access
ability the easy programming function
the great interface and the great looks
it is the iPod of thermostats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
