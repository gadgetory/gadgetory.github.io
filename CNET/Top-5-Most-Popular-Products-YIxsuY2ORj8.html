smartphones have become the master
device of everyone's digital life this
edition of cnet top 5 is it I'm Brian
Cooley with the top 5 most popular
products on cnet as of july 2010 and
they're all phones number 5 the samsung
captivate yes AT&amp;amp;T does offer something
other than the iphone and this is their
best android offering and you're
fascinated by it it has an amazing 4
inch AMOLED display great call quality
quake great call quality on AT&amp;amp;T
unfortunately AT&amp;amp;T has been out drinking
with Apple too many nights and they've
learned the over control stick so no
side loading of apps on this guy and for
some reason no flash for the camera but
you still think it's a great iphone
alternative in a world that often
forgets there are such things number
four the sprint EVO 4G you know the
first 4g phone if 4 g's turned on in
your area but you're still going to pay
a ten-dollar 4G surcharge whether it is
or not and that irks us this guy's also
a mobile hotspot and has an almost too
big 4.3 inch display it also shoots HD
video and like your first bicycle it has
a kickstand number 3 the droid
incredible a ballsy name but luckily for
verizon they don't end up looking stupid
because the incredible is and you
believe it it's got a cnet editors
choice so we're with you on this one it
has the sense UI laid over android two
dot one fast processor and of course
verizon's network is a big draw for a
lot of people here 8-megapixel camera
3.7 inch screen just right to keep
things pocketable but remember this
guy's verizon so no voice and data at
the same time you don't seem to care
number two there's the iphone iphone 4
almost as much a software story as a
hardware thing iOS is still the
operating system to beat with scads of
improvements now that it's in the fourth
generation the handset doesn't hurt
either a killer Retina Display you love
those dual cameras HD video capture and
editing but there is that thing with the
antenna and the net
or get connects to which doesn't seem to
bother you before we get to number one
the most popular product on cnet that
isn't a smartphone you make a scroll all
the way down to number seven for the
canon powershot s90 a great compact
camera for advanced amateurs you know
those few folks left who don't take all
their pictures with their phone okay now
it's time to reveal our number one
really your number one most popular
product on cnet for july 2010 the one
that told the iphone 4 to go over there
and take a seat and be quiet please it's
the droid x oh it's a big boy with a 4.3
inch display great multimedia another
one of those 8 megapixel cameras and
it's on verizon but no front facing
camera and at least we wish a tree on
the sense UI instead of motoblur but
you're all over it that's it we're here
celebrating today the diversity of our
opinion versus yours well those are the
products that have you lying awake at
night don't worry I'll give the other
cnet departments a pep talk and let you
know you love them too you do right I'm
Brian Cooley we'll see you next time for
another top five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
