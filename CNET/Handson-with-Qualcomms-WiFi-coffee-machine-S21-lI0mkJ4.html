qualcomm stand at mobile world congress
2013 taking a look at something that
caffeine fiends will really enjoy it's a
tablet and smartphone controlled coffee
machine okay so here's how it works this
coffee maker is hooked up to a Qualcomm
4100 atheros chip and then all you need
to do is hold the tablet using a camera
in front of the coffee machine it will
then identify it that's using the view
Fauria augmented reality technology and
then you'll get this tablet interface
here which you can use to control the
kind of coffee you want you can set the
time that it's set to brew you can
choose regular or strong then you press
brew and that signal is sent to the
coffee machine you can even get a
separate notification popping up on a
different tablet letting you know when
your brew is ready it's very cool stuff
but here's the bad news this isn't an
actual product it's going to be shipping
it's just a concept that Qualcomm's
whipped up to show how you can connect
physical devices in your home to the
connected devices you've got smartphones
tablets that sort of thing a couple of
other applications we've seen that you
could use the technology for is
controlling an alarm clock or a
television the whole system is built on
Qualcomm's all joint open-source
software which is actually going to be
shipping with a variety of Qualcomm
chips later in the year so if you really
wanted you could get hold of that chip
and try and build something like this
for yourself I'm the West ready for CNET
suddenly in need of caffeine here at
Qualcomm stand at mobile world congress
2013
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
