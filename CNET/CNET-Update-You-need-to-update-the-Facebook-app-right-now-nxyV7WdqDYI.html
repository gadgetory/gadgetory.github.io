right now I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update the Facebook app is a
battery drain on your phone and even
Facebook admits it has a problem with
how much battery life it uses but the
network just came out with an updated
app that should improve battery life a
bit this fix follows complaints about
the app which have been escalating ever
since iPhone users got the ability to
see exactly how much battery each app is
using in iOS 9
this feature shows Facebook was eating
up lots of battery life in the
background even when background app
refresh was turned off in settings
Facebook's engineering manager Ari grant
wrote a post saying that his team found
a few key issues and made some
improvements and that Facebook is
continuing to work on improving battery
usage there are other ways you can also
watch your battery and data with
Facebook make sure in facebook settings
you disable videos from automatically
playing in your newsfeed snapchat is
another big battery offender because
it's getting your location with GPS and
using video and data travel mode can
save you a bit because it won't load
your friends snaps unless you click on
the message and with all phones and apps
you can save battery by limiting your
notifications turning off bluetooth and
location as well as turning down the
brightness of your screen but going back
to Facebook the network is rolling out a
new function that lets you search
through anyone's public posts that's
more than 2 trillion posts a month that
you can search through it gives Facebook
more power as a resource to discover
news and other trends by using it as a
search engine of sorts you can do this
in the search bar on the website or app
but right now it's only for us members
type in a keyword like star wars and see
what your friends have said about it and
also see public posts from people you
don't know and not to fall behind
Facebook Twitter is trying to make money
from its new moment section moments
highlights big stories being shared on
the network and it's Twitter's way of
creating a news hub now moments will
have advertisements they're called
promoted moments the movie Creed paid to
show photos and videos within this
section over the weekend and for those
of you who like physical mail over
social media there's a cool
new feature in the ship app it spelled s
Hyp it wants to change the way we ship
packages you can send a package to
someone without knowing their address
but the catch is that the person also
needs to have the ship app all you need
is that person's username and it sends
your package to their address on file
without telling you their address ship
has been around for a year already and
it helps you send anything you want you
just take a photo of something you need
packaged and within 20 minutes someone's
coming by to pick it up and pack it in a
box and mail it for you that service is
in San Francisco la New York Miami and
Chicago that's it for this tech news
update there's more at sea Netcom from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
