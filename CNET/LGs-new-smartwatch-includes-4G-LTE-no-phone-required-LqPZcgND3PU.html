with the company's newest smart lock the
LG watch urbane second edition this is
the first Android run watch with
cellular capabilities it has 2 G 3G and
4G LTE radios inside so you can pop a
SIM card in there and take the watch
without your phone make phone calls to
other people and that's a first for
Android wear it also has a 480 by 480
pixel resolution display which is the
highest Android wear display to date in
addition to being able to make calls
there's also Wi-Fi onboard and GPS which
I really like so you can track your pace
and distance when you're running the new
watch urbane also has three buttons one
on top that will bring you to your
favorite contacts a crown that will just
shut the watch off and then a bottom
button which will bring you to LG's
health app battery life is said to be
about a day maybe a day and a half but
it's not certain yet other than that
it's pretty much like a run-of-the-mill
Android wear watch there's a heart rate
sensor on the back it's powered by a
Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor and
there's four gigabytes of storage
onboard so you can have your music and
play it with a bluetooth headphones or
through the speakerphone this is just a
prototype so it the screens not on but
usually it would show you missed calls
notifications from apps and text
messages from friends and whatnot but I
think that really doesn't do all that
much besides make phone calls release
and pricing is still up in the air but
for now this which is a first look at
the LG watch urbane second edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
