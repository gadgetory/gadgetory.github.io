the buzz report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week Netflix is in hot water again fun
with neuroscience and cat videos reach a
new viral high but first the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
Wi-Fi equipped panasonic lumix dmc FX
90c point-and-shoot cameras are pretty
much losing out to smartphones
everywhere because duh you can't share
the photos easily sdcard dance out
Instagram to Facebook in seconds in so
yay for the lumix which has Wi-Fi plus
all the good point and shoot camera
quality for just three hundred bucks
winner kind of i mean the Wi-Fi settings
are kind of impossible to use and
actually the image quality is pretty
crappy especially in low light but you
know what I'm so happy to see Wi-Fi
showing up and point and shoot cameras
that I'm just going to be encouraging on
this one good start Panasonic keep it up
and now for the news amazon just
announced a new streaming video deal
with Viacom that brings Comedy Central
MTV Nickelodeon vh1 and other shows to
its instant streaming library amazon now
has about 15,000 titles for streaming
triple what it had when it launched a
year ago and near as i can tell that's
about the same amount as netflix has oh
also verizon is teaming up with coinstar
owner of the red box boxes to deliver
on-demand streaming video on the web and
on mobile phones now considering that
amazon already killed bookstores and
redbox killed video stores if I were
Netflix I'd be thinking the mayans were
right about 2012 at least for Netflix
too bad they've kind of been having a
good year so far Mobile World Congress
starts at the end of februari in
Barcelona and Nokia's plans are already
trickling out basically the plans are
win or die a Nokia vice president told a
swedish newspaper that the company's
entire plan is Windows Mobile period
that is plan a and Plan B and there is
no plan C
the company is planning some kind of
high-end phone release and I at least
and mostly just hoping for no
embarrassing crying or begging that's
messy us unemployment there's an app for
that according to a study released by
technet the so-called app economy has
generated an estimated four hundred
sixty-six thousand jobs since the iphone
debuted in 2007 and honestly if you told
me ten years ago that a company could
make a ton of money on a game for your
phone where you use your finger to fling
birds at obviously not code approved
structures I would have checked it for a
crack pipe turns out anything can be an
economy and neuro scientists with the
Royal Society in the UK issued a report
this week that basically says to
governments and the neuroscience
community itself hey dudes you need to
be careful with this stuff they say
neuroscience should be used for good
like making people think better or
treating their post-traumatic stress
disorders but when it comes to
experimenting with super soldier stuff
like actually making people smarter or
making them need less sleep or creating
little implants that let people actually
sense the heat of an object or a person
in the same room as them tread carefully
tread carefully really we can turn
people into real-life captain america
and you think that a strongly worded
report is going to stop any government
anywhere from doing stupid irresponsible
crap that leads to the apocalypse have
you ever seen a movie any movie and now
it's time to relax with what's clogging
the tubes this week it's kittens on live
streaming video wait for it with remote
control toys that you can control
friskies launched a facebook campaign
featuring a live-streamed kitty play
house with like 10 adorable kittens in
it and it gives you the chance to play
with three toys and then control the
cameras while the kiddies play with your
toys and you thought March Madness was a
productivity killer plus when people
weren't watching the live stream they
were dreaming up ways to set up their
own live streaming webcams with remote
controls at their own houses which come
to think of it Brian Cooley already did
a how-to on that I think and that's it
for this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
