buddy I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update google has found a new way
to use its search engine to stall key
while shopping let's say you search on
Google for a product like a certain toy
or maybe a pair of shoes later in the
day if you walk by a store that sells
the item that you were searching for
you'll get a popup on your phone it's
part of google now in the Google Search
app for Android the alert on Google now
shows the product and price at nearby
stores as a friendly reminder that
Google is watching every move you make
the next step would be for Google to tie
this ability into the Google Wallet for
payments and it may do that soon with
Google glass techCrunch reports Google's
tinkering with a way to send money to
other people with the voice command send
money and that's not all from google the
Google Maps app now includes information
on the car service uber on both iOS and
Android you can choose uber as a travel
option and if you live in the city with
uber car service and if you have the app
installed it'll let you see the
estimated travel time to your
destination if you order an uber car to
pick you up google has an interest in
seeing uber succeed it invested 258
million dollars in ubers latest funding
round but if you don't care about car
service the map update has other perks
google shows what lane to stay in with
driving directions you can save maps
offline which is good for vacations
abroad and there are more details on
public transit times so you know when
the last train leaves there's a few tech
stories to keep an eye on in the coming
days starting next week on May fifteenth
the four major wireless carriers in the
US will support a text to 911 program it
lets you send text messages to 911 to
get help and chat with an operator
instead of calling this of course is
helpful when you're in a situation where
you're afraid to speak but it may not
work everywhere only some emergency call
centers are equipped to answer texts
it's up to the local states and counties
to implement
to receive and dispatch your text
messages the Federal Communications
Commission has a list of the counties
that can handle text to 911 but if your
area does not you would get a
bounce-back text to know it didn't go
through and later this month will see a
smaller version of the surface tablet on
May twentieth Microsoft is happening
what it calls a small gathering which is
likely a tease that it will unveil the
rumored mini surface which could have a
7 or 8 inch screen and a stylus pen
that's your tech news update you can
head to cnet.com for more details and

New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
