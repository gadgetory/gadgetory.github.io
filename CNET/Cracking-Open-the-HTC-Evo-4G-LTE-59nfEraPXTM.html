until mid-2012 and even then it will
only be in select cities but that hasn't
stopped them from releasing an LTE phone
and now that the HTC EVO 4G LTE has
finally cleared us customs we can crack
it open and compare it to its cousin the
One X the Evo 4G LTE shares a lot of
hardware with the One X but there are
several important differences
beyond the Evo's kickstand and two-tone
case in fact the first difference is the
way you open the phones now using a thin
metal tool I popped off the upper half
of the back cover and then remove the
Evo's internal motherboard cover I then
remove the speaker cover and battery
compartment cover in contrast the One X
has a single piece cover now that we're
inside the phone we can see more
differences between the Evo and the One
X for starters the Evo has a larger
capacity battery 2000 milliamp hours
instead of 1800 the Evo's battery is
also easier to replace as its connector
is mounted to the top of the motherboard
speaking of motherboards they're also
different the Evo's board doesn't extend
down the side of the phone as the one
axis does and on the Evo's board most of
the connectors are on the top and this
makes working on the Evo easier than
working on the One X lastly instead of a
micro SIM card slot the Evo's
motherboard has a micro SD card slot
comparing the rest of the phones
construction the Evo's vibration motor
is mounted at the top instead of the
bottom and the lower speaker is mounted
to the front panel assembly instead of
the back cover the Evo
also lacks the circuit board that houses
the 1x docking connectors contacts and
despite all these differences the
phone's at least the US versions do
share a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
has 4 processor 1 gig of ram shown here
on top of the processor and 16 gigs of
on-board storage as well as an infant in
3-axis gyroscope and synaptics touch
screen controller and although I haven't
tried to swap them out yet
cameras also look identical as of this
taping the Evo 4G LTE is available for
$199 with a two-year sprint contract and
like the One X it's a solid phone even
though the US version lacks a quad-core
processor as CNN's Brian Bennett wrote
the new Evo is light years better than
its predecessors and flaunts enough
features to strike real fear into the
hearts of competitors c-more teardown

analysis go to TechRepublic comm forward
