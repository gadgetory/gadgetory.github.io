hard at work trying to shed the
grandpa's car image trading in soft
luxury for premium sport with a 2013 GS
Lexus hits a new high a performance
handling and cabin technology throw in a
hybrid powertrain you have one of the
best techie stands around this is the
2013 Lexus gs450h
this big screen its twelve point three
inch LCD most of the time the screen has
a split it shows a map or whatever the
main function is on the left side on the
right side you get this small dogs iller
II screen which shows you maybe the
music that's playing right now or it's
also got this energy monitor for your
trip information and you control stuff
on this screen with this little
controller right here which I think it
should have a more solid feel given that
this is a pretty high-end car and also
it's sometimes hard to hit the buttons
on the screen and really hit the mark
you want but another way to control this
is a voice command and this car has
excellent voice command so if I just hit
the button on the steering wheel after
the beep
saying a shortcut menu command play
artist Fleetwood Mac play artist
Fleetwood Mac but we also have the Lexus
enform system here and that that's very
similar to the Twitter and tune system
so what that is that's that's Lexuses
app integration strategy the inform app
is running on my iPhone and that's
paired to the car a little work
bluetooth paired it'll also work if it's
cabled into the car so I've got my apps
screen loss here I've got apps like
Pandora Open Table Yelp and I've also
got Bing search and the cool thing about
being is that I also can do voice search
with it I can't actually use the voice
command button on the steering wheel I
have to go to this little microphone
icon on the screen hamburger
and I've got a list of the results hit
the hamburger result with the controller
here and so I've got an in-and-out
burger hit the result for that and I get
an icon for the map so I can just
program that right in as I'm going and
also on this console we've got this dial
here below the shifter that puts the car
in a different drive modes we've got eco
to the left this will be - in the gas
pedal and just you know frustrate the
heck out of you when you want to
actually get going you can turn it to
the right and you get in this sport mode
this Tunes the transmission to keep the
revs up higher and keep power up all the
time then you can turn it once more to
the right and you get the Sport Plus
mode Sport Plus actually retains that
transmission profile and also changes
the suspension it actually dials in a
more rigid suspension so with a hybrid
system but they actually do is they
start out with the 3.5 liter v6 it's got
direct injection and porton injection
which is a little weird the reason why
they do that is port injection is
quieter and so uses port injection when
the engine is running at slower speeds
because the direct injection which is a
lot more efficient when it's running at
higher speeds along with this engine
they add this hybrid system and the
system all combined produces 338
horsepower that's a bit more than the v6
a little less than the v8 but the real
win here is you've got 30 miles per
gallon on average that's what we've been
getting
I think EPA numbers are like 29 city 34
highway but 30 is great 30 is like 10
miles per gallon better than you'd get
with the v6 and probably a couple more
than you'd get with the v8 this is a
great engine it's also got a lot of
power that 330 horsepower will actually
bring it to 60 miles per hour in 5.6
seconds according to Lexus so it's fast
and it gets great fuel economy I mean
what more could you want
as a full hybrid the Lexus gs450h
they'll turn off its engine when I'm
stopped a bit lightly if I let my foot
off the brake start creeping forward
you'll move forward under electric power
what I find with this car is it's it's
really too heavy to stay in eb mode for
a long time if you want to get out of
people's away from behind you you really
need to push that accelerator and which
will kick the engine you know there's
just really no getting around that
but what I also find is that you know
you can get moving
and with the engine going then just as
you're kind of a cruising speed lifts
off the accelerator really quick it'll
and usually the engine will cut off if
you're at speeds like under 35 miles per
hour and then you can get going now
we're a little bit of rough road right
now and I can feel the fairly rigid
suspension and this is a changed Lexus
is made from the old days of old sort of
grandpa cars with soft suspensions they
made this especially more rigid to help
the handling and that leads to you know
maybe a little more bumps but it handles
it pretty confidently when you put it in
Sport Plus plus mode it actually
tightens up that suspension and makes it
handle actually surprisingly well and
the hybrid powertrain actually gives it
a lot more power than the standard v6
car you get that zero to sixty and I
think they say five point six seconds
which is is not bad at all
the Lexus gs450h goes for fifty eight
thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars
with this car we also have the blind
spot monitor that's five hundred dollars
I can get that we also have this luxury
package which is five thousand two
hundred and five dollars and includes
all sorts little trim elements and nice
stuff little gimmicks here and there you
could get that or not nothing really
essential there and the navigation
system with that twelve point three inch
screen goes for 1735 that's essential
you'll want to get that the GS 450h it's
a lot of high points in tech that hybrid
system gets great power and great fuel
economy the adaptive suspension gives it
great handling and it's got app
integration with all those other cabin
tech features it's all around a great
tech car and I have no problem giving it
