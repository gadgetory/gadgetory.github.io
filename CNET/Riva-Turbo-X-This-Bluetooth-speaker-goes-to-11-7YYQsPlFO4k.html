is the turbo X a higher-end portable
Bluetooth speaker from newcomer Reva
audio it's one of the best sounding
portable speakers currently on the
market although it's pretty pricey at
$350 the speakers design is elegant and
straightforward but from the outside
anyway it doesn't scream premium speaker
that said it is splash proof thanks to a
hidden rubber gasket on the bottom of
the speaker that you can pull off and
use to cover the ports on the back of
the speaker it also has some nice bonus
extras there's a proximity sensor that
allows you to wave your hand over the
speaker and have the sense touch buttons
on top the speaker light up which comes
in handy at night and a USB port on the
back allows you to charge your
smartphone or tablet
additionally the speaker's equipped with
a high-grade speaker phone it works well
and there's app tech streaming for
devices that support this feature apdex
is supposed to make bluetooth streaming
sound better but it's debatable how much
of an impact it makes but more and more
wireless speakers are offering it while
fairly compact the speaker weighs in it
3.5 pounds or 1.6 kilograms
it's got a lot inside as chassis and the
folks from Revit out it's 45 watts of
power and combination of three full
range proprietary drivers plus four
custom dual piston base radiators
battery life is rated at an impressive
twenty six hours and while the speaker
doesn't come with a carrying case you
can buy an optional one for $30 the
speaker has a fairly neutral well
balanced sound profile and as I said it
sounds really good for what it is and
shines compared to the competition at
higher volumes most compact bluetooth
speakers perform well at lower and mid
level lines but when you crank things up
the speaker restrains itself to keep
from distorting and certain frequencies
particularly the bass tend to get
clipped not so with the turbo X it can
play very loud and manage to sound full
and retain good definition with minimal
Distortion even when you crank it to 11
that's right in a nod to spinal tap you
can use Rivas free ground control app
for iOS and Android to engage the turbo
mode
and take the volume 211 giving you an
additional seven decibels of sound it's
a bit of a gimmick but hey the Bluetooth
speaker market is crowded and at least
the Riva manages to stand out from the
pack a bit I just wish it cost a little
less I'm David Conroy
that's the Revo turbo X thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
