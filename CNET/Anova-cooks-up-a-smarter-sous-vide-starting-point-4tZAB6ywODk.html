back in the kitchen with the Nova to
test out the second generation a nova
precision cooker this is an immersion
circulator that offers sous-vide cooking
shops for at affordable $179 a much
better price than you might get from an
all-in-one water bath or even some other
emergency relators that cost a little
more we did all the usual tests with
this one eggs and poached salmon the one
that really jumped out was our flank
steak test we took a nice tasty but
tough cut a flank steak and cooked it in
here for 24 hours and man did that come
out fantastic the meat was tender and
juicy it sliced like roast beef tasted
amazing very happy with that result
this one also adds in bluetooth cooking
smarts so you've got a Bluetooth radio
in this thing and a dedicated ANOVA app
pull the app up and you can control the
device remotely setting the timer
setting the temperature and also looking
through a catalog of recipes if you see
one that you like you can hit start and
send those settings straight to the
machine so for instance if I wanted to
make this salmon recipe I've got my
vacuum filled salmon here I just find
salmon in the app look at all the
different recipes find one that looks
good
open it up and then hit that little
Start button and boom the Innova starts
cooking to that temperature and on that
timer now exciting as that might sound I
thought that the app controls were a
little clunky and the recipes were fine
about the same thing as you can find
online so it's not a huge deal I would
like those app smarts if they were Wi-Fi
enabled and not just bluetooth it only
has that 50 foot radius or so so I say
hold out for Wi-Fi cookers if you really
want that smart functionality both ANOVA
and anomic you have Wi-Fi pictures
coming out later this year but if all
you want is a simple sous-vide starting
point that's going to produce really
tasty food the Innova precision cooker
is a very safe bet thanks for watching
check out the rest of our smart home and
appliance reviews at cnet.com for seen
at appliances I'm right Chris
