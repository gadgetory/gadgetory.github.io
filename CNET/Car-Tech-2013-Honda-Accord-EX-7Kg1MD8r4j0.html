pretty much divvied up the broad boring
middle of the auto business and didn't
leave much to eat for anybody else now
they've got hungry new competitors
Ford's fusion Nissan Altima Chevy Malibu
Hyundai Sonata they all want something
to eat let's see if the new 2013 Honda
Accord can get it done as we check the
tech
I'll be honest when I went in to pick
this car down in the CNET garage I
couldn't find it for about a minute not
that it was hidden the garage was almost
empty but the car didn't stand out to me
it just looks like a car now the Accord
has gotten a lot of knocks for being
kind of bland for a long time but I must
say what they've done here if not
notable is at least more luxurious and
has more presence or gravitas in general
the dimensions on this car the exact
same width as the outgoing Accord two or
three inches shorter that's quite a bit
of a difference fifty to a hundred
pounds lighter and several mpg better
city and highway the first thing you
notice is beep or at least I did is
everything is really substantial it's
really grown up into a grown-up's car
everything is sort of you know maturely
elegant another thing I noticed a lot of
you have asked about is how's the
Headroom this car actually has I think
almost two inches less measured Headroom
than the outgoing 2012 but I don't feel
it in fact when I got in this car I
thought it had amazing headin all the
cords now have that eight inch screen
they call it the Honda imid they've done
this in various cars this is the most
elaborate version yet its standard as a
way to get to things like media and also
see some of your driving statistics or
if you want for some reason just put the
clock up there your main function is
going to be audio you can option this
guy up into nav but to do that you've
got to go to a higher trim level the EXL
and above have nav so now is not so much
an option as it is a trim level feature
spec by the way if you get nav this
whole button panel here gets replaced
with a touchscreen control panel it's a
little bit overkill from what I've seen
I haven't driven the car equipped that
way yet so I'll hold off judgment for
the e.x trim which you're likely to buy
this is what you've got these buttons
here you have a turn and a push to enter
on this guy
there's no jog wheel because there's
nowhere to jog you just rotate to go to
places all the cords have a rear camera
to go with the fact that all the cords
have that big screen it's relatively
advanced
you've got trajectory and distance in
there if you get a higher trim Accord
you also get multi angle views now on
the theme of driver assistance you can
also get forward collision warning on
this car that's packaged in with
adaptive cruise control they use the
same technology you can get a lane
departure warning system as well but
even our e^x has this interesting
technology check it out I do a
right-hand turn signal and the camera on
the right wing mirror comes on this is
their version of blind spot tech as
opposed to radar that warns you that
something's back there they just show
you what's back there through that
camera on the other hand it can be a
little disorienting think about it I'm
looking at that screen looking forward
to see what's behind me and on the left
side of the screen is what's on the
right side of the car beyond that there
are no major surprises am/fm no HD radio
at this trim level your CD is this slot
right here still in there we're about a
year or two away from cars starting to
drop that thing entirely auxilary brings
you a number of interesting choices
you've got Pandora I've got the app on
here it locks out the phone screen and
then puts it all there with good tagging
a little slow to respond I fine
bluetooth streaming was a little dicey
to pair and I am almost never getting
meta tags from at least my Droid 4 with
Android 4.0 4 put a USB stick in or an
iPod you get much better results in
terms of how quickly things come up as
well as the tag information reporting
the phone interface is really big nice
and clear and response is nice and quick
as well my gripe with it is a lot of the
options you want to use lock out when
you're moving for example when I'm
driving the phone book on the screen
cannot be accessed by any of these
control same thing goes for the dial pad
all new Accords have text message
support they'll read incoming messages
to you when you're moving or let you
reply with a canned response but no
freeform text entry transmission on this
car 6-speed manual bass up from a
five-speed bass in the last year's model
but we have what will be much more
common the CVT not a true cog automatic
but a continuously variable transmission
now up front we've got a rather
radically new engine for Honda this is a
direct injection in line for the DI
technology makes quite a difference and
we'll see that on the road as well it's
got the unfortunate name of Earth Dreams
the hell does that mean direct injection
2.4 liter and the usual IV tech variable
valve timing tech the numbers 185
horsepower on this car 181 foot-pounds
of torque pretty good from what is a
pretty big inline 4 zero to 16 about
seven point six seconds that's a lot
faster than the last Accord or down to
six point eight if you get the manual
the CVT is a little slower 33 36 is the
kerb weight on this guy so it's a fairly
substantial car but not portly and we're
also looking at 27 36 as the mpg several
better than the outgoing Accord on both
counts okay now drive in the Accord the
first thing I want to determine is that
CVT that continuously variable
transmission how variable is it this one
does not suffer that issue to any
significant degree it does tend to get
caught up in high ratio which is the
equivalent of seeking a top gear all the
time but what car today doesn't so
you've got to coax it out of its slumber
to get some good response the sport mode
down here helps that and then you're
struck by how much really good power
there is from this four-cylinder engine
and four cylinders get a knock in larger
cars like this but this one's got good
power especially when you really get
into it and realize wow there's a nice
smooth powerful engine up there the
handling is actually quite good on this
car it's never gets into that feeling of
tub enos or feeling as if it's starting
to really yaw over one way or the other
they've gone to arguably cheaper and
simpler McPherson strut in the front end
for this new generation but the ride
quality and handling are good it's a
it's a a non fatiguing car to drive
which i think is one of the great
attributes of a car in this category in
general this new Accord is a nice place
to sit while driving and it's got a more
modern crisper feel to the inside now
than the past Accords that were pretty
generic inside
okay let's price this 2013 Accord e^x
seen that style which is a little tough
because the e^x doesn't really go seen
that style you can't option up much as I
mentioned that said 25 4 is your base
with delivery ad 800 bucks for a CVT
which most buyers are going to get so
we're at 26 - and that's about as far as
you can go another 500 gets you back up
bumper sensors but you've got a standard
camera who cares
now the key for the C net user is to go
one notch higher to an e XL that unlocks
navigation that unique second
touchscreen and a variety of the
advanced audio options but no matter
what Accord you by Honda still remains a
step behind the industry in terms of
connected services like Google
integration and true app support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
