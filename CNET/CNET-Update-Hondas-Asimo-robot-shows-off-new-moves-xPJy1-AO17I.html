of tea while hopping on one foot I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update the International Auto Show is in
New York and car makers are flaunting
more than vehicles Honda demonstrated
the new moves for ASIMO it's the
humanoid robot that was first introduced
to the world nearly 14 years ago our
little buddy is a little more smooth
these days he can seamlessly transition
from walking to running and approach
stairs and climb with little delay now
that he's a teenager it seems that he's
taken a liking to kicking around a
soccer ball and getting it airborne
he's also mastered hopping on one foot
and keeping his balance while doing so
Honda engineers also showed off awesome
OHS hand dexterity and how he can
communicate in both American and
Japanese sign language he's also been
practicing his serving skills able to
unscrew the top of a thermos and pour
juice into a paper cup
ASIMO is designed to be cute so you
don't fear a future robot uprising
behind his tinted face shield there's a
little smile edged into his plastic head
he's not too tall to intimidate you and
he's programmed with friendly gestures
he even has a pretty good handshake
awesome Ozen goal is to be a robot that
could assist people in the home also
know someday in the future can be the
arms eyes hands and legs for all kinds
of people in need elderly people or
people who have learned in mobility will
really be helped that may remind you of
the 2012 movie robot and Frank where a
robot is a living assistant for a man
with dementia but there's still a long
way to go before awesomo is at that
level everything in our demo was
pre-programmed awesomo had to learn the
layout of the stage before his
performance and when it comes to
communication skills we didn't get to
see how he responds to voice commands
awesome most chief engineer explained
that back in Japan the robot is able to
understand when different people ask for
different drinks to be served
distinguishing between faces and voices
he
also smart enough to not listen to
strangers but how long will it be until
ASIMO can understand our natural speech
just like the technology in our
smartphones well ASIMO ever hook up with
Siri or Cortana I'll suppose in it it's
not going to hook up with anybody
okay so awesomo doesn't have a date yet
with a sassy smartphone voice but for
its next trick engineers wants to train
ASIMO to be able to walk alongside a
human and match their speed or learn to
carry something for a human in the
meantime he's not too shabby of a dance
partner that's your tech news update
