they packed the power of an ultrabook in
the body of a tablet unfortunately they
also made the device nearly impossible
for an end-user or even an in-house tech
to service and repair I'm Bill Detweiler
and this is cracking open from a
hardware standpoint Microsoft's surface
pro is more like an ultrabook or
convertible laptop than a tablet the ten
point six inch display has a true 16 by
9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 1920
by 1080 it has stereo speakers a micro
SD card slot a full size USB 3 port a
mini DisplayPort and to 720p cameras on
the inside it has a 1.7 gigahertz Intel
Core i5 CPU with HD 4000 graphics 4 gigs
of 1600 megahertz ddr3 RAM and a 42 watt
hour battery the surface pro comes in 64
and 128 gig models and I strongly
recommend getting the larger one in a
statement to see net Microsoft said that
out of the box the 64 gig pro only has
23 gigs of available storage now given
its laptop like hardware it's not
surprising that the surface way is a
hefty 2 pounds which is significantly
more than other tablets like the surface
RT
the pro is well built and feels sturdy
in your hands unfortunately it's also
much more difficult to disassemble and
service as with the RT the first step in
cracking open the surface probe is
removing the kickstand
but unlike the RT the pro has no
external screws to get inside this
tablet will need to break out the heat
gun now as several ribbon cables run
along the lower edge will need to start
at the panel's upper left corner and
work our way around removing the front
panel is a slow tedious process but if
you rush you risk damaging the tablet
after disconnecting all its cables you
can set the front panel and LCD assembly
aside
and begin removing the internal
components now like the RT the surface
pro is filled with screws and they range
in size from Torx t2 to t5 i recommend
cataloguing the location of the screws
as you remove them now the first
component to come out is the bezel that
runs along the tablets outer edge and
houses the front-facing camera next are
a pair of metal plates that run along
each side followed by the headphone jack
and volume button assembly the
motherboard and cooling assembly is next
but first we'll need to detach all its
cables and remove more screws with the
board out we can remove the machines
twin fans and cooling assembly as well
as the SSD card and the board's metal
shields now given the surface Pro's core
i5 CPU it's not surprising that the
mainboard looks more like that of an
ultrabook rather than a traditional
tablet at this point our teardown is
pretty much complete like the surface RT
the LCD and front glass panel are
basically fused together and separating
them isn't practical the battery is held
to the back cover with a lot of adhesive
and there's nothing under it so I'm just
going to leave it in place likewise I'm
leaving the speakers keyboard connector
power connector rear camera and
microphone attached to the back cover
there easy to remove but clearly visible
while still in place after cracking open
the consumer targeted surface RT I hoped
that Microsoft would make the more
business targeted and nearly twice as
expensive surface pro easier to
disassemble in service but they didn't
in fact they took one of the worst
tablet design elements a glued on front
panel and married it with one of the
worst laptop elements and overabundance
of screws there's no denying that
Microsoft is making a bold effort to
bridge the gap between tablets and
laptops but as Jason Heine wrote in his
TechRepublic review the surface pro
doesn't quite stand out enough at either
function for more information on the
surface pro
including real-world tests and pricing

analysis go to TechRepublic comm forward
slash cracking over I'm Bill Detweiler
