first time the next advancement in OLED
technology the LG signature OLED g6
television this top-of-the-line OLED
embodies the very best in TV innovation
first let's look at the design it's
designed with one principle in mind and
that is eliminate the unnecessary we've
streamlined every element to focus only
on those essential to delivering the
best picture and sound quality
experience LG signature delivers a
perfect picture of Ola TV on an elegant
glass body quite literally ladies and
gentlemen it's a picture on glass the
stunningly slim OLED panel is attached
to a glass sheet meaning that the panel
measures a never before achieved 2.57
millimeters ladies and gentlemen that
makes this unit as thin as just four
stacked credit cards there's nothing at
all
and of course this unique design is only
possible with all Ed's revolutionary
self lighting technology which of course
requires no backlighting unit however as
TVs got slimmer TV manufacturers faced a
new challenge sound quality and at LG as
usual we refuse to compromise the LG
signature OLED television integrates a
powerful speaker system that also
functions as a stand pointing the sound
directly at the viewers the speakers
produce a clean detailed audio without
distortion or reflection and this unique
stand integrates the speakers and also
features extra woofers to booster the
power and by the way the speaker system
itself can also fold cleanly behind the
glass back for a seamless wall mount and
with all the TV circuitry repositioned
within the stand the slim glass case
which covers 80% of the TV's backside
can also be used to display artwork
making this signature OLED television
a work of art in itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
