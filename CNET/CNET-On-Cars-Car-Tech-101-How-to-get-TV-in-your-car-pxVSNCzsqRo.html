rabbit ears clipped on it Mercury even
offered a backseat TV accessory in the
late 64 the most part TV in the car has
been a fuzzy picture not for a lack of
trying
there was media flow a qualcomm
technology that set out 16 channels of
cable and network TV by a special slice
of airwaves served up from a broadcast
tower but typically received by a mobile
device with a special decoder chip in it
it flopped went away in 2011 local
broadcasters have been uniting behind
mobile DTV the future of TV is now it's
what you want when and where you want it
it's called mobile digital television a
version of digital local television
broadcasts but which are coded and
signaled in a way that makes them
receivable by a moving target bring your
television with you with dial a
derivative of that is dial which is
backed by NBC and Fox dial turned your
smartphone or tablet into a portable TV
that means you can watch theirs and a
few other local stations along with most
Fox and NBC sports broadcasts but not
the NFL which doesn't play ball yet
however none of dials products or
adapters are actually car specific there
are however some off-brand car centric
mobile DTV receiver boxes out there that
you can wire into your car and connect
permanently to the monitors in your
vehicle to get a similar line up of
local channels know so far that all
these implementations of mobile local
digital television are standard def not
high def and not every market or even
all the stations in a market are
broadcasting this way if you're a
DirecTV subscriber there's actually a
dish for your car kvh has something
called the track vision a7 it's about 33
inches across it roofs mounts the harder
problem to solve has apparently been the
price still lingers at about three
thousand dollars plus not including the
DirecTV subscription it needs
back in August Oh seven serious began
offering backseat TV a TV service via
their radio satellite it has a mere
three kids channels on it for an extra
seven bucks a month plus the cost of
installation kit it's still out there
but Chrysler has stopped officially
offering that's where we tried it on a
ram pickup a few years ago the next
evolution in the US may be what's called
ATSC 3.0 that's the next version of
digital TV broadcasting in the US which
is expected to have strong mobile
reception technology built in but it's a
few years from implementation LTE stands
for long term evolution others are
watching a new form of 4G called LTE
broadcast which would create a new layer
of the 4G signal coming off the cellular
tower but dedicated to sending out TV
signals as a data stream though not
using your personal accounts 4G data
allotment nokia just started trialing
this in Munich the big question of
course is whether mobile DTV will even
have relevance in a world rapidly moving
to all kinds of internet-based Digital
on-demand streaming including the
content we know as TV just without the
platform we know as TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
