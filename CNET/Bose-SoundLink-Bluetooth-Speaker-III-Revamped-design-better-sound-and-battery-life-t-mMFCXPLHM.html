Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker 3 this
is the successor to the popular bose
sound like - and it is a very
similar-looking speaker but it does have
some key differences it's slightly wider
and it also doesn't have the cover that
the previous model had this is a
straight naked speaker you can get
covers for it those are optional
accessories that retail for 3495 and
they come in a variety of colors but it
is a better sounding speaker it does
deliver bigger sound a little bit more
bass a little bit more clarity so this
is a very good sounding compact
bluetooth speaker Bose really did a
great job with the previous version and
this model is that much better this is a
$300 speaker so it's not cheap and Bose
also has the Soundlink mini this does
deliver more sound than the bose sound
like many but that is a very small
bluetooth speaker this also one of the
key differences here is that it offers
much better battery life from the
previous version it's up to 14 hours the
previous version only got more like 6
hours
one thing to say about this is it really
not a feature-rich bluetooth speaker a
lot of other speakers have extras like a
speakerphone bose has continued to leave
off that speakerphone functionality
there's nothing like app tech support
for devices that offer that that's
supposed to make Bluetooth sound a
little bit better doesn't make a big
difference in speakers this small and
there's no NFC pairing that's the tap to
pair feature with devices that support
it another small feature that some
people like is a pause play button on
the device itself this does not have it
does have volume controls a mute button
and there is an auxiliary input as well
as a micro USB port that is for firmware
upgrades only that's not for charging
you do have a separate charger here it
does require a separate charger after my
listening test I was impressed Bose has
definitely up the sound quality here it
may not have added any new features but
this is definitely a better sounding
speaker for the same amount of money and
it
have battery battery life I'm David Carr
toy and it's the Bose Soundlink
Bluetooth 3 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
