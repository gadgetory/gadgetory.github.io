overview screen we also have navigation
communication media and car wraps and
what you're seeing at the moment are
contextually relevant suggestions in
this case we have a navigation card so
eight minutes to home Sally so a recent
phone call that I received and these are
all just presented to me when I connect
the phone so this is google play music
if i could play
you'll see the media coming through the
car speaker system and all the controls
that I would expect to to see from
google play music here I have an
overflow screen so things like thumbs-up
thumbs-down start radio things that I
would typically be able to do in google
play music on any of my devices one of
the things we're really excited by is
all of the party apps that we've got so
everything you see on this menu here are
actually apps that are installed on my
phone right now so as I scroll through i
could pick from any of these and what
you'll see is that these applications
actually have customized you is so if i
look at say joyride I'll see a very
different menu to what we just saw in
google play music but it's really easy
for the developer to do this so they get
control of things like the color the
iconography the menu structure to
provide an experience that's really like
their app but when in the car and if we
look at phone you can see here people
that I've recently called or received
calls from can place calls to them
really easily so I can tap this person
to place a phone call so obviously
you're in a car you want to go somewhere
in this car this button on the steering
wheel to activate the microphone so if I
tap there's navigate to alamo square
so without having to think about where
I'm going very much I can simply tell
the cow where I want to go now what you
can see over on the left is a card
showing you the next turn you're going
to make so not only can we say that you
should turn right and point to the mail
but we can actually tell you you can use
any of the three rightmost lanes so we
launched lane gardens recently in google
maps navigation and we brought that to
android order we take a look at the rest
of Google Maps what we've done is taken
aspects of the product that make it
really easy to use and brought them to
the car so for example under suggestions
I can see things like home will work
which I can just get to really easily
businesses i might have searched for and
interacted with recently in maps i can
also pull up categories for example
places i might want to park or get gas
which is really easy to do while you're
in the car and then finally we can turn
road traffic on or off for the entire
system and then if you're parked and
safe to do so you can pull the keyboard
up and start typing just as you would on
a mobile phone so I could start typing
it's a photo head to the airport and you
see a suggestion can appear and then you
can navigate there and of course I can
say anything that I would to google so i
can press the button find starbucks
seven mile and then I can see those in
google maps in ever get there really
easily so if i receive the text message
while i'm driving i'll get one of those
heads up notifications at the top the
message gets read out i can tap the
microphone button and then say reply
it's up to the car manufacturer is how
they want to hook up the controls on the
steering wheel begin to the car system
so in this particular car the the
microphone button is hooked up which
uses the cars microphone but you could
have other cars with different controls
that control different aspects of the
product and from a developer's point of
view it's really a great thing because
when i build a music app i don't have to
think does it have a touchscreen to have
a rotary dial does that have a d-pad i
can simply build the app once and not
have to worry too much about the
controls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
