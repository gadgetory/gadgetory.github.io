Consumer Electronics Show with rich
Archuleta the CEO of plastic logic which
unveiled its QE reader you guys have
been showing the technology underneath
it for a while but today you showed the
final design yeah today's our assignment
we've unveiled the whole product
including the user interface right the
products alpha name pricing and
availability and so basically it's a
touchscreen you use swipe gestures that
sort of thing yes yeah it's a full
touchscreen device is very uncluttered
by buttons were navigational directional
pads or anything like that we just have
one capacitive button up at the top here
which is used as a homepage everything
else is done by swipes and taps on the
streets and using it with on-screen
controls for better or worse I think the
thing that's going to catch people's eye
most is going to be the price tag 649
for the version without 3g 799 for the
version with 3g obviously at that price
you know it's certainly people are going
to have to factor in do I want a new
laptop that's sort of thing how are you
guys going to address the price issue
well we think this that we think the
pricing works for the customers that
we're targeting it fits really well
within the ecosystem and device devices
that they use for their personal network
information so between a laptop and a
smartphone this device you know kind of
fills a gap where people print and
essentially now they can get rid of all
the things that they print I don't we
think it will be on the market in a
frontal be on the market and eight-ball
shipping in April and you can actually
place pre-orders right now at Q duck
face right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
