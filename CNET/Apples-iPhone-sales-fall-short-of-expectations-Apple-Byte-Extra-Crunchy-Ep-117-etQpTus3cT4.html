Steven Beach a producer of the Apple
byte extra crunchy podcast with your
host mr. Brian Tom what's up everybody
welcome to the show it is Apple byte
extra crunchy extra Munchie episode 117
can you believe that beach 117 that's a
lot man yeah we're back in the flow now
we took a little break we came back last
week so we're back at it again beach and
tong again this show is all about you
just as much as it is about all the
stuff we talked about so call us at
Dean Apple because of the iPhone 10
craze again this is what they were
expecting initially to sell 80 point 2
million units they actually sold 77
point three so they did not really
measure up to what people were hoping or
expecting from a sales standpoint of
iPhones now there's other interesting
tidbits in here the average price
selling price of an iPhone just any
iPhone because they don't break these
down specifically by model was seven
hundred and ninety six dollars per phone
which would definitely indicate that the
iPhone 10 and iPhone eight had something
to do with this but really more the
iPhone tend to bump up we have lower
selling iPhones that are selling around
you know five hundred dollars or so so
that helped to bump up the average
selling price but when you look at this
in the big picture bottom line Apple
sold less iPhones than they were
expected to and that's not a good thing
right this is their bread and butter
well we'll visit that topic back in a
second but let's talk about other
information iPad sales were thirty
thirteen sorry thirteen point two
million units that's up just point 1
million from last year's quarter so
again that's this is for October through
December 2017 compared to October
through December of 2016
Mac sales what do you think of each you
think they went up or they went down
from lashing I think they went down you
are correct sir because of the the whole
little touch screen thingy that no one
really was into and also the iMac Pro it
did come late to the game it came out
pretty much like late mid to late
December so it wasn't gonna be that
impactful it also is really expensive
the Mac sales were five point 1 million
this year in the fourth quarter compared
to five point four million last year so
they took a little dip there as well the
other big story here is when you talk
about Apple gives estimates of how they
they want to kind of tell Wall Street
how they oh they'll be performing next
quarter when I say next quarter this
would be the period from January to
March of 2018 their guidance is between
sixty and sixty two billion dollars Wall
Street expected it to be something
closer to sixty five point seven
66 billion dollars so Apple does like to
be kind of set their expectations lower
but in this case it was the iPhone that
perform lowering again there's a lot of
other evidence that is leading us to
believe that the iPhone 10 isn't selling
as well as Apple hoped for as well as
analysts hope for and I think the first
thing we can talk about numbers all we
want but I would just say anecdotally
Beach I know that typically when a new
iPhone came out most people were like
I'm gonna upgrade to the iPhone 10 like
the the highest-level model that's the
one I want but this is the year where I
had plenty of people who asked me what
should I do and I asked him what do you
want in your phone and they told me and
I said you should you should honestly
get an iPhone 8 right based on what they
wanted from their phone and not only
that even like my you know the tech guys
my friends that they may not be they may
not be the type of people that have to
buy the latest phone because most of
people listening here were fans of
technology and someone's like we got to
get the newest thing but I think a lot
of those people were like I'm ok right
now or I'm not gonna get the 10 right
now because it is still Apple's real
like cotton in my opinion it's still a
nice phone it has its flaws obviously
we've talked about them a bunch but to
me it's still their concept car phone
like it still has to get it still needs
like an extra level of polish for me to
be like that's a fine tuned Apple
product that's a good way to put it
their concept car phone it's like it is
yeah it's like it almost like they're
testing it on on us you know like
they're they're just running drive tests
on us to see how face ID works and all
the new technology works so that's a
very good thing kit has to do with the
price too I mean
Oh $1,000 is sticker shock for a lot of
people and I think that was a big
turn-off you know yeah I mean I've
totally forgot to mention that the price
point does have a bit to do about it I I
think also media may mainstream media
made the $1000 price point a bigger deal
than it really is when you compare
things like a Samsung Note 8 and Samsung
Note 8 is I think around 900 950 dollars
Apple iPhones the
is model with the top storage has hit
basically $1000 already but they weren't
reporting about it then right yeah so I
think that that kind of also tainted
maybe house how some people felt about
it but again dropping a thousand dollars
before any Apple care before any
expansion tweaks that's still a lot of
money it's a gang the grits a bag that's
a bag that is a bag so right now we're
we're at Apple didn't really outperform
estimates specifically with iPhone sales
it's something to keep an eye on we have
heard plenty of rumors I'm gonna kind of
jump around but we will keep talking
about iPhone stuff there's a report by
The Wall Street Journal just earlier
this week that Apple is cutting their
production of iPhones in half for the
first three months of 2018 so originally
that expected to build out 40 million
additional iPhone 10 units well that
number according to them was slashed to
20 million units and then on top of that
they say that based on their supply
chain sources they're throttling down
component parts orders by sixty percent
so you can see this is we know over the
lifetime of a phone they will throttle
down orders but to do that so
dramatically three months after you know
I guess you could say yeah roughly you
know three months in that that's
actually that's actually a bigger deal
then than you think it's a little
concerning but again when I said this is
Apple's baby this is Apple's concept-car
look they're sitting on now after these
earnings their cash reserves are now at
two hundred eighty five billion dollars
they're just sitting cash apple's gonna
make sure that this product is going to
succeed and they will just wait it out
and they are going to throw cash at it
to make sure like the iPhone isn't sorry
news flash the iPhone isn't gonna fail
anytime soon right that look they're
still selling 77 million units yeah but
does Apple want to see a decline no but
also we've talked about this for years
like this kind of pullback what more can
you do in a phone what more value is
there and
each you've said perfectly a thousand
bucks look to make a $200 jump from the
eight to the ten the compelling reasons
they gave us were an emojis a better
selfie cam and then face things ie yeah
bitch and we'll have calls people that
are for it and that are lukewarm and
people that are totally all about it but
that's not worth $200 for most people
yeah and and I feel bad for all the
developers you know and other people who
make like the little component parts for
the phone because if Apple's cutting all
that all those people are taking a hit
too and that's like a long chain of
companies that's a lot of companies OLED
screens
you know chips and everything that goes
into the phone so yeah that's a big deal
when Apple sing they're gonna cut half
of their production you know so these
are things just to keep your eye on I'm
not saying it's a failure but it is it
did at least disappoint to a certain
degree the other thing though the really
the biggest news that came this week iOS
12 feature delays did you hear about
this Beach I did yeah a little bit I've
been reading about a little bit here so
here's the story broken by Axios from
inna freed formerly of CNET in the past
and basically inna reported the scoop
that Apple will be Delaine iOS features
to focus on reliability and performance
and when I hear that headline I think
two things I think that's a good idea
yes but I also think it's like we've
talked about this and I'm not gonna beat
everyone down with this but it is
relevant for today's show again this is
the new Apple this is a different Apple
that remember in the past when Apple
used to be able to innovate and deliver
on time yeah that is not that is not
them that's not in their DNA anymore
it's just not this is an admission of
guilt sort of in a way here I mean like
they're admitting like yeah we have
we've been putting out stuff that's
substandard so we want to take a little
more time to make sure we get it right
and again think about iOS 11 has been a
disaster from a bug standpoint from a
patch that remember there it was
probably about a six-week span where
every week there was a new update
the update to the update of the update
lay and I'm not even over exaggerating
there were actually two more updates in
that update to the update update that we
updated you know what they need to do
this and I think this is a good move to
get it right they're kind of getting
getting ahead of everyone saying hey
guess what
iOS 12 we're not gonna bring all the
features we expected to but we want a
fine tune and tweak it it reminds me a
little bit of when Apple did a Snow
Leopard for Mac OS 10
remember Apple had the cat series of
operating systems they had leopard and
the next year they're like Snow Leopard
is gonna be a refinement and it really
was I remember it optimized like file
space it was faster it was snappy was
cleaner the thing is that they had made
that kind of known very early so I feel
like and the other issues that it wasn't
like leopard was a disaster of an
operating system Snow Leopard just
fine-tuned it and so here is a little
different where iOS 11 was pretty dang
crappy and iOS 12 is going to hopefully
fine-tune and not from an aesthetic
purpose but just from a bugs efficiency
snappiness we will though still see some
of the features that they were expecting
to put in so what happened here is when
we talk about features in iOS 12 coming
up some of them won't make the cut so we
know that bloomberg reported earlier how
one of Apple's kind of grand plans or
grand visions is to bring Mac OS and iOS
apps together where you could build kind
of a universal app that would work on
both a touch device and a keyboard and
mouse device that that is still going to
be the case so that's good but the other
thing that happened is these are
Bloomberg kind of dug into some of the
features that they know about that will
not be making the cut one of the things
was an augmented reality multiplayer
mode that was being reportedly worked on
with iOS 12 um the biggest thing a
redesigned home screen app grid so kind
of a new layout and a new home screen
that was expected to come out in iOS 12
but it looks like there
that on the back burner there's some new
file management apps and business user
enhancements that they're working on but
overall another thing that they talked
about is even a new kind of app with
photo or feature to the Photos app to
help you reorganize and a more easily
organize your photos some of these
things just aren't gonna show up in iOS
12 now because they're working on
optimizing in again when I hear some of
those features I'm like yeah it's like
FaceTime improvement we haven't seen
multi-user FaceTime for god knows how I
think I think the iPhone 4 might have
been when FaceTime came out and we
haven't literally like I would love to
do a multi-person chat on FaceTime still
has it would be awesome there are like
little tiny bit tiny FaceTime things or
you can kind of move to screen like the
little box around resize and stuff but
yeah nothing major and the things that
you just said don't they're not like
exciting they're gonna redesign how we
organize our photos like I feel like
they already did that and they made it
more confusing and that process memories
I'm down with memories bro cool but
memories gotten keep man memories get
you sometimes I'm serious
oh dude my way more and in the Google
memories but they were doing it first
before the Apple memories I guess like
gee that's a that's a that's a dirty
word here totally nothing else exists
Apple had the FIR Apple did actually
bring the first voice assistant to the
phone they just felt way behind yeah hey
but when is iOS 12 is there any
indication when that is gonna come out
or has there been any any words about
that from a challenger standpoint
they'll announce it at WWDC they'll show
off some the features and then we'll see
it typically by September of 2018 but
remember also at WWDC last year they
announced it-- messages iCloud syncing
and airplay to neither of those have
I'm out yet it's been eight months since
they were announces key tentpole
features and airplay - still isn't here
and that is what gives the home pot its
ability to use multi room sound or
actually be able to use two of them in
stereo as a stereo speakers so that's
still not here yet
get on that but anyways I always told
delays I don't know what you guys think
about this we know this is the new Apple
but if you if you guys and gals want to
call this one 800 number cuz it always
slips on my six one six two six two
eight we want to hear I want to hear
your thoughts on this new Apple that we
talked about are you okay with it are
you not okay with it are you just such a
super fan that you're like you know what
just get it right cuz I'm all about
getting it right but I I'm getting a
point where I'm kind of getting sick of
saying just get it right just
I think the shareholders right now are
not happy well though they can put a
little pressure the other story is that
came out from Bloomberg was about a
government probe coming at Apple
specifically about the iPhone to the
Department of Justice is one of them
that's involved as um it's sorry about
that Department justice and the
Securities Exchange Commission they are
involved in investigating whether or not
Apple really deceived consumers with
their power management features that
they decided to implement in slower to
slow down older iPhones nothing is
happening right now let's just be honest
about that but Apple also came out and
admitted yes there are government
entities that are looking into what had
happened they're receiving questions
from them and they are responding to
them here's here's the I also enjoyed
this statement from Apple specifically
they say as we told our customers in
December we have never and would never
do anything to intentionally shorten the
life of any Apple product or degrade the
user experience to drive customer
upgrades our goal has always been to
create products that our customers love
making iPhones last as long as possible
is an
part of that and I mean I think that's a
nice way to put it but they would have
never came out and said this if they
were never caught doing it right yeah
they literally they they only came out
we talked about this so there's
something there
will will they say okay you know I know
and I know Apple try to get ahead of it
they are addressing the issue now they
are offering a battery replacement
program which is not the easiest to get
fulfilled for the record people have had
issues going to stores to make an
appointment to replace their battery and
guess what Apple says oh we don't have a
battery for your phone Wow so you know
it would be better if you scheduled it
right and then hopefully they have a
battery on hand when you get there but
they're building yeah they're building
in a new feature into that kind of
system I I recall right I think they're
testing it down in Canada right now but
I know that they're rolling out a new
feature to basically get a battery in
place specifically for you for your
phone because you've got to imagine and
know that everyone went to Apple stores
after they heard about the iPhone
throttling issue with the batteries I'm
gonna try this Brian I'm gonna try going
through this process I'm gonna save this
blog post here I'm gonna try this and
then I'll report back until everyone how
my you know how my whole thing went down
so yeah I want to get a new battery for
my iPhone 6 that's for sure you need you
Nate you need to um you can go to Apple
support page basically if you type in
iPhone battery replacement the article
that brings you through the steps to do
it I'm able failable there so we'll see
we'll see what happens to this
investigation nothing is eminent
honestly I think it's just gonna be like
they'll get a slap in the wrist but
there are people that were actually
filing like class-action lawsuits
against Apple oh yeah sure you know
throughout there's several of them from
consumers throughout the US I don't know
if anyone's doing it outside of the US
but I definitely know that that's
happening so we'll see how that all
plays out but look at all these things
that we've been talking about it's just
it's not the brightest time for Apple
right now you know yeah they wish
honestly I know so bad they just wish
that they had a product right now that
could just kind of like distract
everyone from all the problems and
they're hoping the home pod might be it
but um let me talk about I need to
release the memo
Hey
release the memo Apple don't be so
political an apple boy
all right we're just playing with you
all we will continue on with the show
and let you know that today's episode is
unsullied by sponsorship oh this is we
can say whatever we want we can say
words like memo this show is sponsored
by cnet.com check it out make Sina make
Apple great again yeah all right another
cool story by the by our friends at
Bloomberg and Mark Kermit and their crew
have been literally working there but
over time Apple is working on a new trio
of Mac's for this year with custom code
processors or processors geez I can't
even talk that could launch sometime by
the end of this year now we know right
now - Mac's currently actually have
coprocessors coprocessors in them the
MacBook Pro with the touch bar kind of
the really probably probably one of the
biggest flops of a feature that I've
seen in an Apple product the touch bar
honestly it's I it drives me crazy to
this day anyways
the MacBook Pro with a touch bar and the
current iMac Pro are - Apple products
that actually have coprocessors the
MacBook Pro has a t1 coprocessor that
helps control the touch bar and you know
all those icons on the keyboard the t2
Mac coprocessor is in the iMac Pro that
handles the power management and
computer security no word yet though if
it turns the liquid metal and stabs you
I hope people have not but I hope
someone got that all right
it's gonna make me really sad and if it
wasn't funny just call us and let us
know I would have laughed more but I was
paying I was paying attention to the
link I was pulling up it wasn't really
funny it's more like a sneak attack
if you're cool with us you would totally
get that but if not it's like forget you
now Apple has been doing developing
processors for a while we know the a4
processor the very first Apple dedicated
built in-house processor for the iPhone
4 they've obviously evolved that all the
way through the iPad which may or may
not be a computer depending on who you
ask
that's right that's that's true but
anyways the report from Bloomberg and as
I've gone on a bunch of different teams
it says Apple's expecting to release
three new computers two of them are
expected to be laptops and one of them
is expected be an all new Mac desktop
that will use new Apple coprocessors
you've got to imagine they're gonna
follow kind of along the lines of what
is happening with the iMac pro from a
processing standpoint but if it's with
the laptop fine it could be a new new
evolved t1 processor for the touch bar
but I'm just like they need to bring out
at least at least bring haptic feedback
to that touch bar just something yeah
like I don't I have to look at that
touch bar and then tap it once just to
turn the volume up and down yeah I mean
I made a whole video about this with
Steve Shanklin and all his his gripes
about the touch bar maybe like six
months ago and there's a lot of them and
it was an interesting video so well you
know you should go back to I'm not gonna
throw him out on the bus but you should
go out back to Steve Jenkins initial
tweets when the touch bar came out he
was all over like white on rice and I
was like I'm like dude I haven't even
used it you haven't even used it that
thing is not gonna be that good it's
gonna drive you crazy
so three new Macs coming that could
launch by the end of this year with new
coprocessors all right we talked about
the product that Apple needs to like
distract everybody just like we need
another hit like don't talk about all
this iPhone mumbo jumbo we need a hit
Beechum what time do you what do you
think the wait time for a home pot is
right now oh man I hope like less than
two weeks less than two weeks
I hope okay what if I told you the home
pod still available
for February 9th delivery oh wow cool
both colors nice that's yeah next week
you might you might say that's nice but
I also think that's actually really bad
it's bad well the reason why it's bad is
Apple wants to sell these bad boys out
and I don't think that they've made tens
of millions of these by any stretch of
the imagination and to me honestly I
don't remember the last time an all new
product from Apple was still available
for pre-order with a delivery date of
the actual release date a week later
after its after its pre-order and I
think and I think that that that's
worrisome to Apple to like I know
there's people that are high on the home
pad hum poem pod like you know where we
stand with it it's a wait and see but
it's still available guys you just want
you can just go right online you could
buy for it's still gonna be available I
see your since so it's not sold out yet
this is what you're saying I was like I
wasn't half I was half paying attention
I'm sorry so usually you're running
you're running I'm looking for home pod
video to show for b-roll here I got I
found you a nice video of you here okay
but uh so so they're still available
they're not even close to being sold out
and you don't think they've made
millions so that's a bad sign that's a
bad apple well I'm not gonna give him a
bad apple until I review it I think it's
gonna sound really good again 3:49 guys
and gals 349 plus tax tax 349 yah yah
mahn all right Apple has confirmed on
their support their tech spec pages the
actual audio sources like this is the
first kind of official layout of all the
different audio sources that the home
pod will support to let everyone know
that is into this the Apple music
service home pod users can ask Siri to
play any of over 45 million songs
available on Apple music yes a
subscription is required and I
definitely think if you're an Apple fan
who has Apple music and you don't have a
home assistant I think you're the type
of person that it would be willing to
drop 3:49 for this that's
because you're literally like the ideal
like target for this it's not a lot of
people it's some people but it's not
like the tens of millions of people also
iTunes music so you can obviously play
any songs albums or audiobooks that
you've purchased from the iTunes Store
was much like I've pre-ordered the Black
Panther album produced by Kendrick Lamar
are you keen that that comes out on
February 9th iCloud music library so
home pod can also ask there to play any
songs that have been uploaded to a
user's iCloud music library
very good that it also includes you know
your iTunes Match subscription or CDs or
Apple music beats one home pod users can
ask them to play Apple's official radio
station podcast you can play any podcast
directly through Siri we'll see how well
that works because sometimes it it can
be it I've used voice assistance to try
and pull up podcast and it's not always
the easiest and then airplay we know
that natively the home pod will not
support any third party music services
so at least airplay will allow you to
use your phone to play Spotify or
Pandora or other apps like that to your
oh don't want it don't want it to ignore
title because people that are on title
like oh I think I think titled people
have might have a little complex with
title because it's like the service that
never gets mentioned yeah I don't think
title people title people like that yeah
I think jay-z is trying to sell it too
right it's been trying to solve for a
long was it long they were the first one
that that came out and said we're gonna
do like high-res files so I was stoked
on that but I signed up for like the
free free preview you know but then I
never and then I got the Rihanna album
which is cool but uh I never stuck with
it see you to me you're the ideal person
that title is trying to target and
you're like no I'm good bro yeah like
that's you know that that is an
indication of when like it just isn't
working right like look at how many
there's gonna be a lot of ideal
candidates for the home pop but I don't
think those ideal candidates are all
gonna pull the trigger on it it's not
gonna happen
Phil Schiller has some thoughts on the
I'm sorry I keep on calling all these
different things till Joe has his own
thoughts on the home pod this is what he
said to sound envision he believes that
apples in a position to create a new
kind of music experience that not only
sounds incredible but is also fun to
interact with he says that's the driving
force behind Apple's work on the smart
speaker he also said this quote we don't
think it's just about home pod though or
any one product it's about creating an
experience that moves with you
throughout the day
that's called marketing speed that's
just like listening to music that's not
even English yeah it's just like how are
you gonna innovate listening to music I
don't understand tomorrow the whole pod
man what you talking about the answer is
the whole pod that's what you've been
looking for that answer yeah I mean they
did it when they made the iPod you know
that was innovative like I have all my
albums and day in here but I don't know
how they're gonna do it with the home
pod Musa watching us on periscope psych
home pod is very bad alright YouTube TV
just some we have a few couple quick
hits before we wrap this thing up
YouTube TV's $35 per month klore
decoding service coming to Apple TV very
soon according to sources the source
would be David Katz mire of CNET so
another kind of TV streaming service for
you all if you want to jump on that
that's go on I'm honestly on the place
PSV you PlayStation View I love that
thing
I travel to TV for like a month and I
loved it I thought it was cool but I
just you know my cables already so has a
lot more you know so I stuff what
stations though are you stuck with on
your kit like because to me it's live
sports that really keeps you locked in
cable with others yeah that's it Golf
Channel
you know like YouTube TV doesn't have
CNN and my wife likes the home and what
is it home network you know like the
Home Improvement network there's a lot
of things a YouTube TV doesn't have but
the way it works is fantastic I mean
just chrome casting and stuff it's
fantastic but it's just fun it needs
more it just needs more channels more
content a little more meaning potatoes
yeah
yeah so this one is my five it pulled up
for you but I hope
you can find at beach it's the what's a
computer ad from Apple we told you right
when it came out like two months ago how
horrendous this commercial was because
it was classic Apple arrogance and it
was funny because someone from Business
Insider the gentleman's name is Dennis
green in January
late January decided to write an article
about how people were pissed off by the
sad and it's funny because then it kind
of surfaced the fact that yeah it made
light something we've been talking about
forever that how horrible and how cocky
that ad is like there's tweets
there's posts around it I don't know how
you guys and gals feel about it but it's
it's just an infuriating add of just
like the hipster so cocky and her
neighbor just nicely comes by and asks
her Oh what are you doing on your
computer she's like what's a computer
it's like I don't want to say I want to
slap that person wrong but I kind of do
it's just so wrong I haven't watched
this I need to watch it well you've
never seen you've never seen this
commercial I've seen just like the
little short ones it's playing on
Twitter a lot yeah and I you know I
never like turn on the sound or like sit
down to watch it but I keep saying a
swear she's going through the tunnel
yeah just just watch the entire ad for
me and then tell us how you feel next
week just what you're doing on your
computer
what's the computer
that is that is kind of infuriating
what's the computer it's you know what
this is this is a great this sets a
precedent for Apple the next time you
have a problem with your MacBook Pro
you're like dude my computer's not
working and the genius is gonna look you
dead in the eye and say what's a
computer this is a computer and and it's
gonna go down in the Genius Bar when
that happens
hey hey you want some good news you
wanna you know that Nintendo finally
decided to pay attention to me what four
or five years later Mario Kart tour they
announced on their Twitter account Mario
Kart Tour will be coming out for mobile
it's now development releasing sometime
in March of 2019 I know I got all I saw
that yesterday I got really excited I'm
like oh yes and then 2019 it's more than
that's a long ways away so it's like
it's like you guys are halfway there
they um their first mobile app it was
kind of like uh I don't I can't remember
exactly what it's called but it was
based like making like your own meet it
was at Mia
Meopta or something it was like you're
making your own avatar for a mobile
phone it was a stupidest they actually
just cancelled that app oh yeah they did
shut it down like the media me for me I
think you can't remember it wasn't me at
Omar so like I literally could care less
about it was that bad cuz I remember
when it came out I also complained put
out a damn game put out a classic game
on the phone yes hell for ten bucks
everyone's gonna buy that like Mario go
kicked ass man Mario go my kids still
love to play that that's fine yeah just
do it alright she does we got some
awesome calls we get to the phone calls
let's do it man thank you guys all for
calling let me put the phone number up
yes remember guys and gals boys and
girls children of all ages well at least
be semi age-appropriate a 1-866 two six
three eight that is the number to call
name where you're from and we had some
really good calls we honestly even some
of that we let some of these go long
because they were
good points but still just try to keep
it around a minute ish
it just helps okay all right
here we go one of them I'm gonna cut off
midway just just to warn you guys here
we go hey this is Brian from New Orleans
wanting to give my two cents on face
idea I've had my iphone intentions
launch day and I'm pretty used to face
ID it works I tell people probably like
eight out of ten times which isn't
terrible for new technology but I still
have multiple times throughout the day
where I'm having to tighten my passcode
in or it just kind of freezes well just
figuring out whether it's me or not
Brian it actually does work when I have
my toothbrush in my mouth so uh you know
there's a good Apple there quick fat
Apple real quick the fact that they took
away a lot of icons off that top bar on
the iPhone can actually bit me this week
I support iPhones for my business and
someone came to me talking about the
fact that their phone wasn't receiving
calls etc etc in the past would have
quickly looked at the you know
notification bar at the top and seeing
that the phone is and do not disturb
mode but when do not disturb most turned
on on the iPhone 10 the only way you
could figure it out of see there a go to
settings or be pull down control center
so took me a little bit longer to figure
out exactly what the problem was
ultimately I figured it out and kind of
felt stupid but I wish that they would
bring the little crescent moon back when
it was in do not disturb mode especially
since people at my business do it
accidentally all the time keep up the
good work thanks bye man Brian I would
like to know the model of toothbrush are
actually using so I can verify that I
have a electric toothbrush and maybe
that's the issue yeah someone tweeted at
us after the last show and said that if
you don't get into your face ID and
you're like at a weird angle or
something if you put in your code it
will it will record that angle or
something and so the next time like
maybe so if you're tried with your
toothbrush you don't get in then you put
in your code it'll let you in maybe next
time gonna let you in with the
toothbrush I mean I don't know it still
doesn't work with me when I
morning when I wake up I mean like
seriously like I'm like maybe it's cuz
my eyes are like even like you know more
closing you know whatever you must look
fugly like Brian ah now we're not gonna
unlock this phone no no I'm not gonna do
that
alright um but yeah good call I love it
let's move on this one I'm gonna cut off
Midway everybody so just keep that in
mind here we go
hey guys this is Adam from Utah just
finished listening to your most recent
episode and we're calling about face ID
and I've had the iPhone X since launch
day and honestly I've been pretty pretty
darn impressed with just how it's been
been working from my personal experience
even yesterday going skiing up in the
mountains you know I'd say 75% of the
time it would unlock when I've got my
goggles on or you know my helmet on
which I wouldn't be able to do with you
know glass with with gloves on or my
hands being wet and so honestly for me I
prefer face ID because each one has kind
of the time that it doesn't work but I
prefer the times that face ID does work
and I get it even when I'm lying in bed
you know on the side of my face it's
half covered up with my pillow you know
it doesn't walk but for me that I mean
that's that's the few times it doesn't
but here's the thing I think people
don't talk about I'm gonna get rid of
that guy you know I think yeah and he
makes good points who I think would I
realize can be frustrating it's not for
me but I always have to think like
outside of the Technorati or like the
tech world is imagine this like the
power before the power button was just
like the power button right but now the
power button is like Siri it's part of
screen capture it's part of turning your
phone off in combination with another
button it's it's like one button that
does like a bunch of different things
now and it it's just not as
quote-unquote user friendly as it used
to be yeah like what my lady she's like
how do i reset my phone I'm like I was
like trying to tell her from a distance
like what I'm like no
gotta hold these two and then just like
it took a screen shot I'm like no these
two it's like yeah man thing is having
to relearn behaviors it's hard you know
like we don't want to relearn behavior
we don't want to learn a new language of
how to write on your phone it's it's
like we got enough to deal with you know
that's how they're controlling us man
that's how they're controlling and they
have you know they have some analytics
on how people like type you know they
probably have some track they're
controlling us stop controlling us okay
all right got a couple more calls there
we go moving through yo beats and tong
glad you're back from the holidays man I
didn't have anything to listen to but
everybody comes to at work I always am
the first adopter of the new products
always get the newest phone got the air
pause love them but the home pod may be
where I part ways and the bottom line is
the cost entry is just getting
ridiculous
right when you've got Alexa or in
Google's platform it's fully integrated
into everything - it's all these devices
and they want another 350 just to get in
to that with Apple it just seems like
I'm starting to part ways so you know I
feel bad because you know I've been a
steering guy but Alexa has been my side
chick for a while and I think I'm liking
going that direction I just I just think
the cost of injury for the product
itself is just getting way too high
that's my two cents man or men suck you
guys later
keep doing good shows thanks dude he's
gonna he's moving in the direction of
the side chick I don't think he was
talking about Alexa either yeah you know
I do want to make a point that we did
have another caller it was just super
long but I didn't want to give him
credit he did call in and mention how
home kit was released first so Apple had
established the ecosystem first which is
true but they never actually turned it
into something that consumers could
latch on to early that's part of how
they fell behind but he did mention that
look you know if you have an Apple TV it
can be the hub but then I'm like well
not everyone
has an Apple TV and there are aspects of
it where you can control things remotely
that can be a little easier but I just
wanted to recognize his call because he
said that we are so harsh on um on home
pod and home kit that we don't give it
enough credit
so I I mean I'll give it credit for
coming out first but Apple just didn't
know what to do with it and why did
Amazon accelerate so fast even though
home kit was technically announced first
is because Amazon opened up their API to
let anyone jump on board third-party
companies people that are developing
apps and it became a thing because they
weren't so close minded about it when
Apple announced home kept they said like
they always do oh we'll make this
available to search specific partners
well that took forever to even happen
and then you just limit this you limit
this new thing and they've done this
every step of the way with home pot at
home kit it hurts the actual advancement
of the product so I think that's one of
the biggest things they had it they had
Siri they had home kit but because of
strategy-wise or what they were looking
at they were so focused on the phone is
it other companies like you know we're
gonna try something different and guess
what it worked so that that's on Apple
more than anyone else like they had all
the pieces in place quite honestly
you also mentioned like ease of use on
that apple homekit app and I haven't
really played with it a whole lot but I
am interested to play with it after that
because I do sometimes when I'm using a
lexan I use the Alexa app I'll run it
you know I got I kind of get lost in
there it it's not that intuitive to use
the Alexa app sometimes it's a little
difficult to like which room I'm am I in
or you know what am i listening to so I
don't know it's interfaces nicer because
it's like tile based and you can create
groups and you can do this with other
apps I think what it comes down to
though is even if the interface is
really easy the fact of the matter that
is I'll give them a credit for having an
easier interface but Amazon is better
because like I said it came out of the
gates it's more compatible it does more
things and it was ready to roll and
everyone was ready to accept it and now
everyone is on it so that's even with a
easy to use app doesn't necessarily mean
it's gonna be the the product that
people end up using
yeah all right we got a few more calls
let's get through them here you go hi
Brian Beach my name is Luke from
Australia big fan of the show I'm just
calling to serve as a warning to all
iCloud users I know that it should be
obvious to not trust cloud services
especially iCloud I stored over 200 gigs
of important data to iCloud and what
happened was the drive ran out of
storage so I upgraded the space but it
was already too late the drive stopped
working and at first I thought it was
just a little too one machine but this
has actually happened to I can't drive
on the server and so now I can no longer
retrieve my files the reason that it is
so bad is because most of my files were
synced off the Mac due to the optimized
Mac storage option I've spent many many
many hours with Apple they keep telling
me they just need a bit more time a bit
more time now coming up to four months
and I know I'm never going to see my
files again so I can download them one
at a time from iCloud calm but I have
over 200,000 files and good more I just
purchased an iMac and I signed in with
the account but nothing comes down so
everyone just be vigilant and I thanks
for the good work guys keep it up that's
a brutal story man I'm sounding the
alarm on that one that is a brutal story
200 gigs I some reason I felt like
Beyonce was gonna cut was gonna start
coming out dancing no you know what I
that story is painful to hear yeah that
was a painful story to hear the alarm is
no like you know I've lost songs that
maybe we're like 30 gigs and that hurts
your soul but to lose 200 gigs of data
that's probably important stuff for
months Apple he's dealing with Apple for
four months sound the alarm
Rudo anyways you know what though way I
appreciate that he called in just to
like tell a story because that's kind of
like a being a part of the community and
I've said on the show like I'm old
school in certain ways and I don't put
my stuff on the cloud like I have mic
music collection on it my hard drive and
then I also have a backup hard drive and
it's one of those things that once it
fails it hurts so bad you'll never do it
again yeah you'll never do it again once
a cloud service fails on you my advice
is to have everything backed up before
you put it in the cloud so you got a
backup of everything and then put it in
the cloud is the third backup I mean
that's that's that's what I try to do so
that is such a people want to say it but
200 gigs son that's a lot 200,000
something like that all right well I
hope Apple gets that worked out for you
man also that's sound a siren could have
set off a 2 Live Crew I swear you know
and they're in there very controversial
explicit album that I should not have
listened to when I was like in 90s kidz
most it's like expletive laced music
when we're in the 90s man crazy anything
any 90s hip-hop or metal even crazy okay
let's keep going we got three calls left
let's get through them here we go hey
Brian this is Eric owns the Scranton
Pennsylvania I really love this show I
think you guys are doing a great job I'm
just wondering about the Apple pencil I
think it's good Apple products that has
a lot of potential maybe Apple will
improve it soon and that's what I'm
wondering about I kind of want to buy an
Apple pencil now but you know should I
buy it now or should I wait you know
expecting a new Apple pencil to come to
summer thanks brain babe I love I love
this color because obviously I'm a big
fan of the iPad pro except for that
horrible commercial for the record that
commercial just makes me want to like
kick it across the room
but the the rumors and reports is that
the new iPad pro that will be coming out
sometime this year my hunch is it's
gonna be coming out towards like the
middle to the second half of the year is
that there will be reportedly a new
pencil with new software features so you
know if you're if you're on the fence
right now and you don't really need it
just wait it out but I love the iPad pro
there's I've talked about it a bunch of
times but there are some amazing apps on
it now that use the actual pencil a
photo editing app called affinity photo
that is affinity AFF i nit y which is
it's just bonkers it's like hi it's
basically photoshop and in some ways
even better on your iPad so I love that
I love that app and it's for you know
you can do you can do pod cat you can
literally record a podcast on your iPad
but there's a few programs like ferrite
and others there's just so much you can
do now that it's like it's really cool
I'm a big fan that's all I could say I'm
a big fan so no one can say oh you hate
Apple products no exact opposite okay
here we go two more two more left two
short ones here we go
a beach in town this is Tom from New
York
I just have a question to you guys maybe
you can help me out here but I noticed
that the face ID only works when the
phone is in portrait mode does not work
horizontally
I mean it's demin gonna make an iPad pro
they didn't have to figure that one out
half the time when I'm laying down I
have to sit up in bed just to open up my
phone and that's not gonna work but then
I said what you think that's fine dude I
had no I I had no idea until the man
just called us like I totally trauma
like oh my gosh he's so right unlock
when it's alright when it's your phone's
locked in its horizontal it will not
unlock I'm know there's people are gonna
try this now that are listening it does
not unlock so and he's absolutely right
about it then having to do something for
the iPad because it's like it's like I
use
my pad horizontally like most of the
time other than when I'm reading comics
so cool that's that's crazy that's a
good fine man I love that all right this
is the last call here we go
hi this is Josh from Ambler as always I
love your show you guys Rock I was
actually just listening to this week's
show you guys were talking about car
play and again it's something that Apple
is really unfortunately done half baked
period I have the iPhone 10 with the
latest software and I have a 2018 Audi
q5 and it is incredibly glitchy it is
really not reliable sometimes it works
sometimes it doesn't
I've taken the car to outi and Audi says
that Audi corporate is working with
Apple to sort out this problem but it's
really a problem with Apple's software
when I spoke to them they said other car
manufacturers are having similar
problems and it just goes towards you
know the overall disappointment of Apple
putting things out they really aren't
polished I mean Steve Jobs would have
never ever been okay with something like
this so your thoughts thanks have a good
one you know this comes down to a theme
that is part of their new identity
they're just spread too thin they're
doing too many things their resources
are spread too thin you know if they
wanted to they could maybe invest some
of those two hundred eighty five billion
dollars of cash they're sitting on and
employ more people to get their stuff
done because now they have like 12
different product categories with five
models for a product category 283 what a
billion dollars sitting on it the thing
is can you know what can money make
things easier for all of us including
Apple it's like they they are just
literally spread too thin and you've
seen that now with what happened with
the iPhone you know remember there are
stories about how Tim Cook really want
to prioritize the Apple watch and so
they shifted resources from other teams
specifically for the Apple watch and to
get it up and running and all that I
think that's what happens when you start
building all these new product
categories and you're not sure how much
time and resources it takes this is a
lot of work and so yeah is it
harder absolutely do I know how to do
any of this absolutely not but at the
same time you understand the dynamics of
Apple in the past was more focused they
didn't have nearly as many products they
didn't have three or four different
screen size form factors just for one
iOS and it makes you have to really ramp
up across all levels to be able to do
that and a lot of the leadership and key
roles during that era are gone now so
this is a new Apple with the new set of
rules and quite honestly I think that
I've always said this jokingly that I
think Apple management like that people
high up are probably probably happier
and more at ease with Tim Cook at the
helm cuz he's not gonna like destroy
anyone but Steve Jobs instilled kind of
this fear in people it worked like we
benefited from SJ being a total jackass
to them like when we won that caller
said oh Stesha j would have never let
that happen would that would never been
acceptable he would have chewed some
people out hard and fired people he
would have oh yeah like iOS 11 I mean
that's embarrassing man that that the
launch of iOS 11 is embarrassing know
who's accountable for it you know and I
know I don't want people to get their
lose their jobs someone listening right
now is like I wish Brian's lost his job
[Laughter]
you've got to put more resources behind
the stuff because it's not easy well
that's it that's it man that's all our
calls that's it we're done are done so
alright um Beach thanks again for
another show we're doing it long
distance I'll be back in the studio next
week alright so uh yeah will I be back
yeah I'll be back alright so there you
have it everybody remember call us
 alright everybody safe have a great
week we'll see you next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
