is the sony srs x-33
$130 bluetooth speaker that comes in a
few different colors including this blue
version which is my personal favorite
this is the follow-up to last year's x3
which I liked a lot for the money what's
different about this model well for
starters it's 20% smaller and 1.5 pounds
instead of 2.1 pounds
it also has better battery life it's
rated for 12 hours of playback at
moderate volume levels while that x3
only offered seven hours in terms of
features it has the typical Bluetooth
range of about 30 feet and offers NFC
tap tap air technology for smartphones
and tablets that support it as well as a
built-in speakerphone it's also got
support for Sony's L DAC codec which
like apdex is supposed to make Bluetooth
audio streaming sounds slightly better
but you'll need a device that has L DAC
to actually use it as far as the sound
goes this model are you Lee sounds
better than the x3 with a little better
bass performance at higher volumes and a
bit more balanced sound overall but like
all these small bluetooth speakers it
does have its limitations and really
sounds best at more moderate sound
levels where it doesn't run into issues
with compressing the audio to keep it
from distorting you're going to get a
little better sound from sony's larger
step up SRS X 55 and Bose Soundlink mini
2 which costs $200 but I'm still a fan
of the size and design of the speaker
which makes it a good fit for someone
looking for a very compact very good
performing Bluetooth speaker for home or
office use I'm David Carr noise and
that's the Sony SRS X 33 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
