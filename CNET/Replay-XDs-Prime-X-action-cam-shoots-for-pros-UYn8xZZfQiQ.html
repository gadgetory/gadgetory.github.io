is that there is a lot of variety so
instead of just a bunch of copycats you
get things like this the replay XD prime
X I'm Josh : we've seen that and the
prime X is the company's fourth gen
camera and has been designed with
professional use in mind made from
aluminum the ultra compact body is tough
and waterproof without a housing it has
a custom-made cinema quality lens paired
with a high sensitivity 16 megapixel
CMOS sensor and enough processing power
to capture video at 1080p at 60 frames
per second or 720p at 120 frames per
second
Saturn's can be changed with the buttons
on back via an android or iOS app when
wirelessly connected to a mobile device
or by altering a text document that gets
stored on the micro SD card this
includes frame rates of 24 or 48 frames
per second or making adjustments to
exposure white balance saturation
sharpness and more the micro HDMI port
supports full res streaming to a display
external recorder or wireless
transmitter and adapters are available
for fitting the camera with an external
mic for better audio quality a nice
assortment of accessories are included
too so there's very little not to like
here except for maybe its built-in
battery though even that depending on
what you're recording at it lasts for
between two and three and a half hours
of continuous recording video quality is
solid especially if your goal is
playback on tablets and smartphones
well you could read the whole review on
cnet.com but if you need a low-profile
camera with some pro features this is a
standout
I'm Josh : and that's a look at the
replay XD prime x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
