ago do you feel like the future has
turned out better than expected or worse
the same I could see devolution and even
if you assumed later on I could see
devolution English the evolution is
wonderful but on that that has a very a
dark cycle tech and science is is with
us dude when it's moving soft fast now
it's faster than flight travel the
movement in the digital world is
screaming past areas in it as a
gale-force and I think where we're going
to be in 20 years God knows now I'll
hoping to we can deal with the fact that
they were melting the Earth's going end
up as a desert if you don't watch it if
we continue doing what we're doing and
put our evolution on travel and which
will be helped by AI thinking and
cooperation unless you're going to send
people out who never plan to come back
that will have to be either hope sleep I
think that's a long way off I think the
idea of a large craft going off with
families on board that will lived I
lived I lived I till they get that is
more likely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
