ability to create in the hands of
everyone and the culmination of our work
is project spark I'm proud to be here
with one of our designers Claude Jerome
to share with you for the very first
time how you can start with nothing and
bring an amazing game to life how you
can turn making a game into a game
itself and how when you are ready you
can share your game with everyone
everywhere on any screen Claude let's
show them how spark show me rivers make
that mountains good now let's add some
texture show me the Arctic hmm maybe
woodland all right now let's set the
mood night evening day four o'clock
perfect now that's a good start using
smart glass I can go into sculpting and
really put some personal touches on this
world so let's start with putting in a
mountain to define our backdrop and then
we'll go in and we'll put a protective
moat around here good and then let's
finish off with a bridge to go across
and then with the touch of a button
Claude is jumping into our world
now in just one minute we were able to
make something that looks great now
let's build upon that and create a
simple game in our world step one our
home base so we'll choose this village I
can place this anywhere I'd like I'll
put it right here this will be our town
square alright step 2 let's add some
behaviors now everything in project
spark has a brain that can be changed
let's bring something to life take this
rock for instance we can make this rock
become a pet with something we already
built so the brain says when the rock
detects me it'll move towards me and
jump pretty simple and just like that
I've made myself a new friend come on
little buddy let's rock and roll it's
step 3 the enemy now we need some bad
guys to attack this village goblin camp
house we deal with these guys plot hero
with a sword I think it's time for the
rock to step it up this fighter brain I
got from the community is a blast let's
see what it does to the Drakh yeah get
him rock man nice moves rock man now we
gave this seed of a game idea to the
team before the show to see what it
could grow into let's check out how
other creators in project spark can
remix and build on an idea
alright starts off familiar enough
there's our town square that meteor too
I'm guessing there's more here let's go
over what we got an army of pissed-off
goblins nice one all right I'm gonna
charge into the valley below here Claud
I can morph the landscape so I'll cover
you from up here
you know I think I'm gonna need some
more help take these guys on all right
hang tight this fireball carve out a
huge lava pit Oh that'll slow them down
Wow anything goes in this game even
flying goblins does it give you anything
else you can use flying Gulman that's
nothing it's time to bust out rock man
badass upgrade rock man becomes
rock neck
come on Dave let's finish this fight
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
