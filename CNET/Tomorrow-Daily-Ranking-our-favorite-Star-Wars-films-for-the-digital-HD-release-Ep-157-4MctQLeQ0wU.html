Collider is back online and we're going
to tell you what kind of upgrades it got
and it looks like you're gonna have to
buy Star Wars again because it's
available digitally now yay finally
actually we finally finally and also
delivery drones but not from the company
or thinking of and not to the people
you're hoping for that makes sense samar
daily
greetings citizen from the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe here
you're not you're not punching the sky
you look are you upset and do what I do
my bad we don't mess up that much at
least that our outtakes we just mess up
and leave men but you did it before the
before you did like a lightsaber annoys
I did you make it that again can we do
it in the second story or do you want to
do now I want it now I want to
front-load this ok hmm hmm hmm I don't
know fair enough fair no I mean I don't
know IV Wow yeah I mean I'm can't you
can't acapella Star Wars noises so we're
excited about we're excited about the
Star Wars thing but we all San we also
have other stories there's some really
good stuff today so let's hit the
headlines
okay that's better than mine that's way
better than mine um okay let's talk
about the Large Hadron Collider I
actually was not aware that it was
offline did you know that like the Higgs
boson that the Large Hadron Collider was
offline for two years or three maybe 30
not just like a week no no and that's
I'd like I totally didn't realize it was
often but it's back online so it's been
out for a couple year a couple years now
and it came back online earlier this
week after discovering the Higgs boson
and hopefully I'm pronouncing that right
boson boson I don't know like everyone
always argues about where the emphasis
is anyway classes so they shut it down
for emphasis exactly they shut it down
for improvements in 2012 and and wanted
to upgrade it because they wanted to
increase the energy inside the loop for
collisions so they want it because they
want to start looking for variants of
the of the Higgs boson so they're saying
that these new upgrades that have been
done will smash protons together at a
higher energy so that they can look for
different varieties of the Higgs boson
as well as Dark Matter supersymmetry and
other sort of parts of maybe maybe parts
of the the beginnings of the universe so
harder better faster stronger is what
they're going for they're trying to like
really increase its capacity
capabilities yeah yeah and there there's
always been down for two years well okay
so this is an interesting way that they
have to do this like also another thing
i did not realize about the Large Hadron
Collider which makes sense after i read
it is that it has to be really cold
inside the loop to work and so it's
minus 456 degrees Fahrenheit it's only
one point nine degrees Celsius above
like absolute zero inside inside the
loop for the collisions but obviously
kind of people working there at that
temperature because they would get
really cold and I they would be a little
corpsicle and so they had it like heated
up let people in there and then cool it
back down so every time they would go in
to do these like kind of upgrade so yeah
this is definitely like one of those
things where it takes a long time to
kind of do the work just in and of
itself because you're raising and
lowering the temperature so dramatically
so we're going to fire our backup
so it's fired back up now but they're
testing so they're they're doing tests
and that will last for a few weeks and
then they'll say once they're satisfied
with the testing and no everything is
good to go they said they want to go
forth with experiments and they're going
to start increasing the number of
collisions which would then make it more
likely for all the physicists kind of
observing and watching to spot unlikely
events so if anything kind of kind of
unusual happens or something new happens
that they haven't really seen before
hopefully the the increase the number of
collisions will help them spot those
things so pretty cool stuff going on at
the LHC and i was like i said i was
unaware that it was actually down for
the count for a couple years I I had
seen that they were taking it offline
but I thought it would be like you said
for like maybe a month or two or maybe
six months and then they were like no
couple years and then I just forgot
about it and then I read it and then I
had read it came back online and I was
like wait didn't it go find like two
years ago so yeah I was at really long
vacation let the only she took so tell
me about Star Wars once a long time ago
in a galaxy far far away oh you wanna
just the new story oh you could just
tell me the story 2 i'm alright to check
this out oh just it's a complete
surprise it was either this morning or
yesterday disney and Lucas Lucas arts
decided hey we are finally going to
release Star Wars digitally so you can
have digital copies about of Star Wars
officially as of April 10th you'll be
able to get them digitally whether it be
on iTunes or Amazon or or a few other
places um not too expensive to ninety
dollars for pre-order if you want to get
it on Amazon or nineteen or twenty
dollars each on itunes now this is the
special edition versions this is not
like the original ones that they say
that were destroyed or whatever Sean
will not be shooting first yeah so it's
it's still it's a little wonky um but
yeah there you go you can get these you
can get these again it was like a huge
surprise they came out of nowhere and
it's the first time they've been
available digitally so I'm definitely
getting these so kill your kind of an
expert in this sort of arena of like VOD
and new media and things like that so
why why do you think it took this long
cuz I like I will say I would have
guessed that they would have announced
something like this at celebration which
is next next week because next week yeah
so why not why not wait a why not wait
another week and be why not um I guess
maybe just get people jacked up for
celebration boy yeah it might have
gotten lost in the fray if they had
announced it at the celebration because
they have so much force awakens stuff
coming out they're gonna probably show
battlefront like I'm sure I'm sure
they've got a lot to announce and I'm
sure they're gonna announce like new
series and stuff like that and probably
get lost in the fray and again like you
said to build up revenge it as far as it
taking so long digitally it's just still
a very confusing market to you know to
that's bigger company and releasing it
around this time period makes sense I
don't know why it just was like hey it's
coming out friday like I don't know why
it was like just like okay like in four
days you're gonna be able to buy the
whole entire six series saga like on any
pretty much any video on demand service
that you have ever heard of like it was
everywhere I don't know anybody that's
not gonna like at least give it a
thought to get by it I mean I didn't I
ever since we moved to blu-ray I have
not wanted to buy the dvds or the
blu-rays because I'm like I don't we
don't have physical disks for movies in
our house like it's all digital now
they're definitely they're definitely
launching this around the time that this
this whole star wars celebration is them
spinning the engine spinning it back up
all the way a hundred percent because
because you've only had in the trailer
and then rumors of things start the the
star wars celebration is going to be the
launch of every single month they're
gonna have all this new content and
everything coming out and so this is
disposed I was thinking why didn't they
wait till like holiday season but by
then you're already waiting for the
force awakens you're already watched the
Star Wars you know trilogy again and
again and again right so right now why
not when all this new stuff about the
force awakens comes out have two weeks
ready for people now you can just go
ahead and start watching them so I mean
it's kind of a no-brainer it's kind of
clever I still understand why they just
launched it like two days before very
well good that it was like oh in two
weeks you can do it but we did only to
work
for you they announced it and then
everyone's like tell everyone so we're
telling you know does he knew we'd we'd
all be shouting it from the roof deck
spected the internet to not have like we
have you know fish brains yeah we're
forget it will be like Oh Star Wars is
coming out in a month and then we'll
forget everything I guess just release
it two days later by it that's a good
that's a good strategy for a fishbowl
internet so there you go but isn't that
our TD of the day I think we're gonna
start an internet war with because this
is the argument that is as old as as
Star Wars itself or I guess until Empire
Strikes Back came out uh yeah the
hashtag today is T dsw and rank the six
Star Wars movies mm-hmm that's that's it
that's what we want you to do I want to
know I want that and I want some good
choices like I like you know there's the
standard like everybody says like
empires the best and then so what's your
ok so what's your definitive ranking for
you personally of Star Wars movies that
are out right now I have to start yeah I
like a new hope ok that's your number
one yeah all right i'll do all a sixth
aurielee skipping skipping over Empire
for number one and going new hope oh but
it was the movie this started in Ireland
Emperor would it be able even be a story
a little bit work for a new home and
then Empire okay then Jedi ok and then
space space space space thanks for like
intercept 7 8 9 episode 3 1 episode 3
episode to episode 1 you're not allowing
your the race began I'd rather rings
okay I'm sorry five six three two one is
that's your that's your definitive
ranking all right I'm gonna get a little
controversial here because I don't like
this I know your your mo you may
actually you i'm gonna move heavy
objects wake so you could bludgeon me
I'm gonna say Empire numero uno hands
down for me the best of the Star Wars
saga then I'm gonna go a new hope then
I'm gonna say revenge of the sith then
i'm going to say Jedi then i'm going to
say attack of the clones that i'm going
to say Phantom Menace so I'm gonna go
with 5 4 3 6 21
you're a broken human being I'm there
could be something wrong with me and
that's fine but that's for me I like
that's but I also hear this is an
important distinction I never saw any
Star War original trilogy Star Wars
movies in the theaters at all like I
didn't see any Star Wars until the
special editions in 97 I'm not even
gonna go at you you you have at her I'm
sure after today my divorce papers will
be waiting for me at the house to X my
cousin's big stores yeah anyway on to
the next story wall all right I deal
with this whole drone everyone other
interests hey I don't know what the
entire internet is calling in their rage
we have to talk about this drone
delivery service so matter net is a
company that is actually quite a bit
ahead of Amazon on drone delivery and
they are delivering dro they're using
delivery drones but not in the way that
you would think so most people kind of
go to e-commerce and Amazon like that's
the thing that they want well matter net
is saying that they have this drone
called the matter net one and that it
would work in developing countries where
either poor or non-existent roads would
kind of prohibit delivering medicine
documents other things smaller things
payloads like that to small villages so
yes the rural village Wow and they've
been testing and they found in this one
area where they were doing testing that
as the crow flies as you saw in that
little map where they had these sort of
like little fireworks as the crow flies
a lot of these a lot of these villages
could be reached very easily in a half
hour in the sky and there and they're
all within a half hour flight drone
flight to a hospital so they would be
able to pack medic medication or things
like that and then fly them directly to
a location a village anything like that
right and they don't have to worry about
like laws of flying their drones around
not of these developing countries right
exactly and here's the crazier part
doesn't need a pilot you this is all
autonomous it is all incredibly like
there it's still very much on paper a
lot of it but they're starting to move
into testing the matter net one right
are they like delay it looks like a
donation type thing I mean because this
is really cool
it's not like an indie go but they're
they're a full-blown company they are
working on this this is everything
matter net is the name of the company no
but I mean if they're like helping
people out like are they like a they're
not a non-profit as far as I'm aware but
because they had also talked about
licensing this technology their CEO said
that he sees three applications for this
type of drone delivery which would be
medical transportation obviously
medication courier service and then
ecommerce and in that order he said that
he feels that's the way we're going to
see this drone delivery services
developed he's like we're going to see
medical first then we're going to see
career then we're going to see
e-commerce so we're not going to see the
Amazons of the world using this
technology until we've kind of nailed
and figured out these other two but it
makes a lot of sense because obviously
medical deliveries organs you like think
about it you have an ambulance it's at a
hospital you have to get it across town
even in Los Angeles let's say you have
to get it from like Cedar sinai to Long
Beach like gives us that ambulance has
to then sit in traffic within organ like
why not just send it via drone right
over like whoa that that's a thing like
I had never considered but it makes a
lot of sense really go hard you're like
oh there goes somebody's heart yes hey
yeah like Oh someone heart transplant
amazing like um that's a great way of
looking at it the way he like yes he
listed it like he's like these are the
three ways I think they're gonna be
developed and so yeah no matter net huh
yeah matter net and they have the drones
go from like landing pad the landing pad
and have these set landing stations
where they can land and have a battery
swap done again all without a pilot it's
all automated and they have software and
hardware that works very cool make it
able for these drones to go to a place
drop off the payload and come back to
its home base is really really cool and
inspiring nicely done super good alright
guys we're gonna take a quick break
we'll be right back with new releases
because it's Tuesday and of course you
are yours or feedback and our phone
target for the day so don't click
weights tomorrow daily also take a look
at this Rubik's Cube video
welcome back hey Logan would you think
of Star Wars Episode three there you go
there's a definitive so Lester rocks
yeah see there okay i I don't think that
anything in eposide on't think anything
in and Jedi was as offensive as a single
moment that I can pick out in episode
three I would argue it they're equally
bad i might say that star wars episode 3
is the best of that trilogy oh yeah no
it easily is the better of the three
prequels easily lines are just again you
won't get any ography i prefer that over
return if somebody offered me both of
those and said which one do you want to
watch I would pick almost always ninety
percent of time I would pick revenge of
the sith as opposed to return of the
jedi sorry alright Tom same all right
let have your own stupid opinion I know
it's in my opinion it doesn't have to be
right I know the Internet is gonna
explode in rage let's talk about new
releases
it's not how dare you have a different
FBI down other people how dare I how
dare no but seriously that is a bad
opinion I that's fine listen I like cock
rock I'm amused by cop rock so oh but
that's like ironically you enjoy it no
no I love it I just deeply enjoy it yeah
it's like liking pop music like I don't
I don't I have looked the guys no shame
in this game like I have no shame in my
game I'll unabashedly admit it like i
enjoy things that most people are like
this is dumb like I I like dumb stuff
sorry yeah all right murderers feel that
way to about the about the whole thing
that's probably we're not ashamed I
haven't yet murdered anybody but the day
is not over yeah do you want to talk
about new releases yep alright so I am
bread is coming out this week's an
interesting week of new releases I am
bread yeah you're starting out with I am
bread I want to just go see again dumb
stuff love it um I am bread is an
awesome game in which you play a slice
of bread and it's really hard it's been
in steam early access since I think late
last year in December and yeah this is
one of the levels there we have to make
yourself toast it says I am toast and
you got to try to get to the toaster and
if you fall on the ground you can go bad
you're edibility rating leg goes down
and you start growing mold and stuff yup
real bad it's incredibly difficult I've
all I've been able to control I've only
been able to pass the first stage um
which is in the kitchen and then you
have to go through the bathroom and
bedroom and katamari or see it's
incredibly hard cuz you have to control
its just like wop really if you if you
play clock it's just like that but so
now this is available on what now he
will be available officially official
release on steam this I believe this
friday what they change the graphics
look better the grabs your better wants
it was just in early access and they've
been polishing it and now this is the
official game releases the ninth I hope
it's a little easier I don't think it
will be I think they're gonna keep it
tougher uh next game is um something
that's actually been out for a few years
now Bastion have you played bass yeah
passions great love Bastion it's out on
ps4 this week and if you have not played
Bastion I highly recommend if you have a
playstation 4 picking this game up
poor giant games makes this if you've
ever played transistor which is also an
incredible game it's so good they
supergiant just makes amazing games
ridiculously beautiful the voice acting
is always so good this one in particular
don't forget the music the music is
amazing like everything is so good about
this game like I it was one of my
favorite games of the year the year it
came out for iOS yeah the year came out
on iOS was the year I played it it's
like a little RPG it is it's like a
little RPG and your kind of rebuilding
Society it's short so you're not you
know a short and it's it's it's very
it's very easy to access like it's not
except it's not a difficult game that
you're gonna have a hard time getting
into anyone can play this game it's a
lot of fun if you if you have a
hankering for some sort of like little
tiny game while while we wait for big
games to come out definitely give
Bastion this is such a high quality
indie game I cannot recommend i play it
through twice that's it's so so good you
guys so if you have a ps4 and you
haven't played this like get by bastion
because it's so good movies you're one
of the movies you saw itself myself us
coming out this weekend why release ex
machina so if your sci-fi fan this is
definitely worth checking out even in
theaters it's it there's uh it's it's
about AI and cannae I be trusted or is
AI on our side it's it's very charming
its seemingly heartwarming and it's very
it's very black mirror if you love like
mirror you'll love this it's got both of
these both of the stars then the male
stars are in Star Wars so yeah it so no
lightsabers but I love this movie so I'd
at South by really loved it got to
interview the cast they were super into
it too so as a sentient AI I am really
into this movie and I want to go see it
I really identify program to like it I
know I'm cendien I can make the choice I
am really interested in this movie
because it has a fellow AI in it oh ok
so I'm very interested so the last thing
is daredevil comes to Netflix this week
this is this is the beginning of a whole
Marvel and Netflix relationship and
which there's gonna be a whole bunch of
series coming out yeah but they're
starting out with daredevil what's and
there was already a screening of it in
LA a lot of people who went to go see it
we're completely blown away they were
like this changes the
named for superhero stuff on television
forever and they're all dropping they're
all jumping the same time April 10 yeah
so you can enjoy this weekend how r been
gypped this is going to be different
than most marvelous airs because it's
going to be gritty and raw which mostly
Marvel has been like silly and fun and
stuff like that sure they'll be very
light-hearted a little more light harder
than DC but since this is based on a
frank miller thing it's gonna be a
little bit more gritty a little bit more
wrong it's gonna be I cannot wait i'm
not the biggest daredevil fan so I'm
ready to change my mind ok and I'm ready
for the DC fans to kind of not have this
argument anymore cuz DC fans you like
whatever enjoy your Marvel movies
because they're not gritty and raw and
I'm really excited to see Marvel take
that on not i love i love DC movies but
i just don't want that complaint to
exist anymore this looks pretty good i'm
i'm interested oh yeah I'm interested I
I will watch it i'll give it a shot I'm
I'm with you I'm not like the biggest
daredevil if I'm like oh my god
Daredevils my favorite superhero but um
yeah I'll watch it and anything's better
than the ben affleck movie so hey yeah I
couldn't put my time in dis shield I
just couldn't do it yeah so this seems
good like smaller great this I'm good
way yeah so it's gonna be violent it's
just gonna be blood now it's sorry it's
Gary's pretty good and then we'll get an
idea of how the unfolding of the rest of
the Marvel yes they're gonna be the Luke
Cage one all kinds of stuff I can't wait
to see you can be delightful so that's
that's you really well killing it man
doing they're doing really well um
that's new releases and now it's time
for your user feedback oh RuPaul's Drag
Race oh bring back my girls yeah yeah oh
well read what do you think of this run
I thought it was mad max oh I mean it
could be I mean maybe wait is RuPaul's
Drag Race like that pony inspiration for
Mad Max I'm I hope so I'm cool okay so
yesterday we asked you guys to use the
hashtag TD prize to tell us what mentors
oh god you would want to do this uh this
Disney Co virtually unchallenged this x
prize tomorrow and Challenger so beta
prime wrote in and said
contest Elon Musk real life Tony Stark
electric supercars and spaceships are
hard to beat I'm so glad somebody picked
that I I totally agree with you great
great idea great choice Frank wrote in
said hashtag dr. Emmett Brown yes to
teach me how to make a time machine and
bring back a future sports Almanac yeah
but then you'd have to kiss your mom
that's a little weird you got to fight
Biff yeah fail that's like a punch bitch
you just got a tongue what's that over
there Hey look a distraction yeah he
looks uh Charles wrote in and said dr.
Henry McCoy time travel 101 oh nice like
that yeah then there was a lot of
hashtags um and then lastly Tom wrote in
to us and said I love us I would suggest
levar burton is Geordi LaForge from Star
Trek next generation as mentor for the
XPrize challenge I debate that levar
burton himself would be a pretty good
mentor it would also be nice it could be
either or I mean he could be it would be
like Artie RDJ he could play either Tony
Stark or just be himself he would be an
excellent mentor either way so those
were really good you guys had really
good suggestions great ones I really
really enjoyed that so uh we also have
our very last piece of user feedback
which is always our photog refer the day
so I know we've been asking people for
note pictures bit from their Galaxy
Notes not the note for this is actually
from the note 3 but it still is pretty
amazing yeah those are all comparable
only wrote to us and said from my galaxy
note 3 at Big Bear California I'm an
international student here in California
and I like watching your show this is my
seasonal photo without any filters and I
hope you like every pixel kind regards
Ali it is so good the no camera is so
good every most people that I know who
use Android have all said that this the
note series of cameras tend to be the
best of all of the android phones
cameras which is pretty great it looks I
mean a look it up said he's in a snowy
area where it like brightens everything
up like it's not washed out like the
sometimes in snow you can get that
really weird glare where it's so bright
that everything gets washed out not the
case here and I think that yeah I mean
if we're good I'm trying to take it and
try to take a picture with this but it
would just be terrible I like versus
like in highlight well done thanks for
setting a little picture oven I've been
trying to analyze note versus good i
think tomorrow we might have a note for
so although there's i'm trying to keep
an eye out for him it's like I'm like oh
I don't know note for okay I want to see
if somebody has a note and an iphone 6
take the same pictures next to each
other now you're just doing work yeah
now you're do it maybe work give your
attitude chance yeah alright guys if you
want to send in your phone tog raphy if
you want to send a story ideas feedback
on the show segment ideas I'll take them
I'm always interested you can email them
