largest living structure is slowly dying
beneath the waves the Great Barrier Reef
stretches 1,400 miles down the eastern
coast of Australia it's home to more
than 3000 individual reefs 600 types of
coral and countless species of marine
animals it's as big as Germany and it's
dying on our watch hundreds of miles of
coral bleached white an entire
underwater Amazon turn to stone
scientists have been warning about
problems on the reef for years and in
2014 the issue was thrust further into
the spotlight when Leonardo DiCaprio
spoke about visiting the Great Barrier
Reef and seeing what remains of this
natural wonder
a witness environmental devastation
firsthand
once it looked like an endless
underwater utopia is now reeled with
bleached coral reefs and massive dead
zones it's not too late to save this
fragile ecosystem in fact researchers
are using a host of new technologies to
map the reef engineer new corals and
even recreate ocean life in 3d it's hard
to save what you can't see especially
when what you're saving is hidden
underwater and that's why researchers
from Australia's James Cook University
and the Royal Australian Navy are using
advanced sonar and laser systems to map
out the ocean floor in 3d even NASA is
involved the US Space Agency has spawned
teams of scientists over the reef to
capture light spectrum data that looked
help them what's happening beneath the
waves it's not just these large-scale
mapping projects that are shedding new
light on the GBR
scientists are recreating the reef on
land to show the world the dangers the
real reef is facing
the Australian Institute of Marine
Science has created a massive sea
simulator in Queensland that perfectly
replicates reef life researchers use it
to grow new corals and can mimic
expected conditions as far ahead as the
year 2100 scientists are even building
coral in 3d computer models stitch
together from hundreds of high-res coral
photographs to track how they grow and
erode over time but greater human
intervention may be required so
scientists are studying heat-resistant
coral in Western Australia with the hope
that they can transplant these resilient
corals back to the GBR
and hope the reefs survive the effects
of climate change researchers are also
looking at science seemingly pulled from
a James Bond film they want to
artificially brighten clouds to reflect
light and keep water temperatures cooler
for most of the world the crisis on the
Great Barrier Reef feels so distant but
big names like David Attenborough and
companies like Google are helping to
bring it home for people all across the
world now anyone with a VR headset can
experience the reef up close with
Attenborough but a virtual die or go on
a self-guided tour through the magic of
Google Streetview
none of these efforts alone will rescue
the reef
we have to make a choice to decide where
the cutting carbon emissions is worth it
in order to save our natural wonders
like the Great Barrier Reef and that's
why technology is so valuable it
provides a window into this underwater
world and can open our eyes to what we
might lose
