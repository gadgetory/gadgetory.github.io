is this at least comes rather close to
the original while also stealing a pager
to from the 911 let's drive Jaguars
latest and definitely most interesting
the 2014 f-type v8 s and check the tech
now I'll tell you my experience with
this car driving it the real world for a
few days is that people fall in love
with it a lot of good things about the
lines especially up here in the front
where I see definitely an echo of the
original e type grille little different
shape but you get the idea you've also
got a little bit of Honda s2000 a little
bit of Miata up here and I don't mean
those as insults although I guess at
this price they kind of are now parked
next to an original e type this F would
look like a moving van but don't blame
Jaguar blame 50 some odd years of
regulations that tell you where the
headlights have to be where the bumpers
have to be how many air bags you need
how you have to handle pedestrian
impacts side impact rollover that said
this and the original e type are within
about an inch of each other nose to tail
after that they begin to diverge quite
dramatically at the rear something of a
horizontally pinched Trump also echoes
the e-type as do the similar horizontal
slit tail lamps now jag loves to
motorize things so the rear spoiler is
indeed the flush door handles extend
when the car is unlocked and even the
center air vent powers up when the
vehicles powered up just because it can
the next thing you see is the extreme
driver centrism of this cabin you've got
an incredible number of displays
interfaces interfaces with displays in
them until you get to the east side of
the Jesus handle in nothing this car
tells the passenger sit down shut up and
don't touch anything now operating this
cars head unit is a relatively limited
experience you're not going to get on a
controller there isn't one it's all
touchscreen and quite responsive and
interestingly no voice command but I
can't say I miss it because most voice
command systems in cars are crap and
notice what they've done to economise
real estate around the climate system
which always takes up a lot more real
estate than it does need to spend time
with it so jag has imbedded displays
inside the nob as you turn this knob for
driver's side temp it shows it inside
the knob face press it and it turns into
the seat heating or cooling control with
similar display it's a nice way to clear
things up now let's talk about the
drivetrain and powertrain controls easy
to spot because they're all in a copper
tone color
paddle shifters downshift left up shift
right mounted to the wheel not my
favorite but they're nice and tall so
you can get to them pretty easily from
anywhere start/stop button of course
over here is a very simple vehicle
dynamics control push it up once to get
your snow mud ice slippery condition
push it down and it's in the middle now
for normal driving pull it down to this
checkered flag and now you're in
dynamics mode that tells you that with
one icon on the center LCD this is nice
and simple and easy to use your shifter
here that goes to your 8-speed quick
shift automatic no manual no DCT in this
car controversial but we'll check out on
the road here in a minute
you've got a power button for your
spoiler if you like playing with that
thing or washing the car and then you've
got your sport exhaust on/off button
here now related to our drive systems
here is another menu up on the home menu
you go into extra features and then you
get to this stuff called dynamic I this
is an optional set of technologies on
this car when you hit that you're going
to be given an area for custom setup of
just about everything in the powertrain
you can decide how you want the gear
shifts to behave dynamic or normal
suspension which is adaptive in these
cars dynamic or normal steering same
thing engine throttle response and power
delivery similar push this and you get a
track timer because you're gonna be
tracking your $90,000 3600 pound
convertible all the time over here is
your g-force sensor you know kind of fun
to watch and here is some pedal display
like I don't know what I'm doing
that's kind of superfluous but they had
room for a button so why not now in
terms of media you've got basically one
set of inputs and two choices on the
output
you've got radio with HD and satellite
optional that's not included base under
here my music you're going to find a
whole variety of sources which include
the USB and the aux jack here in the
center console you've also got bluetooth
streaming standard on this vehicle CD
slot is down in here which plays DVDs as
well when you're parked the base audio
system is 10 speakers 380 watts ample
for a small cabin or go to 12 speakers
770 watts is that right yep the base
audio reg is 10 speakers in this little
cabin 380 watts
you can also up it to 12 speakers 770
watts and both are Meridian branded
stuff you're either going to have
the sound or lots of lots of sound one
thing I have a gripe about are these
visors they only come down they do not
sit here at the eyebrow and flip up so
all those times when you're driving
along and the Sun is right there can't
do anything about it except put your
hand up here and look like a dork now as
you can see jag went with a conventional
soft top not a retractable hardtop
though they did insulate this one really
well so it's pretty quiet on the road
and it goes quick 12 seconds from one
end or the other whichever direction
you're going and as you can see it does
not go into the trunk which is a good
thing it doesn't take up any trunk space
the downside is there isn't much trunk
space no matter what position it's in
now the hood opens as it should on this
car forward and giving you a look at the
5 liter supercharged v8 these cars are
rear-wheel drive and there's one choice
only between here and there and that is
an 8-speed automatic transmission called
a quick shift gearbox that raised a lot
of eyebrows no manual gearbox no dual
clutch gearbox just an automatic which
we're going to check out on the road and
I think you're going to be impressed the
number is on this Mill R 495 horsepower
460 foot-pounds of torque this car
weighs around 3,700 pounds but gets up
to 60 and 4.2 seconds no kidding
your mileage is fine 16:23 i'm
sixteen mixed all the way
okay the first thing I do without a
friend is defeat the auto start-stop
because as in any non electrified car I
find it to be kludgy the next thing I
noticed right off the bat is wow that is
one crisp transmission and it's an
automatic as I mentioned not a DCT
obviously not a manual but it is super
fast super tight I might have no gripes
about it this has to be the best
automatic transmission I have ever
driven next thing is this is ten things
so fast it's actually obnoxious it's
really fun for a few minutes and then
you feel like an idiot because
everybody's looking at you there is so
much power here it's almost a bit much
this is a showy car in this
configuration I go for the v6 almost
certainly
now the f-type is a flagship car so they
don't come cheap even the base vehicle
is like 69 grand this guy the v8s bases
out at 90 mm then you got to add some
things to get it seen that style let's
start off with about 1,200 bucks for the
big Meridian audio system why not it's a
small cabin but nothing succeeds like
excess steel on this car is 220 measly
bucks for the sport exhaust system even
if you only use it once in a while to
scare the neighbors it's worth the money
now the big-ticket stuff 27:32 add the
fully addressable dynamics package it
lets you really shape all the vehicles
on the road systems and set your own
profile and about $2,100 gets you what
they call the vision pack which is the
intelligent high beams steerable front
headlights passive blind spot technology
rear camera and front sensors now my
philosophy on the f-type if it's
possible to have one after just three
days is I would look down market
consider also the v6 supercharged base
car it's gonna save you 23 grand get you
substantially better miles per gallon
and still do a nice 5.1 260 miles an
hour but it's going to I think alighting
much more engaged in the driving process
this car has an awful lot on tap you
spend a lot of time controlling it
keeping it from leaving Earth's orbit
and not as much driving it as idling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
