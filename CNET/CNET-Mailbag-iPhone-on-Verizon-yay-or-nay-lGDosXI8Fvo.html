to the cnet mailbag the show where I
regularly correct the things that I have
said to miss leave you in other shows
for example I need to clear up some
minor confusion that resulted from the
most recent buzz report MCG n was one of
a few who wrote in after many years with
verizon i painfully pre-order my new 3gs
iphone from ATT it is killing me to
leave verizon but i figured i would have
to wait at least another year now after
your latest buzz out i am totally
confused should i return my ATT please
give me some light all your colleagues
at cnet say at least a year if ever I
don't know what to do any inside tip
would be helpful I can still cancel my
iphone well I responded to MCG n and
others to say that I don't have any
inside information about a verizon
iphone at all my suggestion on the buzz
report that it's coming to verizon and
you shouldn't sign a new two year
contract with ATT was based on all the
same old rumors and speculation and
wishful thinking but i do think it's a
good bet there will be a verizon iphone
in about a year so if you can't wait
that long you know go crazy with the
eighteen t although as long as we're
confusing you daniel responded to that
episode of the buzz report to say hi
Molly the next version of the iphone
will be available for verizon a friend
works with the CEO teaching people in
verizon stores about the new phones all
she told my dad was that not this year a
verra son of the iphone will be
available for verizon not this year
apple and verizon are talking and in the
stage of agreeing on terms verizon said
this time though they won't let it pass
soon you can stop complaining because it
will be a network with some standards
helpful right but if I had to guess I
would say CES announcement jun 2010
release just a guess ok in other recent
big events buzz out loud turned 1000
that was one of the more colorful
congratulations we received he said hey
mo whoa sorry about that if it's bad it
is anyways first of all I want to
congratulate bol on its 1,000th episode
well done to the bol crew and the rest
of cnet for me
my days of boring reading stupid
articles to fun insightful discussions
that help me understand what the article
is really talking about that's what we
aim to do around here speaking of buzz
out loud and our other podcast offerings
been had this to say the news cnet com /
live site is great to pimp it up a
little maybe a minutes until feature can
be added for example 1 hour 15 minutes
until bol streams live that way people
who live in other time zones and are
also mentally challenged like me don't
have to deal with converting gmt to
local time Thank You Ben I really like
that idea I pass it along to the team
that's working on future features for
that page of course it'll mean we have
to start our shows on time but we can
try anyway if you haven't already check
out the cnet com / live page and you can
see all of the live streams of our
podcasts throughout the day and chat
with your fellow viewers it's so
interactive alright moving on Jake and
several others sent in this question hi
what is the URL of the cnet acceptance
speech at the webby awards or could you
just show us the video i tried browsing
the youtube channel youtube.com slash
webby but i couldn't find it yeah so it
turns out the webby people did not
upload the People's Voice acceptance
speeches to YouTube we all recorded our
five word speeches just like the other
winners but then apparently they only
put that actual winter speeches on
youtube even though People's Voice
winters work treated the same as every
other winner and almost every other
respect so that sucks and the web bees
are dead to me and they should be to you
too since you are in fact the people and
you voted but allow me to recreate this
Beach right here thank you seen at TV
fans worth the wait right and that's it
for this week everyone keep the feedback
and the questions coming email me at
mailbag at cnet com or send your snail
mail to 235 second street san francisco
california 94 105 and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
