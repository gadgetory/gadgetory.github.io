but I wish I could say the same thing
about its performance I'm xiomara Blanco
frisina and this is a first look at the
yoga tablet too if you saw last year's
Android yoga tablets this new model will
look familiar the 8-inch tablet dawns a
sturdy aluminum frame with the chunky
rounded spine on its bottom on the left
side you'll find the microUSB port
volume and power buttons and on the
right there's a headphone jack the
silver sign is home to the two front
facing speakers and if you turn the
tablet around you'll find the built-in
kickstand to use it you simply pull it
down by twisting at the spine it
securely locks into a 90 degree angle
but you can easily adjust it however you
want the yoga tablet too can sit upright
or be set down at a lower angle it looks
a little funky but I really like the
design the rounded spine makes it
comfortable to grip in one hand and the
built-in kickstand is undeniably useful
it's also light at a little less than 1
pound and I found its size pretty
portable unfortunately I'm less
impressed with the rest it has to offer
the Lenovo yoga tablet 2 runs Android
4.4 KitKat and houses a one point three
gigahertz quad-core intel atom processor
and 2 gigabytes of ram there's only 16
gigabytes of internal storage but thanks
to the microSD card slot that's hidden
behind the kickstand you can expand it
up to 64 gigabytes the eight-inch
touchscreen boasts a 1920 x 1200 pixel
resolution IPS display and it's bright
and colorful enough but it disappoints
in sharpness text doesn't look as crisp
as it should especially for such a high
resolution though it's still readable
additionally the touchscreen is
occasionally unresponsive or slow to
recognize taps the yoga tablet too has a
simple Android scan that doesn't have an
app tray making finding specific apps a
little tricky instead of one menu that
displays all of your apps your app
shortcuts are scattered among your home
pages you can easily make folders to
organize them but if you like to
download a lot of apps you're going to
have a lot of home pages
there's an eight megapixel camera on the
spine near the power button which takes
decently sharp but washed out photos and
a front-facing 1.6 megapixel one that
produces similar quality selfies
performance was fast and smooth for
simple tasks but it's suffered from many
performance hiccups like unresponsive
screens app crashes and Wi-Fi
connectivity issues these may all be
addressed in future over-the-air updates
but for now it makes it hard to
recommend for the price you're better
off looking at other small tablets for
more details check out my full review on
cnet once again I'm xiomara Blanco and
this is going to first look at the
Lenovo yoga tablet to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
