depending on where you are on the planet
Earth my name is Steven Beecham producer
of the Apple byte extra crunchy podcast
with your host mr. Brian Tong yeah
what's up everybody we got a groovin we
are moving and grooving today back in
the studio here live in living color in
the same room beachin tong rappin Apple
byte extra crunchy episode 100 and I
think 14 Couture say Thursday 14 at our
sale all right so you guys and gals who
are listening know this this is the show
Apple white extra crunchy it's
everything Apple it's all the good all
the bad it's an extension of our weekly
video show but this is where we got to
dive in dig a little deeper and new
stories pop up I think we cannot start
this show without talking about net
neutrality
it was just repealed the Obama era rules
for net neutrality were just overturned
in a vote that was expected three to two
and I'm pretty pissed off about that
yeah I think extremely lame other than
corporations and that small at least
those three FCC board members who put
that vote through I the majority of the
internet is frustrated about this and
here's the thing net neutrality let me
I'll just kind of give the quick
synopsis what by repealing or removing
net neutrality what it does is it allows
providers like Comcast AT&amp;amp;T internet
providers to either throttle block or
prioritize what goes through their pipes
meaning quicker access to certain sites
priority to get information from
services that pay for it it is
completely made this right a corporate
run entity now there are no there is
really no oversight the only thing they
have to do is just tell us that they're
going to block something or tell us that
are going to prioritize something but
they can do whatever they want this
hurts small businesses this does hurt
innovation this is kind of their
long-term implications and we're not
gonna see this switch flipped right away
it's something that's gonna happen let's
say I think around February they're
gonna obviously there's going there's
going to be people that are gonna modify
what happened
it'll look differently no matter what
the internet that we have today will
look different in the future it won't be
an overnight switch I think what happens
is maybe in six months nine months
something funky is gonna happen you're
like why is this what's going on here
this is not and people want emo sleep
alone even realize it right but
someone's gonna be like what what what's
going on like why is this slower wise
it's not and then all of a sudden you're
gonna hear a story about how oh yeah we
prioritize this this site or this
service now it's stuff like that that is
very subtle we've never had to think
about it before but we're going to have
to think about it now and it's really
disappointing it it's fundamentally they
can talk about on the surface yeah you
can buy a burrito you can still you know
surf the internet like the FCC head or
chair I guess a Jeep I made like a
quirky tone-deaf stupid-ass video of him
really trying to be goofy about the fact
that things will be the same after these
net neutrality the current rules that
were in place were overturned
he just basically comes off as looking
like a huge d-bag trying to as if he
wants us to like him and believe him
that he's giving us the right direction
it's absurd if you look it up um yeah
this is a guy who likes to do interviews
with a giant Nestle Quik coffee cup
which is ridiculous he's into Jesus you
can tell he's into himself it's it's par
for the course if you know what I mean
we're not gonna get into that you know
it's funny for for an administration
that is all is cutting regulations from
everything they just added a massive
regulation to the internet which is
completely just uncalled for and you're
just gonna slow everything down and I've
already been seeing a lot of things on
Instagram and like you know other places
that they're they're fake things but
they're they're kind of like
foreshadowing the future like I saw an
Instagram if you go through I went
what's going through someone's stories
and then I got to one thing that said if
you want to access to Instagram stories
pay $5 you know it's like stuff like
that is possible I mean I'm not saying
it's gonna happen but stuff like that is
possible you know well they think they
can even this doesn't mean it's going to
happen yet but I'm sorry my brain is all
over the place today but even in other
countries that that basically unlimited
net neutrality rules and allowed
corporation
to take control and do what they deem is
important to them cuz what do
corporations care about making money
it's all about that Chetta they don't
care they really don't care because in
their brain they're like hey you're
still getting Internet we're just gonna
control it how we the way that we want
to control it so you have prioritization
of services maybe maybe they break down
your plans where you're gonna actually
you might have to pay extra to use video
streaming services right this is a real
possibility this is not made-up stuff
we're not making this up this could
actually happen all the provider has to
do these internet providers have to do
is just decide they want to do business
differently and by removing that
neutrality they are going to be able to
do things differently based on height at
the highest bidders and it's going to
happen it won't happen in a month or two
this is one of those stories that people
gonna kind of forget about unless we
keep on talking about it but uh maybe
you won't get to see or listen to a show
like the Apple it won't be it'll be like
lower prioritize oh oh you wanna list
some people might like that act for this
for this episode some people might
actually like that so we just want to
let you know that's what that's what's
going on um with net neutrality this
this battle is by far by no means over
but it did just happen and it did just
drop and it's gonna affect everyone so
that's why I wanted at least kick it off
at the top of the show but we are here
to talk about Apple right yeah is that
it what's the name of the show Apple
byte extra crunchy crunchy that is right
okay I did forget to let you all know
again this is your show the comments are
just going full force right now but to
be a part of the show we have a hotline
hotline bling' well you gotta call us is
that one eight hundred six one six two
six three eight that is to get into our
voicemail system we have plenty of
voicemails this week name where you're
from and your commentary your thoughts
your ideas your suggestions we take it
all and let's just kick things off the
big really the big story from Apple this
week is the launch of the new iMac Pro
there five thousand dollar machine again
just saw the price tag and I was like
I'm sure it's a 5k scream so you got to
charge five thousand dollars per you
quite honestly I'm actually not hating
on the iMac Pro from a standpoint
if you stack up you know the specs and
what's involved in this machine let's
just talk about the raw power here the
base model I'm not gonna go through
everything because you don't want to
hear all this
the base model of 3.2 gigahertz eight
core Intel Xeon processor there's going
to be multiple configurations an eight
core a ten core there's also gonna be an
18 core available later on a 14 core
there's multiple configurations
available I think someone even specked
out the highest iMac Pro you could you
could get beefed up to the max and it
can go as high as $13,000 if you want
again this is cater to the pros but what
what I also there's two other things
right the base model comes with one
terabyte of solid-state drive storage
it's kind of crazy Radeon Pro Vega 56
with 8 gigs of memory so that that's
just the baseline the model that they've
been giving to reviewers is a 10 core
model with 16 gigs of video memory it's
even a better SPECT machine than the
base model $5,000 now I think this is
gonna be a beast even based on
performance results marques Brownlee and
Jonathan Morrison caught the machine
basically a week before anyone else did
favorite youtubers awesome dudes um
j-mo is a buddy of mine so I gotta give
a shout out to him but what happens is
here is they SPECT it out and basically
on the multi-core geek bench score the
iMac by Mac Pro 10 core model has a
multi-core threads thread score of
37,000 400 now yeah that's just a big
number but if you compare that to
performance of the current iMac 5k it's
a 93 percent increase in performance so
these are beasts you just have to pay
for the other thing about this is if
you're not the only thing I don't like
about this is in the past at least the
Mac Pro line or the Power Mac line when
it was the g4 the g5 it was at least
within reason for a user to be able to
you know pay two thousand three thousand
dollars it wasn't a five thousand dollar
machine that was not up
gradable that's the biggest issue I have
this is gonna be a machine that maybe
corporations are going to invest in you
know hi and it's gonna be able to handle
virtual reality 360-degree video a
rendering and outputting you know these
amazing videos that people are shooting
for k8k videos it's gonna be able to
crunch right through that but this is
not really for your general even
prosumer even for a it's it's borderline
prosumer so that's that's my biggest
issue and the other thing that I've
talked to you all about on this show is
the reason why I was frustrated by the
iMac Pro more than anything else is this
was an indication of what Apple's idea
and apples vision of a professional
computer was moving forward that's why
after the Mac Pro garbage-can design we
never saw something for four years they
were set on the iMac Pro being the pro
machine and then it was in April of 2014
where they came out and they're like you
know what we might have made a mistake
with the iMac our sorry we might have
made a mistake with a Mac Pro we're
going to build a modular Mac Pro it'll
come sometime down the road we don't
have an exact timeline not even a year
so it may come out on 2018 it might come
out in 2019 we really don't know and it
will be modular so you will be able to
expand it because that's what a real pro
wants prosumer iMac Pro maybe but it's
still a little high in price an actual
Pro yeah they want that but they want
expandability customization the ability
to put in cards to do different things
sound cards audio cards customized
graphic cost cards more RAM you can't do
that with this iMac once you buy it
that's what it is
and it's so great it's gonna be a great
performing machine but like it like many
Apple products there's always this
caveat that you're like oh like why are
they doing this I just this is a beefed
up iMac more than it is an iMac Pro in
my opinion that is out of the range of a
of the general consumer I think
sometimes we sometimes I'm not gonna
call out people but when you get access
to this stuff and you can just like play
with it the sense of reality of like
actually going to a store and dropping
five thousand dollars on it that's not
normal for your average consumer No
it just isn't so you people I think we
allowed a you know the reviewers in
general lose that perspective there are
seduced by the fact that this is an
amazing machine but are they gonna buy
it most of them aren't and I even did
just to get some idea of where your
brains or thinking I put up polls on
Twitter all the time I asked this
morning the day that the iMac Pro comes
out how many of you will actually be
buying an iMac Pro so I put up this
Twitter link and this is the results
right now it's still early but it's
around nine hundred votes only twelve
percent of respondents said yes and
eighty eight percent of respondents said
no oh wow that's huge said they I like
to say that's a big sign - yeah I like
to call it yes or pass 12 percent said
yes yes BAE 88 percent said pass and it
doesn't mean this is a failure if Apple
is really just trying to target that
small market fine but even at 12 percent
if you had your general Pro market you
would at least see maybe like a third of
people say yes we're talking about 10%
people saying yes
yeah and that is not a product that
resonates with either of general
consumers which maybe it's not for but
even pro consumers we the professionals
want this it should be higher than 12
percent I would bet this twelve percent
of the people who've been actually
waiting for this to come out and like
they're excited about it you know it's
like something in the they've been
planning to purchase like it's been in
their brain like once they thought they
were ready to do it yeah like they've
been in you know on their radar for a
while and they can't wait for it so so
there you go first orders if you do
order this the first orders I'm thinking
like Star Wars when I say that the first
orders arrive on December the 27th the
14 core and 18 cores I think they said
they're somewhere around six to eight
weeks out so those will be coming later
the other of course Apple had to do this
the other caveat about the iMac Pro
there's an it does get a new keyboard in
a mouse that has that whole like space
black deep black I do like the break you
know graphite looking color they
included for the first time the first
ever Apple licensed
black lightning cable oh wow slow clap
that was amazing Thank You Apple for the
black lightning cable if you search on
Amazon a black lightning cable has been
around for quite some time for six bucks
it is Apple m-phy certified and it only
cost six dollars and thirty cents so
thank you Apple for the black official
how much is unofficial the Apple ones
play what around I'm around twenty bucks
or thirty bucks depending on the length
of cable yeah thank you thank you for
that we really there's good one on
Amazon that's well I found this one for
$11.99 I found one for like six bucks
earlier I'm some other cool stuff
obviously new iMac Pro gotta have more
power you've always got to bring new
software with new hardware that's in the
past that hasn't always been the case
Apple released a new version of Final
Cut Pro 10 that's not Final Cut Pro X
mmm Final Cut Pro 10 it's version ten
point four it brings support for 360
degree VR video editing HDR video
editing H EVC which is their new kind of
high quality high compressed video codec
that is used as part of Mac OS high
sierra and much more so they're giving
us some more control tools and more
power great thing again I think a lot of
the momentum has moved away from Final
Cut Pro because they haven't had these
tools it'll be interesting to see how
much of an impact that makes but there
are plenty of creative professionals
that will stay in the Mac platform but
if you talk about it in general I think
a lot of creatives because Apple hasn't
done anything significant in the pro
mark for literally four years they've
actually moved on other platforms this
is still like iMovie the way the videos
laid out on the timeline cuz it kind of
looks like that
I can't tell it's still high if anyone
that used Final Cut Pro 10 it's like an
I don't want to say it exactly like it's
like an iMovie how about this there are
remnants that make it feel like iMovie
Pro they have done a lot of improvements
to it ice I do like the real-time you
know rendering on Final Cut but that's
probably one of the best things about it
but yeah it still has a an iMac pro feel
but I after its evolved in some of the
new things that they've done to it I
don't I don't feel like calling an iMac
pro anymore I got to give them credit on
that one yeah yeah so I'm looking at the
screenshot here
looks more like like premier like you
know like a traditional timeline kind of
thing yeah so you you do you do have
Final Cut Pro still a great prop but
most of our interaction 99% of our team
is is using a premiere now yeah and
there's one person one percent as one
dude I think we were waiting it took too
long for them to give us a product that
we wanted that we needed that that was
best for our workflow so that that's why
we moved on from that and then um the
other thing this is kind of interesting
not that everyone's gonna do this from
the software standpoint snapchat just
released a new app called lens studio
it's called the lens studio app for Mac
there's even like a video clip that
shows it in that article and it it's
basically a snapchat filter that you can
build on your Mac and then actually
publish it with like a special code that
people so although snapchat may not
officially support it it'll it creates
like a code that's integrated into the
app that then you can then use send it
off to friends it can be shared and then
they can use play with your little
snapchat lens creation well I think
that's that's pretty cool I mean that's
gonna create a lot of new I want it that
someone is someone pitched the beat easy
the beat easy hair snapchat lens why are
we doing that at CES yeah I'm not the
one that's gonna pitch that because
that's really self-indulgent is this
available now yeah they just released
that app I want to make the bTW hair
emoji thingy
someone's got this is this is how you
know if it's gonna get made if our
actual marketing department listens to
this show yeah they're not gonna get it
made I'm just being real with y'all all
right let's take a little breather here
we've got to show love for our sponsors
that keep this show poppin moving and
also you the audience that continues to
watch it in large numbers that's why we
get sponsors cuz they're like oh we want
our goods to be talked about on the

sweet
you got that got it got it alright let's
keep on rollin through the show the
other big news of the week without a
doubt come on Apple acquires Shazam oh
man yeah they acquired them for a
roughly 400 million dollars it was funny
because an article said I think back in
2015 Shazam was actually I think their
value was estimated at 1 billion dollars
are you serious I'm serious
how did they get a deal well bet they
didn't get a deal when they were valued
at 1 billion but they got a deal with
Apple two years later for for honey
this happens like when a product is hot
right before you really know what how
pop sometimes the popularity dies after
that time right
but Shazam was purchased by Apple for
four hundred million dollars I think
what's gonna be interesting here is to
see how this all plays out specifically
because Shazam is already plugged into
the Apple music service and Siri in fact
as far back as iOS 8 whenever you ask I
know I don't want to say because I might
set off people's devices when you ask
the S lady or a guy depending on the
voice you said to you know what's the
name of the song it's actually using
Shazam as a third party a filter corning
partner to get that information that's
not Syria at work it's
Ceri using Shazam so that's already been
integrated into Apple's ecosystem I know
we'll see a much tighter integration but
Shazam goes beyond music you know it
pulls up the music videos I I can't
remember if it pulls up the lyrics of
the song as well I swear there's an
option to see the lyrics yeah but there
was there's music streaming on it too
yes yeah awesome you know and so Shazam
not only does that it can identify TV
shows TV ads we know that Apple is
obviously more than just music so
there's kind of maybe some interesting
ways that they can integrate this in
it's not gonna be a game changer or
anything that's gonna be like I'm just
curious
Shazam integration is or whatever
improvements they make is not gonna have
me say I've got to have Apple music I
still not a subscriber yeah I think the
reason why they bought is just cuz
Shazam its name is just so popular you
know it's like it's the brand identity
is really strong so it makes sense for
them to buy it and then you know I know
Google has this ability already just in
the Google search bar you know if you
just play a song to it it'll tell you
what song it is so well I know I know
the next feature that's coming to the
Nick the the next iPhone what's that
it's easy it's the ability to have your
phone just sitting down there with a
always-on display and then if it hears a
song it will show you that song on the
display it's a feature that is on the
pixel 2 phone already that's where I saw
it I was like racking my head like weird
I've seen that before where was that oh
the pixel y'all haven't seen that before
the other thing that how this deal plays
out is what will Apple do in regards to
other services we know Shazam is already
integrated into Spotify as well it's it
has its own app on the Android platform
this is not something Apple has offered
Apple has an apple music app on Android
so I guess that's that would blend me to
think that Shazam will still live in its
current state but I could see them strip
it out of Spotify because that's a
complete that's a co-editor competitor
yeah like why so these other streaming
companies are probably gonna get worried
you know oh man we're gonna lose all the
Shazam customer or maybe Apple raises
their pricing as prices for them to use
for Zam integration I just because Apple
is set
an island and they want you to be on
their Island I'm curious if if they'll
retract some of those deals I'm trying
to think right off the top my head when
have they done anything similar like
that from some service that is so
broadly used I mean I know they've
purchased kind of other apps and killed
those apps but it wasn't like as big of
a name as Shazam
yeah yeah I know I don't see them
killing Shazam just because the brand
you know the brand name is so big
there's even like a stupid game show
with what's his name Jamie Foxx hosts it
right this is yeah yeah yeah that's the
next show that's coming Apple that's
coming Apple music guys that's so so
we'll see how that all plays out but
it's just interesting it's their biggest
acquisition our biggest big-name
acquisition since they got on board with
Beats for three billion dollars I think
that was back in 2014 ish if I recall I
can't lose I won't break up the crib
dance yep that was Drake and Tyrese get
all crazy and happy and a Jimmy Iovine
for a vine and also for the fifth time
on the show watch Defiant ones on HBO
it's fantastic and they talk about the
crib dance and the whole that whole deal
that went down and everything and other
deals going on Apple this kind of
stirred up the internet a little bit it
was reported that Apple was investing in
company finis R and who exactly is finis
R finis R makes one of the important
components that are part of the true
depth camera in the iPhone 10 right now
but what Apple basically clarified or
Finnis are clarified is that Apple
didn't invest in the company it was a
three hundred ninety million dollar I
guess pay or contribution to them to a
in an agreement to lock down future
orders and why is this important well
the company makes like I said a
component of that tree that sensor it's
a it's a vertical cavity surface
emitting laser let's say that one more
time it's a vertical cavity surface
emitting laser Wow
shoots the laser on your face I can't
wrap my head around it vertically it's
fine how many you totally don't have to
so
this is a commitment to basically say
hey we want to work with you in the
future and also to prevent other
companies we heard once Apple did their
face ad recognition that Android
manufacturers were looking phone
manufacturers were instantly looking at
facial recognition this prevents them
from basically making the deal with
those Android manufacturers and and
giving up their components so it's like
a retainer like they're giving them some
retainer cash hey you guys don't go
don't go somewhere else and build some
stuff just we want you for us and this
is interesting because I don't know
about y'all face ID over time is just
not as good as touch ID and the only
reason I say that is I think a lot of
times everyone was used to like okay I
need to hold my phone in my face but and
they'll do it for maybe a week or two
but I'm telling you like I don't hold my
phone to my face all the time and there
I really feel like in general now face
ID doesn't work for me on the first time
because I like to just kind of casually
pick up my phone yeah where I used to
just touch my touch ID button it was
money I was in face ID works when you
hold it up properly but even in some
late conditions it doesn't my face ID
probably works the way it should that I
like maybe 2/3 of the time but 1/3 to
maybe I don't want to say half the time
but more than one-third of the time face
ID doesn't unlock my phone and it's
annoying do you have that do you have it
enabled all the time or do ya just
turned it off I know I have it enabled
all the time so then I have to punch in
my code and that's annoying
it's just that I'm curious what what
your experiences are because I think
everyone was like yeah face ID works
because yeah you're like holding it up
and you want you're using the phone the
way that you're training but I want to
use the phone that way that I'm used to
like I just want to pick it up and it's
already ready to roll and that's not the
case and it's over time it's actually
gotten annoying for me yeah so that
sounds very annoying I that would drive
me crazy
hey Jonna Craig our new boss he talks
about his issues when like driving or
something you want to change a song you
have to go through a whole thing like
move your head so it just sounds it
sounds very annoying yeah is a pain in
the butt the other thing that I wanted
to jump on as we talked about face this
Finnis our true depth camera component
and an Android jumping on face
recognition the thing is that not
everyone in Android is drumming on face
recognition because this story just came
out we were we were all lusting after
this whole fingerprint sensor under the
glass forever right yes like that was
the thing that I was like you know the
iPhone that's what I want
honestly but okay fine face ID that's
apples direction Apple said they weren't
looking at a fingerprint sensor on the
glass at all they're committed to face
ID and it will get better
synaptics announced this is a company
that has their first in display
fingerprint sensor the company synaptics
announced this week that they're
launching with a top-five smartphone
ommm and what does that mean well that
means we're going to see the first
fingerprint sensor under glass we'll see
how good it is that that obviously
remains to be seen but they say it's a
top five company and they also call out
the demand in this press conference for
bezel free OLED infinity displays oh man
let me get my sound effect here so what
company has a bezel free OLED infinity
display Samsung its Samsung Samsung has
got to be the company that's gonna roll
out with this thing next year so it's
really gonna be now and find this
interesting it's gonna be a battle like
which is actually better face ID or
fingerprint through the sensor now we
know the numbers they say like
technically one in 50,000 people can
unlock your fingerprint sensor iPhone
and the face ID is one in a million but
how many stories have we heard of
someone stealing someone's phone and
being able to unlock it with their
finger I haven't heard a signal one a
single story about that you would have
not won but we heard first week iPhone X
came out iPhone 10 there's that at least
ten ten stories kids other people kids
other people being able to hackers so
you know although yeah it is technically
more secure in a day to day situation is
it really more secure it's probably
arguably less secure in a day to day
situation you know if your brother or
your sister kinda
lock it yeah your son or kid so either
way this sets up a really interesting
dynamic between which platform has the
better security from a standpoint of not
only secure sorry unlocking your phone
not only from a security standpoint but
from a speed standpoint mm-hmm I think
in most cases speed is speed is the
priority because we never complain about
the security of touch ID in the first
place we never did never did no one has
I'm so used to it now and it's just like
second nature it's easy yeah I mean
speed it's everything to do with speed
if you guys are watching this I'm I'm
curious what you think in the comments
like does would you rather have a
fingerprint sensor under the glass
versus face ID knowing that most likely
the fingerprint sensor will be faster
and is in one spot and is a home screen
versus face ID being a little slower but
you having to use your phone differently
I'm curious what people are thinking so
well if if if having the the button the
touch ID or the fingerprint ID on the
screen if that gets rid of that little
bezel that everyone hates on the iPhone
X and that's a win-win for everyone
that's all we'll see how this plays out
it's really to two different totally
different ideas and who it's like VHS
versus beta like beta was better beta
beta was better
yeah but VHS won out like HD vs or what
ray yeah HD DVD versus blu-ray someone's
gotta win all right um just some quick
updates Apple released iOS 11 point 2
point 1 to update that home kit remote
sharing fix where someone could
basically get access and unlock your
smart locks and other smart devices
remotely that wasn't you
iOS 11 point 2 point 1 also fixes this
auto focus issue that's some people with
iPhone tens 8 and 8 plus users were
experiencing where while you're focusing
you would kind of almost priority or
switch between the two lenses and you
could see your image is kind of
fluctuating it was annoying they fixed
that and then the third thing is a lot
of Sprint customers were recently unable
to use wife
by calling once iOS 11.2 rolled out this
was as far back as the iPhone 6 all the
way the iPhone 8 plus it was a carrier
issue they updated that so in case you
were wondering what the heck was
happening Sprint has that fix and has
rolled out that as a carrier update so
just just want to let you know that is
good calling over Wi-Fi is very
important man it is we tell you cuz you
know there's a lot of times in a dead
spot and I forgot Wi-Fi I'm stoked
Shamal inland in the periscope says why
do always need a fix for the fix there's
been a fix for a fix I think I think re
believe four or five weeks in a row now
it's funny I mean you fix something in a
break something else it's you know
that's that's just a problem in our new
technologically advanced society I think
it's also different than when it's a
very public bug like the eye bug that
was atrocious yes I still see all right
um we're gonna skip a couple stories but
I want to jump to before we get to our
calls the last story of our show this is
always fun this is Apple related the
Google at the top Google searches for
the year beach you can use the second
link as it actually is the display from
Google's article it'll be able for us to
see but um this is what was training in
2017 what it before you look at this
Beach so are you looking at no don't let
hasn't loaded okay what do you think was
the search term what do you think was
searched more in 2017 iPhone 10 or
iPhone 8 I would have to say iPhone 10
okay well if you look at the top five
oh my god search trends in across all of
search not just in different categories
officers number one hurricane
Irma yes all right very important
obviously number two was iPhone eight
you know I 3 was Eiffel 10 I think
that's because the iPhone 8 was out
longer than the iPhone acts and the
iPhone X just came out a couple months
ago so maybe you know this this is the
entire year so that was part of it and
only see what the other part of it was
what's that
everyone thought that it was gonna be
called iPhone 8 for the longest time so
really people were already searching for
iPhone 8 before the rumours of iPhone 10
were out and if they had listened to a
like the Apple bayit extra crunchy that
that iPhone X movement would have been
like maybe maybe iPhone future would
have made that list of people if if
everyone was listening future would have
made that list yeah but they weren't
well just just a reminder we did come up
with iPhone app you did come up with
iPhone acts before mean I don't know if
I did but maybe public maybe on a public
forum we said it on this show we marked
a date we probably marked a day thanks
gonna give it to you woman does Matt
Lauer number four I wonder why it's so
sad man it is sad
let's go over those two computer tech
consumer tech horrible consumer tech
number one obviously iPhone eight number
two i phone 10 number three
Nintendo switch number four Samsung
Galaxy S eight and number five Xbox one
X hmm those were the top consumer tech
trends for the year there's a lot of
other stuff are you so don't look at
everything really quickly okay I want to
we haven't looked at everything do you
know what the number one song might have
been that's a good question I don't know
just throw out something I'm gonna say
uh what's her name Taylor Swift
look what you mean though very good that
was that was number five that was number
five I'm gonna give you props we've been
breaking the top five is it uh cardi B
no actually surprisingly I don't know
why not
J spa seeped oh ah okay yeah yeah number
one yeah number one gotcha all right
she'll get to the calls memes wait can
we just go through the air lines mean
was it like I think it was the dude like
getting pulled off the plane I don't
know okay I didn't see that let me click
on that one real quick yeah let me see
what what is this all about
I don't know no it doesn't have any just
has like data information nothing about
what it is all right till the cols y'all
to the calls thank you guys all for
calling we got a bunch of good calls
today remember if you all want to be a
part of the show
comment/question all that good stuff
you'd be on these dope life dope calls
we had a lot of people requesting
collaborations which we probably are not
gonna take them up on but uh thanks for
calling anyway there we haven't done
people okay let's just get this out of
the way we haven't done a music video
for any new products recently because we
were told from the uppers that we can't
do it yes like parodies specifically so
we're gonna it's gonna take a little
more time but we're working on some new
ideas a music video will return in 2018
but the the parodies will no longer live
on week imparity an Apple commercial
which we've silly
yeah which we've done but the music
video specific parodies are are dead
which is a bummer which we were we've
fought about this for probably six
months at least seven months yeah we had
a blast we did like five of them right
oh no I'm saying we've we fought oh yes
we've been talking about lawyers have
this way of talking until you just give
up because there's gonna tell you no but
talk to you in circles over and over and
over they're not trying to hear you
they're just trying to tell you and then
you're like screw it we're gonna do it
differently the last meeting with some
of the things I said didn't make sense
like of course they didn't get that so
of course it did we're gonna we're just
gonna stop it before we get fired but
their their argument was like there's
there's an argument for whether or not
it's funny or not I mean come on they
were funny when you have a lawyer that
doesn't follow tech and doesn't even
know what the Apple bite is and they
said this wasn't funny to me go read the
comments get that out of here I don't
even respect that all right let's do
these calls here we go number one this
guy is very excited about his Apple
watch hey Beach and tongue spread foot
from East Lansing Michigan say one of my
favorite features of the Apple watch
that I've never heard mentioned is the
flashlight on when you get your Apple or
when you get to watch face just swipe up
to the little utility screen find the
flashlight and it is the most awesome
soft perfect little light not too bright
we're getting from the bathroom to your
bed or in dark spots it's just fantastic
and then the coolest thing is to turn it
off don't look for buttons just put your
palm over the
face and it turns off automatically
super-sweet thought I'd mentioned it
thanks for the job you guys do oh yeah
dude a remix he did a speed up version
of Apple bite he's like it was his own
that was like his own Apple bite extra
crunchy bit that was his show yeah that
was his show thanks for calling uh yes
the I only just never used the
flashlight because I actually don't
think it's bright enough for me but he
didn't make a point it's not too bright
it's a nice glow and you can oh he
didn't mention you can swipe it to get a
dimmer light and then one I think is red
what I use none of them that's amazing I
wonder what the red lights for it's not
it's you know I mean maybe you want to
read you maybe you want to go visit
Amsterdam for a night you know for sexy
time or so here's the regular there's
blue blinking - huh oh that's the
blinking one and then this is the red
one you can't if you can't I can't see
him in the dark it doesn't help me see
anything yeah I always use my iphone
flashlight to get around in the dark
maybe it's my eyes that are that are
having issues I'm not gonna make jokes
like that no no no I just I just picked
up on where you were joking about okay
it's horrible it was yeah no you're not
somebody no you're some people don't
even oh we're talking about stuff
I literally thought like you're you had
bad eyesight but I realized what you
were joking about okay next call here we
go hey beat on the show I just wanted to
call and tell you about my experience
with Apple pay cash they're different
greatly from years Berrien I know that
you had talked about how it was a pain
in the butt three had to go and enter in
the last four social all this other
stuff I think it's because you didn't
have dual factor authentication turned
on though like I said I think because
I've had that turn on on my phone for a
while literally all I had to do was go
in and turn on like I just went into the
settings I saw an Apple pay cash it
clicked on it so set up now I clicked on
that I had a ring come up for like five
10 seconds like a loading ring and then
it came up and said you're all set up
like that was my whole setup like it was
it so I
no like I said maybe this gives you to
have the dual factor authentication
turned on so that's why but you know I
guess maybe experience it'll differ
based on you know different settings you
have on your phone um my name is Lou
come from cigarette style by the way
love your show
thanks cool thanks Luke cool yeah that
makes sense he had double no what is it
double superior yeah and III know I know
that's why it was but I just was like
damn it was crazy yeah because you were
putting them like your social signal I
put in my last 40 just my social
security then they wanted to scan my
driver's license and they want me to
punch in my entire social security
number I felt really comfortable doing
that or like send us your birth
certificate I felt very comfortable
doing that yeah that's scary man okay
cool okay next call let's go
hi Brian hybrid Jersey I'm calling with
a few suggestions I mean I love the show
and it's great but I think that Brian
this year is to bring too much on Apple
if you look on Wikipedia you can see a
lot of like every iOS release and all
the bugs I think it's just Twitter and
everyone's just making a big fuss over
thank you love the show bye okay we
think yeah sure sure
thing to check Wikipedia to make sure
that we can cross John I've never seen
an iOS released with literally like four
to five weeks of straight updates to the
updates to the updates the updates yeah
I've literally never seen that me
neither
like four or five weeks consecutively
sometimes even in less than a week nah
yeah but granted the Internet does put a
microscope on it a little more but these
were like you can't the I issue is a
thing like a phone not working in cold
weather that's kind of a thing that's a
thing man I've never heard of that
like literally affecting a line of
phones because of software like where
people literally couldn't use their
phones yeah sure if you're maybe in like
under in Antarctica underwater
but not a widespread issue that actually
genuinely affects all phones of that
nature No
so yeah I mean that's a giant part I
mean it's wintertime that's a huge part
of the population not able to use their
phone
yeah for however long it was okay we
have a couple more here we go each and
uh what's going on guys all this home
pod talk um I don't know if you guys
have talked about put the apples trying
to make the best sounding speaker but
then Sonam says the Sonos one which
apparently is going to open up into the
Apple ego system eventually probably not
gonna be as tightly integrated but
there's another nail in their coffin as
far as I'm concerned I think you guys
know at least Tong I think but yeah I
think I've broken down the home pod more
than enough and what it has and what it
doesn't have if Apple's biggest
differentiator is superior sound quality
for 349 I don't again I'd never
underestimate the power of Apple by
Apple loyalists and fans but series not
smart enough it's it's just not and it
doesn't support and it's only has Apple
music natively out of the gates to
support on device so the third thing
you're like ours is the best sounding
not really smart speaker I think people
care more about a speaker that the home
assistant is where it's at it's where
everything is moving totally where
everything is moving and I don't think
it's at 3:49 it's it's not it's not
compelling it's just not compelling as a
product and now I'm just sitting here
hearing hearing you talk about that and
I'm thinking like you're gonna stream
mp3s through this high quality speaker
you know III sound like crap or AAA sees
you know they're not they're not FLAC
files they're not high res file so if
people people that already have high
quality speakers already have high
quality speakers exactly that and so to
make it more compelling you need to have
a high quality speaker with the best
assistant supporting the most services
you don't that's how it becomes
compelling yeah and we don't need okay
fine best sounding speakers for their
size what about
people people with homes the other
systems and stuff like they don't need
this yeah What did he say about Sonos
though like the Sonos one has a Amazon
integration right now or I don't want to
say the word but you know the a word oh
yeah yeah it's already integrated into
their dual speaker system they're their
speakers don't look as large as the home
pod so we'll see how that is but it's
still using you know beamforming to
figure out like the layout of rooms and
stuff like that or to listen so again
I'm going to buy and home pod to review
it but I right now I guarantee you I'm
going to return it because because I
already have a Google home in an Amazon
system that works perfectly fine and
supports everything yeah yeah I forgot
to even talk about smart home support
yeah so they all do it better right now
they do sound is not gonna convince me
to buy it or keep it okay let's go to
the next call we got two left here we go
someone's all is this a live yeah it's
live yeah we could just get up and walk
out of the room and still be streaming
here we go hey this is uh Damien James
again I'm from Minot Kentucky and anyway
I had a really good idea for a Apple
watch series for whenever that may be
released of a really cool future that
could actually save lives and bring a
whole lot more really to what it can and
can't be but I noticed okay I get to get
right into it I noticed that the Apple
watch obviously has the SOS future how
cool would it be if I had the ability to
detect like a stroke or something like
had the ability to detect if you were to
pass out or have low levels of blood
pressure or blood sugar whatever the
condition may be maybe it can have a
sensor that could affect that and
prevent you for passing out or even
dying give them I think it would be a
really cool to mention on the show and
give me a shout I'm on Facebook and you
can call me back he actually gave us our
number we always played that part there
were two people that gave us a phone
number this week that's true this is
some really great stuff I just want to
bring up to the tension for listeners
well that Apple did launch recently
there Apple heart study where basically
you can sign in and they're using the
masses you know Apple watch users to
build data and information and the idea
is to detect irregular heart rhythms
depending on let's say if you're just
sitting down doing nothing and all of a
sudden you have extremely irregular
heart rhythm they're using that to kind
of link that to warnings and be able to
build systems and get a larger knowledge
base of how our bodies are reacting in
different conditions to warn us hey
maybe maybe a stroke is coming up you
know your heart or whatever this is I'd
like to know that know it so that's what
they're really doing with this Apple
heart study the other product that is
out there is this really interesting
thing called the cardia band Katie I
know I was gonna be like dude seriously
one that one okay so when this product
came out actually wanted to do a music
video with it but guess what we couldn't
it's like ah that would have been fun
called the cardia ban are you for real
khadi be who you be um so it's the first
of its kind it's an FDA cleared clinical
grade wearable EKG band that replaces
your actual Apple watch band so it does
an al instant analysis that's tied to an
app as well so there are things that are
out there as these studies and data is
collected from everyday users constantly
we're gonna start building a knowledge
base and so to your point this is this
is coming soon and everything you said
and thought of it's it's happening right
now it's happening right now there's
pretty much a spread out now cuz you
might have thought he had yeah that idea
but yeah we talked about this a long
time ago where you know apples really
trying to get into the health the health
area you know health care and there's
probably gonna be a time where you walk
into a hospital and they're gonna check
you in and they're gonna give you an
Apple watch and that's gonna monitor all
your vitals and your heartbeat and
everything blood pressure
yeah it'll send like an alert send an
alert to the nurses if something goes
wrong so that's probably gonna be the
future we're getting there we are again
it's not the sexy
thing but I think it's really important
so yeah that's cool all right everybody
I think that's gonna do it for doing
that we have almost one where it's real
quick oh sorry I send us a message take
care oh you say you'll miss us because
we tilt we basically told you when we're
