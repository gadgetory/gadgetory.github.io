than three minutes I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update Apple dished
out a ton of news tuesday at its press
event yes Apple announced the ipad mini
we can finally put the years of mini
ipad rumors to rest but apple also
unveiled a new macbook pro I Mac mac
mini computer and the biggest surprise
of all Apple came out with a
fourth-generation iPad and the
third-generation iPad that came out in
March this year that's just six months
ago poof it's gone and replaced but
before we get into that drama first
details of the ipad mini this super
light and thin tablet has a 7.9 inch
screen and a price starting at three
hundred and thirty dollars for a Wi-Fi
only version with 16 gigs of storage
that model arrives november second if
you want one that has a 4g wireless
connection it's going to cost you four
hundred and sixty dollars it comes out
two weeks later on november 16th the
online pre-orders begin this Friday the
iPad Mini has the same screen resolution
as the ipad 2 so no Retina display they
had to leave off something right it
comes in white and black and you can do
all the same things you could with a
larger iPad the big competition in this
space has been Google's Nexus 7 which is
cheaper at two hundred dollars so Apple
took a few jabs at the nexus 7 showing
that the iPad Mini is lighter since it's
made of aluminum and it has more screen
real estate the mini has 10 hours of
battery life which is the same as the
new fourth-generation ipad it has even
been a year an apple just revamped the
ipad line again this fortune ipad has
twice the computing and graphics power
of the previous model it has that new
lightning connector as you would expect
the price stays the same starting at
five hundred dollars and it can also be
pre-ordered friday reaction to this
fourth ipad has been mixed on twitter
and in our chat rooms you have people
upset that they didn't get a full year
before their version is deemed outdated
and others aren't too bothered since
it's just a speed boost desktop
computers also got a refresh the imac
all-in-one machine has a crazy razor
thin screen five millimeters thick on
the side keep in mind it does curve out
in the back so it's got some junk in the
trunk but it's still slim it starts at
thirteen hundred dollars shipping
november the more portable mac mini
desktop also got an upgraded processor
with more storage it starts at six
hundred bucks available now and the
13-inch macbook pro laptop now has a
Retina Display it's thinner and lighter
than the last macbook the 13 inch pro is
Apple's best selling macbook so of
course it was getting a boost it starts
at seventeen hundred dollars shipping
now lots packed into today's show but if
you want more details we got links to
all these stories on the blog sina com /
