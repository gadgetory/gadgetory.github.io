online based on looking at a person's
browsing history when we find out what
you're interested in and then keeps on
giving you great recommendations based
on the pages that you browse before so
signing up to loom it only takes a
couple of moments so you go to lumiere
deal and you create your account and
then straight away as part of the
installation of the extension which
works together with chrome firefox and
safari your browsing history kinda gets
analyzed and looked at so luminous
pretty pretty quickly what kind of
things you're interested in so in my
case you find some stuff about my music
taste foreign policy stuff take stuff
that I'm interested in things that have
been recently browsing some art stuff
here these are the interests that then
really determine my recommendations
which happen on the next page so
essentially what lumia is in its current
incarnation is a feed of interesting
items that we found for you so based on
my interests that you saw before we
recommend you lots of different things
so you can go back in time and just go
through all the stuff which blooming has
found for me based on these interests I
didn't have to take any boxes or
subscribe to any feeds or follow any
people or something like this it all
does it automatically from then on every
time I'm interested in finding something
new I can go to lumiere and there's
always going to be something interesting
I don't need to update it either so it's
dynamic if my interests change then room
we will change with me at the moment
this is how lumi looks and we try to
give quite a higher information density
lots of different things have different
kind of assets with them some have
pictures some have experts some of
headlines some there's some videos in
there there might be some third-party
websites of like hotels and films and
stuff like this and trailers so we're
trying to make a design which is really
open to
sorts of content that is coming in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
