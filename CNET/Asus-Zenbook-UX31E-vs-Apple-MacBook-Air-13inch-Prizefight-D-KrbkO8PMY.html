and this is a blockbuster battle between
two of the top 13 inch laptops that are
thin it to win it
it's a prize five foot out between the
Azusa Zenbook ux301
and Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Dan the man after a man
senior associate editor Scott it's go
time Stein and Bryant can't go wrong Tom
will take all three judges blind scores
and ABS amounts to nearest tenth each
round the final prize fight score will
be an average of all round using the
same decimal system let's get it started
round 1 is design they say imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery and the
azouz end book has no shame with the
design that could be mistaken for the
MacBook Air with its sleek lines in
teardrop shape that's slightly thicker
now our judges felt opening the laptop
wasn't always as easy but it doesn't
hurt it it's all-metal interior is
impressive with the best-looking Windows
laptop on the market now a sous gets
close but there's still nothing on this
planet that can truly match the design
quality of Apple's unibody MacBook Air
its blade design is still thinner it's
lighter in weight and it's just as
sturdy that air is a beauty that
maintains Apple's iconic look and feel
both of these laptops are amazing
looking but Apple is still a cut above
the rest it gets a perfect 5 and the Zen
book gets a 4.3 next round this features
a soos makes sure it won't falter when
it comes to features it comes loaded
with two USB ports with one beam USB 3.0
an SD card slot for media a micro HDMI
port a higher 1600 by 900 resolution
display plus dongles for Ethernet and
VGA out now the keyboard has no
backlight and tends to be a little
finicky with its shallow keys that
sometimes resulted in keys not
registering his trackpad gets the job
done
Anasuya includes multi-touch gestures
but it's not as responsive as the
MacBook Air at times and that can be
frustrating it's not a deal breaker but
it's still worth mentioning
now the MacBook Air brings two USB ports
and an SD card slot you can use an
Ethernet adapter that takes up a USB and
there's also a mini DisplayPort for
video out but you'll have to purchase
the adapters to do that you'll have a
backlit keyboard for those lonely nights
in the dark and it's multi-touch
trackpad is one of the best that's
extremely smooth and responsive in
comparison to the Zen book but if you
add it all up it's a soos that brings
everything but the kitchen sink the Zen
book gets a 4.7 and the macbook air gets
a for dr averaging two rounds we're tied
next round is performance
both laptops bring 1.7 gigahertz core i5
processors with 4 gigs of ram so we put
these two laptops through CNET's
rigorous tests and you can't dispute the
numbers the MacBook Air outperformed the
Zenbook significantly in our multimedia
multitasking test and perform better in
our Photoshop processing test and our
iTunes encoding test as well both these
laptops are great for everyday use but
the MacBook Air is still the performance
meter for super slim laptops and it gets
a 4.7 while the Zenbook gets a 3.7 round
4 is battery life who has the power last
2 hours an hour battery drain test
Apple's MacBook Air went the distance
with 6 hours and 46 minutes of juice
compared to the Zenbook which was able
to get only 4 hours and 45 minutes
that's a 2 hour difference and it's even
more impressive when the air with the
Glitter winner in both performance and
battery life to air get the perfect 5
and the Zen bug gets hit hard with the
3dr averaging four rounds Apple takes a
big lead but it's not over yet the final
round that decides at all is value these
are premium laptops all state drives and
they won't come cheap but the azuz end
book is doing its best with its
entry-level model that starts at 1099
and in addition to that they're also
including adapters for Ethernet and VGA
out you'll get a carrying case and most
importantly a cleaning cloth now Apple's
MacBook Air 13-inch starts at $12.99
with pretty much the same specs and
that's pretty much all you're going to
get an Ethernet adapter will run you $29
a video out adapter is 19 bucks more and
there's no cleaning cloth Apple's
premium rears its ugly head here
as this takes the final round with the
four and Apple gets a three so let's
average out all five rounds and in a
prize fight that was neck-and-neck Apple
surged ahead in the performance round
and it was just too hard to overcome for
a soos the MacBook Air takes this battle
for points a week the three point nine
and is your prize five winners
I'm Brian Shawn thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time on
