is the largest women's race in the world
with 30,000 runners taking to the hills
of San Francisco but training for the
race is a much lonely road Samantha
Hirsch and crystal Loman ran hundreds of
miles often solo with only their Nike
FuelBand keeping them company that
really pushes you in like lets you know
and you're not just like out on an
aimless run hoping you get a certain
amount of miles the FuelBand tracks
steps calories and overall activity a
new version the fuelband SE launches in
early november and promises to recognize
more activities whether it's yoga or
tennis with greater accuracy for added
motivation runners pair their fuel bands
with mobile apps like Nike Training Club
that's been wonderful and pushing me
along so I make sure that I post all of
my runs to facebook so i can get chairs
along the way those cheers are sent by
friends via social networks and heard by
runners via the app on their phone
running apps are helpful for runners and
trainers alike I'm also able to you know
tap into their Nike Plus account and
just see and maybe check up on them and
make sure that they're actually doing
the run fitness trackers like the
FuelBand cover the basics the very
beginner the person who's still sitting
on the couch should get a fuel band
because that's gonna let them know all
right I have a goal I need to burn X
number of calories more serious runners
may want to consider a GPS watch which
connects two satellites to log your runs
more precisely tomtom offers two models
one for runners that tracks outdoor and
treadmill runs and a multi-sport version
that's designed to track swimming and
cycling as well adidas will start
selling its micoach smart run watch on
November first it features an optical
wrist sensor that can measure your heart
rate if you're in the Nike ecosystem
you'll likely want to stick with its GPS
watch definitely like the split times
that the gps watch has I love knowing my
pace I'm a huge OCD when it comes to
pace I like to stay right home face and
then distance of course the technology
is providing runners with more stats in
the
ever had and enabling beginners to
tackle even marathon distances but there
is a downside you can get overwhelmed
with numbers and spend more time doing
that than actually doing the exercise
instead of being fixated on your wrist
try enjoying those miles in San
Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet for CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
