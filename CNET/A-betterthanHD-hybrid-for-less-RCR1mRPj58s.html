look at the lenovo ideapad yoga 2 pro
now that pretty complicated name means
that this is a sequel to last year's
lenovo ideapad yoga which is one of our
favorite of the first generation of
Windows 8 touchscreen hybrid laptops now
for the yoga too besides adding the pro
name they've done a couple of other
really cool things number one they've
added a backlit keyboard something i
always appreciate but much more
importantly this system now has a better
than HD resolution is a 3200 x 1800
screen and that puts it in the same
category as things like that retina
macbook pro the toshiba kirabook the
google pixel Chromebook or even the
samsung 8 of book 9 plus all those
complicated names basically mean these
are laptops with higher than 1080p
screen resolutions which is something
we're seeing a lot more often the big
difference in this case however is that
you can get that for 999 in a
configuration that's otherwise a basic
ultrabook configuration with an intel
core i5 processor 4 gigs of ram and 128
gig SSD all those other systems i
mentioned with the higher res screens
there are a lot more expensive 1299 1399
1499 and more now why would you want a
higher resolution screen well if you go
into a web browser or anything with text
you can see you can zoom in super tight
on the text and it looks really amazing
if you do a lot of reading especially in
tablet mode you're going to appreciate
that and if you go back to the
traditional desktop mode you'll see that
this is kind of weird doesn't scale
maybe as well as it does in the windows
8 i'll screen or on OS 10 everything is
kind of small over here and if you
launch something like photoshop you can
see the icons here are super super
Tiny's they're gonna have to work your
way around that but it's still a nice
piece of future proofing to have this
new generation of super high res screens
that we're going to see popping up more
and more often now if you're not
familiar with what a yoga does the basic
concept is it looks like an ordinary
laptop and if you're just use like this
you might even never notice that there's
anything unusual about it but if you
pick it up you can bend the screen back
like this and then you keep going and
then you get kind of this kiosk mode
here that's what I kind of called this
and you can just
you know photos and videos without
having the keyboard in the way if you
wanted to you could tilt it up like a
stand like this I'm not sure how super
useful that is but then you keep going
and then you have a tablet the folds
down into a slate on the back is still
have the keyboard and touchpad but
they're deactivated in this Mac mode so
it's a little awkward to have it against
your fingers but it's not really a deal
breaker and still a fairly thin fairly
light fairly powerful tablet that works
just as well as any other Windows 8
tablet which is to say it's not quite an
iPad but for a tablet OS it's pretty
darn good so what no one else is doing
right now is giving you you know very
good ultrabook performance and design
plus the super high risk screen for
anything approaching this price so at
999 I think this guy is a real steal i'm
dan ackerman that i did the lenovo
ideapad yoga 2 pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
