a look at this upcoming Android phone
the first thing that stands out is the
5.7 inch screen it takes up the vast
majority of the front of the device
except for a little cutout for 8
megapixel front facing camera and a chin
bezel on the back are two cameras at 13
megapixels each a fingerprint sensor is
located on the rear one thing missing
from the phone is branding
there are no logos on this device the
back also has magnetic connectors for
accessories similar to some Motorola
phones there's a 360 degree camera that
clicks into place
there's also a magnetic dock accessory
which wirelessly charges the phone the
phone is made out of titanium and
ceramic essential says it does not have
an area for cases on its site because
titanium is more resilient than a lot of
other materials the site features a
slow-motion drop test video to show the
ph1 surviving a fall inside the pH one
runs the same processor that can be
found in the North American version of
the galaxy s 8 the qualcomm snapdragon
835 there are 128 gigabytes of storage
space in the essential phone so it looks
great but what's missing there's no port
for a microSD card to easily add more
storage there's also no 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack although an adapter is
included in the box
there's no mention about the phone being
waterproof on the site the pH one comes
in four colors black grey white and dark
green the essential phone can be
reserved now but only in black or white
it costs six hundred and ninety nine
dollars and if you reserve now you can
pick up a 360 degree camera from an
extra 50 bucks for a total of seven
hundred and forty nine dollars that
combo will eventually cost eight hundred
and ninety eight dollars the pH one will
first ship in the US there is no
official release date yet if you're
wondering what on earth essential is
it's a company started up by Andy Rubin
Rubin built the Android operating system
that Google eventually acquired for more
