the first musical ever written about
living and working in this tech startup
so I guess it's kind of about life in a
company that has lots of interesting
funding lots of dynamic individuals who
are trying to solve a problem that maybe
we didn't even realize needed solving so
I have worked in several startups in
London Silicon Valley over the last kind
of few years and different kind of roles
and I suppose quite predominately in
talent roles so in that time you just
meet lots of different types of people
who work in these kind of up-and-coming
companies it was when we first started
having a conversation about what we like
to make a musical about working in a
start-up we were like okay where shall
human level be and we kind of talked
about the different kind of apps for
different things and we were like how
about an app that sends smells to
different people and we were like well
that's our like brand of humour and
that's our tone great
[Laughter]
audiences look forward to they can look
forward to really really good songs Luke
Liefeld who wrote our music is genuinely
an incredible musician and writes
beautiful songs that are both funny and
also sometimes really moving and lovely
so the music is very good it's big power
pop with lots of parts we were a small
band piano guitar and drums and that
band is called Steven the jobs so they
all dress like Steve Jobs it's gonna
look amazing
do you like fart jokes there's a lot of
fart jokes
[Laughter]
working in the startup sector you do see
a lot of weird things he's in yeah
really odd things I'd say probably one
of the hardest things is when the
company that currently work out one to
beat when we got some of our venture
funding we've installed a sauna and
we've never used it working in startups
there are no rules and it's a great
place to get idealistic people together
and that's what I love about it but
often sometimes with idealism comes a
not a lack of self-awareness but
sincerity that is very easy to maybe
laugh at kindly but also laugh can there
be any other exit strategy for Nosa than
being brought by Elon Musk his name is
Elon Musk he's already a perfumer so
Nosa the startup musical will be playing
as part of Camden Fringe this summer or
guess six to nine August the energy
conspirator in Highbury &amp;amp; Islington in
London and if all goes well with a
following wind the deep breath of air
and a big smell a big sniff then we'll
go to Edinburgh next year I don't know
what that was I'm sorry
give bad news Bob
yes yes that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
