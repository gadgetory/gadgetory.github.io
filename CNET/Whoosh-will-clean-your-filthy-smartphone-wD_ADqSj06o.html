now okay we've been at the show all week
long and we all know that phones have
all these kinds of disgusting germs and
bacteria and all those good things on
them our next guest has a way to wipe
them clean
Jason Greenspan CEO of woosh there it is
is in the house let's give it up for
Jason everybody all right thanks for
coming out here whoosh whoosh who told
me it's all about tech hygiene tell me
what you guys do and you know kind of
what's your mission behind all this yeah
so we recognize that your screens are
gross right so all these screen that you
love playing with and interacting with
they get really dirty right no different
then when you have plate of food your
play gifts dirty well your clothes get
dirty your hands get dirty so we've
developed a really great line of
products that keep all your tech clean
hygienic so there there's like some
magic solution in here I guess you say
what are you trying when you look at
someone's phone or iPad what are some of
the types of nasty things that could be
on it everything from a cold or a flu or
general bacteria you know why do you
wash your hands at to go the bathroom
why don't I well why don't you I do why
don't you wash your hands right so I
didn't think that you touch your phone
touches so right so we look at it as
what you touch your phone touches we
also look at it as these devices you
don't go very far without them right
they're always with you so they are
personal extension of your hands so you
wash your hands why don't you clean your
device like what was the last time you
cleaned your device I honestly like you
asked me this earlier and I have no idea
I I mean I don't know how many of you
have any of you guys like played video
games while you're you know in the
bathroom beyond let's put those hands up
we go Exmouth put those hands up there
we go I know you know what like everyone
up in the front is the people in the
back I know you've done it yeah you're
right over there be proud Oded she has
used the potty that's right touched her
iPhone Detroit so um when you look at
this there's a lot of cleaners you know
Windex I guess um I don't know how
abrasive this is what what what is in
here that you know why shouldn't you use
some of those over-the-counter cleaners
too great question to do this so
glass cleaners are designed to clean
glass you think about what glasses glass
is designed to see through right it was
never designed to be touched or
interacted with and glass cleaners do a
great job of cleaning glass for you for
seeing through the problem with screens
is there actually electrical components
right and all the OEMs and manufacturers
they also put coatings on an
anti-reflective oleophobic do different
things from a color transparency
perspective if you use an alcohol-based
cleaner an ammonia based cleaner which
is like a Windex it can actually peel
away that coating and the alcohol can
actually peel away the glue that the
screen attached to the device with and
burn through the the electrical
component so they're actually not really
safe to use an all you're only OEM
warranty say do not use alcohol ramonja
for that reason okay
ours is completely safe not only is
woosh alkaline ammonia free is 100%
non-toxic so right like Binaca so it's
completely non talk because why would
you want to put something on your device
that you then touch and is talking about
I didn't say taste a good I just said
it's non-toxic no be you've been
drinking that stuff a lot having not as
good wind at Nauticus vodka is going to
say but it's completely non-toxic was
great you put the phone to your face
right your kids touch your iPad yeah why
you toxic chemical it's kind of crazy so
uh one thing before we are going to do
some tests here one thing before we do
the test is like I've seen videos where
they say oh you know you have your
toothbrush at home and that there's
fecal matter on your toothbrush like is
there poo poo on your phone there is poo
poo on your phone so your phone is 10
times dirtier than a public toilet seat
it is phone has poo poo on it phone the
one with the box that's you know uses in
the bathroom now maybe she'll wash it
has poo poo on it it does right so let's
do some tests and figure out what's a
life on a poo poo we're gonna let's find
out okay it was quite a let's do it
let's some senses so to explain this
test as we're doing it yeah for sure so
this is an ATP test meter okay for
bacteria and germs to really grow it
needs a protein source so for you to you
know grow you need food germs bacteria
need food as well so what this does very
quickly is it measures the amount of
basically food the protein that we ter
uses to grow right outside of a lab so
we're going to do some tests will do
yours will you do mine so
let's show everybody already right so
we're taking rid of swabiz phone a
little bit of swab in here a little bit
of swab in their minds yet macadamia
perfect right awesome that looks a
little bit for me please sir
you know I've just jokingly plenty of
segments I've actually licked and made
out of my made out with my phones that
not a good idea great idea it's like
using some live at a clean your play it
just works so well all right so so this
one's 10 sec will do a countdown so
let's see what's going to come out with
anything really above we're talking
about 10 to 15 is really considered
dirty six thighs right so which one is
great there we go to anything from what
to what any about 15 is dirty that's
dirty what's my not what's 47 47 dirty
dirty boy there is definitely poo poo on
my phone right so let's yours let's do
mine right so I had this iPad that we've
been giving around the show all day yeah
you been touching it and using it and
demoing product on so we're going to do
this one right so this is for this gonna
be pretty cool so we're gonna see how
this one is knowing that we were coming
here we didn't clean it at all the last
two days and everybody's been handling
it so do the same test if it would be
really sad if that's lower than mine
I'll be really sad man right okay so
