Bridget Carey this is your C net update
it's not every day that tomorrow becomes
today but here we are October 21st 2015
it's the date Marty McFly visits in the
movie Back to the Future Part 2 and the
world went wild on Wednesday for the
nostalgia of a future that was dreamed
up by a movie made 30 years ago and
although we're not living in the future
exactly as the movie predicted perhaps
this is just an alternate timeline
created by Biff well there is plenty of
technology from the movie that is
commonplace today just like Marty in his
future home we could video chat on any
screen in the house Jennifer opens the
door with her thumbprint and you can
install fingerprint logs today for your
home as well as use prints to pay for
things at the store companies are making
all sorts of headgear that's connected
to our smartphones so you can see who's
calling and use voice commands to
control things like the visors used by
Marty's future kids and just like the
fly in USA today use camera it's no
surprise to see a news outlet put a
camera on a drone and what about walking
your dog with a drone although it's not
possible yet some people have tried to
make it work like in this video that
went viral last year by New Yorker Jeff
Myers and is very obedient Golden
Retriever with all the Phantom's
surrounding the movie brands are milking
the media squeezing every gigawatt they
can out of it Pepsi sold bottles of the
fictional Pepsi perfect soda that you
see ordered at cafe 80s making only 6500
available and at $20 a bottle these
collectibles sold out instantly but fans
were ranging about how it went on sale
before you could even find it in an
Amazon search the Amazon page is filled
with low reviews over the lack of
communication about when you could buy
it
Nike got the geek verse buzzing with a
debut of real self-lacing sneakers first
there was a cryptic tweet sent to
Michael J Fox then Nike told reporters
that the power lacing Air Mag sneakers
were in New York City and the Michael J
Fox foundation tweeted this image of the
actor wearing the shoes saying that they
are real and coming in spring of 2016
Nike has created non powered versions of
the shoe before which go for as much
sixteen thousand dollars on eBay just
think how much people will pay for
powered laces you can grab a copy of the
USA Today newspaper from the movie on
Thursday that's because the issues shown
in the movie is dated October 22nd and
USA Today is printing a special edition
cover for new stands on Thursday
USA Today also changed its logo on its
website to match the one from the movie
and the ride-hailing app lyft ran a
promotion in New York City where you
could get picked up in a DeLorean
unfortunately today where we're going we
still need roads but you never know what
can change in the next thirty years
the future is whatever you make it so
make it a good one for CNET I'm Bridget
Carey see you in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
