off-site at e3 2015 i'm here with sean
murray one of the cofounders of hello
games and the studio responsible for no
man's sky which let's be honest stole
the show last year start us off and i
guess we'll just sort of talk about
where the game has come
we're here we're just walking around an
alien planet excellent and that's the
cool thing about nomans guys that this
is a real planet to planet sized planet
I can walk in any direction for days and
days and weeks and we sure I'll
eventually come all the way around the
planet right back to where I started Wow
if I do it will turn from day to night
and back today again I think what
captured the imagination was just a
boundless game you know limitless game
one way you're not enclosed in it like a
skybox sure have a matte painting you
know you can just go anyway sure what
you want you can be a traitor okay and
so you can trade resources between space
stations you can gather resources and
planets combined them and then sell them
for a profit or you can just be an
intergalactic kind of trader okay go to
a space station or trading post on a
planet by some resources Philo and kind
of sell high build up your ship your
suit your weapons and kind of improve
yourself in that way see there's kind of
a North EG now and to it as well and you
can also be kind of a fighter you can be
sort of an intergalactic jerk basically
okay go out into space and try and shoot
down innocent traders steal what they
are trading and you take on pirates take
on fighters or go down to planets and
just start causing trouble there's lots
of different options open to you lots of
different ways to play the game and
nobody is telling you you know in a
three minute opening cutscene this is
what you do we're going to do only this
for the next 10 hours and so it's a game
of scale really I mean you see that one
moment I'm down and their blades of
grass and fish in the water right at the
next moment I can be in a solar system
flying around it you know hundreds of
thousands of kilometres an hour and here
we are now able to travel at light years
yeah it's a selector a solar system at
random and then go there an amazing ship
around of a range there yeah it's kind
of powers of 10 really now most of these
places
I've never been visited many of them
never will be what are you seeing around
you is being generated on the fly okay
so none of it exists before you get
there when you get there the maths
generates everything when you go away it
will all be thrown away if two people go
to the same planet or if you fly away
and come back it will be you know I do
expect it well this has been fantastic
thank you so much for showing the game I
definitely am able to wrap my head
around it a little more than before but
having having you here so really pretty
thanks so much man thanks a lot all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
