huge music fans but I know one in
Cupertino who is I'm Brian Cooley with
top five Steve Jobs greatest hits the
top money makers from his second tenure
at Apple basically the I era let's see
which of Apple's products are most
responsible for making that company just
about the most valuable in the world
number five is the iPod that's right the
bottom rung of our list is where you now
find Steve Jobs critical first foray
outside of computers but it was the
device that began apple's march toward
what it is today a maker of an array of
digital living products remember the
company dropped the word computer from
its name entirely in January oh seven
but iPod is now Apple's only declining
business down about 6% the most recent
report and about half of those sales are
ipod touch if you're thinking of the
classic Nano that's yesterday's Apple
number four is iTunes now this lowly
ranking might surprise a lot of folks
iTunes for media and apps looms totally
large in our digital culture and it's
one of the truly unique innovations of
the jobs I era but its sales are light
the iPod only around 5 or 6% of apples
revenue and until recently iTunes was
basically a break-even business now
unlike the iPod iTunes is a growing
business and here's a hint why iTunes
sold 10 billion apps in less than half
the time it took to sell that many songs
number three is the Mac Line MacBooks
imax and pros now we're getting into
real money something like eighteen
twenty percent of apple's business and
growing at about 23 percent over the
last year Jobs has to be especially
proud of this category because it's
where Apple was always ridiculed as a
niche player back in the day when it
adjusted computers today OS 10 is about
15% market share in the u.s. Switzerland
by the way as they number one Mac OS
country by the way Apple has 91 percent
market share of computers priced over
$1000
nice territory number two is the device
they called a toy the iPad it's Apple's
biggest growing product by far something
like six hundred percent growth in the
last year and it will go down in history
as jobs last product as the boss at
Apple it's about 21 percent of Apple's
business today and even with dozens of
competitors
it'll have over 60 percent of the market
through 2011 when consumers are asked
which tablet they're considering
ninety-five percent say iPad I don't
think the numbers are quite that high
for the PlayBook now before I take you
to the number one hit on that album we
call Steve Jobs here's a huge hit from
Apple you can't buy their stores they
now have over three hundred and ten of
them around the globe and they turn out
the highest revenue per square foot in
the entire retail chain business
something like seven times the dollars
per square foot of a Best Buy store and
almost double what a Tiffany store does
okay the number one greatest hit of the
Steve Jobs second era at Apple is of
course the iPhone but a lot of folks
don't realize by how much it's nearly
half the business at Apple and combine
that with the iPad those two are
basically the company but with that in
mind you can see why the battle with
Android is likely the one jobs is most
disappointed he won't lead the company
through Android phones now have about 41
percent market share compared to iPhones
27% and Android is growing its share
some three times faster but in terms of
dollars nobody makes as much money off a
single phone model as Apple so those are
Steve Jobs Greatest Hits pretty darn
impressive album right there's always a
few flops out there
yeah don't miss my other related top 5
biggest Apple flops that's coming soon
