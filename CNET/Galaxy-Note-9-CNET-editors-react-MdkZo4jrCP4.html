Samsung's launch event for the Galaxy
Note 9 and we have a lot of opinions
we've got the note 9 here in our hands
sure what is your takeaway what do you
think you know I think for a lot of
people it's gonna look very similar to
what we saw last year but there's some
really good changes inside a lot more
storage a bigger battery they really
played played at cautious last year
because of the note 7 problem so the
note 8 they kind of went with a smaller
battery then they could have now we're
back to them promising you know all-day
and more battery life yeah that's right
we've got a four thousand milliamp your
hour battery which is big that's it's
huge actually so I am looking forward to
seeing how long that battery lasts this
phone also starts at 128 gigabytes of
storage which is huge normally their
phones start at 64 gigabytes then
there's another option and that's 512
gigabytes that's that's insane what do
you think about that yeah I mean you
have to think about the fact that
Samsung is the world's biggest flash
memory maker so it's just like you know
pull it off the shelf put it in the
phone yeah I mean that's something like
the note users are typically like power
users it's people who like need to do a
lot with it they want the stylus they
want to like you know have everything
the best basically and so like that's
what Samsung was really trying to do
with this but kind of on the flip side
they also still had the expandable
memory so they were saying there's no
that's right in there yeah that they're
soon gonna have the memory cards that
make it so you could have a terabyte of
storage basically on this phone you know
it's interesting when you code like if
you get the largest capacity and then
you also get a 512 gigabyte memory card
you're up to about a terabyte but yeah
that's a lot that's a tremendous amount
of videos and photos and I think that's
what a lot of people want they want a
lot of memory yeah but then it comes to
the whole you know we're all playing
paying for cloud services you know how
much it's kind of I think a debate right
now like how much do you actually need
actually saved on your device versus how
much that you can have on the Internet
so right and then apart from that you
know and if you if you take out the
memory if you take out the battery we've
got a lot of very similar features to
last year and in fact you the Galaxy S 9
and s 9 plus we've got the exact same
camera setup with dual 12 megapixel
cameras on the back dual aperture which
helps with low-light shots there's an 8
mega pick
camera on the front you've got a
fingerprint reader wireless charging
waterproofing so I do think that the one
thing that makes the note stick out is
of course the oh there we go the stylus
it's really crammed in there the stylus
is a big deal and Samsung really this
year has gone ahead and it's added a lot
more features to this so you can still
right navigate draw but now it's
Bluetooth connected yes yeah so they're
saying there's things like you can use
it as a remote basically to turn the
shutter on your camera so like if you're
taking a group picture instead of having
to like go over and push the button or
use the self-timer I guess you can use
that you know they used it they really
like to say they used it for their
PowerPoint presentations so the their
presentations to go to the next slides
they were actually using the notes you
know be interesting to see how much you
can actually do with it but yeah you
know we got briefings we got demos on it
and basically you just long press this
button on the S Pen and right now it
triggers a setup page for the S Pen
remote there's a lot of customization
that you can do I think we still really
need to deep dive into what those use
cases are definitely in the demo I use
this to successfully launch the camera
flip it over to selfie and take a selfie
so I think that that could be really
useful and it's really nice to see
Samsung expanding beyond you know a lot
of people have called for Oh make the
tip into an eraser and let's do
something else with this so this is
something that Samsung has been long
overdue for I am glad to see it here
what does it justify the elephant in the
room which is the price yeah yeah yeah
so the price is more than what we saw
from the note eight it's more than what
we saw from the s9 plus which is
interesting considering it's very
similar actual specs right so the phone
actually starts at $1000 for the 128
gigabyte version and then for the larger
512 gigabyte version that is $1,250 this
is iPhone 10 territory yeah I mean it's
iPhone center II I think there's kind of
two sides to this where samsung devices
are generally iPhone 10 quality you know
they have good displays they have good
materials you know I think it's could be
hard to justify this in some ways
because there aren't as many
kind of noticeable changes but then on
the flip side you also have more storage
but storage is cheap like you can go buy
a microSD card I was just doing some
searches and like you know a 64 gig
microSD card you can buy for literally
like five or six dollars so you know it
doesn't justify kind of this huge price
to get more storage I don't know yeah
we've been looking and talking about
pricing for smartphones the prices have
definitely crept up not just for Apple
not just for Samsung but on high-end
devices all across the board so this is
a trend that we're seeing it's not gonna
go away and the question is does it
really justify it are the days of the
$600 flagship phone behind us I mean I
think that the answer is clearly yes and
I think what that leaves us with is
asking and answering the question who is
this for and I mean my immediate thought
is that this is a phone for somebody who
has you know an earlier version of the
note like the note 5 you know of course
Samsung skipped the note six and then
the seventh exploded and had to be taken
at the shelves and then there was the
note 8 so if you're left with the note 5
this is going to be a huge upgrade it's
going to be fast it's gonna be you know
future ready yeah and and so it could be
good for that I mean it could also be
great for a person who wants just like a
very powerful device like the best that
they can get you know power users who
like the idea of using the stylus to
write with yeah
yeah I mean in like Samsung was saying
you know I was talking to one of their
executives and he was saying that most
people who upgrade like their upgrade
customers are people who will have had
like the note 5 you know it's kind of
those like huge ultra fans is kind of a
smaller percentage of it and they're
gonna buy it probably no matter what but
like for this when they're thinking of
upgrades they're thinking of those like
note 5 customers so like for the note 5
customer or even note 4 like whatever it
is you have this older you know they
also compared it to like this of an edge
like that it's a big step up for that
it's just you know the note 8 users not
so much
and then competition is really fierce
too right so we have the next iPhones
coming up we've got the pixel 3 series
probably coming up and the Samsung
itself is gonna have another next big
phone right next spring yeah yeah you
know and like it also you know even with
pricing it's almost just kind of a
mental thing as well like if they had
cut pricing on this or
maybe even kept it the same you kind of
mentally think well oh it must not be
the best phone then because the best
phone is gonna be really expensive you
know so it's kind of almost
counterintuitive because you don't want
to pay more more for a phone but you
know like oh I want the best phone so
it's gonna be the most expensive phone
well it certainly looks really good and
this blue color is very striking with
that contrasting S Pen that comes out of
it we are gonna have a lot more details
coming up we're gonna have a full review
of this device so stick with us for all
of your Galaxy Note 9 news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
