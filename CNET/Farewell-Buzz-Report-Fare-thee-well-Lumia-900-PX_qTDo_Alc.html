the bus report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week nokia and microsoft are saved maybe
the future is here and probably fatal
and this is the end friends of the buzz
report but not quite yet first it's the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the nokia lumia 900 nokia and
microsoft's last stand when it comes to
saving Nokia's hide and pushing Windows
Phone into the mainstream and mainstream
it is this phone maybe not the electric
blue one we would match though anyway it
also comes in black and white it's 99
bucks and our editors say it's the best
windows phone on the market plus its LTE
on AT&amp;amp;T so faster data than an iphone so
if the iphone is too expensive or too
Apple II and you're hoping for something
a little prettier or easier to use than
Android then the Lumia 900 is for you
now is that the kind of recommendation
that can save two companies bacon that
sadly is another story and now for the
news speaking of sadly yahoo announced
that its laying off 2,000 people and
refocusing on three areas content media
and communications that's one core
platforms is two and third leveraging
data sets you know just making more
money off our personal information
facebook style and that's basically all
the details that the new CEO scott
thompson had to offer which sounds kind
of like the same strategy of the past
few years just minus two thousand people
but at least he didn't say they're gonna
pivot as for yahoo using suing facebook
as a strategy that could get a bit
tougher facebook countersued yahoo this
week saying yahoo actually violated ten
of Facebook's patents now it's all
standard operating procedure in these
kind of lawsuits and experts say it's
really just setting up for a settlement
a settlement that might be roughly
equivalent to 2000 yahoo job salaries
what's amazing though is the stuff these
guys have managed to patent like method
for enabling a user to fetch a specific
information item from a set of
information items and a system for
carrying out such a method you mean like
clicking on a search result really
an office really and now the future is
here google announced this week it has
started testing its augmented reality
glasses but only apparently on very
attractive and happy people Google put
up a video showing the day as viewed
through these glasses where you see
heads-up weather maps you could take
pictures with them you can chat with
your friends you can find out the
subways closed you know that kind of
thing oh man really although judging
from this video I don't think I want the
glasses until they can also hear my
thoughts so that I don't have to talk to
myself all the time Who am I kidding Who
am I kidding give me those I will have
them now actually our producer Sarah
pointed out that like a lot of people
are probably gonna get hit by cars in
the early days of using these glasses
but I kind of don't care and finally a
flying car made its debut at the new
york auto show this week yes finally
it's kind of more like a hybrid of plane
and car so you would drive it to the
airport then you can fly for about four
hours then you would land fold up your
little wings and just drive away so that
caused a bunch of nerdy types out there
to claim that in fact this is not a true
flying car it is actually a hybrid
vehicle and therefore barely cool at all
which again who are you kidding give it
to us now and speaking of the future
we're getting on to the future this is
the last regular episode of the buzz
report which I believe but can't be
bothered to prove is the longest-running
web video series ever but all good
things must come to an end I have a new
project in the works that I am thrilled
about but this is it for the buzz report
