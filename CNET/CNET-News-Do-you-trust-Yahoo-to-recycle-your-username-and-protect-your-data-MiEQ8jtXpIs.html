users who haven't used their yahoo email
or id's in the past 12 months use it or
lose it you can imagine how many user
names have been created over the last
you know decade or two and so there's a
significant number of accounts that have
just become inactive but the best thing
to do for users is just make these
available again on July 15th at midnight
Pacific time
Yahoo will cancel accounts of these
inactive users and invite people to try
to claim these newly available user
names so let's say my current email
address is Carra one two three four five
six at yahoo.com
but I've always wanted just Carr at
Yahoo I can go to Yahoo request Carra or
carroty at Yahoo and then hope that my
request is one of those recycled names
Yahoo says they'll inform people in
mid-august if they're awarded the
username they've requested but recycling
usernames is bringing up privacy and
security concerns with so many online
logins and passwords linked to our
emails
Yahoo says it is working to ensure users
information will be protected if they
lose their yahoo ID and others claim it
will go through and and do some cleanup
work to ensure that you know data
doesn't end up in the wrong places and
unsubscribe that particular ID from any
newsletters we're working with a handful
of our partners and peers in the space
collaboratively on a program that will
basically help them understand if
account has been recycled and
potentially has a new owner so that they
can do the right thing for the user on
that property so for example if you're
you know if this is a user on Amazon
who's trying to recover their password
we'll help them understand if the
account has been recycled the password
information won't get sent to the new
user of that account while yahoo says
they're confident in their cleanup
process experts say you should take
security measures into your own hands
I think it's a very good idea to go
through accounts that you may have
associated that yahoo email with and
associate them yourselves use Yahoo's
plan to do cleanup for you as a last
line of defense not as your first line
of defense if you want to keep your
yahoo ID and email just make sure to
sign in to Yahoo or
into your yahoo email by July 14th 11:59
p.m. Pacific time in San Francisco I'm
