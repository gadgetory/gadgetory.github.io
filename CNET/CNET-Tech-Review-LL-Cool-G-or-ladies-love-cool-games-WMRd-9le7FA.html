highlights from the 2011 new york auto
show clever cases for your iphones and
ipads will count down the top 5 worst
product names in tech and brian proves
once again what a chick magnet the ipad
really is it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom lines
let's start with the good it shouldn't
come as a surprise given gas prices
these days that the New York Auto Show
was all about small cars and better gas
mileage this year whether it was eating
more efficiency out of Subarus or trying
to make a Mercedes into a sexier econo
box the message was clear sippers not
guzzlers I guess you can call it the new
New Beetle though VW doesn't go on is
the kooky arched roof giving into
something a little more rakish so to the
taillights cease paying slavish homage
to the past inside this beetle gets a
grown-up dash and instrument panel while
shedding the little bud vase but
offering an upper glove box that does
say original car one thing you notice
right away is the top of the dash isn't
as absurdly deep as it used to be since
the windshield base is pushed back and
atop the dash three sporty gauges three
engine choices as well most exciting to
me is a torquey 2-liter TDI that should
deliver 29 40 mpg but there's also word
of a beetle are with a 270 horsepower
turbo motor out of the Gulf are now VW
needs this new beetle to deliver more
than the seven percent or so of its
sales been doing the last couple years
if the company wants to hit audacious
goals of being the world's biggest
carmaker by 2018 the new 2012 beetle
arrives in the US September of 2011
here's the new face for the revised ford
taurus all kind of angry and menacing
looking especially on the show edition
and there's new increased sculpting
around the body a new shape on the hood
now none show tour I will get a light
revision as well but the most
interesting thing is this will be the
first Ford to offer a choice of two
EcoBoost engines those are the ones that
combine direct injection and
turbocharging one will be a new version
of the three and a half liter v6 that
will now deliver a healthy 290
horsepower and the other will be a
little two liter for that should
deliver 31 mpg from this big car myford
touch will now be available on the LCD
screen of a taurus and rumors have it
some sort of video streaming could be
coming to that system electric power
steering will enable the same impressive
automatic parking tech we recently saw
on the focus the new taurus hits the
market in 2012 as a 2013 model subaru
has been on a tear in the US but the
Impreza has been uninteresting outside
of a WRX this new impressive is no
looker the sedan is super suburban the
hatch looks sporty orrantia come around
the back and mistake it for a chipmunk
with jowls full of nuts they have
downsized the engine dramatically from
two and a half to two liters too much
improve the cars previous mediocre fuel
economy now projected to be 27 36 which
subaru claims will make the new Impreza
the most fuel-efficient all-wheel drive
car in America now that's with a CVT
gearbox shift it yourself with the
five-speed manual and you'll lose a few
mpg oh by the way at the Shanghai show
subi also showed off this wilder cousin
to the Impreza the XV concept which for
the first time would take an Impreza in
a crossover direction we'll have more on
that when we see it in person
ever seen a Mercedes a-class yeah this
dorky little thing well forget that and
check this the new a-class concept it
just went from being about as sexy as an
elevator to being a pulse elevator lots
of tasty sculpting around it's sort of
mini Shooting Brake body style but none
of it's so outrageous that you can't
squint and see a production car here
well except for this highly unlikely
interior with all its LED illuminated
pods and such those vent nozzles turn
red when heating and blue when cooling
and of course mercedes is envisioning
streaming radio facebook and twitter
through a docked smartphone which are
pretty much becoming must have
technologies right now under hood they
see a turbo direct-injected two-liter
for that will put 210 horsepower into a
7-speed dual-clutch automated manual to
the front wheels also available things
like radar adaptive cruise lots of
luxury this is likely a real answer to
BMWs 1 series and Audi's threes in a
world where small and premium no longer
seem like odd bedfellows the new Chevy
Malibu debuted at Shanghai but a couple
of days later dropped a bit of a
bombshell in New York that is it'll be
available as a mild hybrid called the
malibu eco battle team a little 15
horsepower electric motor with a 2.4
liter 4 to give you 20 6 38 mpg also
thanks to it having regenerative braking
and auto start/stop up front is what
they call an expressive face in the auto
biz and that feature line along the sill
continuing out to the rear bumper gives
the car a very rakish stance out back a
clear nod to the hind end of a camaro
and inside the camaro nod continues with
the gauges then over in the center is
the new Chevy MyLink head unit which
will be a first for GM and that it will
have app support for pandora and
stitcher streaming and almost certainly
more apps after that push the button at
the bottom of the screen and the whole
thing tilts up for a space to stash your
connected i phone the other engine
option is a two and a half liter direct
injection for that puts 190 horsepower
into a 6-speed automatic the new malibu
goes on sale first half of 2012
the Malibu is so purple how Barbie
although actually if we're talking cute
cars i gotta say i am digging the new
new beetle now you know the ladies are
digging our mutual friend brian Tong but
this week he has agreed to pass on some
of his unique tech wisdom and tap that
up ipad games to help you get girls
we're going to tap that app i'm brian
song and this is the show we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space and we
showcase a lot of games and apps really
the best way to use technology is with
the ladies so we're going to show you
the best ipad games that will help you
get girls based on my extensive research
now forget about violent games like
infinity blade or gun brothers girls
don't care and please don't say angry
birds are fruit ninja those games are
played out and trust me you got to be
different from those other nerds so
here's my favorite ipad games to get the
girl now first up is harbor master HD
and it's absolutely free just ask the
girl if she likes water do you like
water what water here let me show you
then bust out the game and all you do is
send purple boats to the purple docks
and orange boats the orange docks by
drawing pass with your fingers you'll
need to move boats in and out of the
docks and it gets good when the game
gets hectic and trust me you'll be multi
touching in no time now remember it's
free and the best date guys is the one
that doesn't hurt your wallet now if you
really want to get your game on with the
ladies check out what's the difference
it'll cost you a chicken mcnugget happy
meal at 399 but this is the classic game
where you work as a team to spot the
differences between two pictures side by
side you'll be saying things to each
other like are you good at this anymore
ooh nice move nice and best of all you
can sure that you're a guy who knows how
to use his head yeah yeah and my final
recommendation little things I know I
know don't let the name discourage you
it's 299 and it's an innovative seek and
fine game you'll work together to find
items in a colorful collage of cute
icons it's a game that more than two
people can play and you know the same
the more the merrier but trust me when I
tell you it's a
good thing when a girl ass can i play
with your little things so there you go
fellas three games you haven't really
heard of to break the ice with that
special someone and what's the trend
having fun working together and my
friends the rest is up to you now if you
have any other apps you think are worthy
to be here that we missed send them to
tap that app patina com i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys next week who needs okcupid when
you've got an ipad of course if an ipad
doesn't turn her on maybe the lady in
your life could use a vibe in fact this
vibe is our editors choice rich brown
loves it and here he is with a hands-on
review hi I'm rich brown senior editor
for cnet com today we're going to take a
look at the main gear but super stock so
this is an editor's choice winning
gaming PC this config cops about twenty
nine hundred bucks is one of the fastest
desktops we've ever reviewed and it also
comes out a nice tidy little package
here this may be ur system is very well
built and generally we recommend it to
anybody in the market for sort of an
upper mid-range gaming desktop so just a
quick overview the outside you can see
it's nice and clean the front panel has
a DVD burner up here as well as a media
drive here right here you've got a pair
of SSD slots pop a little lock the
driveways open up and you can pop the
drives in and out now despite this is
some small size that actually has a nice
range of connectivity options here on
the back you can see there's two
graphics cards here each card has tons
of video outputs you can see there's two
DVI ports as well as two adapter based
mini DisplayPort outputs and here you
get a single HDMI out down here on the
motherboard ports you get 7.1 audio
digital audio output a couple USB 3 s
USB to Ethernet e-sata firewire and a
couple more USB ports now inside the
vibe it's nice and meat which is what
we're used to from main gear up here
you've got two graphics cards it's a
pair of AMD Radeon HD 6950 s down here
is an intel core i7 2600 k chip and
that's a stock speed of 3.4 gigahertz
but main gears overclock that 24
18 between that chip and these two cards
this is one of the fastest systems we've
ever seen now there's a couple memory
sticks here you can actually add two
more if you want to go to 16 gigs that's
probably overkill for now anyway you've
got room for three hard drives over here
now there's one SSD drive installed
already now it's actually a 250 gigabyte
drive it's probably a little excessive
you can actually go into a 120 gig drive
on makers website not four hundred
dollars out of the price of the system
so it's probably not the worst idea down
here you've got a one terabyte standard
hard drive and you got a free drive spot
here now the system does come with
wireless networking integrated but there
are a few other upgrade options
available on the motherboard you get a 1
x pci express slot here and here and
there's a single pci slot available
between the two cards now you don't have
room to add a third graphics card to
this PC but there is still plenty of
room to upgrade and more than we would
expect from a system that's kind of
small like this so as you said the
system is one of the fastest we've ever
tested and it will also play any game
out there at high image quality and high
resolution so between its speed its
value and its design this is one of the
best gaming PC's out there right now so
I'm rich brown this is an editor's
choice winning main gear vibe super
stuff what did you think I meant get
your minds out of the gutter people and
while you take a moment to wash your
brains out with soap we're gonna take a
break we'll be right back for more tech
review right after this
you
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good many new iPad
and iPhone owners are compelled to buy
cases to protect their pricy new
purchases if you're one of those people
you might consider a case that actually
adds functionality to your iDevice like
these two right here hi I'm Scott Stein
senior editor at cnet com and this is
not a netbook this is an iPad to dock
into the Logitech keyboard case by zagg
for the ipad 2 it's not even plugged in
it just rests here and for those people
that are looking for a perfect keyboard
solution for their iPad hey at a
keyboard it's just like a laptop well
this is the type of device you might be
looking for at $99 it's a pretty good
price compared to other iPad peripherals
and it doubles as a case and as you can
see it's a real keyboard this isn't a
sort of glued on rubbery keyboard or any
sort of a fake oh feeling keyboard this
keyboard has keys that feel like a real
keyboard although compressed it's a
little more like the keyboard you'd find
on a netbook it's not a real full-size
keyboard but the fact that it comes
inside this case and allows the ipad 2
to be stood up with in it makes it a
really nice solution for an all-in-one
type of device now there are some
drawbacks the case is not really a
perfect case for the ipad it does allow
the ipad to fold down and store it
inside it but you can't really easily
remove it so it's not going to be a sort
of case you want to take with you on a
subway for some quick ipad reading also
call us crazy even though there are
rubberized bands here that will protect
contact against the keyboard when the
iPads folded down makes us a little bit
nervous to get this glass up close to a
keyboard on the other hand this has some
really nice ergonomic features to it you
can stand this thing up in a landscape
or portrait mode you can flip it up like
this now the back connector over here is
a flip-up plastic it's not great it's
probably one of the weakest parts of the
case but it does the job and allows it
to stand up it also has a really nice
set of bluetooth keys here the control
functions on the ipad you may not even
be aware that it could control for
instance there's volume control
track skipping for music there's also
undo and redo buttons so if you're
working in a word processing they'll
actually work it also has cut and paste
buttons but of course if you're going to
be using those you do still have to
select text on the screen so that may be
in reaching up and touching the screen
you're actually typing on this keyboard
really does make it feel like a laptop
kind of gives us nice little coffee shop
vibe you can relax and lose yourself in
your writing a little bit just got to be
careful because after you work on this
for a while you're going to wonder where
that Masser that trackpad is and you're
going to have to press back on that
screen it gets a little bit confusing
this logitech keyboard connects by
bluetooth so that's why there's no dock
connector here or 30 pin connector you
just set up bluetooth on your ipad then
you turn the keyboard on and you hit the
connect button you've already set it up
for pairing it's good to go the first
time it will ask you to enter a four
digit code on your keyboard to initiate
the pairing process this also has a
micro USB connector and its own little
charge cable for plugging in via USB to
charge the battery on this case it's
long enough of a charge you're really
not going to worry about charging at too
many times overall it's actually a
really nice attractive case and it
creates a nice clean profile for the
ipad 2 really makes it look like a
laptop if you're looking for a keyboard
you really might want to check this one
out I'm Scott's time and this is the
Logitech keyboard case by zagg for the
ipad 2 i'm nicole a senior associate
editor for cnet.com and this is a first
look at the logo talk XD the logo talk
XD is an iphone case but it also has a
built-in bluetooth headset on the back
as a case it's a pretty normal looking
iphone case if it's very snugly around
the iphone there are all the buttons at
the right place it should be there
cutouts for the jacks so it's overall a
pretty decent iphone case in general
what sets the talk XD apart is that on
the back here is a little bluetooth
headset this means that the case has a
slight hump back on the back here to get
the bluetooth headset out all you have
to do is press down on the left side
here and it will pop out of the charging
cavity the bluetooth headset itself as
you can see is
extremely skinny it's around less than
0.2 inch on the side of the bluetooth
headset here is a very tiny
multifunction call button on the other
side here are the two charging points
for charging in the case the ear piece
of the headset can be folded open just
by clicking it forward and the headset
can be fitted to fit in either ear the
head side comes with a variety of
different earbud tips while the headset
is in the very skinny and slim it
actually fits pretty comfortably in the
ear also on the bottom of the case here
is a micro USB charging port to charge
the bluetooth headset you can charge
both the iphone and it hits at the same
time because of the two different
openings the bluetooth headset has to be
paired with the iphone it doesn't pair
automatically just because you put the
case on however it does pair quite
easily the bluetooth headset is the
usual bluetooth headset features you can
answer calls and calls and reject calls
because the iphone is close at hand you
don't need to use the volume controls on
the headset just use the volume controls
on the iphone however the bluetooth
headset doesn't have a lot of advanced
features it doesn't have a two DP it
doesn't have onboard volume controls
like we said and it also does not have
multi-point connectivity that lets it
connect up to two devices at once
overall we think mean we'll go talk XD
is a pretty clever idea after all
Bluetooth headsets are notoriously easy
to lose or misplace this way it's always
close at hand perhaps our only issue is
that it's a little bit expensive at one
hundred dollars retail but you can't
find a cheaper online I am Nicole and
this has been a first look at the Mogo
top XD
while those both seem like really good
ideas they're not cheap and they're
definitely going to add some bulk to
your portable devices but if neither one
of those things bothers you don't let me
talk you out of it let's just move along
and see what's bad this week instead
naming products and services in the tech
world can be a tricky proposition for
example how many of you know that cnet
used to officially be named cnet with a
little pipe character and it actually
stood for the computer network that was
fine but after some time we became cnet
networks or computer network networks
awkward as that maybe it's nothing
compared to the five truly terrible tech
names in this week stop by
let's face it folks tech manufacturers
make tech for a living they make screams
operating systems processors little
buttons and stuff where they fall down
all too often is when they name their
gear I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
stupidest names for tech products in
recent memory ranked in order of how
much they made us cringe here at the
scene head offices number five is a tie
between two products that violate the
first rule of reading the room never
call yourself cool unless you rap for a
living but the cooler ereader and cool
the search engine missed that lesson the
cooler reader just wasn't it was a
second-rate half bait cut-price ripoff
of both the Kindle and the ipod so it
has the unoriginal ur name that it could
have claimed now cool was a search
engine that claimed to do what Google
does but faster and better the name was
one of those we in the media biz say
needs a pronounced ER never go to market
with a name like that some saw it
meeting cool as the founders intended
others thought it said quill which had
kind of founding fathers tonality to it
and I just saw call which is what
happened to it number four is the
samsung smiley you know smiley they
branded it with both the word and the
emoticon and tried to position it as the
happy phone asking what about it will
make you happy you know it'll make me
happy this thing going off the market
number three is the pentax issed
pronounced pissed but with a leading
asterisk in the structural tradition of
a das wild card cuz you know that's cool
the idea was sort of this is the DSLR
for whatever your passions are whether
you're an artist botanist naturist or
anesthesiologist which works because
they put this line to sleep in late two
thousand six number two is the olympus
em robe i actually forgot about this one
had to go look it up it was a line of
portable
audio and video players the name
supposedly a contraction of music
wardrobe that's idiotic and it used
proprietary file transfer called yep em
trip which actually made sony sonicstage
look good olympus is blessedly out of
the media player business now but that
unfortunately gives them more time to
come up with unnerving stuff like this
colonoscopy camera with an obscene
flexible tip before we get to our number
one worst named tech product a reminder
a bad name does not keep a good product
down you recall the groaning when
steve-o announced ipad and we all had
our jaws in our laps when nintendo
announced we and can there be a Dorking
your geekier name than android danger
Will Robinson hey so you see cooler you
could have been a hit if you just hadn't
sucked okay the number one worst name
for a tech product hands down no
exceptions for the remainder of history
is this media player called I beat
blacks what I mean Sharpton's on the
phone right now for me just reading this
all right in defensive maker Trek store
they are a small company located in
Lorsch South hesiod Germany well known
as the Silicon Valley of the former
third reich anyway from what I've seen
they were genuinely horrified when
someone who's actually heard English
spoken explained to them what they've
just called their product so they fired
their VP of brand development David Duke
and soldiered on with a name change to
the only moderately disturbing trick
store blacks for more top 5s like this
one well none are quite like this one go
to top 5 cnet com I'm Brian Cooley
thanks for watching
wow that did not really happen did it
that I be okay well that is a bad name
Tech or otherwise let's just go ahead
and check out this week's bottom line
shall we Apple's been in the news a
little bit lately over charges that the
iPhone stores a huge unencrypted cache
of your location data apple says it's
not tracking you and the data is just
more access points in cell towers than
visits to dirty book stores but still
until they roll out the fixes they say
they're working on here's how to lock
down some of that stuff before any
private investigators come looking Brian
song Hasina calm and one of the hot
topics in the tech world is apple's
tracking all of your location data on
your iphone or ipad as a file even if
you choose to turn off the location
services setting on your idevice now the
data is being stored in an unencrypted
file potentially accessible by anyone
who's up to no good with some basic
technical skills this file is stored not
only on your mobile device but there's
also copied that saved on your
computer's hard drive when it backs up
files from an iphone or ipad while
syncing with itunes now the good news is
that apple's not uploading this data
file to their internal servers but it
still lives on your idevice or computer
and the data has mapped out your
location and whereabouts as far back as
a year now there are plenty of you out
there that care about your privacy so
what can you do to protect yourself this
file will live on your phone in you
really can't do anything about that but
your best bet is to encrypt the iTunes
backup that lives on your computer so
first up plugging your iDevice with its
USB cable into your Mac or PC then
select your device in the left-hand
column of iTunes when it launches find
the options section and check the box
next to encrypt iphone backup choose a
password that's unique and make sure you
don't forget it but once you do this the
file on your computer will be protected
I'm Brian town for cnet com with your
how-to for protecting location data use
it wisely
the bottom line this week bug chef right
and while you're at it all of you
playstation 3 players might want to go
ahead and change all your passwords and
cancel your credit cards i mean i know a
sony says they don't know for sure if
the credit card information was taken in
their recent hack attack but do you feel
like you can trust anyone lately all
right folks that's our show will be back
next week with a brand new Cena tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at Cena
TV com see you next time and thank you
