market in the u.s. a few years ago that
was in Sony that was 11 inches that was
I saw that one introduced it was this
thin and it was like a technology
demonstrator yeah but this LG machine is
for real yeah this well you know that's
not a TV this is a TV and the real
coolness is that you know you get this
great picture quality but you also get
incredible dimensions so LG is talking
about a one millimeter bezel which is
the thinnest possible thing so it's
pretty much all picture the most compact
you can get from the 55 inch TV it's
also what I'm told seven point six
kilograms so math math math hey I don't
know how much that is but like 17 pounds
something like that we do a lot of
lifting televisions in and out of boxes
so that's going to help us just as a
side note I was at the sharp press
conference and they said one of their
big focuses is going to be making their
televisions lighter which I can really
appreciate any of these things around
well I guess you know there's things
like infant hazards you know for example
people have to attach their TV to their
units so their children don't knock them
over so having a lighted TV I don't know
if that's more dangerous or less
dangerous well as a manufacturer it's
also a lot cheaper to ship those things
so everybody you know unless you're
getting free shipping from amazon it
really doesn't matter now ty there's
another new technology that's being
talked about i think it's sony is
showing this one is called what is a
crystal crystal display i believe it is
it's essentially what you see if the
baseball games you know the huge screens
that they show that the plays on shrunk
down into a 55 inch television that
seems to be the magical number this year
55 so essentially it's little LEDs
similar to what you get behind in LCD TV
but they are actually used to display
the pictures similar to 0 lead as well
so I think we need a little technology
refresher here because we are sold all
the time at the stores oh this is an LED
TV tell us the difference between an LED
TV and an LED TV ah so LED tvs that we
know are actually it's a marketing ploy
so it's it's just using LEDs like you'd
get on the power buttons of your
television for example used to light the
screen itself because LCD doesn't admit
its own might like you got in a digital
watch you actually have to press a
button to get the thing to display but
an LED TV is actually using those LEDs
as the picture as the pixel so there's
six million LEDs in this television my
crew micro size and it's going to be
expensive if it ever comes to market or
you think there's a chance it won't
absolutely you know they're dead pushing
it as a prototype which I don't think
sony has done in a long time yeah this
TVs it's basically a CES kind of you
know come check us out thing they
haven't talked about marketing this
thing at all if they do it'll be really
expensive previously mad at Oleg's we
just mentioned is the old ads are
actually shipping Samsung and LG both
you know assure us that they're going to
come out with these 55-inch oled tvs by
the end of the year LG says you know
third quarter and Samsung a prodigy
around it as well now when I just got a
new TV and before I did I talked to the
guys have seen it about what kind of TV
I should get and they said get a plasma
set now there's only one or two vendors
I think actually making plasmas but one
of those being Panasonic and they're
they're not stepping away from this
technology is that right why is plasma
still a thing at Panasonic well the main
reason we like plasma TVs is a couple of
things they have excellent screen
uniformity so they have the even
brightness across the screen they're
also superb from off angle so it's I was
explaining with the LCDs you have this
backlight issue where they shine through
to the LCD and it actually makes the
picture be less fidelity kind of fuzzy
yeah you miss out on a lot of fidelity
when you sit extreme angles plasma
doesn't have that problem that's one of
the couple reasons why we like them
they're also have on a lot of the
high-end plasmas like the panasonics we
really like last year they give
excellent black level forms as well so
Panasonic's plasmas again I saw those
this morning in person and they look
really good they're talking about how
they've improved a lot of their picture
quality aspects deeper blacks brighter
color and addressing one of the Bugaboos
of plasma
energy efficiency so you know all of
these things are supposedly better for
the 2012 panasonic line and i called the
st 34 master the best value i'd ever
seen pretty much in terms of picture
quality for the money that you're going
to spend it's an excellent bargain and I
think plasma is going to continue to
occupy that niche what I can see
happening is that oil is going to come
up like this and plasmas going to go
down like this you'll see LCD start to
fill up the lower under a thousand
dollars maybe some budget plasmas as
well but I lives probably in 2015 2016
companies like LG is saying that it's
going to be the same prices in LCD so
you think that OLED will take up the
mantle as the high end where plasma is
right now plasma will eventually finally
make its exit I I think so i think it's
a kind of technology that's probably on
the back end of its life span i mean at
the end of the day plasma is still going
to give you the best picture you can buy
right now without spending eight
thousand dollars which is what I think
these old ads are going to cost so
that's still like a really really high
end technology as I was saying you know
they're expecting it to come down pretty
fast and there's a lot of impetus to do
that because again you get the lighter
screens you get the smaller size and you
give people a chance to buy another TV
now we're looking here at TVs for the
next year or two but just for the moment
let's say that somebody is looking for a
TV today in the sweet spot which I guess
is about 46 to 55 inches what technology
would you recommend and what's about the
price point for a really good display
good value you can get excellent values
i would say the value price point
started under a thousand dollars for 50
inch and up screen size so you know
that's where these some of the better
LCD and Plasma zar hovering right now
like i was talking about with that
panasonic st thirty one thousand dollars
that's actually got down to nine hundred
dollars for a 50-inch that we gave an
eight in performance to which is
excellent and you know one of the best
pictures we've seen so that's a pretty
good combination right there but I
wouldn't actually wait for this year's
TVs to come out if y'all you can always
wait you know you know in six months
it's going to be another TV to you know
it's an unending cycle so if you're
looking for a TV now probably februari
when these models going out and then
once we're going to see if this show
start coming in you're gonna see really
cheap tvs really good tvs yeah so I
wouldn't wait for this use technology if
you need a TV right now that's good
because i just bought 10 so this is just
so i didn't feel bad back
for you Ray thank you so much now
speaking of weird stuff that's going
into TVs so we've got four different
technologies play technologies we've got
plasma oulad crystal LED regular old LCD
actually there's more than the different
ways they like that with the old tube so
i guess the tubes are gone edge-lit and
back lift oh that's a lot of
technologies to sort out me yeah and and
manufacturers don't make it clear to
consumers they basically just say hey
it's led we have a big explainer up that
lists the four different types of LED
backlights that are available now and
that's actually a big differentiator for
video files who want the best picture
quality out of their led-based LCD TVs
it's good to know the differences but
you know it's still a lot of stuff out
there I think of some manufacturers do
thrive on that confusion people just go
screw it I'm going to buy you know
whatever is expensive hence our jobs
manufacturers thank you very much for
young confusing please keep it up so we
can continue to explain things anyways
they can understand it thank you now
panasonic in addition to being a hold
out with plasmas also you said they have
a dual core TV yeah this is I so crazy
you know we went through the whole dual
core was the savior of computing then it
went into our phones last year and now
it's in our televisions next year is
going to be juicers that's our juicers
yeah okay but Android juices it's going
to happen essentially what the trial
would put it past them they've tried the
3d is really amazing they've tried the
it's got sixty percent more black which
doesn't really mean anything so they're
going for the technology angle they're
going for okay it's got a dual-core
processor but actually what it's doing
is that because there's so much
technology in there you've got a lot of
different things like Netflix having a
dual core actually makes that sort of
process a lot smoother so do we do so we
want our big displays to be basically
computers essentially how long until
they we get Android TV all we have
google TV we do yeah yeah we have right
now lenovo go announced one a couple of
days ago yeah
android TV and a couple of manufactures
are still doing Google TV LG is actually
coming up with air Google TV in the next
couple of months Samsung hasn't talked
about Google TV that I think they will
to Vizio even said you know they're
going to push their Google TV to follow
this year so those things are out there
you know I don't know whether or not
people actually want them or enjoy them
we were just talking backstage and it
sounds like the actual apps built into
the TV or not that satisfying for you
Rafe and at the end of the day you Adam
yeah broken and it's fifty dollars and
you get the same thing and it's you know
you know to worry about it does anybody
make a really good monitor that's just a
display panel that says you can put in
your signal and we're not going to junk
it up with all these apps which we
really don't know how to make interfaces
for the last thing that really did that
was the pioneer kuro is what three years
ago yeah they went for out an app
picture quality but the problem was that
people didn't buy it because they didn't
want what was a mr. an Australian TV
eleven thousand dollars they didn't want
to spend on it didn't have features they
want big screen they want cheap and he
can't really sell a high-end TV in this
market anymore which is a shame yeah
because the upgrade cycle is migs mixed
up i mean the display technology that
you get today will be good for another
maybe five years maybe 10 but you know
if you buy a dual-core plasma display or
you look for anything right now that's
going to be obsolete in 18 months on the
outside technologically most of the
readers that i talked to are completely
unconcerned about those sorts of things
they want the picture quality first and
foremost you know it all these extras
that manufactures add-in are a little
less relevant I think the answer your
question you know guys can't do it they
can't build these you know these TVs
with just the monitor only because
they're competing directly on a spec
sheet by specially basis with other
manufacturers and they all have stuff
built in so the market really isn't
there and guys you know if you have 6 15
dozen the other you look at two TVs and
one is a complete monitor and you have
to take the manufactures word for it
that is pure sport lay is excellent
unless it's significantly less expensive
really no images for that and of course
the flip side of that is that these TVs
are the expensive ones are you know the
ones that have the best picture quality
so you know they throw in these extra
features it doesn't cost too much to
throw in dual core all that stuff into
these TVs now there is one vendor that
we haven't talked about and aren't going
to hear from here at the show when it
comes to television that's Apple yeah is
it possible the reasons that there are
only smart functions going into TVs is
because people are trying to get out in
front of apple and when Apple comes
along and with their whatever it is
television if they do do you think
they'll kind of eat the lunch of
everybody who's building apps in I'm so
sick of hearing about this Apple TV this
mythical television the thing is we've
got an apple TV now it's on this show
floor it's it's Samsung that's LG to
some extent we've got these features now
and what we can participate you know
imagine is going to happen in the future
is happening now yeah we've got eating
connects if you've got an xbox you can
still do those those functions so I
don't think it's worth waiting for an
apple TV you know if you want that sort
of functionality which is still fairly
better as far as you know being able to
be sold in the work the marketplace ah
yeah you can get it now don't wait for
three years I think Rafe one of the
things that is a little conspiracy going
around right now is the reason why these
manufacturers Samsung and LG are pushing
out 55-inch oled is because that is the
display technology that apple TV is you
know according to rumor going to be
using so Apple is not going to release a
TV that Tyrone Oracle about this earlier
they're not going to release a TV that
has mediocre picture quality they're
going to go for something that has
really good fish quality so the thinking
is if they do that it's going to be Ola
it's going to be wow I said when people
look at all their TVs it is wow you know
you're like wow that really that picture
really does look better than what I have
at home or what I've seen before so if
you're going to if your Apple you want
that yeah now one of the things we
haven't talked about is something that
definitely is out ahead of the curve in
terms of technology and that is the 4k
display technology which we're hearing
about from a couple of vendors what is
4k what does that mean to the two to the
buyer what was that movie that came out
a couple of years ago Blade Runner they
actually rereleased a digital print that
was in foreplay it's essentially 4000
pixels by about
thousand pixels essentially it's a
cinema format so you've got a lot of the
digital films a lot of 3d films are
actually Sloan in the cinema in 4k yeah
so what they're trying to do is sort of
shoehorn that into a consumer television
for no real reason unless you've got a
cinema sized room in your house you
don't really need for K what it is
useful for is dividing into so you
actually get full HD passive 3d
technology yeah so that's the only real
reason you so when you go see a movie
that a digital movie that's mostly and
that's in 4k today right yes again it's
for the big screen sizes and like I said
the ability to get rid of passive TV
right now it's basically half resolution
on 3d so what LG told me is that they're
actually you can get full HD resolution
to both eyes if you're looking at this
past a display with 4k resolution so
that's one little selling point but at
the end of the day these are again it's
you're not going to get any content
that's 2d 4k for the near future yeah
and I heard about where was it sharp was
talking about 8k 8k and so a que has I
think about the same amount of content
for the consumer that is available as 4k
right which is to say none if you can
get the master discs of Blade Runner
maybe you can watch 4k all day but would
there be any visual visible this
difference between 4k and AK are we down
to that too what what Steve Jobs called
the retina display where that's the
limit of our resolution yeah it's really
hard to see a difference for a lot of
people between 720p and 1080p so you
know when you start talking about these
resolutions that are 4 times 8 times as
high as that it's really no pay off
unless you're on a gigantic screen or
sitting and possibly posted hey we got
to wrap up and there's one thing we
didn't talk about because I hate it
which is 3d so really briefly the state
of 3d here at CES if people forgot about
it is going to be back next year what's
going on with 3d it's going to be a
function it's going to be something you
have I don't know if they have telly
text here I'm going to straight in but
telly Texas a feature it's just like a
tick box and 3d is going to be the same
I can see passive really taking off
people don't want to pay extra for
glasses if you get six pairs in the in
the box that's good and so you can watch
a 3d movie once a year maybe so you're
going to be paying for 3d TVs anyway but
yeah I think
way to go one of those features comes
along with it yeah all right so for more
great TV coverage check out CNN com and
stay tuned what's up come on exit 44 is
coming up next ty pendlebury from CNN
kastle-meyer from Cena thank you so much
for joining us i'm rafe needleman see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
