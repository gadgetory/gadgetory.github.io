for its printers and scanners they're
the latest company to enter the wearable
market with a line of running watches
and activity trackers I'm dan Graziano
and I'm here with the Epson run sense SF
810 this isn't a SmartWatch it's not an
activity tracker but rather a GPS
equipped running watch not only can you
measure your pace and distance when
running but you can also measure your
beats per minute the best part is that
you don't have to wear one of those
uncomfortable chest straps thanks to the
optical heart rate sensor on the back of
the watch I compared the heart rate
sensor to a polar chest strap and found
the results to be nearly identical which
is quite impressive I was also impressed
with how accurate the GPS tracking was
which was on par if not better than
competing products from Garmin and polar
what I liked the most about the watch
was the amount of data it presented the
sfa 10 features 35 different data points
that you can pick and choose to display
across four customisable screens which
gives you the option of displaying one
two or three lines of data points on
each I was also impressed with the
battery life with both the active GPS
signal and heart rate tracking turned on
it will last 20 hours this is compared
to 10 hours on the similar equipped
Garmin Forerunner 225 overall I got
about 2 weeks of usage out of the SF 810
before I was required to charge it
during this time I used the GPS and
heart rate sensor for around 30 to 40
minutes four to five times a week it's
also a good thing you don't have to
charge it often because doing so
requires you connected to the
mammoth-sized charging cradle which can
be a huge pain to carry around now I did
run into some issues when attempting to
acquire GPS signal in New York City
Epson has an assisted GPS feature which
will pre cache your location on your
watch using your smart phone but even
with this enabled the watch would take
longer than the Garmin Forerunner 225
and polar m4 100 even on some days it
just couldn't get a signal I was also
turned off by Epsons runs connect mobile
app it's one of the worst things about
using the SF 810 not only is the upload
process slow and at times unreliable but
overall navigation through the menu is
met with loading icons and frequent
delays there's also no
automatic syncing you're instead
required to hold the lap button to
initiate sync mode and then manually
upload each run the sfa 10 is a bit
pricey as well in the US that will run
you $350 that's $50 more than the Garmin
Forerunner 225 which has heart rate
tracking and adds all-day activity
tracking but the sfa 10 could still be
an appealing purchase simply for the
accurate tracking and the impressive
battery life for more information check
out my full review over at cnn.com I'm
Dan graziano frisina and that was a
first look of the Epson run sense SF 810</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
