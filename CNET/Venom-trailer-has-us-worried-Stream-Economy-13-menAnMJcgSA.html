you where to invest your time across
movies TV shows and games guys there's a
new venom trailer out and we got to talk
about it
Sony dropped the first full official
trailer for venom earlier this week
which was probably a smart move
considering how many trailers got lost
in the wake of comic-con Tom Hardy plays
journalist Eddie Brock there's a
sentient alien parasite
Riz Ahmed looks rich and sinister chaos
ensues for me the question here is is
the trailer scary oh maybe so Tom
Hardy's accent as any Brock is a little
bit concerning and it sounds like he's
struggling to put two sentences together
so I don't know about that the movie
itself and the trailer kind of seems
like it doesn't know if it's an r-rated
horror antihero film or a more
family-friendly pg-13 that still kind of
toes the line towards a rated R and on
top of that the eternal question is it's
in by out or symbiote and symbiote
we call them symbiosis it looks like
this version of venom is going to be
based off of the lethal protector
version of the comics which was a
six-issue run that included I'm not
joking a storyline in which venom went
to live underground with California mold
people but he also fought five other
symbiotes now at Comic Con this year
Sony confirmed that the symbiote that
had taken over RZA meds body in the
trailer that we just watched was
actually riot so that's one of those
five symbiotes so that actually sounds
like a really cool thing and I'm pretty
excited if they can pull it off look
Sony has a problem maybe just like DC
where they're a little impatient they
want to do something without building
the foundation first I get that because
you want to just get there but they're
gonna have to be patient here I want
this movie to be good you guys I want
this movie to bring about a trilogy of
venom films that then culminate in venom
taking on spider-man his arch-nemesis
it's gonna be the greatest thing and
it's what comic book fans deserve it's
what they deserve I'm telling you guys
that's what they deserve
speaking of Horrors from outer space now
it's getting a reboot yeah that's right
everyone's favorite cat eating
from melmac might get resurrected from
his grave if you haven't seen Alf it's
about a furry alien who crash lands on
earth and lives with a suburban family
with HIGHlarious results supposedly
Warner Brothers is in early stages of
development on the revival but honestly
is it a good idea to bring back Alf
I've been thinking a lot about this
since the news broke and I think I can
explain why this might not be the best
idea with macaroni and cheese
or let's call it mel mac and cheese
because it's self so macaroni and cheese
is my favorite comfort food i love
eating it it's a lot like Alf it's warm
and cheesy and it makes me feel good and
it makes me forget about all of the
trials and tribulations of adulthood
however these studios are going into the
cemeteries of our nostalgia and digging
up all the things that we loved in order
to feed us this bland food that we used
to love when we were kids but we have
more sophisticated palates now we can't
eat macaroni and cheese every single
meal of the day so what I am saying here
is as much as I love macaroni and cheese
that now that I am an adult and I've
changed society's changed television has
changed we have more sophisticated
palates we want different interesting
new things I want the equivalent of a
television sushi or an amazing
margherita pizza there's all kinds of
great things out there we can't just eat
mac and cheese every day so Alf I am
sorry but it's gonna be a no from me dog
sorry go back just go back to the 80s so
you can have characters who may have
outlived their usefulness guys there is
an insane community uprising happening
in world of warcraft that community is
in revolt after Blizzard revealed in a
war bringer short that none other than
Sylvanas Windrunner the Warchief of the
Horde was the woman responsible for
burning down the Night Elf World Tree
teldrassil scandal oh but I know you
guys are super mad about this it could
be a good thing I've played quite a bit
of World of Warcraft in my life
let me explain get ready for some lore
when Sylvanas was made leader of the
horde players thought it maybe meant she
would bend toward a more thrall like Ark
that's to say if you don't know who
thrall is she would respond to being put
in charge by becoming more heroic and
less dark now we knew back at Blizzcon
2017 that the World Tree had in fact
been burned down we just didn't know who
did it
until this war bringer short when we
found out that it was in fact Sylvanas
players have responded to this in a very
angry manner
some people say they feel betrayed by
Blizzard how dare they make Sylvanas a
war criminal for all intents and
purposes because they're innocent Night
Elves living in that world tree that she
burned down and on top of that they
don't feel that they want to be forced
into being the evil team for the
upcoming expansion but then there are
other people who are like um hey guys
this also includes me by the way
Sylvanas literally had her soul sucked
out by Arthas she is soulless she is a
soulless woman what did you expect at
the end of the day I'm not sure what's
gonna happen with Sylvanas Windrunner
who knows what will go on but if she is
in fact the final raid boss of the
upcoming battle for Azeroth expansion
that would be going out on an iconic
level that we have not seen since Arthas
since the Lich King himself so I say
what a way to go and I kind of hope it
happens sorry
also for the Horde do you still love me
that's my bad those are my favorite news
stories of the week but there was one
story this week that I thought was
really interesting which was that Carrie
Fisher would actually be reappearing in
episode 9 due to some unreleased footage
that Lucasfilm and Disney had from
episode 8 now I am cautiously optimistic
about that because her daughter Billie
lourd has approved whatever way they're
going to bring her back into the film so
I feel good about that but there was a
person who also wanted to talk about it
and that is of course Mark Searles
remember when Connie fresh off gold blew
a space shuttle bet and she entered the
glass and she's in a spear since she's
like
I'm deed I was like how good start
because she's deed in real life and then
she was like surprise I'm alive I'm
using the force to float through space
but were they going to dinner the other
did the huddle did and then she's not
deed they're gonna use the footage of
already go I get that but that's not
going to be Everett leave it whenever
you're in there and we're gonna use that
CGI crap because honestly Christ man I
swear to God if they be a grand moff
tarkin Tihar I don't want my last day my
last memory I Princess Lea I be some men
all like robot computer face another one
or robot Carrie Fisher I don't want a
hologram to Pyke dancing in my Star Wars
the youth that's all Luna so we mark
gets really excited sometimes anyway if
you enjoyed the show please feel free to
watch last week's comic-con episode
which was really fun and of course you
