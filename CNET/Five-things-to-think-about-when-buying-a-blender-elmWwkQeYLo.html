to make smoothies sauces or your
favorite frozen cocktail these are the
things you need to know before you buy
size if you only need an appliance that
whips up individual smoothie servings
each morning then a personal blender
will suit you best to supply large
groups go with the machine with a
high-capacity jar power pretty much any
blender can dice soft fruit into a
smooth drink tougher items such as ice
leafy greens with lots of fiber and nuts
require an appliance with a powerful
motor
not to mention well-designed blades
price how much are you willing to spend
kitchen blenders range widely in price
you can buy one for under $100 several
hundred or close to $1,000 many fancy
blenders from Vitamix and KitchenAid for
example also tend to come with glossy
cookbooks with lots of splashy color
photos if you can live without the
gourmet treatment choosing a more
mundane machine could save you a lot of
cash technology a lot of blenders these
days try to use sophisticated technology
to prepare food automatically so you
might see a machine with buttons to
blend smoothies soups or crush ice with
just one key press the cleanup blending
food is messy hopefully keeping your new
appliance clean won't be too much
trouble
a thoughtfully built blender won't have
too many ridges nooks and crannies for
dirt and debris to collect inside or
worse gets stuck some blenders even
feature an automatic cleaning mode to
ease your pain so if you consider these
factors you're sure to find a blender
that's a perfect match for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
