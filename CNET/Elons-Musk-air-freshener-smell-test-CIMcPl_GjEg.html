it's very chemically and like just bad I
don't wanna keep smelling it I feel bad
now what does success smell like we're
about to find out when reporting on
billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk there
is a question that many have wondered
but few have dared to ask what is the
musk of Elon Musk now we can find out
what the SpaceX and Tesla founder smells
like thanks to a company that's making
car air fresheners that smell like Elon
Musk it's designed by fans not
officially endorsed by Elon Musk the
website that sells them for about seven
dollars a piece describes it as quite
leathery with low notes of rocket fuel
we put his scent up against other car
air fresheners in a blind whiff test the
blindfold sir mm-hmm am I the first one
wearing this no that's me okay I'm gonna
hand you your first scent okay yeah I
don't know lemon hand soap
sandalwood Oh oh I feel like this is
what they put in stores to try to keep
you shopping it kind of lands me
pine-sol smells like my grandma's
apartment threw up a cup of coffee beans
look I want to eat these delightful
scent number two okay this smells like
the bathroom at a strip club like I'm
not very good smile I'm sorry where's
the coffee is it in front of me this
one's great all right and number three I
don't know a clean bathroom or a cab
I don't mean like a Cabernet I mean like
a you know somebody's driving a car that
kind of thing
oh this I like feel like an acorn sort
of shape or or a dreidel like a changing
table what if you met someone who
smelled that way I meet them all the
time people have no idea how bad they
smell like old lady baby powder kind of
a woodsy earthy or maybe even a very
clean restroom oh yeah but I wouldn't
want like a guy or a woman smelling like
this this smell makes me feel bad just
an old lady that's maybe smelling this
couple thank you all right take the
blindfold off oh no what's that is it is
it like a youtube guy Elon Musk
oh it's Elon Musk what it's so stupid
would you imagine that that's what Elon
Musk smelled like I hope not yeah I
guess that's what it smelled like in
real life I'm gonna go find it let's go
I feel like he's one of those hyper
obsessive guys who probably doesn't put
any thought at all into what he wears
what he smells like he probably as a
closet filled the same outfit supposed
to smell like space a space smell like
this he's just working all the time
multiple companies building robots who
knows what Elon Musk
smells like building other robots to
defend us from the first robots when
they achieve sentience and try to kill
us I wouldn't say that it smells
anything like money if that's what's
supposed to smell thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
