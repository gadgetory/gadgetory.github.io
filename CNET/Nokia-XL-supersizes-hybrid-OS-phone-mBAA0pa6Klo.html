cnet and this is the Nokia XL this is
the largest phone in the nokia X family
now the x family is sort of like a
combination hybrid of android windows
phone and nokia Asha OS Android is the
backbone and you've got some icons on
top that are reminiscent of both Windows
Phone and Asha interfaces with some of
the services of both but you can't think
of this as an Android phone because you
can't use Google Play services you can
only get apps through the Nokia Store a
little bit limited so keep in mind this
experience as you see the rest of the
device even though the screen is 5
inches pixel density is pretty low about
187 PGI versus somewhere in the 300
range for higher end phones so although
you do get the real estate for watching
movies reading the articles you're still
not going to see is sharp and crisp as
detail as you would on a higher-end
phone this phone is definitely in the
budget end of the range it'll cost about
150 150 pounds that's the lower starting
end but of course prices will vary and
fluctuate for market to market now the
phone comes in this bright green color
but it comes in other shades as well so
you've got a variety to choose from on
the front you've got the single
navigation button you can long press to
get back home and short press to go back
to previous screen there are several
screens on the interface here and you
scroll vertically to access your apps to
your recents get your news feed
navigation is pretty simple on the back
we've got a 5 megapixel camera with
flash I thought photo quality was okay
in some circumstances but definitely not
very clear sharp still usable and
there's a 2-megapixel front-facing
camera same story there inside there's a
1 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor found the phone to be a little
bit sluggish a dual sim as well storage
capacity is pretty small at four
gigabytes but there is an expandable
option to up to 32 gigabytes so if you
are looking for a budget experience and
you don't mind the
kind of outdated looking interface then
the hardware is really good and I would
definitely recommend the XL for that
however if you're looking for something
that's pure Android this is not the
phone for you keep looking I'm Jessica
