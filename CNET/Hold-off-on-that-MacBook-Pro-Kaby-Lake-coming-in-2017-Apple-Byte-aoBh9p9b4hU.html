the Apple buy for everything good a bad
inside the world of Apple and let's
start the show with the latest MacBook
news now if you're still unsure if you
want to get one KGI securities reports
all mac books will be upgraded to
Intel's latest cabby Lake chipset that
was announced at CES 2017 they'll bring
a 20% performance increase for laptops
and lower power consumption but on top
of that the 15 inch model will also get
the 32 gig ram option many pro users
we're looking for in the first
generation see that's exactly why you
should wait now the report also says the
13-inch model without the touch bar has
performed worse than expected and Apple
will cut its price in hopes to improve
that also the latest fourth beta of Mac
OS Sierra 10-point 12.3 brings a new
feature and will warn you if the display
brightness affects your MacBooks battery
life hold on hold on uh-huh okay um I've
been informed we did not pronounce that
correctly it's actually Michaels
yeah okay we're good now the warning
only appears if your brightness is
anything higher than 75% we know about
the new MacBooks battery issues Apple
says they've fixed it but it's still
only available in the beta and we
haven't seen how much it actually fixes
for regular day-to-day users now we'd
love to hear any of your stories or
experiences with your new MacBook Pro
overall there's no way I was gonna get
the first gen but are you happy with it
are you not let us know at the Apple bye
to see Netcom and we'll post some of
your comments in next week's show okay
an iPhone rumors according to Cohen &amp;amp;
Company the next iPhone could have
facial recognition thanks to a new laser
sensor it's the first rumor we've heard
of any kind of depth sensor as part of
the package but Apple has never had face
recognition on their phones Apple's
acquisition of primeSense in 2013 the
team behind the Microsoft Kinect camera
could help with Apple's push for
augmented reality in the future as well
the multiple reports are on board with
the idea that we'll see 3 iPhones this
year the standard 4.7 and 5.5 inch
iPhone upgrades and a premium 5.8 inch
Lyne phone with wireless charging see
just what the people want a phone that
doesn't fit into any of its hipster
skinny jean wearing fanboys I'll write
in a follow-up to the airport from last
week's show the numbers probably aren't
as good as we thought
MPD says the slice intelligence numbers
with a 26 percent market share for air
pods we're only based on online sales
and pretty much misleading MPD data
includes brick-and-mortar sales and
online sales altogether they found
apples air pods market share is more
like a two percent share see Q the sad
trombone
now MPD did mention it's pretty
impressive for Apple to even make a dent
like that in such a short time Beats led
with 25% of unit sales LG had 10% and
Bose brought in 8% of sales but Apple is
already neck and neck with Plantronics
and jaybird at 2% after only one partial
month of sales see that my friends is
the power of the Apple brand now a
sketchy rumor says the Apple pencil 2
will launch alongside new iPad pro
models this year let me guess
it will be thinner and take away
features people still use come on I'm
messing with it all you diehards who
always get their feelings hurt when I
say stuff like that
now patent filings have shown potential
new capabilities like being able to draw
on the Smart Cover like a drawing pad
Apple's been testing it to work on an
iPhone with iMovie and different apps
you know exactly what Steve Jobs never
wanted No who wants a stylus you have to
get them and put them away and you'll
lose him yeah plus there's also been
patents filed by Apple for it to work on
a Mac's trackpad as well now Apple is
expected to keep the 12 point 9 inch
iPad pro a lower-cost nine point seven
inch one and bring in a new 10.5 inch
model with reduced bezels this year as
this we're talking iPad pro we need to
go back to last week's show where we
featured a dude holding it with one hand
at Obama's farewell speech now lots of
you were freaking out how he was holding
it upside down as well I saw that too
but I have to point out it was actually
smarter for him to do that to get a
steady picture since the camera lens
would be closer to his hand
instead of being further away at the top
and swaying a whole lot more while he
held it up right so you know what for
that he deserves a good apple but there
is still no excuse no damn excuse for
him or anyone to use an iPad to take
pictures in public you know how I feel
about that and yeah that's a bad apple
all right that's going to do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bye to see Netcom about your mac
pro experiences for next week's show or
just tweet me a bryan song if you need a
friend in 140 characters or less thanks
so much for watching we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
