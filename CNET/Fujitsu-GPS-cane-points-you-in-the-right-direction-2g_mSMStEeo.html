Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where
I'm looking at the fujitsu new
generation cane which is a prototype
21st century digitally connected walking
cane that's designed not only to help
seniors get around but also to give
peace of mind to family and friends so
the new generation cane it has this big
contoured plastic handle to make it
comfortable to hold so the seniors can
use it to guide them to help them get
around and the way it works is you
pre-program the route into this software
on your computer and then that sends
through GPS built into the cane it puts
little arrows on the top to show you
where you want to walk and it also beams
back the location of the cane to the
computer so family and friends and loved
ones can monitor where you are for
example it also has a humidity and
temperature sensor in it so if things
are getting quite hot and you're worried
about the the senior citizen in your
life who's out there with the cane and
what you can do is you can guide them to
somewhere where it's a little bit cooler
so they can have a sit down other
features include a heart rate monitor
built-in so if you grip onto it and put
your thumb over it here then it will
monitor your heart rate and that
information also gets sent back to the
computer and all that data gets saved up
and you can keep it for your family and
friends you can look at yourself and you
can also send it to your doctor or
health care professional so it has Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth built in as well as GPS
now at the moment the the battery lasts
for about three hours so it's all for a
good long hike but it's only a prototype
so it may well have a longer lasting
battery when it actually comes to market
so that's the prototype new generation
cane to help senior citizens get around
I'm rich a trend I'm have seen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
