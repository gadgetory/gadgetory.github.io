Android phone for you to get excited
about it's called the Nokia eight and
unlike Nikes previous Android phones
this one is a real powerhouse at its
core is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
protesser backed up by four gig of ram
it's delivered benchmark scores to
easily rival Samsung's Galaxy s8 so rest
assured there's very little you can
throw at it that you can't handle the 5
point 4 inch display is pin-sharp thanks
to the Ultra HD resolution it's also
bright enough to use even under these
office lights around the back you'll
find not one but two cameras one of
which shoots in color the other only in
black and white
good news for those of you that love
those dramatic Moody portraits they both
have 13 megapixel resolutions and both
will shoot video in 4k there's a 13
megapixel camera on the front as well
and thanks to some software trickery you
can take photos with both the front and
back camera to combine them into a
single split screen image you can also
livestream that split screen view
directly to Facebook or YouTube for
those occasions when you want to show
off a lovely scene and you're grinning
stealthy at the same time that's all
wrapped up in a really slick highly
polished metal body which I think looks
really smart although it is a total
fingerprint magnet Nokia says the phone
is splash proof not waterproof which is
disappointing given the waterproofing is
something that we're used to seeing on
top-end phones on the upside it has a
fingerprint scanner on the front it
charges over USBC and it's got the
latest version of Android on board at
599 euros is absolutely not cheap where
that top-end price will get you a
top-end phone it's absolutely worth
considering particularly if you have any
kind of nostalgia for the Nokia name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
