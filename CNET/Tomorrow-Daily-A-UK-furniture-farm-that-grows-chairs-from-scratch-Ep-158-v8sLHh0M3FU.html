researchers show off a battery that
recharges in less than a minute and soon
you're going to be able to watch
television for free on your xbox one
I'll tell you how in just a second hold
on and a UK company is growing furniture
like literally growing furniture out of
the ground and we'll explain how sera
really
creating citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe
every co-host Ashley Scott join me as
always kill anonymous I totally picture
you having to grow the furniture and
then put it together like IKEA he's like
yeah you grow the parts the little allen
wrench and then you have to put together
with your friends good I can buy the
seeds now forgetting you can't even buy
a flower back that's not like you I
presume it's cooler than that it is it's
pretty great okay we got some good it's
weird but it's really cool all right do
it
number one complain about most smart
phones batteries battery life yeah
running out of battery right okay so
researchers at Stanford University
showed off this video this week which
made me so happy I almost like turned
into the Willy Wonka blast elevator just
shot right through my ceiling they
showed off this aluminum battery that
recharges in less than a minute so this
is the battery right here and this is a
prototype aluminum battery and like we
said that can recharge in about a minute
it's powering an LED right there you can
see it they little green LED here's some
facts about aluminum a bendable not like
lithium-ion batteries which would make
super flexible smart phones and things a
possibility well there it is powering a
smart phone I think they had a couple of
them are a few of them altogether so a
little bit about aluminum batteries I
guess this has been a material that
researchers have kind of had their eye
on for a long time like they've been
interested in making batteries out of
aluminum but the biggest hurdles have
been voltage and also getting it to the
point where it can have multiple
recharge cycles so being able to plug it
in over and over again and have being
able to use the phone so now they're
saying that this is has no recharge
decay over hundreds or even thousands of
recharge cycles which is pretty awesome
because with lithium-ion they over time
they decrease so there's that they are
inexpensive they are fully bendable and
they are made of aluminum and graphite
so they're saying that now that they've
made this a loom
battery or if I was Johnny I've caught
aluminium now that they've made this
aluminium battery they're saying that
the goals are from this point forward a
making it scale up so finding ways to
scale up the battery technology increase
the capacity obviously because you want
to be able to power things that are
bigger than an LED light and then they
also want to get a low cost electro
electrolyte material so they're working
on sort of developing this battery and
moving forward with it but it is a great
interest I think to a lot of people to
everybody a lot of people's batteries
yeah batteries are big business and the
thing is is I think I think really
that's kind of been the the big gate on
new technologies I mean for me is
battery because really there's only so
much you can do when you need to have a
little block of lithium ion inside a
device or you need to have a small watch
battery or you know whatever that is
this is flexible it's it's totally
bendable you saw it in the video they
just like bent it right up so I think
this is really cool it could be really
exciting I know we're kind of also
waiting on graphene that's a another
battery technology that has the
potential to be pretty amazing
but yeah so aluminium and and and
graphite I think we can all get behind
this I am behind it 150 percent that's a
little too much nice work Stanford I'm
looking forward to the future of this
battery I'm keeping my eyes on it I want
this for summer
how can i watch Xbox TV alka watch TV on
my xbox for you said free yeah you can
oh my god yet okay but very very soon
because this was announced today so one
of the best reasons to own a console
whether it be Xbox or Playstation is
because it's also a media device yeah do
you watch TV movies use apps and stuff
like that well they added a feature that
has been actually available outside of
the US and Canada they added it to to to
us u.s. and Canadians can now get this
feature which is that we can now stream
television from television signals so
it's for free so these are okay these
are local stations like oh yeah like Fox
CBS
NBC and so on this is very very simple
that's why this feature is so cool all
you have to do is buy this little
attachment adapter and then put an
antenna up and you can stream all of
this stuff through your Xbox but not
only that you can also pause the live TV
because this is a live feed but because
you're using it on this Xbox one you can
pause that's really nice unbelievable
feature one of the other things that
Major Tom shows off over here is that is
that you can also stream it to your
tablets so I can watch my life my live
stream get content on there while you're
playing I don't know infamous - Xbox
exclusive but yeah so I so there are
some limitations to this you have to
find out what you have in your area as
far as broadcasts and you can go to Como
who comm / Xbox to find out what's
available in your area if you out your
an xbox pre preview program member
you're gonna get this earlier than
everybody else apparently it's coming to
the rest of us very very very very soon
a lot of people are saying this ship
they should pair this with something
like Slingbox link TV yeah HBO now well
because this is free subway sling TV is
that it didn't include all of all of
broadcasts like over your local
broadcast networks and so this would be
a way to get that for free I mean even
though you have to make an investment
with an Xbox one and which is not cheap
and then the antenna and everything but
still to be able to have broadcast TV
where you're able to pause it like
you're saying I can get pause you don't
get DVR it doesn't have DVR right no DVR
no pausing it is something because you
know otherwise you just like life you
should sit there yeah obviously isn't
gonna blow anybody away it's not gonna
sell Xboxes but if you've already got an
xbox and you live in the United States
or Canada at least now you know you have
that capability it only cost a couple of
bucks to get like I'm sorry that's it's
probably about five dollars to get like
the adapter and the antenna I bought my
antenna for like three dollars
yeah the HDTV antennas are really
I think I think there is like a box that
they said like I think he was saying
something along the lines of it being
there was like a the adapter was the
more expensive thing but there are
options like you don't have to worry
about like oh it's gonna be like $200
for this like adapter whatever so so if
you're if you're a cable cutter and or
you're tired of watching stuff on your
cable service you can watch Family Guy
you can watch last man on earth you can
all watch all that stuff through your
xbox and pause it whatnot that's save it
but there you go still keep an eye out
you got to keep an eye out again inside
out yeah just keep an eye out and just
look for it when it comes out and even
get all your friends to it yeah and they
can all come over to your house so I
gotta tell you about this furniture this
furniture
oh yeah they grow your own furniture
yeah okay so um there's a company in the
UK called full grown and the guy who
sort of founded it his name is Gavin
Munroe he decided to figure out an
alternative to the standard way of
making furniture which is like chopping
down a lot of trees and then you have to
use fossil fuels to run the bulldozers
and chainsaws and yeah as I said there's
a lot of manufacturing kind of waste of
that and wood waste as well because
you're you know basically taking a tree
trunk and you're whittling it down to
like a leg on a table so this guy I love
this story decided to figure out an
alternative here's where it gets weird
he uses a special plastic frame to coax
trees made out of willow oak ash and
sycamore into the shapes of specific
kinds of furniture so the tree that's
the tree that is the tree there's no
extra wood that was cut out of this he
taught the tree to make a shape so
here's yeah this is what it looks like
when they're there twice everything and
they have to kind of guide the tree into
growing in a very specific fashion and
they grow it into chairs tables frames
and lamps and when the tree matures
fully it's a complete piece of furniture
there's no wood waste it's just a chair
or a table or whatever it's pretty
clever that's how they do like the like
art and like animals like the shrubbery
yeah
I got llama in the shape of like like a
tree in the shape of a llama yes this is
similar to that only the entire there's
no trimming or pruning it's just the
tree has grown into that shape so does
it make what does it makes chair chairs
tables frames there's like mirror frames
and lamps and okay so there are about
400 trees at their farm and what they do
when it's done is they just buff it out
and they add some like they're doing
this right now for like the flat side of
the chair and stuff so they'll sand
everything and you know stay and seal it
stain it if they want to you like
whatever but you get this completely
original one-of-a-kind chair because
it's a tree
I want this okay okay okay so mind you
it takes four to eight years oh yeah I
can of it cuz you know just grow a chair
so but look at me I mean it's so cool
that's the order now you can order now
and you get okay so so he is saying oh
look at this diagram is so cute um so
it's like he's calling it organic 3d
printing so it's like organic 3d
printing so there they are like take
taking that one out like in the
wintertime they like harvest all the Jer
how much all right so first round of
chairs will be ready in 2017 so you got
a couple more years to wait and it's
gonna cost you 3700 so we're we gonna
sit in the veinte on the grounds that's
pretty cool pricey chair better it's a
price you get that turn you put it in
your house you better be like when
people walk in like hey hey everybody
come I appreciate it lamps the lamps and
frames will be ready in spring of next
year but they didn't have prices on that
you you have to click an Inquirer button
on the website which means it's not
gonna be cheap
if I'm guessing probably like 2,000 but
it's still really cool still of the idea
of Catan and it brings me us to our
hashtag of the day which is TD tree and
the question is what would you want to
grow from organic material if you could
grow anything like what's the thing that
you would want to grow out of organic
material so this guy's making
furniture out of trees which is pretty
awesome okay what would you do if I
could I would love some way to build a
car out of like I guess it would sort of
like seashells I guess like I like the
idea of like having serve a developed
cuz it like I don't know I I think it
would be awesome or or a boat out of
seaweed where it's like a floating like
a nice this is a very bizarre question
of the day it is a weird question of the
day I picked it because I want you guys
get a little bit weird about it I guess
I would want a suit of armor uh-huh made
of rocks I like that or just iron that
just naturally created its own actually
can hire man but I can't go anywhere in
it I like I I dig okay I see strange I
think they'll have some fun like a suit
made out of like palm tree leaves it
just grows into a suit and they you just
walk into it kind of like that yeah I
think that they had that in like in hook
yeah yeah that they were throw out there
and their heads were coconuts or
something like that
have fun with that you guys we're gonna
take a quick break and we will be right
back with a really really cool Mod Squad
straight of Star Trek and we also have
your user feedback and our phones are
good for the day so don't click away
it's tomorrow daily oh and check this
out
welcome back to the show I love that
tars cosplay it's so cool
yeah it's like how they made it in the
movie to look a guy just behind it just
straight-up went for it and looks
amazing do you see that he like had a
camera like a camera built into it so
you could see from the back
what tars is seeing in the front oh yeah
very very good genius I love it I hope
it comes to comic-con maybe he'll bring
it to comic-con and we could see it in
person I'm team tars I am a team tars
all the way to okay so it is Wednesday
which means we like to kind of find cool
and crazy mods all over the internet
this is Mod Squad what is there a
graphic doing there did you so nice
looks amazing
well done okay all right so this week's
this week's Mod Squad comes from
Christof Koch and roll Schwartz which
sound like awesome Star Trek names
actually I was just thinking about that
and they made a Wi-Fi access point USS
Enterprise and there's video of it so
here's the process they took it all
apart they used a ubiquity ap Pro access
point and they reassembled it inside the
USS Enterprise model this is the
original enterprise from the the og Star
Trek television series okay so not next
generation nope no TNG here this is all
oh gee Star Trek and so what they did
was so the would base they made one that
looks like the the logo and they put the
plug in there and then they have some
LED lights in there and everything and
so there it is they're working on
putting this access point inside they
got all the cables wrapped up and then
they put the lid on it and boom it is a
beautiful at Wi-Fi access point that you
never even know about because it just
looks like a model of the USS Enterprise
so it lights up then - as will you yeah
it's got some LED lighting on the board
that looks like wouldn't you see the
middle of it like when it's dark it
looks like there's activity going on
inside the ship which is pretty cool
this is kind of my favorite Mod Squad
kind of it's so it's so fun and such a
simple concept but it really nailed it
in terms of execution
I mean you could I would never be able
to tell that there was a Wi-Fi access
point in there I wonder what the
password to their Wi-Fi hotspot is I'm
gonna guess it's something engage in
Klingon Oh or maybe make it so make it
so yeah but that's I know it's TNG but
you know they did a little reddit AMA
about it like they were answering
questions about it over on reddit and I
was reading some of their answers and
one of the questions a lot of people had
was does it get really hot so they were
expecting it to overheat
cuz it's inside a really tight case
they're like no actually it's not that
bad so it's pretty cool I thought that
was super amazing and I'm a I love
clever mod so I thought that was kind of
a win it was a big-time win for me I
don't know I don't know Wi-Fi has begun
before exactly going Reneau Wi-Fi a
galaxy far far away
nope wrong one but speaking of that
speaking of that sever user feedback
that was a great catch that was a great
catch I got reflexes like a cat you I
can hear you laughing at reflexes like a
dead cat alright dead cat
okay so I have to say I'm feeling very
vindicated today because many of you
wrote in and put episode 3 ahead of
Return of the Jedi so we asked you guys
to use the hashtag TDS W and to rank six
Star Wars films I gotta tell you some
surprises but more than anything I would
like to say that I am proud to be wrong
with the rest of you because clearly Cal
says that I'm incorrect but I'm happy to
be wrong with all of you as opposed to
right with kale because I picked I put
three above six I'm saying Ryan wrote in
kills like I don't care I don't really
care
Ryan wrote in and said number one Empire
then Jedi then safe new hope phantom and
clones three and four and five and six
are close could go either way
I'm surprised people put phantom above
clones but a lot of people did a lot
people really don't like it I think they
like that podrace though the podrace is
awesome and the other thing though is
like I was thinking about Attack of the
Clones cuz I'm like what are they
talking about attack of clones are so
cool but it's really only in the last
like 15 minutes of that movies cool
because the rest of it is like the hills
are alive with the sound of Jedi where
Anna hands like running and they're like
yeah rolling her I remember yes and it
gets everywhere yeah Stanley wrote in
and said Jedi Empire hope Sith Phantom
Menace clones so he put Return of the
Jedi first and then Empire than a new
hope
then Vader wrote in and said he walks
ruined six oh he says four five three
six two one which was that was close to
my order I said five four three Jar Jar
and bad acting Anakin ruined two and one
may the force be with you James Roden
had a message for you is that first off
kill anonymous that t-shirt has inspired
your green Power Rangers as 40d SW list
for me is for three five six one two all
of the lightsabers in three so he put a
new hope Revenge of the Sith and then
Empire Strikes Back here's the issue
never turn the Jedi which here's the
problem we know we're gonna have you're
gonna have to be killed
here's the problem we have here once
again we're forgetting that the prequels
for the most part especially three had a
lot of had a lot of support because of
four or five and six yeah you know you
had you basically already had the story
but I think most people are giving three
credit because of the fight scenes and
because of the cool action or whatever
and that's that's air we're talking
about terrible story awful writing and
garbage direction I feel like that about
episodes about about for sure to the
Jedi though like a lot of it is really
bad like I I mean I guess I'd like
that's I look at it I'm just like this
is just as bad but I mean that was back
when I guess the time ago it's not
exciting man my father came out in the
70s but now with like gazillions of
dollars and then we have I would argue
we make more terrible movies now than we
do back like yeah sure but you know not
not behind like amazing franchise okay
fair enough
maybe maybe we'll see so about Batman V
Superman der to go there's not really
been a great Superman recent a good
franchise um but now we're just now
we're just opening wound I know
everywhere God what does this show
becoming I know Neil wrote in and said
Empire Strikes Back and you hope return
Revenge of the Sith Return of the Jedi
Attack of the Clones The Phantom Menace
that was my choices return it a Jedi
would have been higher but he walks come
on that's what he said
people don't like Ewoks ma'am I'm with
you I got you Rick wrote it and said I'm
gonna go with the unpopular opinion
episode six five three four two and I'm
gonna pretend that Phantom Menace
doesn't exist like that he just
completely dropped that one obsolete
producer Logan you're the only person
that's on my side how do you feel about
everybody putting three up there and
that's what I'm saying is it just it
doesn't belong there guys are all along
I loved three of all of one two and
three I loved it I thought it was great
it was somebody but it was only
refreshing after one and two I don't
know just like this is better that ends
expenses all right um it is time for our
very last fees user feedback it's time
for our photogra for the day
I'm really enjoying all this inner rage
that we're having it's so fun I'm I I
have I have a present for you this is a
phone talk refer her that using note 4
at festival season oh yes okay this is
from Aang and he wrote it and said hey
guys long time watcher this photo shot
with my samsung note 4 I shot this photo
of my significant other of 13 years at a
music festival and with much luck I got
a sunset in the background
he also said happy birthday to me so
thank you and get out of here look at
this picture it's amazing he's at
Wonderland he's at he's at like one of
the insomniac events I think it is yes
that is awesome first of all it looks
like it belongs in like a magazine it
looks like it should be like an ad for
festival season like it's just go see a
festival look at the delights that
you're going to encounter this guy is
totally this guy is totally my kind of
guy I like going house using the note 4
which Dutch angle tolling Dutch angle
and he watches tomorrow daily which
that's where we differ
I don't watch tomorrow daily now kale
does not but look at that picture it
looks amazing and your signature lady is
delightful I'm assuming that's a lady
right well he said it's of his
significant other oh so angry lady is
literally gorgeous and that is a
stunning picture and she should be a
festival season model just for all the
festivals they bring her out for free I
should fly both you guys out and just
have you guys take pictures yeah and you
should take her to more festivals yeah
there I just wanted to like screw off
right now you have to go to every if you
guys want to submit your phone tog Rafi
you can you can email us your phone tog
Rafi tell us what device you took your
picture with tell us a little story
about it or you can send us story ideas
feedback for the show whatever you want
to tomorrow at cnet.com and we also are
on social media where tomorrow daily on
snapchat tumblr facebook twitter
instagram and tomorrow daily TV over on
google+ and if you're watching on
youtube don't forget to like favorite
subscribe and also if you're listening
on itunes don't forget to rate review
and also if you're on twitter don't
forget to follow us on twitter at
kilometer and I'm at Ashley's gala
that's it for the show today we'll be
back tomorrow with a whole new dog
weird wonderful science fact meeting
science fiction all that good stuff but
until then think of humans don't see you
guys next time bye
