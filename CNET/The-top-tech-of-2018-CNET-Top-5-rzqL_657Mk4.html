on what CNET readers researched so
instead of doing an absolute top 5 which
would sound something like this phone
phone phone phone and phone we're going
to highlight a few products per category
how we ranking this long story short I
looked at the top 100 products and
categorized each it turns out that the
100 all fit within roughly 10 categories
will rank by category mention a product
or two and then repeat count along with
me and number five is PCs well look at
that computers are not entirely dead yet
while phones and tablets have gotten
more powerful over time it's still hard
to beat a notebook sometimes you guys
were really interested in the Dell XPS
13 and who could blame you it's got a
great looking design with a smaller body
it still has that weird placement for a
webcam though you well at least
squirrels like it on the Apple side the
15-inch MacBook Pro with touch bar was
the leader it has a lot more power than
previous versions of MacBook Pros along
with that questionable keyboard coming
at number four is smart home stuff I was
surprised to see the nest hello gain the
most attention of all the smart home
gadgets this year you can take a look at
who is at your door from your phone plus
chat with people at the door from the
hello the Google home hub also racked up
the views this year that's the one with
the screen as for Amazon it's cloud cam
was below those two alphabet things
maybe people aren't researching Amazon
stuff like the echo since people already
know what they do theorized amongst
yourselves
coming at number three are headphones
the leader of the pack was a Sony WH
1000 XM 2 these headphones can handle
atmospheric pressure optimizing meeting
and helps with airplane use that Sony is
currently battling with a Bose
QuietComfort 35 - which came in at
number 2 for headphones this year after
that it's time for ear buds with the
Jabra elite 65 t no wires just two buds
you shoving your head the elite at 65 t
can survive around 5 hours on a single
charge coming in at number two our home
theater things the top TV was a TCL
sixty-five are 617 let's look at the
review page the best picture quality for
the money in 2018 well that explains the
interest
it runs the Roku's Smart TV platform has
deep black levels and accurate color it
seems like those who were looking for a
TV also wanted good sound to go along
with it
that explains the Vizio SB 36:21 sound
bar at number two let's look the review
page the king of the budget sound bars
as for streaming boxes the Apple TV 4k
was king of the mountains and what
category could possibly be number one
say it with me smart mirrors it's the
hottest category of 2018 and is the most
widely adopted technology since the last
one we know will we all see in those
products we see ourselves and we love us
all right we all know it's phones and if
you've watched this far you just want
data so here goes the phone that made
you pay attention is these Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 yeah really it's pricy
it's powerful and it's the last big
Samsung release of the year next up was
the iPhone 10 not the newer 10s what was
number 3 for 2018 the iPhone 10 R that's
the phone that does pretty much
everything a 10s can do including
attempting to take pictures of pigeons
as an aside the only video game system
that popped up in the 100 was the
Nintendo switch that does it for us
Amaya Zack turn I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
