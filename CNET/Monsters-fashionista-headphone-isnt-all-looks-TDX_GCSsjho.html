cnet.com and I'm here with the monster
diamond tears headphones these are
monsters currently hottest selling
headphones and they are a whopping three
hundred dollars these are obviously very
flashy looking headphones with a unique
design these are geared towards women
though some men will certainly be able
to rock them I would include our own
brian tong in that crowd but these are
more of a female friendly headphone they
do reflect light and they come in two
colors right now this is kind of a
bluish purple with black ear pads and
there is a crystal model that has white
ear pads that said there are more colors
coming in 2013 so expect to have more
choices these are on ear headphones they
are fairly comfortable for on ear
headphones they're a little bit tight
but the ear pads are nicely padded and
they have kind of a teardrop design I
would say that folks with a bigger ears
will have a little bit more hard time
with these they do seal out a lot of
sound they do leak a little sound but
all in all a comfortable pair of on ear
headphones they also seem well built
that you fold up a little bit and fit
into a soft carrying case there's a
straight cord for audio purists and then
two cords with inline remotes and
microphones ones for Apple device users
and ones for Android device users and
other types of phones another small
feature worth mentoring there are two
jacks in the headphones a left and right
that means you can plug into either
headphone and it also means that someone
else can plug in their headphones into
the open Jack and you can kind of daisy
chain your headphones and listen to one
device at the same time as for sound
quality
these may surprise some folks for a
flashy headphone they do sound good and
I did like them better than some of
monsters other high style headphones
headphones like the DNA which is a
little bit cheaper than this model but
this one does sound better it's fairly
neutral for a monster everyone that
means it doesn't push a ton of bass
there is ample bass but it isn't
barring there's good detail here however
that said you can certainly find
headphones in the 150 to 200 dollar
price range that sound as good as these
or even slightly better of course people
first and foremost are buying these for
their aesthetics and they do come with a
cleaning cloth any little spray bottle
of monster shine so you can buff them up
ask the question of whether these are
worth three hundred dollars well a lot
of these status headphones are
overpriced and the diamond tears
certainly are too but at least they have
good sound so you're getting some decent
performance along with the flashy looks
I'm David karna and these are the
monsters diamond tears headphones thanks
