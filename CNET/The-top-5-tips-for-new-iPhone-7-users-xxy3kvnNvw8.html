iPhone 7 users maybe you got a good deal
on a new iPhone or maybe you're
pondering purchasing one here's what you
should know backup your photos iPhones
have had great cameras for years you
wouldn't want to lose those precious
photos would you you get five gigabytes
for your backup with iCloud but you've
got lots of automatic options for photo
and video back up including Dropbox and
Google Photos if you've got Amazon Prime
you get unlimited photo backup as a part
of the deal at number four expand your
storage Apple phones have never allowed
the ability to expand storage using a
microSD card however there are options
out there you can pick up a plug-in
device like the SanDisk I expand flash
drive which can add up to another 128
gigabytes of space then there are
wireless options like the WD My Passport
Wireless Drive the wireless drives are
more versatile and can be used with iOS
Android and regular computers at number
three portrait mode this one's for
iPhone 7 plus users only Apple made a
big fuss over the portrait mode now if

around make sure it's updated to iOS
10.1 or higher that's the version of iOS
that brings the fancy depth of field
feature to photos and number to make any
headphones wireless maybe you're on the
fence about Apple's courageous Wireless
future here's a great compromise a
bluetooth headphone adapter this one is
made by Griffin but you can find others
you plug in your regular headphones into
it then it connects to your phone with
Bluetooth plus you can play pause
controls it's kind of like having an
iPod shuffle on you and the number one
find a way to listen and charge at the
same time so much has been said about
Apple dropping the headphone jack from
the iPhone what you need to figure out
is how you will listen to audio while
that lightning port is busy charging you
could get a dock from Apple that has
both a headphone jack and a lightning
port there's also a Belkin accessory
called the Lightning audio plus charge
Rockstar that gives you two lightning
ports or you can go all-in and never
never use wired headphones again if
