comfortable design and a ton of software
features however performance issues when
multitasking makes the tablet look more
like an amateur than a pro I'm Xiomara
blanco and this is a first look at the
Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 10.1 the tablet
is definitely comfortable to hold with
the faux leather back providing a grippy
surface and the left and right bezels
providing just enough space to rest
thumbs though it's been in light for a
ten-inch er the thick top and bottom
bezels and silver trim make the tablet
look larger than it actually feels in
your hands like the touchscreen the
capacitive buttons respond quickly and
they don't get in the way when holding
the tablet the top edge houses the power
button volume rocker and IR blaster and
the top left and right edges housed the
speaker's the slate only comes with 16
gigabytes of internal storage so the
microSD card expansion slot on the right
edge is a crucial feature the 2560 by
1600 pixel resolution display is razor
sharp with saturated colors in stark
contrast but watching video is hindered
by the poor speaker quality audio is
tinny and week making headphones the
best option there's a rear 8 megapixel
camera with flash and a 2 megapixel
front facing shooter both have decent
photo quality for a tablet but they
suffer from graininess and low lighting
conditions and soft focus Samsung does
offer a bevy of camera features that
should appease any artsy amateur tablet
photographers the galaxy 10.1 probe
performed swiftly with large apps
opening within a couple of seconds
however it's performance suffers under
pressure if multiple apps are running or
if using the multi window function to do
too much at once it significantly lags
bugginess is komal and performance slows
down with apps unexpectedly shutting
down or freezing these issues are easily
resolved but with the title of pro I
would expect more out of this Samsung
Galaxy Tab when it comes to a
comfortable handheld experience in a
great screen the 10-inch Galaxy Tab pro
delivers however its lofty $500
starting price doesn't correlate with
this poor performance under pressure if
it fits your budget it's a great premium
tablet for casual users however there
are more affordable 10-inch tablets with
comparable specs available for a closer
look
check out my full review on cnet.com
again i'm Xiomara blanco and this has
been a first look at the Samsung Galaxy
Tab pro 10.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
