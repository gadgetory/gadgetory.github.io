valves Bergen Germany during 1893 most
people were convinced that no machine
would work at the high pressures which
diesel insisted were necessary let's
start our little journey into diesel
learning here at an unusual diesel to
the chevy cruze diesel not only are
diesels rare in America but this one's
made by an American company they can get
twice as rare but the principles are the
same a diesel engine starts its
combustion cycle by compressing air and
just air highly twenty two to one can be
as much of a compression as you find in
here
compare that to a gas engine around
eight or nine to one so it's night and
day then it's a very top of that
compression cycle the diesel fuel is
injected and it all combust
spontaneously because the temperature is
so high because the pressures been
raised so much there are no spark plugs
that's how a regular gas engine gets
combustion going but these guys do it
spontaneously by heat then at the very
last minute is that piston comes up and
compresses the hell out of that air what
happens then is this blast of power it's
a really high explosion because of that
high compression rate and you get that
characteristic not related to that whole
idea of spontaneous combustion so notice
that one of the key timing factors that
makes a diesel run well is the timing of
that fuel injection as opposed to the
timing of a spark that's why very
precise direct high pressure injection
is key to these motors in the modern era
also because they compress their charge
so much before combusting they tend to
ring more out of the fuel up to 50% of
the energy in a droplet of diesel
gasoline cars
nearly that well
if you think Diesel's are noisy stinky
and slow you're probably over 40 old
enough to remember when they were modern
diesels like a Mercedes GLK a Volkswagen
Jetta TDI or even the chevy cruze are
none of the above
and there are three important
technologies you can thank for that
first off is common rail direct
injection the common rail part means
you've got this metal plenum are
basically pipe that has the fuel pumped
in with under extremely high pressure of
the 29,000 psi from there it is direct
injected into the cylinders with extreme
precision
partly because it has that high pressure
behind it and partly because they're now
using piezo electric injectors which
open and close extremely quickly
sometimes multiple times in one
combustion cycle precise injection means
better use of fuel lower emissions more
power better economy win-win-win-win-win
the second big tech trick is turbo
charging this complex turbo charging is
key because a diesel without it will
tend to bunch up all its power down at
the bottom of the tach what the turbo
does is up to spread the power further
up the RPM range and get it delivered
faster get it off the line quicker these
things are not slugs anymore that's an
old-school ID
the last technology trick is exhausted
scrubbing this Mercedes for example uses
urea injection urea fluid is vaporized
and sprayed into the hot exhaust which
catalyzes it to convert those nasty
nitrous oxides into pretty benign water
vapor and nitrogen secondly there is
additional sort of cooking of the
exhaust hot catalysts downstream
actually recoup it a couple of times in
some cases to cause a chemical reaction
that also reduces the nasty stuff coming
out of the tailpipe and thirdly
ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel has become
pretty much the rule in the US Europe
and many other areas by not having so
much sulfur it is innately cleaner and
by not having so much sulfur it doesn't
clog up the other two technologies I
just mentioned allowing them to work now
I can talk to you about high compression
ratios and common rail injection and
blah blah blah till I'm blue in the face
but all you really want to know is does
a diesel car drive and feel like a UPS
truck or is it actually a nice car let's
go for a ride I think you're gonna be
pleasantly surprised now the first thing
you figure out in a diesel is commoner
is different the redline is much lower
you don't run these cars up as high
there's no reward they're like on this
jetta TDI you get you about 4000 and
basically game over it's time to shift
these are low-end grunt engines compared
to a gas motor
and even if you do run them out there's
not much payoff which is actually a very
easy way to drive we're just not so much
used to it the torque in the low to low
mid is just a delight and it makes
everyday driving a lot of fun it's also
that kind of acceleration that we all
love you will notice in really every
diesel I've driven less so at the high
end more at the low end but there is a
different engine note there is a diesel
rattle that is innately in there and
depending how well the car is isolated
and insulated you will detect more or
less of that you have to get used to
that but it's not a bad sound as what's
the difference beyond that one of the
other things you have to get used to is
the back of that damned fuel gauge
hardly ever moves I didn't know if this
one was broken in this car until I
driven it for an hour and finally saw it
come off the full peg and start to work
its way down Diesel's tend to have
tremendous range seven and eight hundred
miles is not unusual because they have
normal sized tanks and can get great
long leg highway economy in particular
in all if you're in the market for a
very efficient car and you enjoy the
real joy of driving which comes from
torque you owe it to yourself to drive a
couple of today's modern diesels see
what they're like I think diesels have a
lot going for them and in many ways have
got better market legs and a lot of the
hybrids and highly electrified cars out
there
