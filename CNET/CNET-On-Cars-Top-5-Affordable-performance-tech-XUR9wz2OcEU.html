glass of the Lamborghini dealer
performance tech wants only found in
super cars now is found in some rental
cars
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five forms
of performance tech that trickle down
from the cars you couldn't afford to the
ones you can number 5 is launch control
this was long the domain of
million-dollar f1 cars with so much
power that only a computer could get
maximum acceleration without spinning
the wheels but lately it's trickled down
to some high-powered vets and Shelby
Mustangs that have the same problem you
can even find it now on a Mitsubishi
Lancer Evo X not a terribly expensive
car although I don't know if this one
ever gets real popular because most of
us aren't too worried about getting out
of the hole in the shortest amount of
time
number four adaptive suspension a
suspension that reads the road in real
time and adapts to it first showed up in
big volume around 1990 on the original
infiniti flagship the cue 45 though
you'd hardly know it since their first
TV spots were infamous for telling you
almost nothing about the car anyway
today adaptive suspension can be found
in European market VW golf's Opel
Astra's although it remains stubbornly
upmarket in the u.s. coming down not
much further than say an Acura MDX or a
Buick Lucerne number three the dual
clutch gearbox this self shifting dual
clutch manual transmission sprang from
the realization that let's face it a
computer can work a clutch and gears way
better than you ever will hence the
first production dual clutch gearbox was
in the 2002 volkswagen golf r32 a very
rarefied model but today it's come down
to Ford Fiestas and dodge darts with
often crappy results in my opinion but
also in the mid cebiche Lancer Evo which
around $38,000 is perhaps the best dual
clutch equipped car I've ever driven and
not that pricey number two the
turbocharger turbos have been around
since 1905 or so well they didn't really
arrive until 1975 with the Porsche 911
Turbo all of a sudden this forced
induction technology was a household
word even though the car that made it
that way cost like 100
of grand in today's dollars today you go
car shopping and you trip over turbo
engines all the way down to up $19,000
Nissan Juke and a bunch of others small
and affordable cars that use them as
much to achieve efficiency as
performance so today saying you've got a
turbo under the hood is no longer a brag
number one has got to be push-button
start this most ubiquitous and sometimes
dumbest of technology's got its start in
Formula One and other race cars cars
that have no keys obviously then it was
a Ferrari thing where it showed up as a
key part of their Formula One inspired
manettino steering wheel all of this
suggesting subtly that hitting a button
is how you really get a hot car going
and save a second that might help you
win a race well today that's found in a
rav4 or a Chevy Malibu we're almost
every single car that I review it says
high-tech without actually being so for
more on high-tech cars and modern Drive
