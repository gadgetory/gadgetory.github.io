cyber sleuth the hunt for clues starts
with the weapon malicious software
viruses that can steal people's
passwords there are personal information
drain their bank accounts at the
Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit in
Washington State a team of engineers
lawyers investigators and analysts use
computer forensic techniques to
deconstruct and understand how the
malware works that means that we inject
a malware within a clean computer to see
the behaviors kind of every Maldor
leaves a digital footprints on the
computer they look for changes in the
infected computer security settings
update options and even additional
screens asking users for banking and
financial information in addition to
username and password deciphering the
malware can take hours or months some of
them could be automated however others
we have to look at manually review them
code by code line by line Microsoft then
works with financial institutions and
law enforcement and a case known as
Citadel Microsoft helped pinpoint the
Eastern European cyber criminals who
robbed more than 5 million people
worldwide a five hundred million dollars
this map shows the infected computers if
you look at this map you will see a
clear differential between Western
Europe and Eastern Europe and that stops
really at the border it's almost like a
mal riveted GPS built into it the
software giant also investigates
software piracy and not only because it
hurts their bottom line what we're
seeing is one of the main ways that the
criminals are transmitting their
malicious software is through pirated
software to help fight the spread of
child pornography online Microsoft at
Dartmouth researchers developed photo
DNA the technology establishes a digital
hash a unique signature for each
photograph let's say this photo of me is
a node illegal image that's about to be
uploaded to the internet again the photo
DNA software skills for matches to see
if it can find the original photo and
match it up against the one that has
just been uploaded and and that has been
found crime lab technology trying to
stay
