Carey and this is your cnet update it's
the start of a new chapter for
blackberry as the company rebranded
itself and unveiled to sleek looking
smart phones that run the innovative
blackberry 10 operating system first off
the company is no longer called research
in motion or rim its name is blackberry
now which is just a marketing move since
most people called it blackberry anyway
as for the new phones here's what you
need to know there's an all touch screen
phone called the z10 it kind of looks
like an iPhone but there are no
navigation buttons you navigate entirely
with a swipe of a thumb spec-wise it
could stand alongside the latest
handsets with an 8 megapixel back camera
hdmi port memory card slot and NFC
technology there's also a version with a
physical keyboard because you can't
ignore the crackberry addicts that want
that tactile feeling it's called the q10
but let's get to the software and what
makes it different from Apple and
Android gestures are key to navigating
around blackberry one swipe of a thumb
can switch between tasks like viewing
email on the calendar blackberry is
pushing the idea that it's very easy to
multitask there's no need to jump in and
out of a nap menu to get things done a
text chat can instantly change to a
video call and that video caller can
share their screen in contacts users can
see real-time updates of a person's
latest social activity and the most
recent conversations typing is another
major focus for blackberry the
autocorrect is advanced plus it also
tries to predict the next word you might
type and you can flick that word up onto
the screen also swiping left on the
clear key deletes entire words
blackberry wants to balance your
personal and business life by putting
work approved apps in their own secure
profile which can coexist with your
personal apps and games winning back the
love of business IT departments will be
a challenge since most employees just
use their personal iPhones and androids
for work apps or another challenge there
are 70,000 apps including a few big-name
ones like Skype and angry birds but it
still doesn't have every popular app for
example there's no Pandora the z10 will
be sold by verizon
ATT and tmobile but only verizon has
announced a price $200 with a two-year
contract and it's the only carrier that
will get it in white it won't be in the
u.s. until March but it's on sale this
week in the UK and next week in Canada
the q10 with the keyboard is coming out
even later in April in the US and will
be sold by verizon AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint if
there was any group that was holding out
for a new blackberry its people who like
physical keyboards and they now have to
wait the longest so do you think
blackberry can stay alive email me at
