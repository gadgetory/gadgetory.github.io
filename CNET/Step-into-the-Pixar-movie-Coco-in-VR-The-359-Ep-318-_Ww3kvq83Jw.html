this episode 318 of the 359 podcast on
BVG and full house today Joanie soles
Minh Ben Fox Ruben and Alfred Inge will
be your hosts hello hello yes so today
we're gonna be talking all about
different VR experiences that our lovely
friend Joan has checked out all
throughout this week you've had kind of
a fun week we are things so VR gaming is
one of them with Nintendo's duckin in VR
and the other one was the new Pixar
movie
Coco got its own you know VR experience
- so okay but when are we getting 3:59
VR edition well we did that's that's not
real VR all right well it's true yeah we
do be VG in front of us okay and I'm I
can like pull up like a sword or
something and in virtual reality that's
that's where the real money maker is
that that's what this podcast needs
anyway send in your questions and
comments BVG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show at the end of
the show show at the end of the
shoo-shoo
let's get to the podcast alright we're
gonna record this we'll see you guys
back in the chat in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm
Ben Fox ribbon I'm Joni sauceman I'm
ralpher dang so Pixar offered its first
foray into virtual reality with an
experience called Coco VR based on the
upcoming film Coco Joan you had a chance
to check this out what was it like it
was really fun every time I talk to
people that make VR or thinking about VR
cheerleaders of ER they always describe
virtuality to people who haven't tried
it as it's like stepping into a Pixar
movie and this is the first time that
Pixar that animation studio that almost
is universally beloved has dedicated
their resources and their level of
quality and their animation to a virtual
reality experience is it kind of like
like a
trailer for the movie or what's what's
like it actually like what do you do
it's not a trailer it goes beyond what a
lot of promotional film VR featurettes
have done it's really interactive it's
really social and basically you become
KOCO is about basically it's based on
the Mexican holiday do Dia de los
Muertos the Day of the Dead and you
become a skeleton you are in a room and
you get to try on clothing and stuff to
get yourself like you take your head off
you can take your skull off and throw it
around the room if you want and you're
doing all this with a friend in VR like
a real friend yeah like I did it with
one of the oculus producers that worked
on the project anyway so you're in a
room and then you kind of like almost
like when Dorothy like leaves her house
and enters Oz and you see color for this
time you step out into this town square
and this gigantic
world of the Dead and it's it looks like
a Pixar movie it's like being in a
beautiful Pixar land
and you can like you get to go to an art
gallery and look at sort of like DVD
extras you get to see concept art and
trailers there's a movie theater and you
can see it deleted scene but you also
get to just play around and do things
take your picture at a photobooth there
are sparklers you can wave sparklers
around let's go yeah I feel like this is
the first time I've seen a VR like movie
promotion or anything like that where I
didn't think it was extremely corny and
I feel like Pixar definitely adds that
element to it definitely went beyond
where a lot of those promotional work
can feel like it's forced where it's
like oh here's the thing we should do a
promo thing for it
yeah it looks like they made a little
bit more of an hour I saw I saw like one
of the clips at the beginning where like
when you were in VR you like put a hat
on and like and it showed like Coco
putting the Hat on that looks really
cool yeah it was cool it was a lot of
fun so you also got a chance to check
out what is it like Nintendo's duck hunt
or a reboot of it in VR as well right so
last night or I guess this morning a
vibe HTC vive which makes another of the
high-end headsets they announced some
new controllers that allow you to do
games that already exist and some new
games with actual guns that feel like
guns
having records and rackets instead of
just having the awkward kind of hand
controllers as your only way to play and
so one of the games that they let us try
was this reboot of duck hunt and it had
it was so if you played duck hunt as a
kid I played it anytime I was sick home
from school if I would just sit in blink
hunt all day long it's really fun they
have like almost like a stranger things
like 80s throwback a living room that
you're sitting in at the beginning and
the duck hunt starts or duck season
starts it's not called Scott it's called
duck season but like the same a little
dog that like comes up in traffic yeah
he comes up and he's in VR he's doing
these horrible dances and you can shoot
them if you want and then you shoot
ducks but it's super fun and they really
played up the like retro like nostalgia
factor of it too it's really cool so we
don't have a ton of time left but I did
want to get to like big picture concept
do you think stuff like this is actually
gonna get people to invest in VR
headsets like these two concepts are
with oculus and HTC vive they cost a lot
of money but do you think that this is
something that's really going to push
this forward into the mainstream I think
that the only thing that's gonna get
people excited about paying that much
money for something that they don't
really understand what it is is when
there are these trusted games or movies
that they know that they love that give
them a reason to be like oh yeah I
actually do want to try that when it son
from you know when it's an unfamiliar
technology and unfamiliar content
there's nothing there to pull you in but
when it's something like Pixar or duck
hunt that you already love that could
give people more of a reason to start
trying it yeah totally anyway if we want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Johnny Salzmann I'm Alfred Aang thanks
for listening
all right everybody onboard go ahead and
start submitting questions and comments
this is pretty cool stuff I just loved
how you've so casually like you become a
skeleton that's just maybe for chuckle I
had to hold it back so I didn't commit
you die it's like a very high version of
dying it's a very day of the dead
consciousness right that like it's a
skeleton but it's fun it's a fun
skeleton you're a fun skeleton yeah
super fun I had a lot of fun doing it I
did want to mention this during the
podcast but it's never enough time so if
you actually want to try this out the
experience is available on the oculus
rift right now and a version of the
experience will launch on Samsung gear
VR November 22nd right which is next
week
alongside the opening of the film and if
you if you don't have a VR headset or at
all they are doing demos of it at some
Disney stores and at some movie theaters
so you can go online and find out which
ones which makes a lot of sense I feel
like VR is such a new concept for a lot
of people that putting it in you know
like a movie theater or retail location
it doesn't require people to like shell
out a ton of money for this stuff
because I don't know unless you're gonna
use it a ton why are you spending why
would you spend that much I said just go
to VR arcades that's a thing to bring
that back yeah you can go to our kids
and just give like a dollar or something
for like one VR session I don't know
what the VR arcade price is all have you
been to those actually the demo of the
duck season and all the vibe HTC vive
stuff was at a VR arcade they because
they it's a handy because they already
have base set up with five things so the
competitions that show up at a place I
should have arcades with like VR stuff I
feel like a lot of people would go to
that because they don't want to you know
that's the same reason of arcades back
when consoles used to cost a lot and you
didn't want to buy a whole cabinet just
to play pac-man
well it's largely the same mentality of
the gimmicks that they put in to get
people back into movie theaters the 3d
movies and everything had their little
or the Renaissance yeah yeah I mean you
make it an experience everybody can put
a big screen in their house now make it
something more I mean I'm not saying 3d
was the end-all be-all the movies that
certainly has proven that it hasn't been
but give me some well and then well no
there's 4d theaters which I went by the
way and saw
rogue one when it came out don't go see
rogue one in 4d if it ever comes back my
movie has a lot of rain in it what is
Hardy you just wings like they have like
the physical experience is it like that
a Shrek one where uh like the dragon
like breeze fire and it gets hotter in
the room or like there's rats running
around they like you feel like something
like touching your leg this sounds
really yeah yeah it's forty it's for D
yes gimmicky but it can be fun but for
the record there's a beach scene and a
lot of rain and rogue one and that got
old fast
that was my that's my formal unofficial
4d review hey are you wearing like a
headset or something shows up and spray
something on you watch the movie
normally like a 3d movie it's just like
there's stuff in the room that like
messes with you okay I don't know that I
would be super into that but there's
just all these devices and lights and
the seat shake and stuff like that but
yeah I just kept getting sprayed with
water and I got really annoying
um Joan I was also curious like so for
instance with like a VR arcade can you
tell us a bit about that like I've never
been to one
does it seem kind of cool is it
something that you think like a lot of
people are gonna want to go to clips and
chips lips and chips I think that it
makes a lot of sense to have them but I
don't know if people are really flocking
to them I've read articles about how
they're because it's such a niche thing
there's not a lot of them yet that the
ones that do exist they can be really
popular just because it's the only place
that you can go there isn't that like
the kind of ubiquity where there's
competition in a city with tons and tons
of places yeah but the problem is is
like the investment and actually making
one yeah and also I mean people are
still so unfamiliar it's not like you're
like oh man I don't have anything to do
Friday night what I I'm gonna go to the
VR arcade it's not like ingrained as an
entertainment option into our mentality
yet so it definitely makes sense to have
them I don't know I don't know how
popular they are I also I feel like once
we are gets more affordable they're
gonna go the exact same route as arcades
did and I think a lot of people like to
have that an
tight now so they're not really like
very eager to open these because like
eventually it's just gonna become like a
home experience yeah exactly
yeah I I think a lot of people hope that
that's the direction that we're gonna go
in but I think the prices really have to
go down and there's definitely
advantages to having an arc there are
things in VR that you can't even when VR
technology for the home becomes more
sophisticated they're still gonna be
things that you're not gonna want to set
up in your home like there are like
seats that you sit on that move you
around and make you feel like you're
flying and stuff like you're not gonna
set that up in here oh you mean like
that thing at CES last year did you go
on that no the VR flying thing yeah oh
yeah the hyper suit
yeah no I didn't go on that silly weird
bird thing so but yeah yeah the silly
weird bird thing you're not gonna want
that in your home but maybe you want to
be a silly bear bird at an arcade where
like at a mall like something good to do
with them all anyway you got any
questions for us actually there appears
to be some technical difficulties going
on with the stream we're streaming I'm
not sure why a lot of people didn't get
an alert today so apologies for that I
have no idea what's going on with the
YouTube these days I it's kind of beyond
my control but thank you to everyone
who's put up with their BS and hanging
on tight and perhaps to the notification
squad let's take a couple of questions
we've less questions more considerations
I like the concept coming from Matthew
debt or sorry Josh Boyd he says are
there gr escape rooms how cool would
that be
escape rooms what is what's that mean
like you know those like escape the
rooms things that they do in New York or
in multiple places that I don't remember
the names of currently I think they have
one in Idaho it's kind of an interactive
choose-your-own-adventure type situation
where you and a group of people are in a
scenario where in basically a set like a
set dressed area and you have situations
you have to overcome more so verbally
sometimes physically aren't there
Atlanta levels very basic puzzle-based
type thing but imagine doing that in a
virtual environment with the incredible
special effects and right
especially if you've got like your
buddies with you because I feel like
that's relatively new right Joan that
like that you could actually have a VR
experience and have somebody like that's
like a regular person right next to you
that that kind of takes away from or at
least like smooths over that whole idea
that VR can be really isolated right
yeah social vr has been around for a
while but it's not the it's it's hard to
do because not a lot of people have you
are right so not a lot of people have
used social VR but when you call up all
your friends I'll be like hey they don't
but when you do get a chance to do
social vr it is really fun like scott
stein who on our review side does a lot
of our he'd wrote about the five
controllers for example he and I were in
Facebook I think it's called spaces the
Facebook like come and play in this
little playground with your friends and
be are we did that and it's you know
seven years down the line we look back
on we're gonna be like god that was
stupid but right now it's just kind of
fun cuz it's like you look at your
friend and he look kind of looks like
actually Scott's avatar in spaces looked
a lot like you
I look good homey in VR sick burn bro so
what are our favorite VR games here
personally I really like this one oh
shoot it's got hot in the title help me
sounds like a dirty thing no it's I
gotta look it up again
we played okay so there were two that I
played in the office that we're at least
memorable and interesting one of them
was a zombie shooter which I thought was
very cool Roger was very good at that
you had to like spin around allied and
like hold like a crappy flashlight and
that just makes sense like doing zombie
stuff and VR is kinda the result there
was one more as like a space cadet
training thing or whatever that I
thought was pretty fun I liked how you
could like pull back and then like get
different weapons or like get a shield
or something like that if you only
pulled back if you're like I think I
remember yeah I've never played this one
but I would really like to it's called
office simulator your NVR pretending to
a office employee is that it's awesome
oh yeah job simulator that was like a
big hit like three years ago job
simulator I don't know why the night are
interesting what is this oh is that it
so I found it it's called it's called
super hot I feel like an ad for never
remembering that but my exposures been
very limited but this is one of the very
few things I did get to try and it's
it's kind of a red light green light
game where your enemy only moves when
you move and it's what is Aki it's on
oculus rift and you're equipped with a
ton of different stuff surrounding you
in this very just a geometric settings
so there's guns and there's staplers and
there's just random officee things that
you can chuck at them or steal their
weapons and turn it around but you can
see that there's like they're in slow
motion until you come at them and then
they speed up to regular motion and then
it's all about your reflexes and it's a
it's a pretty friggin cool game I like
the stylization but at the same time it
kind of takes a bit away from the whole
concept of VR being super immersive and
you know photo really I would disagree
with you because what I've heard from
people that make VR is that usually it's
like this what is it they call the what
is it uncanny valley uncanny valley like
the more you make something try to look
like real people the more you're just
kind of like this Thanks yeah the more
you like like degrade the quality
especially well especially with humans
like you degrade like if you make it
look polygonal and like geographic
Geographics you're right worried gee
whatever like the more you do that the
more people like forget about like you
don't think about the interface as much
you just think about playing and having
fun and you don't get weird yeah that's
why I like my favorite games are all
like pretty low graphic stuff I'm not
really into why Nintendo is too cool
yeah that's why Nintendo continues to
exist I mean are you doesn't have very
unique art doesn't have to be high
fidelity just has to be stylized ya know
it's just really that was one of the
first VR experiences that I saw that
wasn't like that was intentionally not
realistic and it really is kind of like
office simulators not realistic mm-hmm
yeah cartoon is pretty too the other one
that I wanted to mention is Barclay is
very realistic
yes writers being totally honest
ironically so the other one which we
also had in the office was like a like a
Star Wars thing oh yeah that was cool it
was like kind of who was kind of like a
game but it was more like a trailer and
it didn't last very long I could kind of
tell that this is just really the early
days of VR everybody's just testing
things out there wasn't a ton to do
there and it was mostly just being able
to like look around and see things which
in itself was kind of astonishing just
like I'm standing next to the Millennium
Falcon it was fun to do once and it's
not something that would result in me
buying this stuff you know not yet
that's really like the way that I look
at it is is like what's the market here
what's actually gonna get this into the
mainstream and like you know even cocoa
VR I would probably argue hasn't really
done that quite yet yeah I mean again my
exposure has been extraordinarily
limited somehow in this office the only
other one I've played its Batman VR on
PlayStation and I strongly recommend
never playing the level titled origin
okay for obvious reasons Joan remember
that oh yeah remember the time we had
Rhett and Lincoln yeah and what was that
game called but they were just playing
tilt brush yeah but it's not really a
game it's more like a art playground
where you use controllers to sculpt in
VR and so we played a pictionary what is
it yeah pictionary basically pictionary
in in VR where one of them would get
something they had to draw in in virtual
reality I don't have to guess what it is
that was fun though it was they were fun
dudes if anyone can guess what what so
the flashlight is drawing there it's
very funny it was a flash it was a good
job
that's a flashlight it's actually kind
of fun to play along while these guys
were we're actually doing this would you
see it on like a TV screen yeah we had a
TV but you'd have to put like the
headset on multiple headsets you could
watch him do it in in VR and you could
watch it in VR but there's always a
monitor that you can see everything from
his perspective as he's making it so I
was a lot of fun one other thing that I
also wanted to ask you on the VR side
like more on like the filmmaking side
yeah what has been like
one of the standouts that you've seen
also because like you got a chance to go
to like South by this year or Sundance
there's been a lot of like VR
experiments in filmmaking yes what's
something that you really liked or would
like all your friends yeah well I really
liked I mean the most recent thing was
the coco experience and that's the thing
about VR is that because it's such an
emerging art form that the newest stuff
that you see is pretty much going to be
the stuff that is most exciting because
every month people are able to figure
out how the heck to do the things that
they've been really wanting to do and
technology's catching up with them
catching up with their aspirations for
what they can do but I've written a lot
about Baio Bob they did one of the first
narrative VR like films whatever called
invasion that was super popular when
gear VR was just coming out and they've
done a lot of other experiences but they
have they are staffed by people from
Zynga and also somebody that started out
at DreamWorks and so they're like Pixar
they're animation is always top notch it
always looks great
what's invasion about it's about aliens
coming to Earth and trying to attack a
bunny but their foibles and not actually
being able to attack the money no no
bunny find the bunny wins at the end of
every bunny the bunny wins so Joan do
you feel like throughout your experience
you've had I realized you're kind of
like our VR Queen at this point for
something not for games but for non
games do you feel like the the medium is
refining itself is it actually
progressing do we see more logistical
uses for it in the near future perhaps
well I don't know exactly what you mean
by it what do you mean by logistical
uses like other applications I better
more actually helpful applications for
it
well sure there's lots of I mean I feel
like people are always coming up with
different ways to apply VR and some of
them are mind blowing like where the
care professionals will use VR to help
paraplegics regain feeling and limbs
they've never did it Roger do a story
about like he watched in on a surgery
like through VR did he yeah
may have Benetton friends yeah did it he
did it from what's that mobile
conference in Barcelona MWC Mobile World
Congress yes yes he did it from there I
believe Wow um yeah it's pretty stunning
the but it's all it's pretty something
the things you can do in VR and what
people are imagining you can do if you
have but it's also like one step away
from conceptual it's like not conceptual
anymore because people can actually put
it in a place and do it but none of it
has like traction it's still kind of
like Brian the sky like the educational
features for it could could really be
pretty mind-blowing
yeah interesting like let's go visit the
Revolutionary War when you think that's
all it sounds to me like that's a long
way from there yeah like when you think
about the implications for like
disparity in education like you know
poor schools versus rich schools rich
schools get to go to Italy on a field
trip and when you're in high school and
to the bodega like an order another
issue entirely yeah and like if there
was a way and like you know as the VR
becomes less expensive people talk about
people putting iPads in classrooms the
idea of putting VR in classrooms can't
be that far away you might have like a
VR room or something I mean like a VR
headset for every desk it sounds to me
like it's not coming anytime so well
except like it just depends like a
cardboard at every desk is totally
feasible right now it just depends on
how things go yeah I liked what you said
with the educational experience I could
see museums embracing this a lot more
and instead of having big walking
exhibits kind of thing there would be
more of a virtual thing things would
move you could be like in the in the
Sahara and experience the wildlife
indigenously it at least put a 3d camera
out there and then maybe not be pho it
would have but also get like a narration
sure absolutely I mean they do that now
though but now but being immersed in a
headset and I think that'd be kind of
cool I would be on board if David
Attenborough was narrating any of it yes
absolutely yeah I like Josh Boyd his
comment Magic School Bus the VR
experience Oh Josh Magic School Bus the
experience is actually something that
has happened in a way there was this is
really cool because it's virtual reality
but not headset based virtual reality
it's there was this company and I can't
remember I can't remember the name of
the company sorry
but basically what they did instead of
putting headsets on kids to have them go
to Mars
they put kids on this school bus with a
literal school bus where the windows
were transparent glass that could also
become screens like LED screens like at
a flip of a switch and so they got onto
this bus and they were in Washington DC
and they were just like driving around
DC like on the way onto some field trip
when all of a sudden like the screens on
their bus turned into viewpoints on Mars
and so instead of looking at the window
and seeing like a park go by and a swing
set or somebody's house they would see
like mountains on Mars and craters and
it was all mapped to Mars itself so when
they would take make a right turn it
would like be following where they would
be on Mars that's friggin awesome
literally and I want that you stole any
words out of my mouth I wanna go back to
school just for that oh man let's can we
set up a trip there can we do that I
don't know it would be extra it would be
extra cool if it suddenly turned into
like a horror flick and like the bus
driver the bus driver like hit a Martian
like the like the front like hit on
Martian and then like all of a sudden
you had to like get out and like fight
the Marcia VR haunted hayride you
accidentally yeah you accidentally
killed like the Martian mayor or
something and then you have to like
fight them Lockheed Martin was the
company that like basically kind of
funded it and the VR visual effects
company that put it together is called
Framestore so if you want to look it up
it's really it's a really cool program
and it was just something that they did
oh it's so cute there's like kids
laughing and screaming and like with joy
and this this picture sorry can you also
throw up on the bus as
you have okay all right so I think we
should wrap it up and go find these guys
and set up a scene at field trip we're
gonna find that buzz Oh Jo Jo and make
it happen please sir I the bus has to be
somewhere I want to go to there yes
please
all right let's let's call it this time
yeah yeah fun week everybody the 359 is
available on iTunes students that share
SoundCloud feedburner google play music
