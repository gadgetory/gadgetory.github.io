introduced its radically redesigned Mac
Pro back in December 2013 and for the
first time since its release the Mac Pro
just got an upgrade a modest one at that
the new Mac Pro's will come in two
models one with a six core processor and
a new model with an eight core processor
along with updated GPUs the original
model speech of quad and six core
processors otherwise you're not gonna
find much else that is different there
is no Thunderbolt 3 or USB C this is a
small speck phone so is that it for the
Mac Pro nope Phil Schiller made a
statement to reporters saying with
regards to the Mac Pro we are in the
process of what we call completely
rethinking the Mac Pro he went on to say
that the new Mac Pro is a modular system
and the company will also introduce a
new Pro display Schiller says these
products are not coming out this year
however the company also said new iMacs
are coming later this year Schiller says
it will not have a touchscreen in case
you were wondering it's pretty unusual
for Apple to officially mention its
lineup of new products so if you were
thinking about buying a new iMac or Mac
Pro you might want to wait when those
machines come out we'll put them through
our battery of tests right here at
cnet.com oh my as act hardened I'll see
you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
