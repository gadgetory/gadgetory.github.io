Joanie salesman apple helots worldwide
developer conference on Monday and while
we saw a lot of new features
nothing really blew our minds I was
definitely year when Apple was applying
polish on its software as opposed to
anything really jaw dropping right so
one of the most interesting things we
wanted to talk about was this initiative
to Kachina use your iPhone les seems a
little counterintuitive there are new
options for its do not disturb app as
well as a new screen time app that gives
you a weekly report on your usage and
most interesting way it actually allows
you to set allowances for your kids and
we're both parents Joan I know we're
both parents of younger kids but I mean
what do you think about this is this
something that you see yourself using
absolutely I'm gonna use it for yourself
for myself and when Anna's make kids
become old enough to become like
destabilized by their phone that's
definitely going to happen oh yeah I'm
interesting also being very grateful for
some of these features yeah I'm
interested to see how disciplined I will
be on screen time especially when you
set a limit it's kind of interesting leo
a warning will pop up if you've got five
minutes left of your a lot of time on
say Instagram I wonder if I just click
like the ignore warning just keep going
and it's something that people that are
Apple investors yeah the public has been
really demanding of the company to do
yep they finally got around to it and
it's just going to know that this fall
is what Google's introduced they had a
digital well-being app that's coming out
for Android P does a very similar thing
offers you sort of a status report on
your usage all right so will Apple merge
its Mac OS and iOS platforms well yes
Apple answered right they said no but no
no in a giant giant screen you'd be more
unequivocal no but they kind of are it
kind of yeah so they decided to bring
their they're announcing that they're
gonna bring iOS apps to Mac next year
it's really kind of first hint that yeah
these two platforms might be bridging
right why do you think that they cuz
ultimately these are gonna be they are I
mean ultimately they will merge down the
line don't you do you think it seems
inevitable right at some point it may be
further down the line then they'd
like to admit but you know windows tried
it didn't work out so well the first
time around they're still kind of
working on it but the idea that they all
kind of work off the same architecture
the issue here is you know iPhones and
iPads run on a slightly different
processor than Macs and so bridging the
two has been complicated but they kind
of have to write that's just sort of the
having one solitary one one single
consistent system seems like it's just
so Apple right it's more it's simpler
it's just easier for them to push one
product all right so remember and emojis
after the first month or so I stopped
using them but there's a new feature in
iOS 12 to turn yourself into a MIMO G or
an an emoji a cartoon version of
yourself
so forget about talking poop or being a
fox you can be a cartoon version of
yourself to set this is very similar to
what Samsung introduced a are emoji
which Brian if they don't have you pick
up there's a there's a nice took one of
my kid that's a little weird but what
the boy will have to wait until fall see
how that you stack up but they were a
highlight of the fall announcement last
year what do you think of I'm disengaged
with all these things but I know that
you tried them out a lot more you yes
yeah you've got a finger on the pulse of
oh yeah although I'm an emoji Pro I mean
use them religiously for about a month
and my wife found them hilarious for a
while but then after a while just became
too much trouble that's the thing about
they're all they're just novelty I think
most of those things are just novelty
and the point of novelty is it doesn't
last yep all right more of these stories
check us out and see that our motor
change I'm Joanie Saltzman thanks for
listening
you want to try that one again real
quick alright for more of these stories
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Joanie Salzmann why
did I just blank out there thanks for
listening thanks for listening one more
one more time for the recording we're
more the stories check us out and seen
it I'm Roger Chang I'm Joanie Salzmann
thanks for listening know know that the
countdown clock went was going no I can
tell if I had Brad
alright I'll cut you slack on that one
we are out of practice sorry guys it's
been it's been uh you know it's been a
long couple weeks it has but it's nice
to be back with everyone here how you
guys doing for serious like I haven't
caught up with you and literally almost
two weeks us we're okay yes we're we're
exhausted
I mean WWDC was you know it took a lot
out we'd be cranked out a huge amount of
stories eight four pieces of pizza you a
pizza I had well you ate four pieces of
it that's that's actually kind of
impressive in itself but yeah it's uh
we're good I think we're good yeah I
have to make the obligatory crack that
you guys said what you mentioned
something about a fox with the ant
emojis and I can't help but notice that
what's his name Craig in the in the
keynote is it Craig something that
that's exactly what I was singing is
like he was a total silver fox there
were a lot of yeah I mean the hair jokes
they there were plenty of hair jokes
yesterday it's a consistent theme
throughout all Apple events you got to
have Craig federighi hair jokes so uh
while we wait for the chat to filter in
and go ahead and submit your comments
and questions and what your takeaway
from WDC was and what your takeaway
wasn't let's go ahead and pontificate if
we will maybe we can editorialize just
just a touch the one thing that I
actually did think was kind of cool was
the a our measurement app but that's
because I'm in here doing the sets and
working on all of our different layouts
for the shows so to have this virtual
augmented reality measurement system
that I can kind of catalog would be
incredibly helpful to my workflow what
did you guys think was kind of cool and
don't say n emojis are on might kick you
off the show yeah the the Lego AR game
was what seemed pretty awesome like yeah
I think I'd quit I can't wait for my kid
to play with it of course he's way too
young to understand or appreciate that's
true that's true though yeah this is
just an easy way to get my kid even more
addicted to my phone
but now Apple has all these features to
help you with that it's not gonna stop
and move from going nuclear once like
that that warning goes off like you've
got five minutes left it's like no more
Legos train well there's that too
no I could actually click through the
button I'll just override the warning
I'm like yeah just keep on going I
personally am very intrigued by the AR
stuff I thought the Lego demo worked out
really well they could I had a nice like
I was actually I really appreciated the
background music is very like
disney-esque very kind of whimsical is
kind of a nice break from all the the
kind of highly technical stuff that kind
of bookended it so I like the AR self
the measurement thing you know I
mentioned this to you before the show
Brian that's been around for a while
Google tango showed that off the
implementation was decent but I always
wondered if like how accurate really was
because you you are kind of fully
relying on just this your phone
detecting it and and kind of spitting
out some number I was always a little
like is that the right number what if
they like it glitched out somewhere and
you were like an inch off on your
measurements like that would screw up
especially for you if you were building
these sets I would screw you up if you
were just like a centimeter off right
true but sometimes just having that
little bit of estimate would be very
helpful because I mean I have a tape
measure around a write stuff down like
if I'm on the fly just trying to eyeball
something to have an eyeball with a unit
of measurement attached to it even if it
is flawed would still be helpful but
this is a very specific instance and I
get that but I'm excited to see a are
actually do something helpful because I
just put Pokemon in my yeah let's go
ahead and jump into the chat we got a
good question from the vet Kumar do you
think Siri can now compete with Google
assistant I guess we're all on the same
kind of topic here and we did actually
see a little sea reaction in there
she continues to underwhelm there very
little very little sea reaction I would
say like the shortcuts seem like it's
kind of nice to have I just don't think
it really puts it on par with Google's
sister Alexa it seemed like that was
kind of the they they were able to kind
of build routine like shortcuts but
it seemed like a lot of the shortcuts
were just Siri offering you suggestions
or you
it seemed clunky it didn't seem quite as
and within the case of Apple watch you
don't even they're kind of they're not
cutting out Siri but they're cutting out
your acknowledgment of her if you raise
your watch who are you really talking to
oh good existential question getting
deep here guys
you should take breaks more often here's
a question for Roger from Kaye do you
think that Apple is focusing on
stabilizing iOS I hope so
the the Craig's comment about you know
iOS 12 being more about performance in
the fact that it was less about big
features and more about performance I
think that's sort of code word for
fixing all the crazy bugs that have
shown up on iOS 11 I have an iPhone 10
as well as as well as an iPhone 7 both
are on the latest version both are super
buggy apps to pop up or iconic yeah or
icons that just sort of like gray out
some reason so it's it's been a buggy
experience so I'm hoping when they say
performance they're not just talking
about things running faster that their
batteries that are battery but also
things running smoother and actually not
glitching out yes
hopefully I liked in the presentation
how everyone got really excited that
Apple finally figured out how to change
the color change the colors on Mojave
that's all things like to go dark night
mode dark mode dark mode and sorry I'm
probably being too critical but it's
just like oh yeah it's a nice to have
but again it's yeah now there's nothing
nothing from yesterday's presentation
really impresses that much they're sort
of a collection so they're like oh
that's cool I guess
and they continued to disappoint the
audience as they made no mention of any
kind of Rio for the iPad air as fun asus
fen asus is asking if iOS 12 will become
available for the iPad air I would
imagine
I thought well for that pet well which
iPad air the original iPad air doesn't
specify
but I know we don't really see hardware
implementations at WWDC but every time
Apple does an event somebody in the
chats asking if the iPad air is ever
gonna make a comeback I would say that
pet error is is done they've kind of
moved to this low-cost model for the
entry-level iPad and then there's the
iPad pros that iPad air which I have I'm
a fan of - why's that iPad air 2 it's
it's a it's a good model but I think
they've kind of moved away from that
earlier models that are getting after on
new updates hmm there's the like how
many thousands of dollars original gold
watch oh right the $15,000 Apple watch
original Apple watch which will not get
the new Apple watch or watch OS 5 yeah
so sorry for all you went as who's 17
grand fortune on yeah on a watch it's
now let's take another look at this an
emoji because it's it's adorable but
also kind of creepy Roger what was your
experience like developing I'm sorry
MIMO gee sorry this is Samsung AR emoji
they introduced this earlier this year
with the Galaxy S 9 they're probably a
little bit annoyed right now that Apple
decided to come out with MIMO G stealing
its thunder a little bit I don't know
the the AR emoji just I don't know my
kid doesn't my kid does not look like
this at all although he makes that small
sometimes which is hilarious but we
thought it was a little creepy a little
it didn't really work as well it gave me
a man bun my AR moji had a man but I
don't know how that even works
he didn't look at the back of my head
and just scan the front of my head and
just decided this guy needs a man button
i think it's cuz it's odd to your soul
and saw your deepest darkest my deepest
darkest desire is Taraka man bun oh yeah
clearly I know I know
so I guess Samsung knows me more than I
know myself
but it it's sort of a good example of
what they look like
you know we tried the the facial or the
facial recognition on gs-9 for AR emojis
it kind of worked okay it wasn't quite
as accurate as an emojis which
definitely matched the movement of
multiple parts of your face to the
actual an emoji image so we'll see how
many emojis work on but I imagine
they're they don't work pretty well I
don't know when I saw them on stage with
Mike oh that's that's cool I guess it's
again it's gonna be one of those
features were probably gonna be using it
for about a month
I'll just get tired how would you
compare from what you know about
Samsung's product versus what they
showed it w see the ability to customize
is there a big difference in between the
two in terms of customizing the look of
the Moto G it's hard to tell because we
didn't see that much from WWDC it seemed
like there were a decent amount of
custom options samsung also offers the
ability to customize things but it's
mostly clothes and I think you know one
of things we knocked it on was it
couldn't do like curly hair so there
were different aspects of features that
hopefully Apple will remedy but Samsung
was kind of missing the first time
around we have a similar question coming
in as we're getting towards the end of
the show here from Bill harried do the
changes to Siri bring in anywhere near
Google assistant and Alexa we kind of
edging down this path time and time
again
kind of maybe man I think it's still
it's still well behind yeah and that's
that's a shame cuz you know the home
pods out there I mean it really relies
on Siri - how are your smart home it
just it just isn't quite as responsive
as here's a good one from Josh boy -
what's up Josh good to see you again
since apple carplay is getting Google
Maps support does that mean you can set
Google Maps as the default on the iPhone
that's a good question I hope so I don't
know it's kind of annoying I I tend to
use like a universe of Google apps on my
phone which keeps me from switching to
Apple Maps so like my Gmail will link to
my Google Maps I would love it if Google
Maps was your default because Apple maps
I so and it is a hassle and what is it
usually in like a text message if you're
in yeah if you're definitely in one of
those iOS core apps
it'll just default you kicks over to
Apple map you like no no I've gotta
escape back to homes but that means that
Apple would have to open up its garden
last time my recall right where there's
a walled garden and an apple and like a
snake and it didn't go too well for
everybody come on come on I'm not trying
to get proselytizing just funny
residence I thought it was clever yeah
yes Brian is the best six lowest points
out the iOS 12 may have been
disappointing for some but at least it's
coming to the iPhone 5s can't say the
same for Android when Android P hits
yeah no I mean I give Apple props for
extending it to the 5s and that is one
generation more than last year's version
so they're definitely offering more
support and hopefully that is an
indicator that they're talking about
performance and making this run a bit
more efficiently works because if we
could work in a 5s as well as an iPhone
10 that's pretty impressive
agreed I'll give them that much for now
one more from bill Harry before we let
everyone go for the day does Microsoft
now own the rights to projects on github
I'm not sure that's a good question
Microsoft just bought github I don't
think they own the rights to the
projects themselves right and we didn't
think Facebook owned her photos either
yeah yeah yeah I think it's as similar
they own the hub for it but I don't
think they actually owned a specific
projects although don't sure but I think
that's that's kind of how it would work
yeah kind of makes sense doesn't make
sense all right we are just about out of
time for the day but it's so good to be
back thank you guys
Roger Joan it's nice to be back in the
captain's chair here I needed it I
missed it and yeah let's finally get
