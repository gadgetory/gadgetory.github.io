forums were hacked in 2015 and 2016
xbox360iso and PSP iso our forums where
users can download game files those
forums were hacked back in September of
2015 according to security expert Troy
hunt Troy hunt runs have I been pwned a
website where you can input your email
address and see if it's ever been
involved in a hack the site tracks data
breaches and these three forum hacks
recently came to light the other
affected forum is run by Witcher dev CD
Projekt RED the developer alerted its
members in April of 2016 that an
unauthorized user may have made a copy
of an older forum database but confirm
the breach earlier this week they urged
users to change their passwords as a
precautionary measure even though the
hacked passwords were encrypted all
three forum accounts don't include
financial information but usernames and
passwords were a part of the hack so if
you've ever registered there and even
think you use the same email and
password combination somewhere else you
should change those logins immediately
especially for your xbox gamertag or
playstation network credentials where
you might have credit card information
stored for more information head over to
