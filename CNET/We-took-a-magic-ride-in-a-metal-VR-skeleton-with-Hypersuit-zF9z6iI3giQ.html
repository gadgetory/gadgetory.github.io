exoskeleton CES is full of all sorts of
strange experiments and high pursuit is
a sort of thing you'd expect to see
designed as a type of a arcade
attraction or something to be used in
public spaces hi pursuit is a giant
metal device that connects with HTC vive
or oculus rift to create a feeling of
mechanized motion I tried it out it is
hard to control but does definitely feel
times like I'm banking around with giant
metal wings crazy but that was the whole
idea the team wanted to live a dream and
this is what the product is high pursuit
wants to make full metal exoskeleton
snacks meaning leg motion as well
imagine hopping into a giant mechanized
robot in VR at your local mall maybe
that'll happen my brief time in high
pursuit was spent circling over polygon
style planes and going through glowing
rings trying to bank around and get
around the clouds and over mountains I
found that my right wing was a little
more effective than my left wing maybe
that's muscle control and my own muscle
tone maybe it's the suit I couldn't tell
but by moving your hands together you
could dive in lower by pulling them back
you could raise and you could also bank
your arms left and right it looked like
I was doing some sort of robotic Tai Chi
on a massage table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
