days that you're not quite sure is real
or actually happening because that is a
Porsche 959 one of in the grand scheme
of things not that many made and done
I've got the key the 959 story begins
all the way back in 1982 when Helmuth
Bott approached Porsches md about the
911 he had some ideas and thought they
needed to go on it well on a new one at
least but wanted to build a sports car
Porsche could rely on in future so
thought all-wheel drive would be the way
to go knowing that motorsport helped
developments along some what he
approached top brass and suggested they
entered that then very popular group be
the right people said yes and he got to
work making his full wheel drive mule
into a racing car the car's engine
wasn't to be all new but one lifted from
the 9:35 racer it was a 2.8 5 litre
twin-turbo flat 6 with 444 brake
horsepower the turbos were in sequence
rather than parallel meaning that turbo
like was in theory a thing of the past
its body was a mix of aluminium and
Kevlar so the weight stayed as low as
possible though it still tips the scales
at nearly one and a half tonnes
it's arrow was made to ensure there was
no lift and the street car got a
variable ride height to help keep the
car as stable as possible
racecar engine aside the 959 prototype
had something pretty special four-wheel
drive PSK or Porsche stoical plumb
shuffled the power around the cars
wheels as and when it was needed it
could have up to 80 percent push to the
rear now I know that may sound a bit old
hat now you can get it on a small family
car but back in its day it was quite
something the group B concept appeared
in 1983 wiring the crowds at the
Frankfurt Motor Show in 1985 of the full
production car was unveiled with a
release promised for 1986 at the time it
was the fastest production car on the
planet putting in a top speed of 195
miles an hour though sport models could
hack 197 naught 262 was apparently
dispatched in 3.7 seconds
in all there were two versions on offer
that comfort and the sport the comfort
had things in it things like air Caanan
anything electrical while the sport lost
pretty much all of that and a hundred
kilos it was supposed to be a
featherweight killer just as Porsches
early LeMond cars had been the
performance is simply staggering still
hook it up from second to third and it
just goes it takes you down the road
angrily shouting Lee making an
incredible noise of course it's got that
engine and oh my what an engine it is
now I want to talk about the two-stage
turbos because the idea behind it was
the little turbo would get it all going
nice and quickly then the victor bow
would carry on so you get just one big
wave of torque now what actually happens
is you start off going very quickly then
the big turbo happens and wool
oh it's fast it just picks up speed
instantly you're gone bang
that's something I'm not really used to
I don't think anyone's used to anymore
because now turbo technology's moved on
but this is one of the blueprints of how
to get cars shifting mentally fast
the clutch is incredibly heavy as is the
gearbox is very very mechanical you do
have to force it into its ratio you have
to work for your supper and well some
may view that is quite bad it's of its
age and frankly it works staggeringly
well it feels really good you feel
incredibly involved and engaged with the
car the brakes again very very heavy
very little assistance as you'd expect
from a car of this particular era but in
the same breath you do get lots of
lovely lovely feedback you know exactly
what's going on a lot of feel through
the pedal the steering is delightfully
weighty something you don't get much
anymore in the feedback you get through
it is when it's awesome it really really
is good you can feel everything through
the fingertips properly and this car is
pretty much mint everything on it has
been lovingly restored and looked after
by the guys at the Porsche museum this
car is a museum piece when looking down
at the Adamo tur well it's done a little
over 4600 kilometers as not much and I
put about a hundred of those on
so I've left the mark on the car that's
good well Group B was ideal to start
with it shift towards rallying put
Portia off it somewhat rather than
complete Portia got on with making the
best road car it could until 1984 that
is when Jacky Ickx prodded for sure hard
enough to enter three 911s modified two
959 spec in the Perry Dakar which eat
one full rally spec nine five nines
entered in 85 and in 86 959s finished
first and second not bad a road racer
variant the 961 appeared as well it even
entered Lamar in 1986 scoring a class
victory and seventh place overall
this cars legacy as well as being a
poster car for people all over the world
that still is today as well as it's
incredible performance and as well as
its victories and stunning efforts on
the world's race stages and rally stages
is the fact that it proved that you
could have a 911 with four-wheel drive
in it admittedly the PSK system was
simplified for the first Carrera 4 and
then completely switched out for the one
after that because while it was
brilliant it was very expensive and very
very complicated it showed that you
could still have fun in a 911 with all
four wheels driven it's a beautiful
piece of engineering and a stunning
piece of design and a testament to that
is the fact that several times today
people stopped just to have a chat to
have a look at it it's just got people
and they love it for it and I don't
blame all our travels chap accosted us
wanted to have a look cause he knew
exactly what he was looking at
and he told us that his dad used to work
at the factory around the time 959 was
being developed and apparently his
father on the day he went to buy his
wedding rings took her 959 and he
doesn't remember that day because he
went to buy the ring he was going to
slip on to his everlasting love's finger
no he remembers that day because he was
driving a 959 Fairplay but don't tell
your wife the power this car has over
people
it is the highlights of people's days
the highlights of their years help for
some people it would be the highlight of
their lives I'm never gonna forget the
time I spent with this car I'm so
incredibly lucky to have done it for me
the 959 was always a special car I loved
it to bits when I was a kid I remember
seeing it just as countless other people
did and falling in love with it at the
time I wasn't really a fan of the 911
but hell the 959 I just did it for me it
just did it for me it got me in a way
that very few other cars did
this car is part of a set that summed up
a tease XS it was the fastest the
greatest the ultimate Porsche it used to
go toe-to-toe with Ferrari f40 s Jaguar
xj220 s in the light it set the paradigm
for the supercar Renaissance it's one of
the world's true greats and an
innovative one at that the 959 vs
ferrari f40 schoolyard battles were a
precursor to those that happened once
again in the naughties and are happening
right now with the 918 Spyder McLaren p1
and Ferrari laferrari each time there is
a big supercar Renaissance Porsche is
always there throwing its high-powered
hat in the ring the 959 was its first
big go and what a way to do it it's been
a genuine pleasure to be able to drive
the 959 even for the briefest of moments
because it's very much of its era it's
very fast and consequences well who
gives a damn about them nowadays yeah
manufacturers are making very fast cars
but they also have something else in
mind
efficiency and while that's all well and
good I'm not knocking that every now and
then don't you just wish manufacturers
would throw out all the eco bits and
make something as big as fast and as
silly as possible and now I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
