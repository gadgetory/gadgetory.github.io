real sports cars in the traditional
definitive sense small light typically
open to seated and not overly power and
the Mazda Miata also out sells all the
predecessors it's a tribute to by far
basically they've been getting it right
for a long time let's drive this 2014
mx-5 miata grand touring with the
retractable hardtop and check the deck
now the most amazing thing about the
Miata after 25 years it's still a Miata
most cars after two and a half decades
on the market suffer a pretty massive
category creep but this is what it was
when it hit in 1989 the pure essence of
a sports car not too much of anything
the engine has grown from 1.8 liters to
two beyond that it hasn't changed much
and you do now have the option of a
power retractable hardtop that is new to
their DNA but again you can go with
canvas over your head if you like this
is a thing of beauty though it's
absolutely nicely behind the rear seats
doesn't add a lot of weight and it
doesn't give you a variable trunk
intrusion like a lot of retractable I
like that
the downside is the trunks really small
now to be sure inside a Miata is tight
it actually makes a Boxster seem fairly
spacious but that's kind of the idea
here let's give it a little slack on
that one
super clean classic gauge pack I like
that it's not adorned with anything
including an LCD helper display which
brings us to the other LCD that isn't
here that one there is no LCD head unit
on a Miata not available optional
standard otherwise unless you want to
get this sort of clip-on Garmin they
offer but don't simple LCD readout for a
simple entertainment system am/fm of no
HD satellite radio is optional CD can be
six disc aux Jack down here there is an
iPod adapter but it's kind of added by
the dealer later and that's about it for
advanced media no apps no connecting
anything except the connection you have
in the road
as long as I like this business like
little cockpit there are a few economic
and stylistic gripes that make me nuts
first of all the style and quality of
that center stack everything in here is
a great classic look and then this is
kind of this weird mushroom shape and
worse than that it's made out of plastic
that should be used to make the packages
things come in not the things themselves
this is one really bad sheet false note
you can otherwise nice cabin some other
weird ergonomic things when you get into
the gear shift here and you're in either
2 4 or 6 the bones on my wrist
hit the power window switches almost
every time I'm constantly wondering what
is that noise oh the windows down a
crack again and if you want to open the
little door to put gas in it it'd be
nice if it was somewhere where I'm
looking forward but no I've got to do a
180 open up the Smuggler's box and pull
that thing that's almost like they don't
like me our basic theme is very strongly
heard under the hood 2 litre inline-four
this is the big engine needs to be
smaller than this when they first came
out I throw a 1 6 or a 1 8 depending on
your market 167 horsepower pretty modest
number by today's standards 140 pound
feet of torque
very modest number by today's standard
but the car only weighs 2600 pounds so
60 happens in a respectable 6.9 seconds
you've got a 21 28 mpg rating
therein lies the rub a car this light
with this small of an engine should get
better mileage but they're not pushing
it on the technology front for example
no turbo no direct injection
now the first thing you'll notice
driving a Miata is that it is not overly
powered you saw those numbers 140
foot-pounds of torque is not much today
but it's about revving this farm you get
it above three pounds you keep it above
three pound that's where the action
lives in fact it's geared toward that
when you're on the highway at sixty in
Top Gear in six you're still pushing
close to 3,000 rpm the gearbox is
short-throw and crisp a lot of companies
will say that about their transmissions
and you get in and they're not this one
doesn't lie
traditional hydraulic power steering you
may have noticed the engine is just
mostly behind the front axle line that
gives us what you could call a front
mid-engine layout bottom line is it gets
around a corner fine without feeling
long now if you don't keep this car
revved it is a bit gutless we've got the
sports suspension on this car gives it a
bit of a hard ride combine that with the
hard bottom seats and it's a bit of a
pain to be driving it every day in
crappy pavement so just bear that in
mind depending on your purposes for this
vehicle
here's what you bind me up because you
can use all of it that goes for very few
cars today if you get down a country
land at a good clip in one of these it's
because you've learned how to really use
the car and how to drive now there are
some wonderful enthusiasts who drive
things like BMW M's and on WRX STI is
but it is also true that any moron can
make one of those go fast with their
massive amounts of power computer
controlled all-wheel drive and
intelligent performance stability
control this car has none of that when
something good happens in one of these
it's because you and the car made it
happen together that's what a sports car
is all about
okay let's price our happy bug-eyed
little friend a 2014 Grand Touring
retractable hardtop Miata is gonna be
about thirty thousand two delivered with
a manual if you want to add the
automatic that's eleven hundred of
course I won't speak to you after that
point so don't do it then it's 1394 the
Premium Package which actually brings
you a lot of things we take for granted
these days
including an alarm system that's right
Bluetooth hands-free that's right
keyless access satellite radio and xenon
headlights 650 more for the Sport
Package that will eat you Bilstein
shocks firmer spring ray shows all
around and the limited slip differential
that one's actually a steal all in about
thirty two three the best and perhaps
the only 30 to three you can spend on a
pure sports car in 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
