gentlemen let's get right to it we're
super psyched back on the program SRX
went around and oh yeah and your fancy
new digs dad are you impressed now I'm
very impressed yeah i'm waiting for
Sally Jessy to come out right ask me
about my childhood I I want to really
hear your kind of crash course 101 about
what the hell bitcoin is I i understand
it only so far a lot of our listeners we
talk about this all the time we've had
financial analysts on the show talking
about it I want to hear from you you're
doing the research you're in production
what the hell is Vic what is Bitcoin
where does it come from ok you're like
money in a vault somewhere that
represents bitcoins how does it all okay
how it works I'm not going to give you
there's really really great now that
we've further down the road there's
really good if you you go to youtube and
google what the hell is Bitcoin it'll
like walk you through I'm sort of the
same thing I do it download it i don't
want to kind of bored people with like
hyper technical stuff sure basically you
know we live and this is what my movies
about we live in an era of cryptography
um you know the the internet itself was
sort of architected around cryptography
and it's taken a while for that to
actually enter our lives in a
fundamental way sure and when i say the
shiny object about the Deep Web and the
dark net is that what's happening in the
in the media just like with Napster was
like it's piracy it's free Madonna songs
it's like that was a shiny object and
over here there was this quietly there
was hundreds of millions of people
creating mobile cute right it's a little
bit more important than pulling a
Madonna debt track down for every right
and what's happening is that everyone's
going oh you know they're selling drugs
online and people using this Bitcoin
thing to buy drugs and it's like no I
mean that yes they are just like they're
using you know US currency to buy shares
people use various forms of exchange to
purchase drugs this is a known fact it's
been happening for a wife or a little
while just as there has been drugs
online for a little while just a little
bit yeah like you know since it first
showed up so sort of notion that bitcoin
is somehow this nefarious thing
that allows you to go and buy drugs is
so completely ludicrous it's it's
laughable and we will dispel that debunk
that myth quickly in the baby what you
have is you know is a cryptocurrency and
what that means in a nutshell is that is
that it was created it's an open-source
peer-to-peer technology it's created to
211 what makes Bitcoin work is that how
do you create an exchange a cyber
exchange that doesn't allow for repeat
spending how do you know that once you
spend one Bitcoin you can't say ok now
I'm going to go spend the same one over
here and the same one over here and
you're never going to know and that's
where cryptography comes in which is
usually tied to a two-factor system or
some way of creating a bounce-back a
private key a public key you can google
all this stuff it's really basic once
you get your arms around
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
