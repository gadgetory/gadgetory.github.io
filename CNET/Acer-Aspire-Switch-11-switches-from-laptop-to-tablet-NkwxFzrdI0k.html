the ice of booth ASA has decided that
their switch range is so good they're
turning it up to 11 this year they've
released the switch 11 this is an eleven
point six inch version of the previous
switch ten but also in much higher spec
options this time around you can get the
switch 11 in a Intel Atom powered option
which is a bit like the switch 10 so far
but they're also offering options
including Intel Core i5 processing 128
gigs of hard drive space as well as a
much more serious performance machine
for something that's running our windows
8.1 now being a switch the whole idea is
the two-in-one convertible format this
means that the screen lifts off very
simply and then you can snap it back on
in the alternate direction and to do
presentation mode or to just do it the
normal way for laptop or straight take
it off and use it as a tablet so it's
quite a little versatile machine they've
also included things like micro HDMI
micro SD slot and just a few other basic
ports including USB 3.0 on the high
espect model this is also a full HD
display so it's a really quite nice spec
machine the pricing is gonna start at us
399 and in Europe at euro 399 and we
still at waiting on other final price
confirmations beyond that but it's a
nice little machine given the price and
hopefully we'll hear more about this one
we get to test it out soon I'm Seamus
burn foreseen it here at IFA 2014
