favorite moment of the entire show the
time I get to interview Gary Stern from
the stern pinball gary is back here
again with the new machine Gary I'm
gonna have to interrupt you I'm sorry I
know you're doing so great let's talk
about Wrestlemania tell me about your
new machine Gary well it's WrestleMania
of course it's you know it's a great
theme for pinball and this game is has a
unique special new feature in it and
that is it's got an upper play field a
wrestling ring with the upper play field
there are kickers within the ropes so
you get to keep the game you use the
flipper buttons like that and you keep
keep the ball in action up there and
once you finally get the ball into the
eject hold it spinning the other
wrestler now there's some other
advancements here as far as the
technology is concerned what's different
technologically about this new series of
pinball machines compared to the
previous generations this game is the
first pinball machine that we are making
with our new spike electronic system
before that up until now we've used for
the last decade or so what we call the
Sam system and if I can show you inside
here a we have a very small board a
sound and sound CPU board and instead of
having a big CPU board and a big i/o
board and a big fluorescent tube you can
see they're very bright LEDs here we
have just this one small board and then
we have data cables that go down to node
boards or semi smart boards within the
game it's a scalable system so when we
want to do more we just put in more node
boards and I've opened up a few of these
cabinets before and is usually a mess of
wires this is a lot cleaner I can see
you're using like Ethernet cables that
can be readily replaced it looks a lot
more like a little computer inside here
it is a lot cleaner and under the hood
it's a lot cleaner the Sam system games
have about a half a mile of wire in them
and this has significantly less wiring
and significantly neater wiring it's
much easier to
and to build it's much easier to
troubleshoot should there be a problem
now is it gonna be at all possible to
open this up to see under the hood or
can we get someone to help us do that or
well just a minute here but it's
impressive if anyone has not seen the
inside of a pinball machine
this will be a real treat that you think
the inside of a computer looks neat this
is a this is this is a wire fetishist
dream alright we'll see if we can get
the new Wrestlemania cabinet open take
the glass off the glass aside from
protecting you from getting a pinball up
in your face is also dampens the sound
of these machines a lot too because we
haven't said as I said you would hear a
bunch of balls falling out of it the
wiring here even though it looks like a
lot of wires guys this is significantly
less than you typically see on a modern
pinball machine and you see a lot of
these cleaner components that are all
attached with Ethernet cabling we
actually have in some of the walking
dead with this system even though it was
made with the Sam board system in it if
you come down to our booth you'll see a
demonstration unit of the walking dead
all opened up with the Sam system and
all opened up with a spike system well
Gary thank you so much for giving us a
tour of your new machine Wrestlemania
very excited to to play this hopefully
you'll stick around for a few minutes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
