apps is talking I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update
using your smartphone to call people
it's such a wild concept that these days
adding a calling feature to an app
becomes newsworthy Facebook's messenger
chat app has just added group calling so
you can make a call over an internet
connection to multiple people and we're
not just talking about a few friends you
can call up to 50 friends at once
calling 50 people would be so chaotic so
maddening
that's almost beautiful over the next
day it should be available for all
iPhone and Android users this makes
facebook Messenger more like Google
Hangouts and Skype but Messenger has 900
million monthly users and that's 3 times
larger than Skype Facebook also lets you
chat with way more people at once in a
group call the free limit on hangouts is
10 people and the limit on Skype is 25
meanwhile PlayStation is adding a
feature that it should have had years
ago two-factor authentication for
password security sony said it's
preparing to offer this extra step of
verification for those logging in to the
PlayStation Network but no word on when
it's coming just yet it's actually
pretty embarrassing for Sony to not yet
have this security option you used it
before whenever a website asks you to
enter in a number code that was texted
to you right after you log in from a new
machine
well Xbox Live users have had it since
2013 so new security has been breached
numerous times already
don't forget five years ago playstation
network was hacked compromising more
than 70 million accounts yet this basic
security feature still has yet to arrive
but that's not all that's tragic in the
gaming world my friends the Xbox 360 has
finally reached the proverbial red ring
of death Microsoft announced it will
stop making the console after a decade
of production but for those of you still
keeping that baby alive at home
Microsoft will continue to keep Xbox
Live services available and if you want
to comfort yourself in a warm blanket of
gamer nostalgia Sega is launching a hub
on Steam for its 1990s Genesis games
steam is an online marketplace for
downloading games and on April 28th
Sega's classics will be available to
play for free accessible through this
1990s kids bedroom you just have to
purchase one of 50 old titles such as
Golden Axe Alex Kidd altered beast Ecco
the Dolphin that one was kind of tough
and then there's flicky and Streets of
Rage and kid chameleon the CAPA
your head flies off to kill the baddies
and you know old games work kind of
weird sometimes but it won't be totally
the same because you can save at any
point during gameplay and that's
practically cheating but there is one
unique twist Sega is also gonna let
people legally modify these Genesis
games and share the changes they make
with others that's all for the second is
roundup you can head to cnet.com for
more from our studios in New York I'm
