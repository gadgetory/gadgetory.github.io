and we're taking a look at the Harman
Kardon AVR 1610 this is a slim 5.1
receiver with built-in bluetooth but
selling for $400 the AVR 1610 just plain
looks nicer than almost any other AV
receiver on the market instead of the
traditional big and boxy design it has a
polished look with smooth corners that
manages to pull off a glossy black
finish that doesn't look tacky it's also
a good deal slimmer than your typical AV
receiver and it's remarkably light at
just 10 pounds it's not quite as slim as
miranne so slim line models but it's
pretty close the remote isn't nearly as
well designed the fatal flaw are the
extremely tiny volume buttons which
doesn't make any sense since you're
always using the modern AV receiver it
ends up being consistently tough to find
those buttons especially in a dark home
theater so it's a frustrating clicker to
live with for features the Harman appear
is pretty good on the spec sheet on the
back there are five HDMI inputs
including an MHL compatible input which
is certified Roku ready for Roku
streaming stick there's an Ethernet port
for networking
although note that you cannot update the
firmware using that port and only
internet radio and DLNA are supported
there are no other streaming services
the real standout is the AVR 1610 has
built-in Bluetooth which is particularly
nice for a $400 receiver or at least it
would be nice if it worked a little
better instead of automatically
switching inputs when you pair it with
the Bluetooth device the Harman forces
you to load an on-screen menu go to the
source select screen and then choose
Bluetooth every time you want to stream
there's not even a dedicated Bluetooth
button on the remote so you're forced to
use the on-screen menus that defeats a
lot of the convenience of Bluetooth in
the first place and other Bluetooth
friendly receivers don't have the same
problem including Sony's excellent STR
DN 840 which costs only $50 more and
adds Wi-Fi and airplay we also had
resident audio file steve guttenberg
give the
I'm going to listen and he was a little
underwhelmed for one the AVR sixteen
tens automatic speaker calibration ended
up setting the subwoofer much too loud
to the point where the subwoofer was
audibly distorting and even after we
manually tweak the settings it didn't
have quite the punch or poise of the
similarly priced Marantz in our 1403
which overall sounded better
especially at louder volumes and so
ultimately the AVR 1610 ended up feeling
a bit like an underachiever especially
after we live with it for a bit there's
a great look and on paper the features
are good but altogether it just doesn't
work as well as you want it to in
practice I'm Matthew moscovia and this
is the Harman Kardon AVR 1610</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
