and get hooked on a new app I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
there's a new way to travel to space the
company SpaceX reveal the craft that can
take seven astronauts to the
International Space Station and return
them to Earth in the same pod it's
called the dragon version to SpaceX has
worked with NASA on other missions but
all of its spacecraft so far had no
passengers and this would change that on
the return to Earth the new dragon is
able to land with the accuracy of a
helicopter that means it can be used
again and again let's move on to more
down-to-earth transportation like Mario
Kart of course the new racing game mario
kart 8 just came out and Nintendo's
hoping that it'll boost sales of the Wii
U but players in Japan will have a
different experience than the rest of us
their characters will be able to race
with a mercedes-benz GLA SUV this
promotional crossover is a first for
Nintendo there's even a commercial in
Japan for the new SUV that features
Mario driving the car in the classic
8-bit game and then he enters the real
world all tough but he's still not tough
enough for a walking mushroom switching
gears there's news on the gear Samsung
is killing off Android from the original
galaxy gear smartwatch which came out in
September of last year there's an update
rolling out that will change the
operating system from Android to Tizen
which is Samsung's homemade operating
system the SmartWatch scene is evolving
quickly there are reports that HTC and
Microsoft will have their own SmartWatch
is coming out soon the blog TK tech news
says it saw a demo of HTC's model it's
called one where it has a round screen
and will launch in august or September
and Forbes is reporting that Microsoft
is prepping a watch that will monitor
your health rate and sync with iOS and
Android devices as well as Windows Phone
of course and to wrap things up there's
a new app puzzle game that will replace
your addiction to candy crush it's
called two dots and it's a sequel to the
original dots game this takes the
original concept of connecting dots of
similar colors but now there are levels
of difficulty with missions to clear
certain colors with limited moves and as
you progress your two dots characters go
on this journey and you compare your
score with Facebook friends it's only
for iOS now but the game makers say the
Android version will be released later
this year that's your tech news update
