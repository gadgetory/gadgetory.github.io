new samsung galaxy phone at Mobile World
Congress on februari 24th I know it
feels like we just got the galaxy s4
yesterday but the s5 would seem to be
just around the corner so what can
Samson do to keep its flagship Android
phone at the top of the pack I'm Donald
Bell and this top 5 I'll be counting
down the most requested features for the
Samsung Galaxy s5 starting things off at
number 5 a faster processor I mean why
not I figure Apple threw down the
gauntlet with the 64-bit iphone samsung
ain't gonna take that lying down but
unlike Apple Samsung is still somewhat
bottleneck by what Android will support
but expect to see some serious charts
and benchmarks trotted out for the s5s
debut at number for a better screen
samsung loves going over the top with
their screens I'm not sure if they're
going to go much bigger without stepping
on galaxy note territory but the rumor
is we're going to see an AMOLED screen
boasting a 2k resolution 2560 x 1440 at
some point we're going to need to
upgrade our eyeballs just to appreciate
the increased pixel density but I'm sure
Google's working on that too googly eyes
at number 3 better battery life android
phones have been known to really push
the limits of battery endurance but the
galaxy s4 wasn't one of them not bad but
pretty much where you see the iphone
words no android fan wants to hear the
recently released LG G flex has been
able to pull down over 17 hours of
intense use that's more like it coming
in at number 2 a better camera now the
s4 already went over the top with
endless features and a 13 megapixel
sensor it's a great camera so what can
samsung do to raise the stakes well
maybe they could lean on lens quality
maybe they can steal a page from the 42
megapixel sensor in the Lumia 1020 or
maybe that 2k resolution on that screen
is just going to make all your existing
photos look more amazing anyway before
we get to number one let me take a
moment to tell you what I don't want in
the s5 more samsung applications
enough with all the s stuff if you make
an awesome useful app android fans will
download it in the meantime just let
them enjoy android instead of confusing
it with all of your s enhancements also
TouchWiz Samsung are you really too
proud to change this name where all the
other names taken hot twins alright and
now the number one most wanted feature
for the galaxy s5 as determined by me so
take this with a grain of salt a
fingerprint sensor it's rumored to have
one and I don't blame them people went
nuts for apples touch ID in the iphone
5s so maybe Samsung can up the ante with
a retinal scanner or a DNA analyzer that
will unlock your phone with the blood
sample that sounds fun so there you go
five ways that Samsung can keep milking
their galaxy phone success for every
penny be sure to join us over on Cena on
februari 24th for our live coverage of
Samsung's unpacked event just to see if
they make good in the meantime top 5
