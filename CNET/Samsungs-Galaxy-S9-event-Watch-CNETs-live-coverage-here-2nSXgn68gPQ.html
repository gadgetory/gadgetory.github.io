have the internet and you weren't
looking on YouTube then you wouldn't
have seen it yeah this is really the our
little pre-show before the actual
samsung s 9 and s 9 plus reveal this is
happening basically the day before
Mobile World Congress actually launches
it is happening out in Spain what we're
gonna do here is kind of talk about this
but also like we do with every show you
guys and gals can call in and be a part
of this show to ask questions talk about
maybe what you want to see or what
you're hoping for or maybe if you've
seen what we've seen then you're like
let us know if you're impressed or not

Canada you can always use the scene at
live hashtag on Twitter and we will jump
onto that and read your questions and
answer them - yeah I don't you know in
the past we've like tried to not be
spoilery but I think we should just talk
about what's out there right well we've
seen a video sorry put up the video
nowwhat alluding to this is what
happened yesterday online via slate oh
hang on didn't start here guys
the mobile workforce is fast approaching
two billion people
doing business everywhere demanding

for a new kind of mobile phone
a phone engineered with advanced
features so now the perfect phone for
you is the perfect phone for business
the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and s 9 plus the
phone reimagined
Aleksey we're back okay we're not we're
not saying the board that video was
boring we're not it's just that that
would that's that's what leaked happened
so that yesterday and it doesn't leave
much to the imagination let's put it
that way even honestly last week like
everything that was out there was leaked
from every speck possible so you know we
know that the audience here is watching
is smart as well so what we're gonna do
is art all ten phone lines are literally
filled because you are least if you also
don't want to call and leave a message
with us just use the hashtag see net
live on Twitter and we'll look those up
and address some of those questions as
well from what we know right now but
let's just uh start kind of going
through the lines and see what we have
this is someone calling from the six one
oh that wanted to talk about what the
evolution of the next couple of years
the Samsung would look like welcome to
the show C Night Live what's your name
oh you have to put engage in my solo
hello hey what's on the top
how are we doing I'm good what's your
name
I'm Roman Rohan Rohan called like 10
minutes before the show actually started
because he uses this tool called Twitter
that I teased to call us what's going on
my man what do you want to talk about
today
so I wanted to hear your thoughts on on
the screen that's gonna have on the
phone and kind of your thoughts on what
evolutions gonna look like ever in many
years well from the screen standpoint I
mean if you even look at the form factor
and the specs that we've seen the screen
is basically we're looking at an SI
tight honestly with you know the main
difference in design wise is that the
fingerprint sensor on the rear side is
going to be placed below the camera lens
not on the side of it and I think that's
a huge that's a big I know it sounds
subtle but it's a big step in usability
of the fact that we phones that have had
that fingerprint sensor kind of down in
the middle on the rear sweet spot has
always been better than putting it
horizontally side with the camera so I
think that if you talk about the
evolution of the Samsung phone today is
a minor incremental upgrade even from a
standpoint of the battery life I know is
gonna be basically the same 3000 for the
milliampere hours for the s9 and then
3500 for the s9 plus that's exactly the
same as the s8 and si plus based on what
reports and rumors in everything that
has been thrown out there so this is I
don't know I don't know if you'd call
this necessarily a huge evolution but
it's more of a there's gonna be more
software stuff here that we're expecting
to see I know a lot of people were
really excited about the prospect of
having a fingerprint reader under the
screen at CES we saw the vivo phone when
that and I thought a lot of people were
going to be going oh look Samsung could
be the first you know big maker to
actually have that possibly with the s9
I think from the looks of the leaks
that's not gonna happen but I think if
Rohan you were talking about like the
evolution of the screen I think that's
really the next logical step about what
all these phone manufacturers need to do
to kind of push the boundaries a little
bit more we know that technology exists
we know it can be there so we just want
to see like when is actually the first
kind of like big-name phone gonna have
that released I'm I'm actually really
excited that's the one thing that I
think I'm super looking forward to in
screen tech it is screen tech and it's
kind of not but I kind of want to lump
it all in the same thing I'm so excited
for that yeah are you excited about
anything specifically for this keynote
it sounds like you are you a Samsung guy
uh some I actually have an iPhone but
I'm thinking of switching over there's a
lot of people in your town probably not
this iteration to be honest just because
of what you're saying it's a very like
iterative update it doesn't seem like
there's anything too crazy so maybe the
next iteration but nonetheless yeah I
think I think I'm in in the camp of
getting excited about the fingerprint
reader going underneath the screen and I
saw gumption stuff at CES with like
clear pixels which is kind of
interesting where the whole the whole oh
the basically be the screen itself is
almost transparent I think eventually
we'll get somewhere in that realm which
would be really interesting but and I
think once we start implementing things
like 3d touch which they have on all the
Apple devices on that could be
interesting as well just adding another
dimension to the screen so yeah so I'm
excited to see where things go over the
next couple of years but but yet some
good insight yeah you know I think 3d
touch I've always said this it's still
an underutilized interface because it's
not ubiquitous people still don't really
use it they don't even know it's there
you know the tech world does but and I
find it convenient I just thought that
it would take off and be used in a lot
more interesting ways then what it's
it's a totally underutilized interface
for me and I think other companies can
take advantage of the fact that Apple
put it out there you can obviously
integrate it into other screens non
Apple and kind of give it more get
really unlock it it hasn't really been
unleashed so
yeah I I think the the hardware is there
I think the software is just lacking
right now yeah yeah I'm right there with
you
awesome if I'm a huge fan of all your
stuff just when I call in I tweeted at
you I saw that or actually I saw that
Rohan but I didn't want to tweet back
because I was actually preparing the
show just a messing with the alright
well hey thanks so much for calling and
being a part of it all right it's good
morning it's Sunday morning so we got
some good tech stuff coming
awesome cheers guys all right thank you
all right Rohan first caller number one
stunner for the day let's jump in these
again we don't we don't have your names
here so we kind of have an auto
screening system right now cuz it's
Sunday we just lost the computer very
nicely because doesn't mind yeah let's
go out here to the three four seven it
looks like we're talking Joey and
Samsung smart battery life what's up
Joey good morning good morning how are
you Brian big big big big fan thank you
thank you so much what you want to talk
about today
basically why don't they move up the
battery life to 35 Miller at 3500
milliamps on the regular s9 and then
maybe 4,000 that seems got to be a big
issue these days I have my thoughts but
did you want to did you want to throw
anything out there no I mean to be
honest I don't know that much about
Samsung's use of battery I mean I know
this is definitely something that I
think you have thoughts on Brian
it's it's just something I think Samsung
is very being obviously very
conservative with pushing the battery
just because of those no it's 70 exactly
what I was saying so I think that
there's obviously you know it there is
the capability to go further and to
increase the milliamp hours but I
definitely know that Samsung is going to
be very very conservative with what
they're going to do just because of the
history there I can definitely
understand that as a consumer I mean I
definitely want the most battery life
out of my device but I think that
they're gonna try and eat that out
through software rather than necessarily
like pushing up the physical ability of
that battery - yeah Joe I think you make
a great point like - what Lexi said
right off the top right when I heard
that it's clearly because we know what
happened with the note 8 that our ultra
sensitive about this could they pack in
more juice probably but they need to
kind of build back that reputation so
nothing like that ever happens again on
top of that the point that you speak to
the most the number one thing that I
think every consumer that is has a phone
today wants not only better battery life
like significantly badder better battery
life whether it's an iPhone whether it's
in a galaxy phone whether it's a pixel
phone we still haven't seen how about
this one of the mainstream flagship
phones get crazy crazy better if I know
the Moto um
which which Motorola phone was it back
and would had like about like a Dave
during life I mean this is a couple
years ago but we need to see stuff like
give us a literally a full two day phone
of battery life or even one and a half
that's what's gonna be a game-changer
what people would would even push them
maybe to jump over to the side so I
think to your point battery life battery
battery life that's what we all want
hopefully the galaxy Excel have that
great next year baby we'll call back
next year we'll see if it happens
alright thank you for taking my pole
all right thanks Joey Oh looks like we
got Roger Chang on the line seen it what
Roger what is your official title right
now executive executive editor this is a
very lofty title or I don't play all
right but a Roger is over in Spain at
Mobile World Congress here like at the
actually arena we have a nice little
photo of you right now but we want you
to turn on your camera to see your
beautiful mind again yeah my camera's on
the connectivity is not so great I think
that's why oh it's okay we're gonna use
we're gonna use the power of your still
photo and uh
b-roll hey Roger a lot of stuff has been
leaked out already about the s9 we know
this but from your perspective being
there and what you know what do you
expectancy or what are maybe the things
that could at least pique people's
interest today and from their own
teasers that the big focus is going to
be on the camera it seems like they're
gonna be teasing a little bit of
augmented reality they they keep pushing
us to download the unpacked app and I
suspect that we'll be scanning a lot of
things they've got these large black
boards up hanging above the stage that I
suspect will be 20 our cameras that they
keep hitting at some magical AR
experience
so we'll see what that's about but I
think most of most of us most of this
talk it's gonna be about the camera how
the camera performs in low light how
camera performs where you're moving
basically going after the deal what
customers really care about it is camera
and photo quality absolutely uh what do
you what about it have you heard much
about the decks pad you know their
second kind of iteration of it we saw
this like sneak peek trailer that showed
a little bit of it often even showed
like how he instead of the phone
standing vertical it's now sitting flat
though so that you could use it as some
kind of a touchpad have you heard any
buzz or is that even any of interest for
you I mean it's that's definitely more
for business customers I could see why a
new Dex pad that laid your phone's flat
mix-a-lot said to be able to rest your
phone
and charge it we're plugging your
speakers and as you said it could work
as a keyboard if you were to work it's a
touch pad so it makes a lot of sense for
a new Dex pad to show up and they've
really been pushing that area more to
business customers it's not really
something our readers and most consumers
are gonna want but it's a it's
definitely something they're they're
looking to push as they try to get more
into the business base Roger its Lexi I
mean I know we don't have a video image
but kind of describe the room the layout
of what's happening because I know
Samsung is you know have a couple of
times that they've had some kind of like
floor and ceiling kind and and wall
screens are you seeing anything like
that anything that might be a
showstopper kind of visually they're
gonna showcase so if you remember Mobile
World Congress 2016 when they unveil the
galaxy s7 it's very it's a very similar
set up the stage is in the center of the
the venue at the large black stage there
are large solid turns above it where
they're flashing right now they're
flashing Wi-Fi at the Wi-Fi signal Wi-Fi
password didn't it doesn't work at all
but I think they'll be flashing a lot of
random symbols for us to focus our
phones on I think that's going to
trigger the AR experience that my guess
is what the big it feels very similar to
the Mobile World Congress event from two
years ago in which everything's in the
center if you'll remember that was the
big VR heavy focus in which we all put
on headsets and then Mark Zuckerberg
showed up yeah that was good us all
right well hey Roger you know settle in
we have our live we have our team that
is covering the event live as it happens
as well so Roger thanks so much for
calling in and I'm gonna I'm gonna say
shame on them for their Wi-Fi I wanted
to see your pretty face all right thank
you so much so that's Roger Chang
executive editor of C net inside over
Anna Barcelona that there's there's
photos that are up on you know aren't on
his a Twitter page exactly you know our
other editors that are over there I did
want to kind of keep on jumping through
the phone lines and but before we do
that talk a little bit about how we
mentioned the camera absolutely and the
camera RIA you know
everything they've done to promote this
the camera reimagined the big thing here
is we've heard and the rumors have
pretty much confirmed and even in that
little video you showed that the camera
lens itself will be able to manually
like switch between an f15 aperture and
f2 for aperture kind of it'll you'll see
like the lens around it letting them the
light or not just kind of shrink it's
like it's a it's a mu it's a physical
piece online so you know aperture works
kind of like the pupil in your eye it
expands and contracts to let in more
light or less light as it needs to be so
obviously in low-light your people is
expanding greatly so it can let in the
most light possibility Brian's doing the
beautiful visual right day6 you four and
F two folks slightly more close just not
preview of you don't even need to watch
them so it's really cool technology but
obviously you know most phones we've
seen Samsung have a concept of this in
one of their hands over the last year
yeah the flip phone and so you know not
pretty much no other phone has this this
is something that's very specific like
camera technology and you know from
until now phones are basically had a
fixed aperture so all it was doing is
basically adjusting the shutter speed in
the ISO to change that exposure
now it's gonna give photographers a lot
more flexibility and obviously they're
going to be pushing not those terms so
much in terms of like having full manual
control I think that the way they're
going to spin it is that obviously it's
gonna be improved performance in low
light so I mean just to see like how
they actually market this without
getting too technical about it and
that's really interesting to see there
because I think this is something that
is definitely gonna pave the way or I
mean this is the Holy Grail really in
terms of a lot of smart phone
photography I know that I want a
variable aperture fine
how much so much so I'm super excited to
see Samson's gonna do this and then
obviously you know other phone makers
down the track in 2018 are going to have
to address this yeah if you look at this
clip that we're showing right now you
can see that's that that actual you know
the ability for it to change aperture on
the fly and the other thing that we know
shouldn't be understated as well as that
this is an f-15 aperture that it that
the the lowest we've seen ordered the
one that allows
most light right LGV 30s one six this is
a 1/5 so this is the best we've seen in
a smartphone camera ever to date that's
good that alone itself is a big deal too
it's a tie like f-16 2f 1.5 it's oka
stop or something I don't even know the
exact you know number there but it's
it's very small it's significant the
biggest thing though that smartphones
have to work on is the size of the
sensor and that is the trickiest thing
so once we get the app the variable
aperture down we're gonna start having
to get bigger senses because I know
that's gonna happen and that's gonna be
the next holy grail to look for and I
mean it's crazy because we're already
getting phones that are getting closer I
will never say it's on the DSLR level
but getting pretty pretty getting closer
and closer
that's really thing I mean you can
definitely achieve the bouquet effect
you know that shallow depth of field for
portraits that's pretty close and that's
pretty good unless you have cool spiky
hair it doesn't work it doesn't work
sometimes it gets all fuzzy out here I'm
like come on man you know what you're
gonna try some of these third-party apps
that are now doing the depth maps I want
to say yeah which one do had do there
anymore halite halide h a lig it's
really interesting hey hey there's lots
of different apps and obviously with
that technology that's coming to
third-party apps not just the eye
friends are in portrait mode I'm excited
to see where it goes but just coming up
but we should get back to the cool
that's groove let's groove yeah the
keynote is expected to start somewhere
around 9:00 a.m. Pacific time excuse me
morning frog in the throat 12:00 p.m.
Eastern Time let's keep on hitting the
call lines we have our friend from the
2:00 to 4:00 wanted to talk about Galaxy
S 9 being worth the money
welcome to the show what's your name
Sina live in a house
my name the dime da and welcome to the
show thanks so much for calling this
morning
thank you
I just wanted to find out if the money
was going to be we thought it was going
to be worth it compared to some of the
newer phones that are also gonna be
released like the Moto G 6 I don't you
know from from a price standpoint I
don't think they've actually officially
that's one of the few things that has
not been leaked out yet the actual price
of the s9 from what I've seen I'm gonna
assume that it's gonna be probably close
to or in line with what the s8 is right
now we heard a couple of rumblings that
it might be about a hundred dollars more
than the debut press of the s8 obviously
you know in line with the increased
features and obviously we're thinking
about the market that can tolerate and a
thousand-dollar phone with the iPhone 10
like we've seen the market can tolerate
it and I might not be able to tolerate
thousand dollars but definitely other
people are and other people are going
there so I think that Samsung has seen
that and I mean as Brian said we don't
know exactly the price and that is also
going to come down to carriers too but
in terms of what I've seen rumor wise at
least $100 more than sa debuted at
all right thanks all right thanks Don
appreciate it Don the man all right
let's keep on rolling down the phone
lines we've got some our friend from the
901 looking for information on gaming
are you just calling to make friends
welcome to the show what hi everyone
I just want to touch a little bit of a
little things not just gaming but um
like the overall design of it like me
um I am an Android fan and I recently
had purchased some the iPhone X and I
spent three days with it and I can tell
you just overall I love the best screen
and the big feel of it and um I actually
returned it and because I you know I
just wasn't an Apple user I was so
caught up in Android is so much customer
you know custom things you can do with
the phone and things like that as far as
um my concern is is the overall overall
power like I look for the camera and the
power of it and I'm a gamer as well I
just wonder if it is it gonna be able to
you know tackle some of the you know
anyway games know come like that so
you're are you telling are you basically
trying to say you'd like to see some
sort of a console level gaming even like
a Nintendo switch level gaming on your
phone is that what you're trying to is
that what you're talking about
[Laughter]
honestly I feel I really just based on
you know the specs of some of these
phones like the high-end phones
I honestly think they're they're ready
to achieve at least you know under
Nintendo switch a level of gaming
performance that's not a problem what
the what the issue is is the developers
we haven't seen we there's a certain
type of game that is successful on the
phones that requires X amount of
resources but if you're talking about
Nintendo pouring hundreds of millions of
dollars into a game that's not on their
own hardware right we know that Nintendo
likes to build games too for their own
in Tendo hardware because that's how
they sell their consoles that's how they
make their money and Nintendo has been
the company that has been so resistant
to even bring something as simple we've
talked about this for years Beach a
basic Super Mario Brothers port to an
iPhone or an Android phone not not you
know sideloading it
for five bucks that is true they haven't
even done that right so it comes down to
me game studios triple-a game studios
sign to invest and take the resources
specifically to mobile - and it can't
just be one game right if you're if we
were hoping that our phones could get to
a console I mean we you need to see like
three or four or five games that are at
that level then you're like okay I'm
gonna start taking this Syria as a
gaming gaming like console level gaming
device I don't want to offend people
that are like I'm a gamer I'm on my
phone I get that right so that's I think
that's the biggest challenge they're
they're they're more than powerful and
ready to do it but I think what we're
now seeing is these phones the gaming
that's gonna be unique to them and it's
always like software that's unique to a
device is gonna be that they are
oriented reality gaming and that's where
this type of stuff is gonna be able to
kind of take gaming to another level we
just have to wait to get there but the
hardware is in place exactly and we've
seen benchmarks as well like the
Snapdragon 805 which is kind of the new
chip that's been benchmarked and it's
kind of got blistering speeds the XE
knows nine eight ten is also done really
really well in those benchmarking - I
mean obviously benchmarking isn't kind
of not the be-all and end-all of
performance you know as Brian said it's
all to do about you know developing and
optimizing for that particular chip and
that platform as well but we know the
hardware is there if the back the
benchmarks and the specs have anything
to say I mean we're ready we it's it's
all there it's now just about leveraging
that platform and making it the best it
can be based on you know the hardware
yeah um can I touch one other thing if I
got the time I'll let you touch I'll let
you touch bro okay Oh
design now I noticed that LG disses and
I see that Samsung is doing it as well
and I'm a type of person that you know I
will purchase the phone and if the total
design has changed and I notice they do
like like they have the s8 and now they
have the s9 v30 they had to be 20 in the
v10 and pretty much nothing has changed
as far as the design but more of like
the internal software it updating the
arm
the storage and now that Apple has made
the iPhone X and you see the whole bezel
islook with the OLED display which is
what I really wanted to try and I kind
of fell in love with it now why is it
some you know they're they're more of
stirring toys like the internal things
and I think they just just it's a the V
is it the V 30s and that there's more on
the AI features like are we gonna see
something there's gonna be a total like
oh wow like this is just incredible type
of feel type of look the draw
you know consumers into well I want this
this is it I mean I think you know what
it is as this market has matured and the
keynote looks like it's gonna be
starting pretty soon so we'll kind of
answer this question and then everyone
else that's on the phone okay gonna hang
out but I think the biggest thing is
that you know as phones have matured
more I feel like phones are all starting
to look the same anyways and now you
know and you know look we're the whole
goal is to get this to be a single piece
of glass with no buttons that is super
thin like that's what you know in the
future but everyone's look at these
phones they basically look the same so
it comes down the ecosystem it comes
down to exclusive features that make you
unique like an emojis you know thing if
that's your bag but I don't I'm not as
concerned anymore as much of the
hardware as I am about what the phone
can do and we've started seen camera
being one of the biggest things that
people are trying to do with phones
these days so exactly it sounds like
something's happening at the Keener
something starting sorry we couldn't
talk more bro but I think was your name
oh cool thanks what's your name you
never told your name oh I'm sorry
you can call me all right CJ everybody
else that you can hang with us we'll be
back after the keynote Samsung's Galaxy
S 9s 9 Plus reveal happening right now
check it out
that's it you can do it
there you go
with all these things that I did
ladies and gentlemen please welcome
president pet a pipe to the mobile
communication division DJ turn
welcome welcome everyone and thank you
it's an exciting time to be Mobile World
Congress incredible advances in
technology have created the perfect
conditions for innovation and change
artificial intelligence and machine
learning augmented and virtual reality
faster networks more powerful processes
the Internet of Things and now with
connected devices everywhere
powered by AI what we like to call the
intelligence of things
this week companies from across our
industry have become too short how they
intend to change the world
but I have a different view
I believe we overestimate our impact and
inflate our role it's not technology
companies that change the world its
people
we may deliver new capabilities and add
new features but it's only when
technology is in people's hands that
real magic happens and our lives are
transformed
it's you for the true creators and
innovators you are the ones who see new
possibilities that open the door to a
universe of new experiences there is no
better proof than the mobile phone it
started out as a simple idea a device to
make phone calls on the go but when you
saw what it could do you wondered what
else was possible if I can make a call
why not send an email why can't I listen
to music why can't I take a pictures or
watch videos
a Samsung we are inspired by the
Christians you ask we are a company with
researchers innovators designers and
engineers who have a deep commitment to
listen to our customers heavily
Christian challenges us to work harder
to turn today's impossible ideas and
tomorrow's essential capabilities
this is why we built the first mobile
phone with an mp3 player and the first
phone with a built-in camera is what led
us to create the fabula and pioneer the
infinite display now we are even more
excited by what's possible when you turn
can't into can you ideas and passion
have transformed the communications and
changing holily but for all the progress
we have made there's still a lot of work
to do technology is still too
complicated
there are too many steps too many
features don't get used to tackle this
next great challenges we are committed
open innovation so all your smart
devices will work seamlessly across real
connected life fragmentation and
complexity will become a thing of the
past
today we are in veiling on new gallops
smartphone with the powerful software
and services to manage every facet or
will connected life a smartphone with a
personalized intelligence of Bixby which
learns from new to simplify now you get
things done a smartphone that includes
the new smart things are to provide a
unified and easy way to control all your
smart things devices a smartphone the
lecture images and videos across your
smart TV
and family hub refrigerator and a
smartphone with Samsung health to help
you live a better healthier life for
years we have been one of the only
companies to offer a built-in heart rate
monitor now we are adding on advanced
optics sensor to track how hard your
heart is working and we are partnering
with the University of California San
Francisco School of Medicine for the
first research program to use this
sensor to measure blood pressure
tracking health and fitness is just one
way people use phones that we didn't
imagine at the beginning of the
smartphone era but over all the changes
we've seen nothing is more important
than how images are replacing words and
how visually have become the new
language for self-expression it's not a
text we send all the updates we post
that convey who we are anymore and the
most important function of a phone is
not making calls is to capture the
fleeting moments that express what you
want to say in an instant by taking
photos and surface sending images and
sharing videos last year people took one
point two trillion photos on their
smartphones every day they shared
ten billion video and sent five billion
images clearly the social media
generation has revolutionized the way
people communicate and transform the way
we all use our phones but if how you use
your phone has a change it how we build
it is not we still squeeze a camera into
a device meant for talking and while
camera have gotten better
they don't take great pictures in
low-light action shots are still blurry
Samsung we believe is time for a new
kind of fun not just a great smartphone
that takes good pictures
a breakthrough camera that sees the
world clearly in any light build around
an amazing smartphone inspired by your
ability to take us to places we never
imagined we'd go I'm thrilled
Tom Vail the first smartphone built for
the way you use your phone today and the
only smartphone with the power to help
you reimagine how you will experience
the world tomorrow ladies and gentlemen
I give you
galux as an ion and as my plus
and that's nine plus
okay thank you
thank you very much Justin Tennison well
hello everyone I am so thrilled to be
here to tell you about the amazing
Galaxy S nine
now we smartphone owners know from
experience that the way we're using our
smart phones is changing whereas
originally our phones were designed for
well making phone calls but we don't use
our phones like this so much anymore
we use them like this we send photos
gifts and emojis we communicate through
video chat and when we see something
funny we don't write about it we capture
and we do this all on our smart phones
they're the most personal devices in our
lives they're how we express ourselves
and how we share things with the people
we love and it's Samsung we're committed
to creating phones that reflect the way
you live your life today and that's why
we created the Galaxy S a 2 no date
introducing an infinity display that
lets you see and do more changing the
way that we create and communicate and
today we're building on that commitment
we're bringing you a phone that lets you
capture every fleeting moment interact
with the world intuitively and express
yourself like never before the Galaxy S
9
thank you
when we release the infinity display
most people had never seen anything like
it it's groundbreaking design offered
more screen in less space and quickly
set a new industry standard with the s9
we've built on this foundation taking
the same immersive and to end display
and refining it even further we've
created a design so sleek and unified
you can hardly tell where the screen
ends and as always you know there's no
knotch we've also refined the back of
the phone and it's as beautiful as the
front so take the fingerprint scanner
for example which we all know is one of
the most popular ways that we like to
unlock our phones which is why we didn't
get rid of it
instead we listen carefully to your
feedback and we move the finger print
scanner directly below the camera where
it's even easier to reach naturally
thank you
and because we believe that in giving
you more choice and convenience we're
also introducing intelligent scan
intelligence scan adapts to your needs
combining the key elements of iris
scanning and face recognition to make it
even easier for you to unlock your phone
in more situations and the feedback we
collect from you
extends the colors too and thanks to
your input the galaxy s 9 comes in four
stunning colors midnight black titanium
gray coral blue and the all-new
one-of-a-kind lilac purple which I have
a hunch is gonna be a crowd favorite and
now because the picture is worth a
thousand words I want to give you a
chance to see how beautiful the galaxy s
9 will look in your hands but you know
because we haven't released it yet we're
gonna use some magic here
so get ready the magic of augmented
reality to show you how the s 9 will
look up close and personal so for those
of you here in Barcelona I'd ask you to
take off your unpacked badges and hold
them in front of you face up okay go
ahead I'll give you a second to do this
now once you have your badge out make
sure you take your phone out - I know we
usually ask you to put phones down but
this time bring it out and open the
unpacked app on your phone there's a
little button in the corner says AR
click that now scan your badge facing
you there with your phone and as you do
that what's gonna happen is your badge
is gonna transform into the galaxy s 9
right there in your hands oh yeah I'm
hearing some oozing ahhs you're getting
it now you've probably figured out that
you can tilt it back and forth side to
side top to bottom you can check out the
beautiful aluminum frame now in case you
haven't figured it out yet you can flip
over your badge and now you can look at
the back of the phone
now when you do this this is when you
need to check out all the colors so at
the bottom you can select colors pick
your favorite one of course you've got
to check out the lilac purple and so for
those of you watching on the live stream
you should see what we're seeing but on
your screen the gorgeous galaxy s 9 with
a sleek refined infinity display a
totally uninterrupted screen that
stretches nearly all the way across the
front the device and it looks great in
your hand too right
now we're I'm glad that you got a chance
to experience the s9 up come up close
and personal I'm gonna have to be the
bad guy and ask you to put your phones
away your Galaxy S nines away for a
minute so I don't want you to miss what
comes next so there you have it folks
your first personal sneak preview of the
galaxy s 9 so from front to back and
outside in this device is designed for
the visual and social generation and
while it starts with an amazing display
that you just saw in your hand it also
extends to one of the most fundamental
tools in our lives the camera and to
create the s9 we completely reimagine
the camera and built an amazing phone
around it to create the ultimate tool
for communication and self-expression
and from the outset we challenged
ourselves with a different set of
questions what if your smartphone camera
could adapt your environment just like
the human eye what if it could radically
slow down time what if it could put more
self into self-expression and what if it
could literally translate the world
around you well today we're gonna answer
those questions and to help us do that
please help me welcome your favorite
demo enthusiast and mine mr. John Wong
thanks Justin how's it going Barcelona
yeah
so I was out with a few friends the
other night and we wanted to take a
group photo because it was dark out
everyone knows I have the latest galaxy
a device of course used my camera most
smartphone cameras just won't cut it
after the Sun Goes Down at Samsung we've
always been committed to leading the
industry with our camera technology and
this year we're building on that
foundation with our most groundbreaking
camera yet we've reimagine what's
possible to help you - brilliant photos
at any time of day for inspiration for
inspiration we turn into an incredibly
powerful image capturing tool the human
eye see the I naturally adapts to
different lighting situations when it's
bright out your pupils shrink down when
it's dark they get larger if they didn't
either be blind as a bat at night or
blinded by the Sun during the day and
yet that's how most smartphone cameras
have worked until now the Galaxy S 9 has
a dual aperture smartphone camera that's
actually designed to work like the human
eye it's bright outside camera will
automatically use a smaller aperture and
when it gets dark the camera switches
over to a wider aperture in fact the
widest ever included in a smartphone so
you can take bright clear shots day and
night with dual aperture reviews our
industry-leading hardware to reimagine
the camera down to its foundation and we
brought that same expertise to the image
sensor with the s9 we've integrated a
dram memory chip directly into the
camera as part of our new SuperSpeed
dual pixel image sensor that means
the camera itself can process four times
as much image data as before to minimize
noise and create a noticeably clearer
image in low-light
combined with dual aperture this means
that you can take incredible shots
whether it's super bright or super dark
now your eyes probably just took a few
moments to adjust in the sudden change
in lighting but the s9s camera adjusts
instantly to take the perfect shot see
and the lights were din we actually took
a photo with the s9 take a look pretty
cray right
and we set out to reimagine the camera
we focus on the experience or users love
the most and everyone loves slow-mo it's
one of the most popular shooting modes
because it makes everything look totally
epic the great part about slo-mo is you
don't need to be filming a
once-in-a-lifetime event
it's all about radically slowing down
time to make everyday moments epic which
is why we're taking slow-mo to a whole
new level with the s9 camera remember
that new super super speed image
processor we talked about well our d ram
memory chip powers the s nines all new
super slow-mo experience with super
slow-mo
you can record videos at an incredible
960 frames per second that means you can
stretch 0.2 seconds of time but the
length of a blank into a six second
masterpiece
so I want to see what this looks like in
action we've invited our favorite
slow-mo experts the slow mo guys to give
it a test run these guys I know right
awesome
these guys make awesome slow-mo videos
and they've pretty much perfected the
art let's see what they've created was
super slow-mo on the s9 camera oh it's
about to go oh god this is scary
hello I'm done where the slow mo guys
we did name ourselves appropriately
let's test this bad boy out for the
light sure lovely love it too one the
only question I have now is are you
ready nail it
the good box position perfect
you want to do again didn't you wanna
drive
Darren sweet let me watch this again you
go get dry all right of those guys
awesome you want to learn how to make
your own super slow-mo videos on the s9
Dan will be hosting a short session
after the show and gavin dan will be
sharing their full set of tips and
tricks on our samsung youtube channel in
the next few weeks
now just for comparison's sake let's
take a look at how super slow-mo stacks
up against typical slow-mo on a
smartphone video on the left it's normal
slow-mo
the one on the right is super slow-mo on
the galaxy s 9 camera just look at that
difference
and it's not just short clips using
multi take you can record longer videos
with up to 20 different slow-mo scenes
that means you can slow down the action
at just the right moments what's better
than a cat video that's right a super
slow-mo cat video yeah and for those
moments that are hard to time just right
we have Auto capture just choose an area
on screen any motion within it will
trigger super slow-mo so you can capture
the magic exactly when it happens and
you can also turn your slo-mo video into
a gif which you can play forward
backward or on a loop super slo-mo
lets you capture fun memories and create
amazing moments that you can share with
your friends now let's check out how
cool it is to create your own
masterpiece all I do is open up the
camera go to super slo-mo and in three
two one go
alright I think we got it let's check it
out
how cool is that how cool is that
I'm totally gonna play it again you got
to see it again sorry
have you ever seen water look that good
and every time you make a video
automatic background music is added and
you can customize it to the perfect mood
and if that wasn't enough let's check it
out in Reverse nice pretty amazing isn't
it of course there's some videos that
make you smile so much you'll want to
see them all the time so you can set
your slow-mo video as your lockscreen
to give your infinity display a unique
personal touch
super-slow-mo videos can be heartwarming
or hilarious our partners at the dodo
and BuzzFeed have already created some
pretty great ones on the galaxy s nine
sure all of you will be just as creative
when you make your super slow-mo debuts
and I can't wait to see what you come up
with and no matter how many photos or
videos you take you don't have to worry
because yes nine comes with a micro SD
slot which lets you expand your base
storage
you can use dual aperture multiframe
processing and super slow-mo on both the
s9 and s 9 plus cameras and now for the
very first time we're bringing the
incredible dual camera to the Galaxy S
series with the s9 plus the s9 plus
comes with both a wide-angle lens and
the telephoto lens and it has optical
image stabilization in both lenses so
you can take clear focus shots whether
you're snapping a close-up portrait or a
wide shot that captures more of the
action you're not just creating memories
you're creating art with live focus the
s9 plus lets you take beautiful
portraits by adjusting the blur of the
background to make the subject really
stand out and you can do it even after
you've taken the shot best of all you
can use all these incredible new camera
features no matter where life takes you
because of course the s9 is protected
from the elements with water and dust
resistance dual aperture for amazing
shots day and night a new SuperSpeed
image processor for epic super slow-mo
videos and a powerful dual camera on the
s9 Plus this is what it means to
completely reimagine the camera but we
didn't stop there we also made a camera
that brings a whole new level of visual
intelligence to your phone and I tell
you how please welcome Aaron Willis
thanks John hi everyone I'm so excited
to be here today to tell you more about
how we reimagine the camera now it seems
like we're always searching for new ways
to personalize the messages we write
that's how we got emoticons remember
those and then we had emojis and then
even more emojis but they were all just
symbols and shortcuts that helped us to
express a thought a mood and emotion but
never quite captured us as individuals
this year we're changing all of them
with augmented reality now you can use
either front or back camera to map your
unique facial features and expressions
and create emojis that actually look
like you amazing right
John do you might go back up here for a
second to show everyone how it works
sure thing Aaron the really cool thing
is with AR emoji is that it's super
simple and easy to create them and
personalize them so let's check it out
let me just plug the cord back in no
worries and we're good so all we do is
open up the camera go to AR emoji create
my emoji and now use the front-facing
camera to take a photo it's actually as
simple as taking a selfie to remove my
glasses so it gets a clearer view of my
face there we go now it's taking my
image and creating my AR emoji and there
it is nice all right all right wait wait
it's a bit generous with the hair so but
no worries we can we can personalize
that so let's go over to this one okay
okay
definitely not I'm not completely bald
no how about this one yeah that's much
better okay great
so now let's accessorize no thanks
great and lastly wardrobe that one yeah
I think my t-shirt looks good black
t-shirt yeah perfect Chris ok and now
personalizing my AR emoji
see how embarrassing his actual facial
expressions you can even add voice
messages to them plus the s9 will
generate 18 personalized emojis all
modeled after you and here's the best
bet you can share all the emojis you
create with your friends no matter what
kind of smartphone they have and because
we want users to enjoy the freedom that
comes with open platforms and ecosystems
you can also use them with their pati
apps like whatsapp and facebook
Messenger John how about we show them
these emojis in action sure thing Aaron
I just pulled up that AR emoji I created
of me check out those eyebrows nice
his/her own point and there's some
several other fun characters to choose
from
bunny bunny I ask you bunny
okay that was pretty cool so the other
night I was with Justin and he
absolutely insisted that he do a live
demo done packed and we both agreed that
a emoji would be the best one so hey
Justin let's check out your AR emoji hey
thanks John finally you've let me into
one of your live demos I'm supporting
well like you you know they're so easy
to use I can't stop with just one
so this is Monday morning Justin looking
professional will be try a couple others
on you this is Saturday night Justin
he's ready to go out wearing this chain
and in the spirit of the upcoming World
Cup I thought I'd try out world cup
Justin here he's rooting for Team Spain
what do you think what do you think guys
what's your favorite I mean they're all
pretty awesome but you can't steal my
thunder I still like my better Aaron
what do you think Oh guys it's a tough
one
I'm gonna have to go with John sorry
Justin oh well let me show you how I
feel with one of the 18 personalized
emojis that were created let's go with
that one
nice that's always feel amazing thank
you guys for helping me out
and if you don't want to create your own
emoji you can use some of the other
familiar faces including one of the
world's biggest celebrities he's got a
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and
he's been a Titan of the industry for
over eight decades that's right it's
Mickey Mouse
thanks to an exciting new partnership
with Disney you can bring to life some
of your favorite characters including
Mickey Mouse Minnie Mouse and even The
Incredibles with a R emoji the camera
helps you express yourself like never
before it's not just a lens for looking
at the world but also a tool for
interacting with it in new ways last
year we introduced Bixby our artificial
intelligence platform that helps you do
more with your phone and it keeps
getting better every day let's say you
want to translate a foreign language now
Bixby uses a R to show you search
results in real time just hold up your
camera and Bixby will automatically
detect the language and translate it for
you live here in Barcelona Bixby would
be a real lifesaver for me now I know
the basics in Spanish but sometimes you
need more than that especially when it
comes to ordering food I don't know
about you but I like to know exactly
what it is that I'm eating before I get
it so tomorrow when I'm out for lunch
I'll definitely be using Bixby to help
me let's check it out so first open up
the camera then I choose Bixby then you
select text search no wonder what buckle
out or no could be you hold it up and
Biggs people translate it for me live
fake fog sounds good
isn't that great as Bixby keeps
improving there are more ways than ever
to use it in your everyday life like
helping you track what you eat which is
amazing for a health-conscious person
like me now your camera can identify
what food is on your plate and log the
nutritional information directly into
Samsung health so you don't have to add
spend ages I didn't it manually as DJ
mentioned earlier Samsung has always
been committed to the idea that
technology can help us live better
healthier lives we want you to spend
more time love things that matter and
what bixby to make your everyday life
easier now I love shopping and one of my
favorite things to buy is makeup however
if I want the right color Foundation for
example I have to visit a store in
person but I have a really busy life I
don't always have the time now Bixby
makes this whole process really simple
with makeup mode thanks about
partnerships with leading cosmetics
brands Sephora covergirl and amore
Pacific Bixby lets you try on makeup
virtually and if you like something you
can use Bixby to buy it through your
camera at launch this will be available
in the US Canada Korea and China as
other companies join our platform
there'll be more opportunities to use AR
to improve the way you shop but that's
not all the s 9 will also be compatible
with Google AR core and developers are
already working on creating amazing new
AR apps and experiences for Galaxy users
so after all this I'm sure you can tell
that I really love this camera not only
because it takes the best pictures but
because it makes everything in your life
easier from shopping to eating to
traveling and with AR the s 9 camera
will revolutionize the way you work play
and interact with the world around you
tell you more about the incredible s9
please welcome McNaughton
Thank You Aaron it's great to be here in
Barcelona with the ys9 we didn't just
reimagine the camera we designed an
amazing phone to match unless you see
and interact with the world around you
like never before
and it's a gateway to countless other
worlds the ones were our favorite films
books and shows all play out with yes 9
and yes 9 plus we've created an
unparalleled viewing experience these
displays are totally immersive the s
nine at five point eight inch and the s
9 + @ six point two inch and they look
great too we all know Barcelona is a
stunning city and it's never looks
better than when viewed through the
screen of an S 9 vivid colors gorgeous
details this is a screen that really
pulls you inside and with es9 we've
boosted the brightness of the screen so
in the brightest daylight or the darkest
night everything will look crisper and
clearer now having an amazing display is
really important to our users but for a
truly immersive viewing experience the
sound has to be amazing - the s9
features speakers on both ends of the
device they're the loudest ever in a
galaxy phone
loud thank you these are new AKG Tunes
dual stereo speakers and they've allowed
us to do some truly incredible things
with our partners at Dolby think back to
the last time you went to your local
cinema the sound was totally immersive
right well we've brought that feeling to
the s9 with Dolby Atmos bringing
cinematic sound to a mobile device Dolby
Atmos takes advantage of yes Minds new
stereo speakers to move sound all around
you in three dimensions so you can fully
lose yourself in the film you're
watching and it works whether you're
listening to the essence amazing new
speakers or on your own pair of
headphones by simply connecting them to
the convenient headphone socket at the
bottom of the device we've made these
changes because the fact is many of us
watch videos and films on our
smartphones and when we do we usually on
the move so with the s9 whether you're
streaming a video or playing an online
game you get a better experience than
ever before the s9 is powered by one of
the most advanced chipsets on the market
which means you can get speeds faster
than gigabits LTE and we support the
most advanced networks so you can have
some of the fastest downloading speeds
available on a smart phone now I don't
know about you but I rarely get a chance
to watch a film these days without
interruption more often when I'm on my
phone I'm doing several things at the
same time so
Samson we're constantly improving the
entire multitasking experience now when
you get a notification you can just drag
it down and open it in a new window
right on top of the current one so you
can respond to a message without
interrupting the video you're watching
and multitasking isn't about just doing
more at once it's also about seamlessly
switching between tasks our home screen
now supports horizontal orientation so
when you're switching between apps you
don't have to keep flipping your phone
around and after a long thank you and
after a long day of streaming movies and
playing games recharging your phone will
be a piece of cake because the s9 comes
equipped with fast wireless charging the
key word being fast so you can get a
quick convenient charge without worrying
about cords to create the s9 we listened
intently to your feedback and your ideas
to give you an experience that's more
comfortable more immersive and more in
tune with how you live your lives this
is a device that revolutionizes the way
we think about smart phones can be and
what they can do for a generation this
more visual and more social than ever
before the s9 is our vision for the
future of mobile phones but before we
get a chance to take a look at it in
person our next speaker it's going to
take you through our vision for software
services and security for today's
consumers and businesses thank you very
much
ladies and gentlemen please welcome to
the stage executive vice president head
of software and artificial intelligence
es Cho
thank you all and hello to everyone
joining us from all over the world I'm
so pleased to join Samsung's leadership
team as the head of the software
research and development
I've always been excited about the power
of technology to make life easier
in my 15 years at Samsung I've been
honored to help our devices grow from
the standard feature phones of the early
2000s to the smartphones we love today
and I'm thrilled to help lead our
expedition into the new frontiers of
virtual reality augmented reality by and
machine-learning our aim has always been
to provide the best possible experience
combining the best Hardware with the
most advanced software we believe you
cannot have one without the other but
with both you can have a profound impact
on people's lives that's why we become a
global leader in chips displays and
sensors and created software and
services that revolutionize the way you
work and live with the mobile device at
the center of your connected life today
Galaxy phones routinely do things we
never would have imagined like organize
your schedule buy your groceries track
your calories translate a page and even
create an emoji that's truly you that's
our vision for software and services not
just make great phones but to help you
get the most out of them not just to
make your experience better but to make
them faster easier and even more
intuitive and on millions of galaxy
devices right now you can see this
vision at work
take Samsung pay for example we started
this service because we believe payments
should be as easy as a single touch
that's why we made it compatible with
most payment systems today samsung pay
is available in 20 markets and we are
continuing to expand to make the mobile
payment even more accessible with
Samsung health we are giving people
tools to live healthier lives the
experience is as simple as wearing a
wristband touching a sensor or taking a
photo of your plate of food and Samsung
smartthings we brought one of the
largest IOT ecosystems under a single
umbrella so controlling the most
important devices in your life is as
easy as flipping a switch and with
Bigsby we have created an intelligence
platform that makes it easier to use
your phone the way you want it adapts to
your behavior and anticipate your needs
and with powerful AR capabilities it
helps you understand the world around
you and express yourself in new ways and
these are just a few of the software and
services that are read radically
transforming our lives and they are just
the tip of the iceberg in the world of
connected technology security is more
important than ever because our data is
our most valuable possession and
consumers need to know that the data is
safe and companies need to handle data
with great care and responsibility and
that's why from our software api's all
the way down to our chips that
Security's integrated throughout our
devices with Samsung Knox and Knox has
received more government security
approvals and top rankings from industry
analysts than any other platform and
because security is a top priority
for consumers and for businesses we have
made sure Knox's Enterprise ready for
our enterprise customers we are for a
full suite of services to help corporate
IT IT managers configure deploy and
update all their devices easily
including through the cloud we may not
work for business because workplaces are
changing rapidly more and more we are
taking our work home with us and
bringing our personal lives and our
personal devices to the office from
healthcare to finance to manufacturing
businesses all occurs the world are
turning to galaxy devices and we are
helping them create flexible productive
workspaces with Samsung Dex Dex knows
Dex let's power your PC like environment
straight from your phone users and
companies love Dex
so we made it even better we've
introduced a brand new Dex pad and Knox
integration to create a seamless
experience for IT managers and services
like Samsung Dex among the most exciting
frontiers of Technology but as I said
earlier they don't stand alone they
built on a foundation of amazing
hardware powerful security and intuitive
software and now embedded throughout it
all is guess what
intelligence big speed will unite all
the different devices and bring our
vision of truly connecting the work

that was the galaxy s 9s 9 plus reveal
Lexi ceviches Brian Tong and Beechum's
Steven Beecham in the house Lexi I guess
hi highlights for you cuz it was overall
iterative we knew everything that was
coming but any highlights that stuck out
to you a couple of interesting things
that I think were really underrated from
I guess kind of both their presentation
and kind of what we heard in those leaks
and the coverage that came out so I
think headphone jack huge deal for me I
think it's great and I made a nice
little dig there had a couple of digs at
Apple which were kind of interesting and
good be the notch in the headphone jack
and but for me the the cool feature that
we were kind of talking about as we
watch the presentation was hey landscape
orientation for the home screen
knee is a huge deal I think that's
incredibly underrated the camera
obviously is really cool I wish that
they showed us a little bit more
evidence of that low-light performance
there wasn't really any kind of motor
samples comparison that's exactly what
we were talking about like during you we
we don't want to interrupt the keynote
but while we watch it we're always like
just goofing around and talking about
but you've got to show some actual photo
evidence to show us how good this really
is compared to what it was before and
what the competitors are doing with
cameras being such
you know maybe sometimes what will push
you to one phone versus the other we
didn't see any single comparison tonight
I feel like in the past they've shown
photo comparisons before but for this
phone they did not and if the title of
this whole keynote was the camera
reimagined they should have really melt
a section focusing on the camera I would
they did the super slow-mo which was fun
but the actual camera photos which is
what we actually take more of than
slo-moes all the time I think that was a
missed opportunity to maybe they maybe
the results weren't as as telling right
maybe they weren't visually as like oh I
see it as you might they might want to
do if they're touting this as a brand
new feature and me making such a big
deal out of it exactly I mean the thing
is though with low-light photography I
mean there is a clear difference between
a good photo with less and reduced noise
and if they're making such a big deal
about the fact that they're basically I
like it has the ability to do this sort
of 12 frame composite image to kind of
reduce noise and improve image quality
on the back end where all the image
processing is done at the sensor level
rather than through the phone's Ram like
show us some images that can kind of
showcase this it's pretty sick it's
pretty easy it's to show that an image
made like @f 1.6 verse is 1.5 like you
you there is a way I'm sure that you can
make it look impressive I would have
loved you even treated this is cool but
as we were saying you know this is a
feature at 960 frames a second that
we've seen on the Xperia phone before
this is not super new it's only at 720p
so it's not even at 1080p resolution and
sunny for 0.2 seconds so you really have
to make sure that you get that moment
right that you hit it right on the spot
because otherwise you're gonna miss that
shot it's cool it's it's a really
showstopper feature in that respect but
I don't think it's the reason why people
are gonna be bright buying a phone is
for that slow motion feature yeah the
camera stuff was really cool but I again
I wanted to see more I don't know
anything else that's a kind of I'm
piqued your interest Brian on that
prison I think let's see what else are
right oh you know what I did right that
we talked about how much they actually
trolled Apple the problem is that they
don't deliver these trolls properly okay
they like they kind of like throw them
in and the crowd doesn't react at all
and it just falls so flat I to me look
when when Apple has in the past has told
companies they they delivered it with a
little bit of gravitas that made it like
made it humorous and people would laugh
and react like you can't throw down the
hammer and even just train your
employees to go like Oh or like have a
DAB after it just they fall flat but
there were at least four or five there
was the notch
there was the fingerprint sensor troll
that they said about keeping a
fingerprint sensor on a phone there was
the headphone jack troll there a lot so
I thought that stood out but from an
actual presentation standpoint um
Samsung decks pad they didn't really
talk about it that much where I thought
they were they showed more in the leaked
video about the decks pad um than they
did in there I also did embarrassingly
enough to kind of find their AR emojis
fine if you loved bit mo geez these are
like bit motors on acid but I want it to
look like my bitmoji not like something
out of like the Twilight it was very
bizarre it was oh no I mean again and I
did like the fact they didn't make been
an outright make a dig but they're like
oh this works on every platform you can
share the right you you can send it to
an iPhone or your friend has an iPhone I
don't know there's something kind of
weird like their meas but way better
meas yeah like we you know I just
Nintendo means I I was weird about it
that I like I'm just drinking about I
would love to have like a Smackdown so
between an avatar from give me your
bitmoji your Facebook spaces via avatar
like the AR emojis in an emerging on all
of these to go into an arena and fight
what would the parameters be uh how it
you you just want to see them I just
want to see I just think it's just gonna
be so hilarious when you have so many
visual representations of yourselves
like what is gonna happen which one is
gonna win because let's face it bitmoji
at the moment I use way more than
anything else I've got mojo steroids
Spindler steroids but I don't I I wasn't
super impressed by those
they are I know Brian was I definitely
like oh I might actually use those if
they can capture the cloth so we'll see
what happens I want to see but I want to
say though I mean like I know we talked
a lot about how you know this is an
iterative update as sort of not that
much exciting stuff I think the camera
is personally the most exciting I'm one
of them to focus more on it yeah I
wanted this morning but I have to say
like for people that aren't like us you
know we followed this extensively
we pretty much update our phones as soon
as we can you know people that are
coming from say like the s7 the s6 other
Android phones that are older this is
going to be a big jump in them it's
gonna be grateful for let's not
underestimate that I mean we obviously
get really caught up in the specs and
everything like that but I think for
most people this is gonna be a
significant update and something that is
definitely they're gonna be looking at
when they're coming to you know trade up
to a new phone and speaking of the trade
in that three up to three hundred and
fifty dollar trading it's like you
people you keep people in your ecosystem
by doing that
so overall the like they said the
pre-orders they didn't give an official
date the rumors had said the pre-orders
would start on March the 1st but they
did say that the phones will actually go
on sale on March the 16th yes correct
March the 16th also you had the pricing
that are the gates so the s9 will be
seven hundred and twenty dollars in the
US and eight hundred and seventy dollars
for the s9 bus obviously it's gonna vary
depending on carrier but that's kind of
the baseline that you're looking at so
didn't probably noticed not at that
hundred dollar extra rumor that we were
hearing um that's actually a really
great price if you think about it yeah
considering well we have the iPhone at
$9.99 so your time out
$270 difference sorry sorry I'm Asian
and I should know math better than that
but my abacus is broken right now I had
to either move the beads around a little
but yeah 200 that's I mean and it's not
it's not even like a mid-tier phone you
know that's that's quality you're
getting quality I think even from
someone who went from you know when
you're talking about previous phones to
upgrade the cameras gonna blow them away
on the s9 so I think they did what they
had to do I'm sorry for people that
think a new phone has to be great just
by having a new completely new form
factor i I don't subscribe to that
anymore
I'm just kind of I guess I'm kind of
past that point I just gotta wait for
the flexible phone you know it's
foldable phone yes it's coming goes on
your wrist I'm down with that it's
coming so we have something to look
forward to one other thing I wanted to
mention that I think is another
underrated thing is the Dolby Atmos they
kind of mentioned this in the
presentation but seriously if you've
heard Dolby Atmos I mean I know the
razer phone has got it on it onboard
HTC but I've heard it on a huawei mate
and that it's just incredible the sound
quality of that it's coming from
literally like a little tiny strip of
speakers and it sounds like the sound is
coming from all around you so I'm so
excited to see what that sounds like on
s9 you know I love my Dolby Atmos y'all
I complain about it because a certain
person company said they would put it in
their product and they didn't turn fruit
certain fruit company said it would be
an absurd product for television that's
not it's still not there yet I'm waiting
up we'll see we'll see that might be a
bad about yeah you know what so what
we're gonna do before we head out we're
not gonna take calls because guess what
it's Sunday morning and you guys and
