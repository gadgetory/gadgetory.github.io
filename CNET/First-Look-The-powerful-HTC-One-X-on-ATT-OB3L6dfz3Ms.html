and today we're taking a first look at
the HTC One X which is available for 1
99 99 on AT&amp;amp;T if you're a fan of HTC you
know the One X is the flagship handset
in the company's 2012 product line this
version of the One X runs a dual-core
1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 processor
unlike the international model that
comes with a quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3
chip still this phone is plenty fast has
16 gigabytes of RAM and one gigabyte of
ROM the One X also connects to a tee
tees new 4G LTE network for fast data
other goodies include Android 40
Gingerbread and HTC's latest version of
its sense UI version 4 with it's big 4.7
inch 1280 x 720 pixel screen the HTC One
X is a sizable smartphone at 0.36 inch
thick however the device is thin enough
to grip comfortably I also really dig
its futuristic polycarbonate unibody
construction which despite being plastic
has a premium feel it's a big departure
from the usual metal designs HTC
typically uses it reminds me of the
Nokia Lumia 900 another well crafted and
aggressively designed handset on AT&amp;amp;T
above the screen is a 1.3 megapixel
front facing camera below to display are
the three usual Android Ice Cream
Sandwich buttons on the right is a very
slim volume bar while on the left is the
phone's micro USB port on top is the
power button and headphone jack and just
like the other HTC One series phones the
One X features what HTC calls image
sense basically that means the device
has a special processor just for
processing images performs very quickly
and boasts a boatload of scene modes
special settings and filters the
camcorder function also captures video
in full 1080p HD quality and lets you
snap stills while recording two beats
audio processing technology is also on
board as well and will automatically
detect when you connect a beats branded
headset and select a matching
equalizer audio profile now the new HTC
One X isn't all peaches and cream for
instance there's no SD card slot for
extra storage and the battery isn't
removable the device also uses a micro
sim card so you'll have to convert to
the smaller size to swap for an older
phone I'm Brian Bennett and this has
been a first look at the HTC One X 480
