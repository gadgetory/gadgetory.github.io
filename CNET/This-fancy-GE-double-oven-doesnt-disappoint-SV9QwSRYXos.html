appliances and today I'll be reviewing
the GE Profile double electric wall oven
PT 955 0 SF SS at three thousand six
hundred and ninety nine dollars this is
one pricey double oven but you may get
your money's worth because it has a lot
of features and some of them are really
interesting one of them is an LED status
bar that you can actually see from a
distance so you know if your food is
preheated or if it's done cooking it
really acts as another type of timer so
that you can really see how far along
your food is and if that light annoys
you you can turn it off another special
feature that you wouldn't know about
this oven just by looking at it at a
glance is that it's connected to the GE
brilliant app that is a really well
designed app that lets you preheat your
oven you can change the temperature and
you can get an alert when it's done
cooking all from your couch that app
only works with select GE ovens so I
really think that sets this one apart
aside from that it has a ton of features
it has traditional and convection modes
you can broil you can roast you can do
pretty much anything you'd ever want to
do in an oven and as far as performance
this double oven also excelled so we
broiled ham we roasted chickens and we
baked a bunch of biscuits in this oven
and it consistently did a very very good
job it may not be the best chicken the
best ham the best biscuits in the world
but it's a great oven one word of
caution if you're baking with multiple
racks stick with convection mode I
definitely think this oven is worth the
$36.99 if you love to cook and you're
really excited about trying out all of
the special features it has to offer
thanks for watching I'm Megan Willerton
