cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up a
lightweight alienware laptop a sneak
peek at windows vista and something
called HD radio but first the in motion
I am 500 travel speakers for the ipod
nano this thing is extremely thin see
how thin that is look at that it's 0.67
inches thick not quite razor thin but
definitely thin enough to sort of stick
in your backpack or no show off to your
friends like this stay guest then the IM
500 also comes with an auxiliary port so
you can plug in other music players as
well next up a portable gaming laptop
from alienware the area 51 m 5 550 like
a lot of the other alienware as we've
seen this one also has a really lovely
display with a glossy finish that helps
colors pop this one is actually 15.4
inches which is just about on the border
line in terms of portability otherwise
alienware keeps it really simple there
are just a few application quick launch
keys above the keyboard as well as two
square speakers on either side you can
also turn off the track pad mouse to
keep it from being accidentally bumped
while you're wildly gesticulating during
your PowerPoint presentation that's what
you need this laptop for PowerPoint
we've been playing around with the
release candidate one for Windows Vista
Robert vamos he tells us about the
different options for networking in the
forthcoming OS the choices are home
which should be the most secure work
which means that you have a network
administrator and probably need some
file sharing and public which would be
an internet cafe or public Wi-Fi this is
the least secure of the three Vista will
also have an IM suppression function for
when you project your desktop up onto a
big screen no more embarrassing
questions popping up from your spouse
during your big presentation did you buy
the be no like I told you honey finally
Brian Cooley explains how HD radio works
using the new BMW m6 as an example you
go into the FM or the am areas you're
going to see some stations show up with
that HD logo right alongside them that
means you're tuned to the same
frequency you would normally use to get
that station but the car is detecting
it's got an HD digital signal on the
same frequency it makes am sound like FM
it makes FM sound like satellite radio
Brian did warn that when you're in a
mountainous area for instance the radio
will constantly flip back and forth
between HD radio and then normal radio
and back again kind of annoying that's
it for this edition of road warrior I'm
Tom Merritt check back next time for
more gadgets that keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
