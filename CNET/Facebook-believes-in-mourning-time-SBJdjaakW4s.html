the charge in the employee benefits
department base with announced it has
extended the length of the bereavement
period for employees who have lost a
loved one and flexible leave time to
care for a sick family member employees
can now take up to 20 days off to mourn
an immediate family member 10 days offer
an extended member and up to six weeks
off to care for a family member in need
this is twice as much as before and way
more than most private companies that
allocate just a few days if any for this
type of need the new policy went into
effect January first but was publicly
announced this week by company's chief
operating officer Sheryl Sandberg during
the makers conference in California the
matter of bereavement hits especially
close to home for Sandberg who lost her
husband unexpectedly in 2015 I was
grateful every day to work for a company
that provides bereavement leave and
flexibility I needed both to start my
recovery she said in her facebook post
tech companies like Facebook Google and
Netflix have been longtime advocates of
improving workers benefits to attract
more talent in addition to free food and
fancy work spaces they offer better
health care options and more paid
maternity and paternity leave up to one
year in the case of Netflix in her
message Sandberg also encouraged other
companies to follow suit and support
America's family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
