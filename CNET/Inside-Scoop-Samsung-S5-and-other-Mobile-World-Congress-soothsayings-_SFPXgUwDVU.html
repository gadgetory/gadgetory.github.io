I'm cnet's carboy joined by cnet senior
editor Jessica dual court we are talking
about the Mobile World Congress coming
up in Barcelona and everyone is
expecting a big announcement from
Samsung that they're going to release
the galaxy s5 absolutely we already
pretty much know that's going to happen
and that is basically the highlight of
the show at this point what is one thing
that you would really like to see out of
this new iteration of the galaxy I'd
like to see a really dramatic design
change we've had a lot of the same
Universal looking rounded corner very
plasticky look and feel Samsung's try to
increase the premium feel of that a
little bit by adding a little silver
around the ridge but what I want to see
is something really beautiful and finely
crafted more along the lines of what you
get with the HTC One or even the iPhone
5s I'd also love to see personally the
power button removed from the side to
the top it's such a small thing but I
carry these things around all the time
and my purse most lean even with a
dedicated purse pocket the thing turns
itself on all the time so either let's
stiffen up that button or let's just
move it to the top yeah okay so besides
like a hardware overhaul what else what
about the guts of the phone what do you
need to see performance wise well we're
definitely going to see a step up in
specs so it's going to have a very fast
we're expecting quad-core processor
something along the lines of the 16
megapixel camera a very good front
facing camera as far as these things go
so what we're expecting is the screen is
going to be something called 2k you can
think of it as ultra HD so the pixels
are just going to be crammed right in
there it will be absolutely gorgeous as
first the size goes you know probably
about the 5 inch mark could be a little
bit bigger but they don't want to
encroach on the galaxy note territory by
making it too big and what about
fingerprint scanners a lot of new phones
have them do you think Samsung will hop
on board that's definitely the rumor and
I would expect it especially because
Apple has that with the iphone 5s there
are a couple different implementations
we've seen scanners on the back of the
phone before and that's been around for
several years but not really implemented
well the problem is in order for it to
be useful it really needs to work
correctly all the time it needs to be
easy to find it needs to be accurate to
use so Apple kind of has a lock on
putting the fingerprint scanner on the
home button not really sure if Samsung
is going to attempt
to do that maybe encounter some legal
battles along the way or we could see it
on the back like you get with something
like the HTC One max the s4 is a very
popular phone all these rumors that
you're hearing about the s5 does it add
up enough to be competitive in that
high-end space with whether it is the
iphone or other androids on the market
absolutely I think Samsung excels at
checking off all of the boxes that need
to be done so usually i think that the
specs are very very good what I think
the phone sometimes has lacked in the
past is a little bit of soul or sex
aphelion yeah exactly but the Samsung is
just an absolute advertising juggernaut
they pummel everybody else around the
world so I think that the phone will
sell it has to sell as long as there's
nothing wrong with it it will sell and
there will be nothing really wrong with
it now is it going to be a beautiful
amazing device I sure hope so but that's
something that we've got to see when it
actually comes out galaxy s5 any
thoughts on it having a curved screen I
know we sort of seen that emerging out
there in the smartphone market right I
don't think we're going to see anything
deeply curved like we did on the samsung
galaxy round which is Korea only or on
the LG G flex which is available in the
u.s. so I think it's possible that the
actual glass or screen on top could have
a slight curve to it like we've seen in
the past I'm not entirely certain that
the OLED display underneath is going to
be curbed so I don't think we're going
to see that really deep arch so the s5
announcement is what you think will be
the highlight of the Mobile World
Congress but what else are we going to
see from the show now one other thing
that we're going to be paying a lot of
attention to so actually phones for
emerging markets because this is where
the battle is really going to be fought
in 2014 we've got players like Lenovo
that bought up us Motorola and some
others as well you've got nokia shifting
under microsoft so i think the question
is going to be now that you know a lot
of developed nations are really
saturated when it comes to smartphones
that's people mostly replacing what they
already have the next phase is getting
the hearts and minds of people who are
moving from their first smartphone or
maybe moving from an entry-level
smartphone into sort of the next model
so for these companies they're going to
be targeting these markets so lots of
keep our eyes out for the stands to
announcement and then all these other
trends and mobile that you mentioned
thank you so much Jessica Doyle court on
cars too boy thanks for watching the
