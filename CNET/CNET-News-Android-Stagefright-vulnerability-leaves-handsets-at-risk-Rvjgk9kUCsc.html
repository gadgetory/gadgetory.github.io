operating system may affect millions of
users according to researchers at mobile
security firms imperium an attacker
could take control of a device and gain
access to information on the handset the
vulnerability is found in stage fright
androids media playback tool one example
of an attack is via text message
depending on the messaging app you use
you don't have to open the message for
your device to be compromised the
attacker can send an especially crafted
MMS file that is automatically being
parsed and then the phone will be
infected it can also be triggered via
other means like a browser it can be
triggered to be a chrome or firefox so
whenever you go to any website that has
this specific vulnerability Google was
notified of the vulnerability a few
months ago a Google spokesperson said
the security of Android users is
extremely important to us so we've
already responded quickly to this issue
by sending the fix for all Android
devices to our partners
unlike Apple's mobile operating system
iOS updates to the Android platform are
distributed through wireless carriers
and phone manufacturers it's then up to
them to push out updates to users so
Android users could stop using all
messaging apps on their phones but
that's very unlikely so essentially we
need to wait for the patches to come out
for now simpie reom says that it doesn't
believe anyone is exploiting the
security flaw
Google also makes its applications run
in something called a sandbox which
limits and apps access to anything
outside of itself the security firm
suggests Android users update to the
latest version although that doesn't
guarantee the patch has been applied in
