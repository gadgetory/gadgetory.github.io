fit in your pocket it's called the lucid
cab and it has two cameras two
microphones and it's capturing a 180
degree stereoscopic VR image what you
can do is once you captured the photo or
video by switching this switch at the
top of the camera import it into your
phone using Wi-Fi now I do have a little
bit of trouble importing using the
dedicated app and the Wi-Fi here at CES
it's a very busy mall there's lots of
network connectivity issues so I did
have to step outside to get it to work
eventually I've managed to pull off the
footage and it's pretty impressive it's
just a point-and-shoot there's no
exposure controls anything like that
once you have it in the app you can also
view the 2d or the 3d object and
navigate around like you would in a
normal VR headset there is also an
optional case that you can buy so you
can watch that 2d and 3d content using
the case as well I did find there was a
little orientation issue though when I
did shoot some of the stuff myself so
hopefully that will be ironed out by the
time it comes out to consumers in the
second quarter of 2017
and it will cost four hundred dollars
which is a little bit pricey because
it's only giving you 180 degree field of
view but you can put a couple of these
back to back for a more full 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
