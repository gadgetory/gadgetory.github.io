to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple believe it
or not the 10th anniversary iPhone will
likely cost more than a thousand dollars
after a new report from Fast Company and
that might sound crazy at first but you
know what I believe it
the current iPhone 7 plus with 256 gigs
of storage already costs 969 before tax
and we're not talking about the new
rumored iPhone 7s that will be released
in the current 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch
screen sizes this is the rumoured 5.8
inch phone with an OLED screen and a
metal frame that we're talking about now
you have to love the part where fast
company says some people believe Apple
will call it the far cooler sounding
iPhone X mm now I wonder what weekly
Apple Show on CNET said that they should
call the iPhone experts oh yeah this one
but it's not like we were serious we're
just making things up and that's how
rumors get started now the report says
it will look like a smooth black
monolith that matches up with Johnny
I've dreamed of making the iPhone look
like a single sheet of glass
the report says Apple is working hard to
remove the physical home button from the
front and have it rest under the glass
and there's a chance the physical
buttons on the side of the phone may go
away replaced by touch sensitive ones on
the metal frame now Fast Company also
says Apple has been working with Lou
mentum to bring 3d sensing technology to
the new phone that can be used for face
sensing to unlock the phone or could be
part of an augmented reality application
but it was not specific this sounds all
nice and dandy but I want to know from
Apple by nation if this is true
are you all willing to get the Premium
Edition iPhone if it cost over $1000
yeah tweet me a Brian Tong or email us
at the alpha-beta cnet.com and we'll
feature your responses in next week's
show okay references the next-gen
MacBook Pros have been discovered in the
Mac OS 10 point 12 point 4 beta release
the developers Apple blog Pyke's
Universum found a trio of motherboard
identifiers that don't match up with any
current macbook pro model and they never
existed in previous versions of Mac OS
Sierra the blog then cross
reference the motherboard identifier
with kb lake processors that will most
likely be used in the new models now see
this list there's a lot to take in here
and some of you weren't too happy that I
told you to wait for the 2017 MacBook
Pros but I still stand by my words think
about this KB Lake better battery life
32 gig Ram support and better touch bar
support is coming this fall dongles
optional and plenty of you have been
waiting for the beats X headphones to
drop and according to Apple they'll be
available on February the 10th we've
been waiting for them for a while and
there were actually the first designed
with the help of Apple engineers that
includes the amazing w1 chip a physical
remote control and magnetic earbuds with
sound that really has more oomph than
Apple's air pods for a cheaper 149 price
point I think the long delay really was
because they didn't want it to compete
directly with the air pods now look the
tech is the same but it has more
functionality at a lower price point and
arguably a better design
CNET reports gray and blue colors will
also be coming soon after they go on
sale in black and white so we'll keep
your eyes on that now the Apple TV is
still buried in that group of others in
Apple's reports that include the Apple
watch but maybe that will soon change
bloomberg reports Apple has hired
Timothy twiddle the general manager and
director of Amazons fire TV to now be
the vice president in charge of Apple TV
product marketing now the previous Apple
TV lead pete dis that will focus on
securing media content deals we know the
Apple TV has seen minor software
improvements and like many things
recently it's been a nice upgrade if
you're an Apple loyalists but it's
really been nothing great even at their
recent earnings report the Apple TV was
blamed for Apple's other category
decline now that Apple trails in the
exclusive content game come on it's time
to up their game and make an Apple TV
that's a gotta have box beyond just
people in the Apple ecosystem alright in
some quick bytes NFC world reports Apple
pay is now the most common mobile
payment platform accepted by 36% of
merchants it was only at 16% a year ago
but see it's made some huge strides
now PayPal is second at 34 percent and
MasterCard PayPass is at 25 percent also
MacBook Pro touch bar integration is
coming soon a
Word PowerPoint and Excel for the Mac if
you can't wait you can jump on board
with the office insider beta program
that just released an update including
the touch bar integration and in a
follow-up from last week uh fix is
coming to the LG's ultra-fine 27-inch 5k
display that was flickering and freezing
when it's close to a wireless router LG
told recode they will fix the problem by
inserting additional shielding into
newly manufactured models and existing
ones will be retrofitted with the same
enhanced shielding so you know what good
Apple for taking care of that all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
you can email us at the Apple by
Tennessee Netcom or tweet me at Brian
song and let us know are you down with a
1000 plus dollar iPhone thanks so much
for watching I will catch y'all next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
