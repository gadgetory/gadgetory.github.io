bring you a microwave buying guide so
one of the first things you want to
think about when you're deciding to buy
a new microwave is where you're going to
put it there are three main options the
most popular type of microwave is a
countertop microwave like this one here
this is by far the easiest type of
microwave to install you just plug it
into an outlet and you can put it
anywhere on your counter the second most
popular type of microwave is the over
the range microwave it's pretty
self-explanatory but it sits over your
range and actually doubles as an oven
hood the third type of microwave is a
custom built-in job that can go anywhere
from drawers to cabinets the next thing
you want to think about is what size
microwave you should get this isn't only
important when you're deciding if it'll
fit on your countertop or above your
range but also if the food you cook
regularly will fit the sizes can range
anywhere from under a cubic foot to
above two cubic feet but most microwaves
it's somewhere in the middle around one
and a half cubic feet if you're still
not sure what size microwave would work
best in your kitchen you can always
bring in a plate or bowl that you use
regularly just to make sure that it will
fit another thing that's pretty
important to consider is the wattage
that's the amount of power that's
running to your microwave the wattage
can range anywhere from around 600 to
1200 and sometimes over generally the
more wattage your microwave has the more
quickly and evenly it'll cook your food
now let's talk about the basic features
that most microwaves have that includes
the popcorn setting a potato setting
reheat defrost most microwaves today
have those presets and they're really
easy to use some of the more expensive
models though are getting a bit more
fancy some of them incorporate
convection heating or even inverter
heating another neat feature that some
microwaves have today is a sensor the
sensor detects the amount of moisture in
the food and it will decide when it's
done automatically as far as style
microwaves generally come in white black
or a stainless steel finish some of them
are incorporating LCD dials and screens
but it's still pretty uncommon as far as
price microwaves can vary widely from
say 50 dollars on up to five thousand
dollars for a custom built-in microwave
for 50 bucks you're going to get a
really basic microwave but for five
grand you better expect something really
fancy
unfortunately microwave technology is
still pretty simple there isn't much as
far as smart technology or Wi-Fi
connectivity like we're seeing in some
other appliances today this has been a
microwave buying guide I'm Megan molar
