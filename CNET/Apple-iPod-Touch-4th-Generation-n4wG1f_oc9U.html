taking a first look at the
fourth-generation Apple iPod Touch a
CNET editors choice for three years in a
row this isn't a radical departure from
the iPod Touch we know and love but
there are some noticeable improvements
in terms of price you're looking at
three different models and a gabite 32
gig and 64 gig version price at 229 299
and 399 all the hardware features from
the previous versions have been
preserved you still have a 3.5 inch
capacitive touchscreen only now it's
using Apple's higher resolution Retina
display there's a home button on the
bottom a screen lock at the top though
now the button is shifted from the left
to the right and you have controls for
volume on the side here but there are
now two different distinct buttons
instead of one single rocker switch on
the bottom you have a headphone jack a
dock connection and a teeny tiny speaker
grille if you take a look at the back
you'll notice two things first the
chrome steel doesn't bulge out quite as
much as the previous version giving a
slightly thinner profile a lighter feel
and the ability to lay flat on the table
without wobbling but the really big
change is the camera lens up here at the
top along with this little
omnidirectional microphone this is an HD
video camera that can capture 720p
footage at 30 frames per second just
like the iPhone you can use the built-in
editor to trim your video clips or spend
an extra $4.99 on iMovie app with more
advanced features the camera takes still
frames too but the camera quality isn't
nearly as good as the iPhone 4 now if
that weren't enough Apple is also giving
you another video camera on the front
with a lower resolution you can use this
same camera for snapping self-portraits
but its main purpose is for making video
calls using Apple's FaceTime app by
using email addresses instead of phone
numbers you can make free video calls
over Wi-Fi to other compatible iPhones
or iPod Touches it's a cool feature it
works well and Apple puts the new app
right here at the top of the menu under
the hood you have a few significant
improvements which have trickled over
from the iPhone 4
getting an a4 processor and a gyroscope
sensor for detailed 3-axis motion
control in games and other apps you also
have support for 802 11 and Wi-Fi and
existing support for Bluetooth 2.1
compare it against the iPhone 4 you
don't get the phone the 5 megapixel
camera GPS or a 3G data connection but
you also don't have to deal with
contracts the rest of the iPod Touch is
just as you'd expect the core apps for
email web browsing music photos and
video are all better than ever under iOS
for you now the new ability to rent TV
shows games look and perform better than
ever with the internal mic you no longer
need a microphone headset or an adapter
to take advantage of audio recording or
the voice memo app and some third-party
camera and video apps now work as well
so that's the fourth generation Apple
iPod touch if you've been waiting to
make an upgrade I really feel that the
two cameras the FaceTime calling and all
the little performance tweaks really
makes this year's model worthwhile for
