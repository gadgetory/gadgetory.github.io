calm this book cover is judging you and
if it determines you are judging it with
a silly look on your stupid face it will
not let you read it the cover that
judges you is an experiment by Thea's
bierce Dekker of Amsterdam based
creative agency more and was designed to
fit over other books the book has a
built in camera with facial recognition
software and in our dwee no board
connected to an arm that keeps the book
locked if it likes the look on your face
it will open for injunction bhutva is
clever and then the little Audrey no
power look of a cheetah if it doesn't
like your face it will remain locked so
obviously the message here is don't
judge a book by its cover
and if I'm overexcited I don't at the
end this USB thumb drive is literally a
USB thumb drive Canadian photographer
Justin Paulson made the thumb drives as
part of a promotional mailer for his
creative skills that contained a message
suggesting that Paulson can help make
clients stick out like a sore thumb
well he got craves attention Polson used
the mold of his own thumb and embedded
working USB drives into them finishing
off each drive with a careful and creepy
paint job that is very realistic make
sure you check out craves photo gallery
of the thumb drives
NASA's Administrator Charles Bolden said
Monday that the Space Agency is planning
a mission to Jupiter's ice-covered moon
Europa which could depart in the early
2020s in his annual State of NASA
address Bolden said looking to the
future we're planning a mission to
explore Jupiter's fascinating moon
Europa selecting instruments this spring
and moving toward the next phase of our
work Europa is being targeted because
scientists believe that under the icy
shell of its surface lies a massive
ocean which could lead us to discovering
the building blocks for life much like
the Curiosity rover did on Mars recently
nASA has been testing a mission concept
called Europa clipper currently under
development by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory the Europa clipper would be
sent into orbit around Jupiter on a path
that would allow it to fly close to
Europa using scientific instruments to
determine if the hidden ocean might be
an environment that could host life
