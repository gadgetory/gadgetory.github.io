something akin to here's an orange sink
ticket to Guantanamo luckily in the last
few years car makers have started to
make the second row a lot less like
going to prison
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five rear
seat innovations now my innovations I'm
not talking about your awkward fumblings
back on dates in high school rather the
ways that car makers have taken tech to
the second row and made it more than
just a place to sit for a minute I'm
gonna rank these by their everyday
usefulness because we've seen just about
all of them here at scenic number five a
rear cooler
sure you can use one of these to keep a
can of Red Bull cold but don't these
really say booze to you especially since
they only really show up on kind of
quasi limos now as you can't open the
boozy contents of a cooler Legally
anywhere in the US this would seem to be
of low utility but they are a crowd
pleaser number four
climate control in the back seat and
many cars have had a backseat sort of
third zone some split that into two
zones for quad zone but that's still
mostly sharing the main HVAC system the
newest wrinkle is a separate AC system
just for the rear on some pretty
high-end cars but I still rank this kind
of low because it's kind of BS I mean
the car remains a small undivided space
eventually all the air goes to all the
seats number three a Wi-Fi hotspot now
most of our mobile devices today have
their own connection to the Internet or
can bum one off the other device but for
a number of tablets and laptops this can
be cool add in the fact that General
Motors is about to make it common on
most of its cars and power it with 4G
and you may have just lost your last
excuse to take a break from work number
two rear seat entertainment now
I'm no fan of those dopey dual DVD
headrest rigs but let's face it they
aren't there for elegant execution
they're there for parental sanity so
they do have their purpose but the most
interesting systems today have really
wide screens and let you plumb in your
portable as a source instead of just
relying on those antique optical discs
now we're talking
before I get to number one here's one
great backseat innovation that touches
all the rest and that is great rear seat
control panels back in 2004 when they
revised the Jag xji spotted the
breakthrough here really sophisticated
controls flash forward now to the latest
Bentley Flying Spur for example with
this cool detachable wireless controller
that even connects to front-row tech one
day the best tech in the car might be in
the back the number one in cabin tech
innovation you will use a lot is recline
massage this is number one because back
seats have always been purgatory with
cramped room and no adjustments to make
the most of what little you have
adjustable rear seats used to be
formerly the domain solely of super high
dollar cars my box and stretch two LSE's
but now you can fly a ride in comfort in
a Hyundai Equus with the same technology
now I've never understood massage seats
personally but I seem to be the odd man
out there so I'll give those a tip of my
hat and now they can have shiatsu
massage and all kinds of crazy stuff for
more tech innovations like these go to
see net on cars.com where it's all about
high-tech cars and modern driving i'm
