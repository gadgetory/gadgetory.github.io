temperature of tap water or a blowtorch
this is more of the latter let's drive
the 2013 Ford Focus ST and check the
tech
now the all-new st is called that
because it's built on the all-new focus
this is now a global car no more of that
envy of the cooler when they get in
England or somewhere some visual cues
for the spotter the Aston Martin desk
front mouth the big y spoke alloy wheels
and nice low stance subtle but effective
body kit the twinned outlet exhaust in
that tidy rump those are among the most
obvious cues as are these Recaro sports
seats these guys are real narrow try
them before you order them look at these
bolsters real deep and so narrow it's
like they're meant for sitting sideways
not facing forward these are not
flexible or adjustable they really grab
you in there I kind of barely fit
luckily these are also available in all
black you don't have to suffer the
indignity of yellow or blue inserts now
you'll recognize my Ford touch up here
on the optional 8 inch color LCD this is
part of a package and unless I'm
imagining things Ford's definitely been
working on optimizing the touch response
that's one of the biggest gripes folks
have had about this system is that it's
a little too slow or it doesn't get it
every time that seems to be improving
quite a bit even from a few months ago
but you know what's really interesting
about my Ford touch that people don't
always realize it's not so much about
what's on the screen but what's around
it this is what I've noticed driving a
lot of forward cars depending on these
bezels and how deeply this thing is
inset and whether your hand is going to
bump into this stuff that dramatically
changes its usefulness because notice
what they do they use every inch around
the perimeter of the screen there are
very few places where they don't go
right to the edge with things and the
buttons are fairly small so precise hand
on contact is critical but look if
you've got this plastic stuff here
getting in your way or if it's too far
to reach even for a long arm guy like me
that ends up being a bigger problem than
what's actually on the screen and of
course sync always has great array of
sources from satellite radio optical
discs USB bluetooth streaming SD card
really well option for that kind of
thing but notice a couple of these are
options HD radio
have to option in and the same thing
goes for satellite radio beyond that
we're talking pretty standard focus
cabin stuff high trim focus cabin stuff
great materials all around I think this
is different though on the esti that
eyebrow display of three performance
gauges oil temperature on the Left turbo
boost and your oil pressure that's
unique to this trim level of course oh
this is new little street signs floating
in mid-air instead of some of those
tortured diagonal reading lines of font
this is very good at a glance and
finally this little screen here in the
middle is very simple on this car it
doesn't have all these elaborate
different layers of how you can set the
vehicle up it's basically a glorified
trip odometer at no point are you going
to be able to get an ST that is really
kind of stripped or bare-bones and
that's an interesting part of the story
this vehicles got real hot hatch cred
but at all times it's a very civilized
focus
at the end of the ST engine bay where
things are very interesting now under
here lies a two liter inline
four-cylinder all aluminum engine that
is very similar in its architecture to
any old garden-variety Focus
it's got direct injection and turbo
charging you're thinking oh that's an
EcoBoost motor but they pervert it in
this formula and that's good for us they
tune it for performance as opposed to
efficiency so that means numbers of 252
on the horsepower that's about a hundred
more than a bass focus to 70 on the
torque that's 124 more foot-pounds these
are life-changing numbers folks zero to
60 in about six point six seconds front
wheel drive only by the way and the mpg
while well down from an EcoBoost car
isn't bad 23:32 for a hot little hatch
sanim a nice performance from wheel
drive car is usually this wheel hop the
front end comes up the front wheels get
all pigeon-toed it all starts to spin
and kind of go nowhere and then it
finally bites and shatters left and
right it's a real undignified mess this
is our doesn't really exhibit much of
that
it's doing rather well
electronically-controlled front
differentials as I mentioned front-wheel
drive only on this car there's no sort
of all-wheel drive rally version yet
why on the sestina is how there is and I
rarely say this no turbo lag I'm not
finding any you can actually read it in
the boost gauge when you tip in there is
boost there immediately but most
importantly you feel it in the vehicle
dynamics this is also a fun car whoa to
toss it is very nicely turning on Center
it's just dialed in that way I don't
know if you can hear that very well but
this car has one of the great engine
notes in an affordable car different
than exhaust note any car can be allowed
it's much harder to get an engine to
sound good most manufacturers just kind
of cover it up hope it all goes away but
this car has a great engine note when
you get on it and then it's very quiet
when you're off it so it can be an
everyday car now controversially you can
only get this car with a 6-speed manual
the purists the driving enthusiast will
say well of course the Nestea but in
this day and age that's limiting sales
there's no two ways about it
so I would be surprised if they get like
a sport automatic or a dual clutch
really on this car in the succeeding
model year that would make sense to me
it's a good transmission nice clutch
engagement nothing too lighter rubbery
the throws on the gearbox are a little
long for my tastes but the engagement is
real clean and positive
let's price this 2013 st base is twenty
four five delivered but you're not quite
seen that style yet you got to add
twenty four hundred bucks for the in
elegantly named package 201a that gets
you HD radio satellite radio the eight
inch LCD with myford touch kind of want
that ten speaker Sony audio dual zone
automatic temperature control and those
Recaro seats now for another twenty two
hundred bucks you can get the navigation
as part of a package but note that you
can all a cart that navigation by just
buying an SD card from the Ford dealer I
think I would do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
