articles just got a whole lot more
visual thanks to a cool new website
britain's first sci-fi film has been
restored and re-released and we're gonna
tell you how you can see it and a very
clever enthusiast has figured out how to
use a DSLR camera to see exoplanets oh
cool that's pretty awesome too
exoplanets tomorrow daily
grading system yet welcome to tomorrow
daily the best geek talk show in the
known universe I'm your host Ashley
skillet join me as always kill anonymous
real quick forget the stories every
single time there's that break that
little intro break with the music as she
always says a joke I have to do my heart
is not till like laughing yeah bag we
need to say your face is an exoplanet
but I know that began amine and weird
dad jokes alright so but enough of that
let's hit the headlines okay so i came
across this website and i thought it was
really cool what they did with it so
this there are 4.6 million English
entries in Wikipedia their sport for
there's over 4.6 million and this French
computer science student named Owen
kornek launched this website called wiki
galaxy and what it is is it's a visual
representation check out this video of
Wikipedia or at least a hundred thousand
wikipedia articles what as if it were
space so here's that's what it looks
like that's the visualization of a
hundred thousand wikipedia articles that
you can navigate through as if you're
flying through space whoa it is really
really cool and so yeah it's it kind of
a three-dimensional you can do like kind
of these fly throughs and when you click
on a particular star that's a topic so
you it's a topic and so you click on it
and on the website you get to see the
Wikipedia article on the left and then
there's related articles on the right
and the really cool part that I like is
that once you click on a few different
things you know how sometimes you fall
into the black hole of Wikipedia yes
just like you fall into a black hole of
YouTube now it's literal and so now it's
literal you could actually like fall
into a black hole of Wikipedia online
and the really neat part is is you can
click on your history and it'll show it
to you as if it was a constellation like
it connects all the dots that you were
checking out I surely that's amazing and
so there's only a hundred thousand
wikipedia articles in there right now
yeah but he says it's in beta uh-huh but
when it goes gold so when it launches
officially it's gonna have every he
wants to have every wicked PD article is
he looking for money I don't know what
the endgame
here I think it's just a really cool I
mean he said he is a computer science
student and I think this is just a
really great cool project that he's
launching I don't know that he would be
able to monetize it cuz Wikipedia also
doesn't they don't make any money
donations run so uh two questions for
you okay first one have you tried it
yeah I tried it this morning and early
results I just randomly like zoomed in
and clicked on the first thing I saw and
it was a gambling and then and then on
the right I saw it was you know
blackjack and poker and there was all
these different types of gambling and
then there was also like loan sharking
and like just you know random things
that are related okay and then you click
on those it takes you to the nearest
like they're they're clustered pretty
close together and then they also have
like sort of kind of sections of the
wiki galaxy that are set up to where
it's like oh here's this collection of
things that all kind of go together
what's really neat I mean it's really
fun to check out and play with if you
have second question hey does tomorrow
daily have a Wikipedia page I don't
believe so no we don't have a reddit
either in case anybody was feeling crazy
like that I don't okay season you don't
have Wikipedia pages we have to invent
something that's true well and also I
mean listen you guys like we're not
we're not weirdo self-promoters and we
know the rules of reddit likes going too
far absolutely cannot start on yeah I
know you this is against the rules of
reddit but if anybody else wanted to
because you loved the show so much I
mean I would visit think about you could
be the king of tomorrow daily the reddit
pain the mayor just like Foursquare you
check in so many times you're the mayor
of the tomorrow daily reddit yeah and
that's where you can push your font
ography yeah your photog rafiq post
links I article ideas this is got a
stuck pig it anyway I'm stuff I mean
it's all hypothetical of course let me
tell you about message from Mars okay I
want to hear about this is this is a
story that I have for you today message
for Mars is message to markets are
better it's a letter that I got no I
think it's met a message from Mars
growing growing address yes message from
our sorry the lower third says message
to Mars is the oldest British
full-length sci-fi movie Oh from 1913
now Wow look at the story here is
they've restored it and released it for
free so you can watch this they restored
it from two shorter editions and one
that was tinted so it's it's pretty
impressive that they're able to restore
it the story is it's kind of like a
christmas carol it's about a Martian
exiled to earth with the mission to
change the heart of a selfish man and
this is according to British films the
ghost of Martian pass yes yeah so the
BFI national archive and dragon digital
work together restore the movie think
from the two shorter films of all I know
if anything if you're if you're a sci-fi
fan it's always great to see how they
what they thought of sci-fi in the past
yeah well there's always social comics
travel like there's all kinds of
transference there's all kinds of like
really for the time like very radical
concepts of what Martians would be like
like I just think that's really neat
yeah and you remember the one was it
mission to the moon or whatever where
the the spacer was the reason I the moon
landing oh yeah i forgot the that was a
good one as a good cooperate was
extended edition yeah but anyway so
through the if you're in the UK you can
go to the website and check that out for
free give us a review if you do on you
know somewhere yeah here's the thing
guys we can't we cuz we cannot see it
over here there's no we don't have the
like region there's region restrictions
so so we can't see it let us know how it
is I sure watch Doctor Who on the
internet via BBC you like you can't yeah
unless you're in the UK they're like
sorry might I think that's a sure no I
know guess Australia oh you do not on
that yeah I think you're just discussing
our love of British accent oh no yeah
I'm so hard about we see always had
British children's sounds smarter than
us already yeah yeah um but yeah I'm
sure some some you know motivated
characters on the internet probably
already figured out a way around the
region I would love to see it yeah but
yeah I'm starving so you see it let us
know that's like an I apologize for my
terrible terrible impression you know
what that's what you get here into our
daily terrible impressions and
kasim don't remember that a geek stuff
is great third let me tell you about
this guy so in the spirit of DIY as we
were discussing yesterday this guy also
got really creative his name is David
Schneider and he wrote up this really
great how-to on creating an exoplanet
detector that does not require a
high-powered telescope or a research
grade detector which is DIY yeah she's
pretty great um and he actually he
posted this whole video on I eee
spectrum which is great and he's
explaining like how we detect exoplanets
which is we look at a SAR and then a lot
of times an exoplanet will cross
directly in front of that star and
that's how we know it's there because
the light from the star gets dimmer and
then that's how we sort of know that
something is crossed around and if it's
you know cyclical if it's in orbit then
we know it's probably an exoplanet so
kind of neat so this guy took his canon
rebel XS DSLR which is not exactly a
super high power DSLR it's kind of older
camera he picked up a 300 millimeter
Nikon telephoto lens on ebay for about a
hundred bucks like a little less than
hard bucks an adapter for the lens for
17 bucks and then instead of buying an
expensive star tracker which is what
he's showing right now is what he ended
up building which is kind of this it's
kind of barn doors that sort of change
shape and he built this with some
plywood and some other hardware like
gears from an inkjet printer a driver
board an Arduino and like a few other
things and so it keeps up with so here's
that's without tracking and then that's
with so you can see obviously like you
have to be able to track the movement of
our planet so that you can get clear
pictures of the stars so then what he
did was he specifically there is a star
the one that they're showing right now
which is eight star HD 189733 we already
know there's an exoplanet their crosses
in front of that star and so he wanted
to see if he could actually detect that
exoplanet with this rig that he set up
so here's his calculations here and you
can see there's a dip in brightness so
on the side you can see relative
magnitude it does dip because almost
exactly what you would detect it was 28
to like the
a difference is in brightness is it
almost exactly what the actual
difference is officially from things
like high-powered telescopes oh yeah he
built it himself he was inspired he saw
somebody else do something similar and
said gosh what if i took my DSLR and
started looking for exoplanets pretty
awesome yeah that's pretty cool is he a
teacher or something uh uh you know I'm
not sure um but he's uh he's just like I
mean from what I saw in the video he's
just he's super enthusiastic about um
you know stargazing and he really wanted
to see it just if he could do it which I
always like I like this like I'm just
gonna do this to see if I can yeah I
recommend you check out the video cuz he
explains it really well what an
exoplanet is yeah yeah he does he he
really liked and he walks you through
the entire build in life you haven't
screwing it out with the pumpkins yeah
that's a plan when those pumpkin grows
on ya know he's greatness yeah it's
awesome those his teacher um I should
mention we forgot our hashtag of the day
what is it was just a really good one
our question of the day our hashtag days
TD sci-fi tease that fine okay and the
question is if you could like remaster
or even reboot a sci-fi movie before
nineteen eighty what would it be yes let
me think of that one you never think
about it yeah i would say i would want
to see x i'm a sucker for like 1950s be
like sci-fi movies yeah so i'd have to
say like attack of the 50 foot woman
okay i have to go with like that's
pretty good or attack of the killer
tomatoes or i think i think that would
be great it's just restored not being
remade i don't i wanted to go with
reboot honestly like restored into like
4k like if we could just restore a nice
old sci-fi like what would it be I'm
metropolis oh that's a really good thing
my beacon I guess I'm they just like
restored it or whatever yeah I think
they like okay I'd go with the classics
I'll go with a remake but my candy yeah
Andy remake so that's not like screwed
up by the machine yeah by the man the
expedia I mean I ruin it let's give it
to the man who ruin it yeah I can make
it ND put it to like make it mobile
court all right come on okay mumblecore
metropolis that's what we're getting out
of the show today we're gonna take a
quick break we'll be right back

releases this week and then your user
feedback so don't click away sera daily
welcome back welcome back to the show we
have returns um you know I feel really
bad for that TIE fighter that crashed
into the highway in Germany just what a
tragedy I'll get insurance uh yeah
that's true I guess the Empire is
probably pretty well insured damn that
probably guys probably gonna get forced
choked or so man what a great dashcam

I love this show so much um okay so
let's talk about elite dangerous this is
finally out this is uh it's available
today for pc and this is a sandbox MMO
it was actually a Kickstarter oh they
crowdfunded like a million and a half
British pounds for this game so they
made a lot of money and it took about
two years of development it's very kind
of open-world sandbox space exploration
I believe if i'm not mistaken i could be
wrong that this is the game that I
played while i was at e3 on oculus rift
so it oh the one that everybody played
that was it your enough right dog by a
space star Phi I think this is the game
I played it looks very very familiar and
I want to say this is the game I played
and yeah the gameplay in this trailer
well so this is this is the game like
this what it looks like and apparently
like so I've heard and I please correct
me if I'm wrong but I believe if I read
this correctly you can actually if you
have the video capability and all the
hardware that can support it you can
play this game in 16 k 0 like it's like
it crazy you can play like a big grid of
screens and play really high-def anyway
yeah there's like a whole bunch of star
systems lots of exploration it's a very
kind of open sandbox game you got to
make your own content out of this and I
think a lot of people are really excited
about this and the star citizen which I
know my husband is like mega excited
about yeah I was talking about it yeah
he's easy talks about it every day I
have to hear about star citizen and I
mean it's really exciting right I mean
space space games good space games are
really hard to find especially ones that
are kind of like this for your dog
fighting and doing a less cool stuff so
I think that this looks awesome and you

it's fine I like that I like that that
is exactly what those sony icons mean
absolutely i'm sorry Muhammad I let you
down and more more importantly I let
pizza dough you did kneel on down pizza
Ryan roaches and said I would want the
ability to dispense fresh coffee out of
my risk to help me survive finals I
think a lot of people agree with you
this is like finals week for a bunch of
bunch of people including the tracer
Logan yeah finals wolf yeah we don't I
don't agree I'm glad kale and I were
just saying we're glad we're out of that
ya know Piper old we finished that
business and then you can open a
starbucks afterwards and dispense the
coffee make a couple extra bucks so
you're pretty good hey defies our
friends at illusionist the creators of
pyro fire shooter what thanks for the
feature guys wait till you see what
we're up to next oh so now I'm a little
frightened but I did did we talked
nicely about it we take of course yonder
they were very tiny always talk nicely
about everything but no they were really
excited to be featured yeah Euclid wrote
to us and said I want slimy MP MP or
acid love the show by the way i thinkI
abuse your empanadas i'm gonna guess oh
it might be electromagnetic people yeah
yeah this guy's like setting up a home
alone scenario yeah like the people the
sticky bandits they're dangerous oh man
I forgot the Wet Bandits it was this
icky babe it's both cuz they had sticky
hands it was the wet bandits in the
first home alone second one in New York
it was sticky bed really yeah because

on and he's like we're the Wet Bandits
oh no right right I like home alone way
too much I guess so and then Joshua
wrote to us and said a glove
I can shoot lasers haha it's just lasers
yeah so does your TV pyro tweets and
then tddi why we asked you guys what you
could make with household items and you
guys came up okay as we say you guys are
way smarter than us these are really
good I said a learning chamber and you
said I said I said it's amis hand cannon
Oh with like you know like rover man
shooter oh very good pin wrote to us via
email and said low-orbit satellite
launch platform use four sets of helium
filled heavy-duty garbage bags bags
attached to four corners of a large
steel cabinet door from which to launch
a large model rocket whose payload is a
smartphone with a webcam app rocket
launchers triggered by pressure gauge
uses an altima tur to measure platform
height yes there's so much smarter than
us it's very upsetting maybe we should
go take finals do you feel like we maybe
should go back to school yeah I think I
think pin should send us a mortar board
like the thing you wearing a head cuz he
schooled us yeah we literally just got
schooled hard Rick regice and said I
would make my own Iron Throne from game
of thrones of spoons forks and kitchen
yeah nice fat be a stainless steel
throne instead of the Iron Throne and
then Andrew wrote us an email and said
hey tomorrow daily team this is someone
who actually made something oh well
tomorrow daily team I've attached a few
snapshots of my articulated arm iPad
mount I've been meaning to post this
somewhere just because of how often I
use it it is both the ultimate tool of
laziness solves the sore arms of holding
a tablet while in bed and the greatest
tool for productivity great for
photography wireless tethering etc while
in the kitchen are working in a hospital
or lab there are lots of applications
all the components i use to make it are
available as separate products on amazon
and it just locks together he put that
together Wow but yeah he also made the
the learning chamber to that's all the
learning chamber he says PS keep up the
great content and presentation this is
the closest thing to learning pod
without going over he means our show or
that really cool iPad holder but like
I'm into it either way yeah I dig it by
the way all so much respect for your
meticulously clean room like that so all
the whites were white and there was
nothing on the counter
yeah like fresh water are you at a hotel
is that hotel he's like listen I need to
go rent a hotel room for an evening just
like an it's beautiful yeah I know
shoutout DeVos whoa yeah nice big Ian
nice really amazing so you guys are kind
of the best and I just really love that
round of user feedback tighter than us
as always always and now it's time for
our last pc user feedback which is our
phone time for the day so this comes
from glenn k and he says I like new
perspectives that explains why i like
your show i often stop perspective shots
just to see things in a different way
I've bloated two new photos to my folder
dedicated just to tomorrow de Leon Wow
the first shot is winter needles that's
on the left area Logan's got it in full
screen I had a coffee and bagel in my
hands when I saw the frosty needles in a
tree and I just took the photo with one
hand I didn't check the shot until later
and was more than happy when I saw how
well it came out that's really nice that
is really cool he says the second shot
3d vase was just Vaz 3d Baba's yeah it
was just me putting my phone into a 3d
printed Vaz and taking a shot I love how
the light catches the layers of the
filament I work at a university library
and coordinate art and 3d printing as
part of my job and I try to show how 3d
printing can be used for artistic
purposes as well as the science and
design we usually use it for no
manipulation of the photos iphone 6
years must a loved yesterday's episode
address yeah I was really I thought
about that too I was like oh man like
the dress yeah come on is all about it
oh yeah I mean not that you're gonna
wear it Glen but I mean maybe you buy it
for a nice lady that you know is what
I'm saying hey whatever glenn wants to
do is finally that's true i want to wear
that dress but anyway i think we all do
yeah we all do I really think we all do
I like the I like the Glen like
admittedly is all about perspective
shots yeah it's pretty cool no that's
really cool um I dug that and I'd like
he sent us those pictures I thought
they're really neat if you guys want to
have your picture considered for
photography you can email us tomorrow at
cnet com send us a link to your picture
tell us a little story about it what you
shot shot your picture with and all that
jazz and if you want to send in your
user feedback your hashtag of the day

daily on Twitter Facebook and Instagram
or tomorrow daily TV over on Google+ and
YouTube exists so and we upload this
video there too and I go and I respond
there somebody said respond to me kale
and I meant to do it and I didn't do it
