much but this is the logitech pop a
smart button that actually controls a
ton of things in your smart home
it connects those light bags Philips hue
and now August locks which is something
it's announcing at CES so if you do a
single press a double press or a long
press you can do a lot of different
things throughout the home so for
instance I set a single press to turn on
a light I set the double press to turn
on this light and lock or unlock the
August log do it again to turn it off
and then unlock the lock it's really
simple really straightforward and it's
sort of the kind of thing you would sit
on a table so you're watching TV you
want to turn something off you want to
turn something on instead of having to
get out instead of having to use your
phone or do anything like that it's just
right there at your fingertips so for
pricing this comes in a two pack with a
hub that you plug into an outlet for a
hundred bucks and you can buy additional
models for 40 dollars so I would imagine
in a large home you might want to have
some spread throughout the house I
haven't spent a lot of time with this
yet but so far it's been really easy to
set up the one caveat with the August
lock is that you need to have the
connect hub or the August doorbell cam
to act as that Wi-Fi bridge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
