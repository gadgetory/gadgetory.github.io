todd park who is the CTO for the
department of health and human services
hello one of the things that you guys
are doing is something called the blue
button what's that yes it's actually
something we're doing with the Veterans
Administration who's really leading the
initiative and we're probably part of it
it's very simple idea turns out that the
Veterans Administration and Medicare
have portals basically where if you're a
vet or your American minister you can
actually go online get an account and
see in this web portal a copy of your
own information in the case of the VA
it's copying personal health record in
the case of Medicare it's a copy of your
own medical pipes and so you already do
that today all we're doing with blue
button which we've just added which will
be announcing commit mass this week is
we've had a blue button on the my health
event and my medicare.gov portals that
allows you to download a copy of your
own data how so you can take it with you
and out can upload it to other
applications worry about it and so the
obvious easiest thing you can do is
download it and then print it out but
there's some really interesting things
you can do once you have that data yes
what are some of the things you can do
you can put it in a personal health
record right right you can share it
though with medical researchers all
kinds of other people if you want so
there's a very interesting a challenge
which a Marco Foundation has launched
recently at the website to help to
challenge Borg which is kind of a public
competition site when people issue
challenges to build really collapse so
Marco foundation issues a blue bucket
challenge that basically challenged the
developer community to build the coolest
apps that enable people to upload the
roulette invade and do something really
useful with it and so what they did was
they leverage the dummy file formats
that we had actually get out there to
get feedback from developers whether
this comp or work for them and
leveraging those dummy file formats
apparently 18-plus come
teams have been building applications
that use the blue button data to do
useful stuff some people to see what
they are over the next couple days and
also to help solve it the winner the
challenge that happen at the help to go
conference shortly but really you see
how people about and so that blue button
is basically available now for anyone
who either uses Medicare Medicaid or
gets health through the VA medicare
medicare medicare medicare and get cell
through the VA and available through the
long-standing portals the medicare has
offered to its beneficiaries my
medicare.gov or VA is offered for its
vets my healthy death great thanks thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
