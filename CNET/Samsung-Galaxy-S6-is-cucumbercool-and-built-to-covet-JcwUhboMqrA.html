aluminum machine in question is none
other than the Samsung Galaxy s6 I'm
Jessica's all-court for CNN checking out
this leap forward in the Galaxy S line
Samsung phones aren't usually the stuff
of design Envy but this overhaul gives
us a genuinely slim sleek and pretty fun
with an undeniably upscale feel checking
the removable battery and microSD card
slot shaves off the millimetres but will
also take off long time fans of both
here's another surprising move the
galaxy s6 uses Samsung's house-made
Exynos octa-core processor which shares
features with other headliner phones
built on Android 5.0 the TouchWiz layer
cut way back on bloatware this leaves
you with a fresh more streamlined look
take the native camera and gallery apps
Samsung has made it easier to navigate
around but also includes extras like pro
mode and a tool for making
instagram-worthy collages a new cool
camera feature launches the app anytime
you double click the home button which
is really neat on the back you're
looking at a 16 megapixel lens with
optical image stabilization there's a
wide-angle 5 megapixel shooter up front
to tools like auto HDR and the rear
camera selfie mode kick it all up a
notch back to its face the GS 6 has a
5.1 inch screen with an enormous 1440
pixels Ellucian that's impressive but
borders on overkill for most photos and
videos a more helpful boost is the
battery which tops up extra fast and
comes with qi wireless charging built
right in
the s6 emulates the iPhone with an
improved fingerprint scanner that
doubles as your key to Samsung pay an
electronic system that will let you more
often leave your wallet at home that one
rolls out to select countries in summer
2015 the Galaxy s6 will sell in four
colors and three different storage
capacities that start at 32 gigabytes
although you probably won't be able to
find every combination everywhere in the
world anyway you slice it
Samsung has made another powerhouse
smartphone that successfully amps up its
shelf appeal while still keeping
hardware specs swinging if you're into
more of a statement phone check out my
full review of the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge which has curved screens in the
meantime be sure to check out all the
pros cons and in-between of the s6 here
