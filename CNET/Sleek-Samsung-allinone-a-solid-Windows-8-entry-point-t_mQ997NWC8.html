we're gonna take a look at the new
samsung series seven on one desktop this
is Samsung's new Windows 8 PC this model
comes in around 1099 so it's actually a
pretty affordable 23 inch Windows 8
system it does have 10-point touch input
here in the screen it's pretty
responsive the screens nice and glossy
so you don't really get that much
resistance like we've seen in some other
all-in-ones Samsung also paid some
pretty good attention to the design in
this system you can see it's got this
nice chrome trim along the edge here and
it's sort of a unique stand the screen
tilts back about thirty degrees so it
doesn't have that full reclining that
you get in some other on once but it's
still not bad if you want to just come
up to it and use it like a kiosk style
system now because it's 1099 the system
isn't the most fully featured that we've
seen it has a core i5 CPU that's laptop
style so it means it's a little bit
slower than you might get otherwise
there's only six gigs of RAM usually we
see about eight there's also a terabyte
hard drive as well as Intel integrated
graphics now all that is perfectly fine
for browsing around using basic touch
apps
well it's playing some light duty games
but if you want to get into media
editing or other intensive programs
you're not going to have much luck with
this PC it also has some of the usual
things we expect to see as far as ports
there's USB 3 and SD card input HDMI in
and out so that's useful for saying
adding a second monitor to the system or
plugging into a console or some other
home video source and using this as a
standalone display somewhat unique to
this PC though is it's just your based
input system now that doesn't mean it's
successful only that it's sort of unique
we've seen it in one other PC and all
one from Acer so to help you get
acclimated to the gesture input Samsung
has included this handy stand here that
has some of the basic gestures so put
this stand next your system and all of a
sudden looks like you're at a trade show
or an electronics store so the problem
with the gesture input is that it's a
little bit awkward and it's not all that
responsive so you put your hand in front
of the screen and you get some feedback
that it's recognized your input but it's
slow to respond and some of the gestures
are just awkward they want you to make a
fist and then drag down to switch
between the start screen and the
traditional Windows desktop and that's
something that I haven't been able to
get work at all you
so from one point of view the gesture
input isn't really that successful it's
not responsive it's a little bit awkward
to use and in general it just doesn't
feel quite right considering the price
and the other features in the system
though Samsung doesn't appear to be
charging a big premium for the gesture
input so you really don't lose a lot by
having it here so in all this is a
pretty decent looking relatively
affordable Windows 8 all-in-one it has a
nice big twenty three point six inch
screen and it has all the features and
performance that you more or less expect
to find in a PC in this price range
so for anybody looking for a basic
mainstream on one I can certainly
recommend the samsung series 7 I just
wouldn't get too excited about the
gesture controls sorry much Brown this
is the samsung series 7 only</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
