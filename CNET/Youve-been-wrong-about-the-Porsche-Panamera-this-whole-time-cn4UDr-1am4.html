knows that it's a hot mess of a car
designed for people who care little
about cars and even less about driving a
fancy badge slapped on a car to do the
school run in it is awful what on earth
has the Panamera got going for it
well it is fast this is the Panamera
Turbo with the top speed of 189 miles an
hour and 0 to 60 in about 4 seconds flat
which for a car of this weight is no
mean feat it's got 520 horsepower and
about the same in foot-pounds of torque
and together
that's a lively package ok yeah it's
fast and it's powerful but apart from
power and speed what has the
pan-american going for it
well it's quite spacious and practical
they say the 911 is the only supercar
you can live with on a daily basis and
that's certainly true as long as you
don't have to ferry around more than one
person at a handbag if you've actually
got some passengers and some luggage to
take your bang out of luck have you ever
tried using the back seats in the 911 if
you can't chop off your legs for the
duration of the trip you're not going to
be able to fit in the back the Panamera
however because the engine isn't in the
back has room for a really big boot and
because it's the length it has two
proper seats in the back comfortable
seats with legroom and rear
entertainment systems well of course
it's spacious and practical I mean look
at it
but apart from being spacious practical
powerful and fast what does it got going
for it I mean its front engines for
pete's sake Porsche are known for their
rear engine and mid-engine cars one
earth do they know about making front
engine cars
well yeah except the 944 the 9 to 4 the
9 to 8 GTS was awesome the 9 6 8 no no
you're right they are pretty damn good
at making fun tension in cars okay well
apart from being front engine spacious
practical fast and powerful what has
this car got going for it it's bad for
the environment it is bad for the
environment it's huge it's heavy it's
got a big ol v8 engine this car is bad
for the environment well yeah that is
true but there is a hybrid version of
the Panamera which if you drive it
responsibly will get you over 90 miles
to the gallon
okay so potentially it's very
responsible it's front-engined it's
spacious it's practical it's fast and
it's powerful but it's ugly
everyone knows the Porsche Panamera is
bulbous disproportionate and well not
from this angle from this angle it looks
kind of badass but if you come round
here then no that's silk now that's
still kind of badass this thing looks
totally awesome why did no one tell me
this
okay okay so it is potentially
responsible spacious practical
front-engined fast and powerful and it
looks badass barbette it sounds like
crap off of sick
okay I'm sure you get my drift by now I
have a confession to make
I am a huge fan of the Porsche Panamera
when I first saw the pictures of it when
I first got them built I was like
everyone else and I thought Porsche it
made a huge mistake with this car it
looked ugly disproportionate and I
didn't see the point and then I actually
saw one in front of me and then I drove
what and since then I've been a Panamera
fanboy this car is absolutely fantastic
and it gets a rough ride for no reason
now obviously if you could pick any car
from the Porsche lineup to have as your
own you would pick the 918 or if you're
being a bit more modest something from
the 911 variants and that makes a lot of
sense and truly I would prefer that as
well but I live in the real world I have
two kids I have two fairly stuff back
and forth and I need an element of
practicality in my life and frankly a
911 on the drive would look great but
wouldn't really get me anywhere the
Panamera on the other hand has
everything in it I want from a Porsche
it's got performance handling power and
yes the looks as well but on top of that
it's got roof my kids in the back and
all the luggage we could possibly throw
at it this is the Porsche for the real
world
this is the Porsche for the real driver
this is my Porsche of choice
now I might not been able to change your
mind in this video about the Porsche
Panamera and that's fair enough but the
next time you see one do me a solid
forget everything you've thought about
it so far and everything you've heard
and everything you've read about it and
try and look at it with fresh eyes I'm
convinced if you give this car a shot
from scratch you'll see what I've been
seeing for years that this year has been
hiding in plain sight this entire time
and it's one of the best cars on the
road today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
