that turns into a tiny little train and
Microsoft creates some crazy augmented
reality painting you go girl lastly two
giant robots that already exist might
get in the greatest fight ever to exist
robot fights tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show known universe I'm Ashley
sceva Jeremy's always kill anonymous who
loved Terminator Genisys last night and
by love Dyke I don't mean that I i I've
gotta say it here and now okay I'm gonna
stay here no special announcement I
officially retire as a terminator fan
I'm done I've been through a lot
resigning we've seen a pretty big drop
off I love Sarah Connor Chronicles okay
good yeah right like I'm into that whole
world but officially I'm out yeah
Dominator Genesis I'm out should we hire
a lot of time line they introduced me
just that I didn't like the casting look
I didn't like it I'm retiring that's
enough you enjoy terminator and if you
enjoy it you think you're gonna have fun
go ahead but I'm retiring I'm done let's
hit the headlines yeah
Logan you gonna torture you with no I
just eat it oh hey it's like he's
smiling at my pain all right okay let's
talk about something hat alright okay
alright so we've seen Microsoft Research
do some crazy fun things right that is
how well they're not stopping now
they've got this AR paint thing which is
incredible I can't wait to show you this
okay it's using augmented reality and of
course the kinect which they love to use
well so this basically scans the room it
makes a 3d render in real time and the
user can mark objects with paint colors
yeah look virtual painted it looks like
it's called covered in duct tape like
that that render little like
everything's covered in duct tape yeah
I'd say it's not a perfect science it
looks pretty good so anyway when you
mark something like a chair like he's
marking the chair it's gonna flood it
with color and it also recognizes
anything else that is marked as a chair
and paints that accordingly it's kind of
like um like a Microsoft Paint but like
with future tech yeah this is weird it's
like August of reality Microsoft Paint
this is so bizarre set of banana yes a
gold banana and some kind of coffee mug
yeah it's a coffee mug they're not so
this is all fun at all like you know
microsoft research building everything
like you said yeah that's amazing it's
like this is a chair as well it's green
now so they're not trying to sell this
this is just like Microsoft Research
having fun they're just kind of trying
to show off like hey look at all the
kind of stuff you can do this looks like
splatoon oh yeah obviously this looks
like the world's worst interior designer
right now like this looks like IKEA
nightmares so it looks like so this is
called semantic paint sorry to drop that
so late in the story but it's called
semantic paint and again this is just a
little little fun thing Microsoft
Research is goofing around with so there
you go how I could totally Gimenez blue
I could totally see this coming into
play for things like interior design
like if you're thinking about painting
your wall you put on your hololens go
like this and then you can see what the
whole wall would look like as opposed to
like using an AR app on like an iPad
which might not be as good I could
totally see anybody putting on Hollins
and doing that and loving it yeah I mean
this is a one of those scratch
the surface type things yeah like it's
you it's a concept and they're trying to
get the ball rolling so that your brain
can fire off electrodes and stuff far
electrodes I'll make it um can I please
tell you about what might be for me my
favorite story we've ever talked about
into our daily 202 episodes in hives 202
episodes in and we might have a robot
fight happening within a year we get it
and not just like battle bots which is
awesome in and of itself I'm talking
giant 12,000 pound robots duking it out
USA v japan like this is serious
business ok so let's take a look at this
video this is from mega bots inc
megawatts Inc has a robot named the mega
bot mark to the megawatt mark 2 is
12,000 pounds of pure robot battling
goodness there are giant guns that fire
out these are three pound paint cannon
balls that are shot out of these crazy
Gatling guns they want they have
challenged officially kuratas oh yeah we
reported on that we did which is from
sue dobashi Heavy Industries it's a nine
thousand pound robot if you forgot about
it with a crazy advanced targeting
system there's a single person control
and there so you or you can control it
with your iPhone we talked about that so
they came on this video and obviously
we're feeling very patriotic they're
here from the US they were wearing
american flag capes and they were
walking and being total like badasses
and they were like listen guys sooo
dobashi we're coming for you we want to
set up this fight let's have these two
giant robots duke it out your you got a
nine thousand pound robot with one
person inside it we got a 12,000 pound
robot with two people inside it to make
this happen sounds like a very expensive
battle it sounds like a very expensive
battle indeed because if i'm not
mistaken i think that kuratas cost over
almost one and a half million dollars to
build so these are not cheap obviously
but it's worth it i would pay my money
is on japan cuz they they are much
better about robots than we are like
they they have robo tags what fires when
you smile remember we like smile for
that little camera that shoots the BB
gattling gun like this things that's
already
pretty legit I mean okay so mega bot
says they're gonna give pseudo vashi one
year to set up the fight they get to set
the terms of the fight and then in a
year they're gonna and they also need
time to adjust the robots because
they're obviously not come with a
combat-ready which who knows what that
means because they already have three
pound paintball cannon cannon balls in
there so it's not it's not for sure it's
just a challenge is a challenge the
gauntlet the actual robot gauntlet has
been thrown down god I think they should
listen soon abbasi if you're watching go
for it because better this seems any
weather and a hundred times i would pay
for this on pay-per-view like
legitimately hazy with me there in the
stands yeah like actually I can't do it
jay-z impression I'm sorry I'm like
uh-huh uh-huh like I don't know that's
your Jesus that's the best jay-z no it's
more like nelly is everything oh no no
sorry p diddy pj all right here uh-huh
yay well that's the years like that's P
Diddy to me like I hear that oh so yeah
uh-huh yeah okay well there you go p
diddy hopefully you'll get to check out
these robots fighting no please make
this happen everybody this has to happen
it has to happen uh and that brings us
steel yeah it's like real steel like
real except maybe a good a good
entertaining thing yeah sorry sorry Hugh
Jackman that brings us to our hashtag of
the day which is TD Robo fight and we
just want to know who you think would
win do you think you're gonna go with
mega bots mark to make a bot mark two
are you gonna go with kuratas I mean you
already said you think kuratas is gonna
take I'm worse I want to know what you
guys think what weapon should they put
on there I like that too what weapons
should they put on there to like really
a clinch the win yeah what do you think
I really want a big buzz saw who buys
just like nice dad right down the right
down the center kind of cut him up I
like that I like it um i'm gonna say i
really like the idea of it having a
high-powered laser that it can burn
through like the the arm of the other
one and like drop the armor of the laser
be well you got about it right on the
head Yeah Yeah Yeah right on him right
on the head you got to get like either
eyes or you do one mega laser like i
like the idea of a big heat like
high-powered laser or another good one
be if it was you know it's out there and
then all of a sudden it's like calling
other robots and it makes like a big ol
robot Ultron the little ones like on no
help me uh yeah no I I love the story so
much it may be so happy when I read it
this morning and watch the video the
video is hilarious you absolutely have
to watch it because they get really into
like the mega BOTS robot they're like we
at it big guns like and everything's
translated in Japanese so that's two
debace can read it it's great it's
amazing so great job megawatts inc and i
really hope you get your robot fight
because i want to see it and in fact
kale and i are volunteering right now to
commentate to do color commentary on the
fight if it happens no I want pilot it
anywhere it is you want to pilot it I
want a pilot ok kills volunteering to
pilot or copilot cuz mega bah if you
want to ride megabyte you gotta rep USA
you'd have you have some other pilot in
there tues there's two people but I
think I'd be full of expletives so they
can't get they can't use me I just be
like oh yeah I know I know you just be
screaming and being over the time of
your life flipping tables I would
totally go John Madden on it and be like
the robot that takes a part the other
robot is the robot that's gonna win
today and I make all these crazy like
nonsensical a captain obvious comments
it would be amazing um TD Robo fight
that's your hashtag ok really briefly
let me tell you about this for rail this
is a crazy publicity stunt not real
pretty interesting though I like that
they did it it's just kind of a fun
little thing Mercedes has a little car
called the 44 there it is right there
and they turned it into a train it's a
tiny little mini train you can see watch
you'll see the tires have been replaced
with these giant 22 inch steel discs
they're just these gigantic like
basically their railroad wheels like
train wheels they threw him on there and
and they ran it down the track as if it
were a real train which is super weird
it took six months to figure out they
worked with a company called inner fleet
to figure this out they like I said
swapped out the wheels of solid steel
discs for traction on the railroad and
then they remove the steering they put
in supports so the wheels stayed
straight permanently because obviously
you don't want like a bunch of wibbly
wobbly wheels like you wouldn't a car
because
they're not really doing any turning on
their own and then they they took a 10
mile ride on the track so that's that's
what they did then they removed it from
the tracks they were able to retrofit it
back to its normal state as a 44 and not
a for rail it doesn't look like it went
terribly fast but it is moving at a
little bit of a clip right here so I'm
kind of fun I like this honor it's like
running side by side with a real train
kind of weird and I'm pretty sure that's
like the Hogwarts Express train looks
like the Hogwarts Express I am super
disappointed in this guy that guy should
have gotten out and surfed on this thing
that would've been a young boy say oh
come on it wasn't that fast he could
have totally done it one of an amazing
eating what is it Swedish goldfish what
was probably I don't know anyone read
the paper six months okay I'm usually
all four concepts tough but that was
really weird it was super weird and they
said there's there's not really a plan
to like kind of put you in production or
anything but they just they they thought
it would be really fun to do it and I do
like this sort of idea of you know just
having an idea I'm like making it it is
very weird and obviously we're never
going to see it happen in real life but
it's kind of fun to be able to just
remodel I stuff and put it out on the
tracks and freak people out so little
tiny train from Mercedes for real kind
of cool anyway we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back it's Thursday
we'll talk about what we're into and
then of course we have your user
feedback so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Thursday time to talk about things
we like this is into it kind of late to
the game on this one hit me sometimes
it's okay to be late to the game talking
some things I figured out something
about myself but this week i'm into
marvel's agents of shield oh I'm late to
the game because it's had a really slow
start i try to get into it at the
beginning i heard and it didn't work out
but i also learned that I'm kind of into
waiting till a bunch of it is out and
then binge watching it so that I can get
all the character development to you
know and that one's a really good
like really good show but it's like
usually at the tail end of the season
does it get good it's impressive like
the scale at which the show can actually
go like some of the set pieces even some
of the CG I mean it's not perfect but
it's pretty good for television and
there's some great cameos sip from Lady
SIF yeah lady SIF from Thor's in there
Samuel Jackson pops up a few times what
uh what's that other girl that was a the
second and command next to Agent Coulson
in the Avengers movies Oh Maria so um
Colbie Smulders yeah she's in a couple
of episodes so it's pretty cool there's
a lot of surprises um what's even better
is when the Hydra thing takes over
anyway Hydra maybe maybe you were into
at the beginning it's worth giving a
shot to like some of the later episode
back around to it because maybe it's
just you know slow burn but if you can
bend watch it now maybe you'll get
passed out a little quickly and get into
the good so what did you think of it a
pretty sure Logan probably a right
around when you started really enjoying
it yeah so it's it's it's pretty good
I'm into it this weekend I'm trying chug
through it by the end of Fortune I
weekend so there you go very nice cool I
so I want to tell you about this game
that I started playing I've heard really
good things about it and I hadn't I
didn't really know what it wasn't it did
you it is an indie game I'm rise there
it's called her story and oh yeah have
you heard of this yeah okay so this is
really fascinating i did not think that
narrative gaming could could be redone
but this totally does that so you open
up the app it's an
it's a game that you can get on iOS you
so you i pad iphone you can also do it
on pc it's on like Steam and OS 10 so
you get it on mac or pc if you have mac
pc so what all it is is like this 1980s
uh this like crazy computer interface so
let me um yeah okay so here's the
computer interface and when you start
the game search term is murder so it's
in there and they give you these clips
and there's four clips and it starts the
story and all they are are FMV video of
this woman being interrogated by the
police okay and you're the cops and you
have to figure out if this lady killed
this other this guy because he's been
murdered so you listen to these four
clips and you go oh she said this or she
mentioned this person so I'm going to
look that up as a search phrase and then
you look that up and then there's more
clips and then you go to watch those
Clips and got to keep going and it's
like a game version of cereal like it's
really fascinating and fun it's like a
true it's like it's such a good
detective game I ask you cuz you're
making it sound like a very big and
expansive game know how many hours would
you say is isn't this probably I'm not
done with it yet but probably like a
couple hours of your time okay so it's
it's an iOS game it's not gonna it's not
gonna you know it's not just your honor
to spend 10 hours on this I'm I'm kind
of getting through it slowly like I'm
trying to like kind of enjoy it and
really you know get so is it just a yes
or no like at one person oh yes sir nose
I don't know what the ending is and I
don't want to look it up but I want to
and I don't want to spoil it for myself
so now I'm not spoiling it for you I was
actually just saying this today I don't
know if the ending is you find a clip of
maybe her confessing or her being
exonerated somehow and then you just go
oh well that's the end of the game like
after you watch that clip of those
congrats you figured it out but like
there's got to be some search phrase
that gives you the final answer to the
game I'm guessing or maybe it doesn't I
don't know maybe it's like cereal and
it's ambiguous and you have to draw your
own conclusions but it's like five bucks
on iOS so I would say well worth the
time like it's really interesting if you
like if you like mystery games detective
stuff or if you just really like things
that
this is a way to tell a story that I've
not yet seen before and I just think
it's super fascinating and I'm really
impressed so that's what I'm into right
now like I I'm literally right in the
middle of being today so I haven't
finished it yet like I i'm still getting
through it and i started it yesterday
and I'm just like oh my god this game is
awesome like it's so cool so yeah really
dig in her story that's what it's called
so I'm and just just so weird and like
quiet like there's not it's it's it's
all just weird like interrogation every
as you actually feel like you're like
looking at somebody's real life like
interrogation for murder it feels like
it could be a real story so it's pretty
cool okay so now that we've talked about
us it's time to talk about you let's hit
your user feedback so is news transition
of the week Oh easiest one into it to
user feedback okay you guys we asked you
to use hashtag TD make me to tell us

other robobee ah ah he knew he was going
to do that when he read producer Logan
knew it okay good Steven good job
Christopher road oh no good job load a
good jeffries iligan Christopher said it
would make me coffee on demand I know
