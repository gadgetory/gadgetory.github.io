that turns into a tiny little train and
Microsoft creates some crazy augmented
reality painting you go girl
lastly two giant robots that already
exist might get in the greatest fight
ever
to exist robot fights tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the universe I'm Ashley
scavenge enemies always kill anonymous
who loved Terminator Genisys last night
and by love day I don't mean that
III I'm gonna say it here and now okay
I'm gonna say it here no special
announcement I officially retire as a
terminator fan I'm done I've been
through a lot resigning we've seen a
pretty big drop off I love Sarah Connor
Chronicles okay good yeah right like I'm
into that whole world but officially I'm
out yeah Dominator Genesis I'm out
should we hire a lot of time line they
introduce me just I didn't like the
casting look I didn't like it I'm
retiring
that's enough you'll enjoy terminator
and if you enjoy it you think you gonna
have fun go ahead but I'm retiring I'm
done
let's hit the headlines yeah Logan she's
gonna torture you at know I just needed
oh I hate it's like he's smiling at my
pain alright okay alright so we've seen
Microsoft Research do some crazy fun
things all right that is tario well
they're not stopping now they've got
this AR paint thing which is incredible
I can't wait to show you this okay it's
using augmented reality and of course
the Kinect which they they love to use
so this basically scans the room it
makes a 3d render in real time and the
user can mark objects with paint colors
yeah look virtual paint it looks like
it's all covered in duct tape like that
that render like everything's covered in
duct tape yeah I'd say it's not a
perfect science it looks pretty good so
anyway when you mark something like a
chair like he's marking the chair it's
gonna flood it with color and it also
recognizes anything else that is marked
as a chair and paints that accordingly
it's kind of like like a Microsoft Paint
but like with future tech yeah this is
weird it's like augmented reality
Microsoft Paint
so bizarre sort of banana yes a gold
banana and some kind of coffee mug yeah
it's a coffee mug they're not so this is
all fun at all like you know Microsoft
Research building everything like you
said yeah that's amazing it's like this
is a chair as well it's green now so
they're not trying to sell this this is
just like Microsoft Research having fun
they're just kind of trying to show off
like hey look at all the kind of stuff
you can do this looks like splatoon yeah
this looks like the world's worse than
Gary or designer right now oh this looks
like IKEA nightmares though it is looks
like so this is called semantic paint
sorry to drop that so late in the story
but it's called semantic paint and again
this is just a little little fun thing
Microsoft Research is goofing around
with so there you go I could totally use
your Manas blue I could totally see this
coming into play for things like
interior design like if you're thinking
about painting your wall you put on your
hololens go like this and then you can
see what the whole wall would look like
as opposed to like using an AR app on
like an iPad which might not be as good
I could totally see anybody putting on
Hollins and doing that and loving it
yeah I mean this is one of those
scratching the surface type things yeah
like it's a concept and they're trying
to get the ball rolling so that your
brain can fire off electrodes and stuff
Farrah's oh okay um can I please tell
you about what might be for me my
favorite story we've ever talked about
into our day like two hundred two
episodes in pipes two hundred two
episodes in and we might have a robot
fight happening within a year we get it
and not just like battle bots which is
awesome in and of itself I'm talking
giant 12,000 pound robots duking it out
USA v Japan like this is serious
business okay so let's take a look at
this video this is from megabots
inc megabots inc has a robot named the
megabot mark ii megabot mark ii is
12,000 pounds of pure robot battling
goodness there are giant guns that fire
out these are three pound paint
cannonballs that are shot out of these
crazy Gatling guns they want they have
challenged officially kuratas oh yeah we
reported on that we did which is from
sue dobashi Heavy Industries it's a
9,000 pound robot if you forgot about it
with a crazy advanced targeting system
there's a single per
and control and their CEO or you can
control it with your iPhone we talked
about that so they came on this video
and obviously we're feeling very
patriotic they're here from the US they
were wearing American flag capes and
they were walking and being total like
badasses and they were like listen guys
sue dobashi
we're coming for you we want to set up
this fight let's have these two giant
robots Duke it out you're you got a nine
thousand pound robot with one person
inside it we got a 12,000 pound robot
with two people inside it let's make
this happen
it sounds like a very expensive battle
it sounds like a very expensive battle
indeed because if I'm not mistaken I
think that kuratas cost over almost one
and a half million dollars to build so
these are not cheap obviously but it's
worth it I would pay my money is on
Japan because they they are much better
about robots than we are like they they
have robo tag well it fires when you
smile remember we like smile for that
little camera that shoots the BB Gatling
gun like things ready to pretty legit I
mean okay so mega-bot says they're gonna
give sue dobashi one year to set up the
fight they get to set the terms of the
fight and then in a year they're gonna
and they also need time to adjust the
robots because they're obviously not
come with a hook combat ready which who
knows what that means because they
already have three pound paintball
cannon cannon balls in there so it's not
it's not for sure it's just a challenge
is a challenge the gauntlet the actual
robot gauntlet has been thrown down
I think they should listen sue Dabashi
if you're watching go for it because
better they seem very weather and a
hundred times I would pay for this on
pay-per-view like legitimately jay-z
would be there in the stands yeah like
actually I can't do a jay-z impression
I'm sorry I'm like uh-huh uh-huh like I
don't know
that's your jeez that's the best jay-z I
know that's more like Nelly please no no
sorry P Diddy PJ yeah uh-huh yeah well
that's the year is like that's P Diddy
to me like I hear that oh okay
well there you go P Diddy hopefully
you'll get to check out these robots
fighting now please make this happen
everybody this has to happen it has to
happen and everyone
Steele yeah it's like real steel except
maybe I'm good a good entertaining thing
sorry hugh jackman that brings us to our
hashtag of the day which is TD robo
fight and we just want to know who you
think would win do you think you're
gonna go with megabots mark to make a
bot mark - are you gonna go with kuratas
i mean you already said you think
kuratas is gonna take i'm worse I want
to know what you guys think what weapon
should they put on there oh I like that
- what weapons are they put on there to
like really Lynch the wind
yeah what do you think I really want a
big buzz saw-like right down right down
the center kind of cut them up I like
that I like it um I'm gonna say I really
like the idea of it having a
high-powered laser that it can burn
through like the the arm of the other
one and like drop the armor the laser B
oh well you got about it right on the
head yeah yeah yeah right on right on
the head you got to get like either eyes
or you do one mega laser like I like the
idea of a big heap like high-powered
laser or another good one would be if it
was you know it's out there and then all
of a sudden it's like calling other
robots and it makes like a big robot and
Ron the little ones like on ya know I I
love this story so much it made me so
happy when I read it this morning and
watch the video the video is hilarious
you absolutely have to watch it because
they get really into like the megabots
robot they're like we at it big guns
like and everything's translated in
Japanese so that's - Dabashi can read it
it's great it's amazing so great job
megabots Inc and I really hope you get
your robot fight because I want to see
it and in fact Kayla and I are
volunteering right now to commentate to
do color commentary on the fight if it
happens no I'm a pilot it anywhere it is
you want to pilot it I want a pilot okay
Kayla's volunteering to pilot or copilot
cuz mega boy if you want to ride megabot
you got a rep USA you'd have you know
some other pilot in there - there's two
people well I think I'd be full of
expletives so they can't get they can't
use me I just be like oh yeah I know I
know you screaming and being at the time
of your life flipping tables I would
totally go John Madden on it and be like
the robot that takes apart the other
robot is the
robot that's gonna win today and I make
all these crazy like nonsensical a
Captain Obvious comments it would be
amazing
TD Robo fight that's your hashtag okay
really briefly let me tell you about
this for real this is a crazy publicity
stunt not real pretty interesting though
I like that they did it it's just kind
of a fun little thing Mercedes has a
little car called the four-four there it
is right there
and they turn it into a train it's a
tiny little mini train you can see watch
you'll see the tires have been replaced
with these giant 22 inch steel discs
they're just these gigantic like
basically they're railroad wheels like
train wheels they threw them on there
and and they they ran it down the track
as if it were a a real train which is
super weird it took six months to figure
out they worked with a company called
inter fleets to figure this out they
like I said swapped out the wheels of
solid steel discs for traction on the
railroad and then they remove the
steering they put in supports so the
wheels stayed straight permanently
because obviously you don't want like a
bunch of wibbly-wobbly wheels like you
would in a car because they're not
really doing any turning on their own
and then they they took a ten-mile ride
on the track so that's that's what they
did then they removed it from the tracks
they were able to retrofit it back to
its normal state as a 4/4 and not a four
rail it doesn't look like it went
terribly fast but it is moving at a
little bit of a clip right here so I'm
kind of fun I like this honor it's like
running side-by-side with a real train
kind of weird and I'm pretty sure that's
like the Hogwarts Express train looks
like the Hogwarts Express
I am super disappointed in this guy that
guy should have gotten out and surfed on
this thing that would have been a yellow
come on it wasn't that bad he could have
totally done it
what is it Swedish goldfish what was
probably I don't know anyone read the
paper six months okay I'm usually all
for concept stuff but that was really
weird it was super weird and they they
said there's there's not really a plan
to like kind of put you in production or
anything but they just they they thought
it would be really fun to do it and I do
like this sort of idea of of you know
just having an idea I'm like making it
it is very weird and obviously we're
never gonna see it happen in real life
but it's kind of fun to be able to just
remodel I stuff and put it out on the
tracks and freak people out so little
tiny train from
Marcedes for real kind of cool anyway
we're gonna take a quick break we'll be
right back it's Thursday we'll talk
about what we're into and then of course
we have your user feedback so don't
click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Thursday it's time to talk about
things we like this is into it kind of
late to the game on this one hit me
sometimes it's okay to be late to the
game talking some things I figured out
something about myself but this week I'm
into Marvel's agents of shield Oh late
to the game because it's had a really
slow start I try to get into it at the
beginning I read and it didn't work out
but I also learned that I'm kind of into
waiting till a bunch of it is out and
then binge watching it so that I can get
all the character development to you
know and that one's a really good
like really good show but it's like
usually at the tail end of the season
does it get good it's impressive
like the scale at which this show can
actually go like some of the set pieces
even some of the CG I mean it's not
perfect but it's pretty good for
television and there's some great cameos
sip from OH lady SIF yeah lady SIF from
Thor's in there
Samuel Jackson pops up a few times
what's that other girl that that was a
the second-in-command next to Agent
Coulson in the Avengers movies oh I'm
Maria so yeah Cobie Smulders yeah she's
in a couple of episodes so it's pretty
cool there's a lot of surprises what's
even better is when the Hydra thing
takes over anyway Hydra maybe maybe you
were into at the beginning it's worth
giving a shot to like some of the later
episode to it because maybe it's just
you know slow burn but if you can binge
watch it now maybe you'll get passed out
a little quickly and get into a good
stroke what did you think of it a
producer Logan probably out right around
when you started really enjoying it yeah
so it's it's it's pretty good I'm into
it this weekend I'm trying to chug
through it by the end of fortune alive
weekend so there you go very nice cool
so I want to tell you about this game
that I started playing I've heard really
good things about it and I hadn't I
didn't really know what it was that did
you
it is an indie game prize there it's
called her story and oh yeah have you
heard of this yeah okay so this is
really fascinating I did not think that
narrative gaming could could be redone
but this totally does that so you open
up the app it's an
it's a game that you can get on iOS you
say I pad iPhone you can also do it on
PC it's on like Steam and OS 10 so you
get it on Mac or PC if you have Mac PC
so what all it is is like this 1980s
this like crazy computer interface so
let me yeah okay so here's the computer
interface and when you start the game
search term is murder so it's in there
and they give you these clips and
there's four clips and it starts the
story and all they are are FMV video of
this woman being interrogated by the
police okay and you're the cops and you
have to figure out if this lady killed
this other this guy because he's been
murdered so you you listen to these four
clips and you go oh she said this or she
mentioned this person so I'm going to
look that up as a search phrase and then
you look that up and then there's more
clips and then you go to watch those
clips and you got to keep going and it's
like a game version of cereal like it's
really fascinating and fun it's like a
true it's like it's such a good
detective game I'm gonna ask you because
you're making it sound like a very big
and expansive game know how many hours
would you say is is in this probably I'm
not done with it yet but probably like a
couple hours of your time okay so it's
it's an iOS game it's not gonna it's not
gonna you know it's not gonna you're
gonna spend 10 hours on this I'm I'm
kind of getting through it slowly like
I'm trying to like kind of enjoy it and
really you know get so is it just a yes
or no like no yes sir nose I don't know
what the ending is and I don't want to
look it up but I want to and I don't
want to spoil it for myself so now I'm
not spoiling it for you I was actually
just saying this today I don't know if
the ending is you find a clip of maybe
her confessing or her being exonerated
somehow and then you just go oh well
that's the end of the game like after
you watch that clip of those congrats
you figured it out but like there's got
to be some search phrase that gives you
the final answer to the game I'm
guessing or maybe it doesn't I don't
know maybe it's like cereal and it's
ambiguous and you have to draw your own
conclusions but it's like five bucks on
iOS so I would say well worth the time
like it's really interesting if you like
if you like mystery games detective
stuff or if you just really like things
that
this is a way to tell a story that I've
not yet seen before and I just think
it's super fascinating and I'm really
impressed so that's what I'm into right
now like I I'm literally right in the
middle of being so I haven't finished it
yet like I I'm still getting through it
and I started it yesterday and I'm just
like oh my god this game is awesome like
it's so cool don't so yeah really dig it
herstory that's what it's called so um
and just just so weird and like quiet
like there's not it's it's it's all just
weird like interrogation every you
actually feel like you're like looking
at somebody's real life like
interrogation for a murder it feels like
it could be a real story it's it's
pretty cool okay so now that we've
talked about us it's time to talk about
you let's hit your user feedback into it
to user feedback okay you guys we asked
you to use hashtag TV make me to tell us
what you want robots to do or make for
you in your house you did not disappoint
then a lot of people say rich people
stuff like you did no I want one to
crack open my lobsters and polish my
gold statues of myself paint large
portraits of me for over my mantel ago I
have 18 fireplace of course they didn't
discipline no Steven wrote and said
fetch me beer and pizza until Skynet
takes over and he makes me do it like
this like the other robot yeah he knew
he was going to do that when he read
producer Logan knew it okay
Christopher wrote oh no good job lo a
good job Brazil again Christopher said
it would make me coffee on demand I know
that sounds like accurate but this robot
would also bring it to me and be
friendly like this this is never gonna
end
Landon wrote in and said sandwiches so
lots of sandwiches also it should make
sure all my gadgets get plugged in at
night like this no we're gonna now
you're gonna torture him all weekend
with these picture it's gonna be amazing
and then okay meanwhile just said print
me that money like he just wants money
you should get a robot to print some
money mmm
like that one lesson plans for any dam
says lesson plans for anything I might
want to learn how to do like for example
save humanity haha just gonna keep we're
just gonna keep going I wish you guys
were getting paid for this
I know paid to use this image Rebecca
says a house and and then Kirk wrote
spray food from Phil of the future
hashtag lazy and sprayed pizza for kale
anonymous and then sent in this gift
which is glorious he's sending a gif of
like the actual clip of what is it
called Phil of the future so we have
this like animated gif thing which is
pretty awesome producer Logan do we have
that gift pretty so Logan hates Logan
I'm pretty slowly gonna hate you today
um okay guys so it's time talking about
our very last bees use your feedback
