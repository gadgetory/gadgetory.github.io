sport or more wagon it's a key
distinction what if it's only a vague
smattering of both let's drive the 2012
Acura TSX SportWagen and check the tap
you may have heard there are folks who
actually miss the old Honda Accord wagon
and thought the hell would miss that
well I miss that and this is a very
close example of what it would be today
in fact this TSX SportWagen
is called the Accord wagon when it's
sold in Europe it's very much the TSX
with a tidy little wagon compartment
moulded on the back very faithful to the
lines otherwise
it's worth noting that the Audi a4
Mercedes c-class BMW 3-series and
everything Lexus are no longer found as
wagons here Acura's either way out in
front or a little bit behind well not
much changes inside these Acura cabins
you've seen this big old bosom thing
here with the not going to say it right
there on the front lots of buttons
that's an acura thing they seem to have
brought the number down a little bit but
not enough so that you don't go wow
that's a lot of buttons when you first
get in this car what hasn't evolved
quite so much as that navigation
interface it looks the same as it has
for ages with minor improvements but
it's still a little bit on the
fisher-price side to my eye it doesn't
fit this high-tech sort of urban
elegance that you find on the rest of
the cabin the key is how does the voice
command work let's take it for a tour
after the beep please say a command
navigation
how would you like this address would
you like to city
after the bead sanfrancisco
7-1 you get the idea it's fairly good at
recognizing what I say but notice every
single piece of data is another beep
response sequence the better nav systems
now particularly in some of the German
cars you just blurt it all out AM and FM
but no HD radio on this guy your
satellite radio buttons there here is
your optical disk and hard drive toggle
15 gigabyte hard drive built into this
thing already becoming passe to be
honest and under aux you got the good
stuff bluetooth streaming your iPod or
USB connection in here you also have an
aux jack you can hook up to now the
Bluetooth audio is pretty rudimentary
that's what you get when you're playing
Bluetooth sound no metatags some dopey
logo and a go to Acura comm message that
looks like dreck one choice only on the
gearbox also taking us back to the old
days a five-speed automatic you do have
paddles up here in Drive those will
temporarily influence the gearshift to
the gear you want that it will drop back
in the drive mode full automatic in
Sport you've got a much better response
holds rpms higher locks out of top gear
and this is also a transmission that
should in a corner downshift or at least
hold that gear instead of up shifting
like a dumb box right in the middle of a
turn at speed
of course the Acura TSX SportWagen is a
wagon not really much of one though of
course I'm biased because I Drive a
wagon rollback - tonneau cover and you
see you've got a very much howdy a4 s
cargo bay I'd love to get them
side-by-side not to compare the volume
that you can get from specs but to
compare the usable shape of getting in
and out of it
you see these stylish compact wagons
have all this rounded occlusion around
here you really want that to be a clean
sweep because this couple of inches of
flange and trim can make the difference
between getting your stuff home from
Ikea or having to pay 60 bucks to get it
delivered now you've got tons of little
smugglers boxes all over the floor here
little one here one like it on the left
here's this big one in the middle
big deep well there and within that
you've got another compartment of
compartments so lots of places to put
small things they are flying around
that's a good thing but I'm concerned
about big things now here in the hood
before we even get to the engine let's
get to the outrage you can't get Honda's
rather excellent corporate v6 in this
car because it's a wagon the Surreal bad
body ISM going on here
the sedan will let you opt into the
bigger motor but this one is stuck with
the 2.4 liter sidesaddle inline 4
perfectly good motor just a hell of a
lot less of it 201 horsepower 170
foot-pounds of torque
moves this 3600 pound car to 60 and
perfectly fine 7.5 seconds but perfectly
fine the MPG on this car is a myth for a
four-cylinder 2230
now as you've noticed there's not much
more conventional a car on the road than
this guy five-speed Automatic 2.4 liter
4 front wheel drive blahdy blahdy blah
but on the road it actually turns into a
little better package than it looks on
paper they've got this car tuned in a
way that I like very responsive at part
throttle in other words when you're
tooling around town or driving normally
on the freeway you've got lots of
responsiveness in the first I don't know
third of the pedal travel that's real
world driving now when you get further
into it more pedal more speed want to
sustain the acceleration that's where
the power plant pretty much starts to
flatten out it runs out of gas when you
get above you now mid throttle 4,000 rpm
you're really starting to push it it
becomes less impressive than it was in
the first few moments of getting off the
line but that works well for an everyday
driver the ride is I wouldn't say harsh
but I would say utilitarian it's uh it's
it's sport but without great sport
handling it's not a bad car to drive it
handles well but it doesn't give you
that feeling of handling that a small
BMW or Audi would give you of course it
doesn't give you that sticker shock
either to get the most out of this car
you really do have to shift it drop it
into sport mode get on the paddles
otherwise you're not going to be in the
exact right rev range for an engine that
like I mention runs out of breath a
little bit your overall impression of
driving it is a fun light possible car
not one that is a tremendous performance
powerhouse a cure would have to give you
the v6 the super handling all-wheel
drive and I don't know another 8 or 10
grand on the sticker to get there
they're going after a different market
ok this car faces at 32
- for your TSX SportWagen but that's
without the tech package since you're
watching a video about this car from
CNET I assume you want that
3650 additional without it you kind of
miss out on all the cool stuff I've
shown you and you need that because this
car doesn't even have that much cool
stuff but the tech package does bring
you 15 gig hard drive DVD surround sound
rear cam run power liftgate all of that
for thirty six fifties of pre
good deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
