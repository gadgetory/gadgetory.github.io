process let's assume you've found the
phone you want on the carrier you want
for the price you want but before you
make your purchase and possibly sign a
two-year contract here are some things
to consider if you're about to buy a
smart phone really ask yourself if
you're gonna use all of those features
if all you need is something for calls
and texts going with a feature phone
could take a healthy chunk off your
monthly payments also take a minute to
shop around some of the best deals and
cell phones aren't offered by your
carrier store call around also check the
usual places online Amazon Best Buy
Walmart eBay next think of the
accessories you're gonna need things
like a case a charger for the car or a
Bluetooth headset you'll almost always
find that these are less expensive
online than in the store but if you
don't factor them in now you'll pay a
huge markup on them when you need them
in a pinch be sure to find out how long
the grace period is for returning your
phone if you only have a few days to try
it out before returning it for something
you may like better
that's good info to know upfront is
there an extended warranty if you're
buying a new phone because your last one
fell on the toilet then a warranty is
probably a worthwhile expense finally
learn everything you can about your
monthly plan how many calling minutes do
you have how many text messages is there
an online tool for keeping track of it
all are there free friends and family
minutes that you can use what are the
roaming charges if you use the phone on
that vacation to Mexico you are planning
even if your phone was free the penalty
for not understanding the details of
your monthly plan can be hundreds of
dollars in unintended fees or paying for
features that you're never gonna use ask
questions hold up the line come back
another day if necessary but don't get
pressured to buy a phone and a monthly
plan that you're not a hundred percent
comfortable with so there you go
hopefully I've given you some good tips
to make buying your next phone a little
easier you can head over to phones
