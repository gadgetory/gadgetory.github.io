with their phones either texting
emailing webbing mapping who knows
what's next
but in the end road rage is as old as
driving
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five other
driving outrages aside from technology
as reported by you seen that car tech
viewers let's get to it
number five is the zipper or not being
aware of it the simple idea that when
lanes merge cars from each lane
alternate coming into single-file the
grief is it that hard
instead you boxed me out when it's my
turn to get in the line and stare
straight ahead like I'm one of those
homeless guys coming up to your window
blending in number four taking two
parking spots park much there are lines
between the spaces that's a dead
giveaway you're only supposed to sit in
one of them luckily full self parking
tech is coming fast and I trust
computers won't be a-holes number three
slow in the fast lane now technically
the fast lane is the passing lane but
let's face it in reality it's the
speeding lane regardless a whole bunch
of you want to be left unempioyed to
risk that ticket by the way the
difference in arrival time between going
55 and 70 is about 14 minutes per hour
number two parking too close oh I get
this one cuz I'm that guy who parks over
there when my passengers roll their eyes
I pointed my pristine 25 year old car
and remind them that's why it looks
better than their two-year old lease so
when you park so close to me that it
would have been easier to climb out of
your sunroof then open your door I see
red before we get to number one you had
some great right in outrages that I
hadn't thought of among my favorites
people who Park with their headlights
shining into the Waffle House big lifted
jeeps that still have to slow to a crawl
to go over a speed bump and cars so
lowered you actually see the driver
wince and contort when going in a
driveway I've seen that actually okay
the number one outrage aside from being
on the phone is merging this is that guy
who comes
right across your bow in the air lane no
signal no gap not even a good speed
match now I'm on the brakes and the guy
behind me runs into my trunk because
he's texting most of you encounter these
outrages multiple times per commute you
say yet violent crime is trending down
in the US so bless you
high-tech cars and modern driving that's
it see net on cars.com i'm brian coulis
