welcome to the apple byte for all the
good stuff the bad stuff and everything
else inside the world of Apple I'll be
your tour guide plus the winners of our
design by humans t-shirt contest but
first let's get to the stories and last
week Tim Cook stoked the apple TV fire
rumors when he appeared on Rock Center
for an interview and respondents of
questions about Apple getting into the
TV business it's a market that we see
that has been left behind it's an area
of intense interest I can't say more
than that so apples getting into rabbit
ear antennas you it now a few days later
the wall street journal published an
article about the big a's development of
their rumored TV set it's a lot of what
we've said before and the report that
Apple's still in the early stage of
testing it's also in the process of
evaluating several TV set designs with
component suppliers and one of those
suppliers is sharp their sources also
add that the apple TV is not considered
a formal project yet translation they're
not even remotely close yet now wouldn't
you guys rather spend your saved up
money on a bunch of blu-rays like
Disney's secret of the wings for your
nieces now during Tim Cook's chatty week
he also told Bloomberg that factories in
the US will start handling some of the
Mac production currently being handled
internationally and production will ramp
up in 2013 the Cupertino kids are
investing 100 million dollars to produce
max here in the US and analysts estimate
it will create about 200 jobs now
sticking with desktops the first batch
of 27 inch imacs have begun delivering
to customers who pre-order them I'm
still waiting for mine but a report from
vr-zone claims to show Intel's plans for
its new fourth generation Haswell
processors there's a lot of numbers here
but these are likely to follow up to ivy
bridge for apple's next Mac refresh now
the top-of-the-line CPU is a three point
five gigahertz core i7 processor with a
3.9 gigahertz turbo boost that might be
the next Mac Pro's BFF
now an apple iphone 5s rumors yep I said
it Peter Misek a Jefferies analyst who's
made up lots of apple stories in the
past expects the next iPhone 5s to have
a new Super HD camera and screen a
better battery and NFC technology he
also makes up more things and says it
could potentially have 128 gigs of
storage a Retina plus display and my
favorite the 5s will come in six to
eight colors sure dude now let's just
say I won't even get into his iphone 6
predictions all right let's check out
this week's app of the week you know
what it is it's google maps now
available for iOS on the iPhone legit
and accurate maps have finally returned
from google with a really clean
interface you'll also now get
turn-by-turn voice directions in the app
the return of street view that works
whatever way you hold your phone and for
city people like myself public transit
returns as well it's really fast and
responsive but the two main drawbacks
right now is that it's currently only
for your iphone and it doesn't integrate
with your built-in contacts but it's
still worth it and hands down it's our
app of the week so go and get it let's
jump into the quick bites Apple recently
fixed an error in their Australian maps
that caused police to issue a warning to
avoid using Apple's maps earlier this
week after the town of mildura was
placed 45 miles away from its actual
location leaving several motorists
stranded in a remote National Park then
they're good old buddy Samsung made sure
to capitalize with a marketing stunt
that seen that Australia took pictures
for us with a setup and a sign that says
oops should have got a samsung galaxy s3
also Apple and Google have decided to
make peace temporarily and have teamed
up to offer more than 500 million
dollars to buy patents from Kodak that
relate to capturing manipulation and
sharing of digital images Kodak has put
them up for sale to fund a turnaround
for the company long live Polaroid baby
and t-mobile and Apple have agreed to
sell products together next year in 2013
which is great for the carrier
people on tmobile that have been
wondering when can they get to use an
iPhone on the network without any
workarounds now it's not confirmed
though if it's for apple's entire lineup
or just its tablets and a report from
glassdoor that lists the best places to
work for every year great Apple this
year as the 34th best company to work
for now last year they were 20th
Facebook was named number one for the
second year in a row but Cena didn't
make their list and I have no idea why I
can't hold this side shot anymore you
need that shot hold it Jimmy it hurts
Charlie give him the plus' 12 volts
beautiful printed that's a wrap that's a
thing of beauty all right let's announce
