it is Thursday December 21st and it's
episode 335 the final episode of 2017
full disclosure this is a filler episode
again just because we are still on
hiatus and this will be pre-recorded but
appropriately enough Ben what are we
talking about okay so today we're
talking about the trend of nostalgia
Tech and also sadly the tech that died
in 2017 so we'll get to both in this
action-packed final podcast of 2017 with
nostalgia tackle let's start with that a
nostalgia talk basically means stuff
that existed like 10 20 years ago that
tech companies decided to dust off the
IP put it in a shiny new packaging
sometimes it's not really an assignee
new packaging it looks exactly the same
as it did before but they're gonna sell
it to you at a lot more than maybe it's
worth many you're right miniaturize but
pricier yeah and like sometimes it's
just add color to it I think the best
example of this is the Nokia 3310 which
is the super cute candy bar phone that
they decided to bring back with snake I
think it had like a 2g connection but it
it did or available in the US right I
think it is coming to the US with 3G but
I guess the big thing question for this
is like why why is this happening not
only with the Nokia 3310 but also with
like a lot of many consoles what do you
guys think I think people hate all the
new tech stuff that's coming out right
now or they're just kind of tired of it
and there's just kind of a you know
let's go back to the way things were but
kind of also remembering oh wait they
really weren't like that great once you
really I think there was a lot of hype
when the Nokia 330 10 was like making a
comeback but I think the general review
was no-one in this day and age should
actually be using this right now well
except for kids it might be a good thing
to like give to your kid it's got really
long battery life you can't really
search the internet it's a very very
simple phone and I
I've repeatedly argued that there could
actually be a market for something like
it mm-hmm and also I mean what is it
like the jitterbug phone that's yeah
constantly similar lines and magazines
that are targeted at very old people um
it's like the same idea like there's a
subset of people that are like this
phone is too complicated for me
I need something where it has a button
yeah maybe maybe nine button may be one
giant under the phone call start nine
buttons to die on that's all I want
okay do you agree with Alfred though
that like this is just you know kind of
we want to go back to a time in tech
where tech wasn't so scary tech wise
just like trying to like steal all of
our information and yes advertising I
mean like that was 2017 was a very good
year of realizing how big and scary
Twitter and Google and Facebook could be
so maybe this was a backlash I mean like
I think that's an interesting theory I
don't know if I like I would I would
want to think about it a little bit more
before I jumped on to it completely well
I think that's nostalgia generally is
not just with tech or with the movies
that you're watching or whatever any any
time that you're kind of reminiscing
about it's thinking about when things
are simpler or easier only remembering
the good parts of it but then like when
you when you get it and you're like
texting is impossible on this phone
that's when you're like oh wait I do
think people might have looked at like
the NSA NES classic and the SNES classic
differently though where there was
essentially just these were really good
games and I want to play them in the way
that like I had played them because they
they were available I'm like for old
console like you could download it on
your Nintendo switch or you could
download on your Wii U or your 3ds even
and you could play like Super Mario
Brothers 3 but like I think people
wanted the whole you know I want to sit
next to my TV and plug in my controller
and you're not gonna have to blow on a
cartridge anymore like they've gotten
rid of like part of the fun yeah it's
logical they could have simulated the
blowing on the cartridge yeah I think
simulates a good word for that I think a
lot of people wanted to simulate like
just you know times when things weren't
as crazy okay fair enough but like
looking at it from a more cynical
perspective do you guys see this as more
of a money grab from Nokia
Tendo arteries the moneygrab why
wouldn't it be a money nostalgia's a
greatest salesman out there mm-hmm I
like that statement yeah for sure
looking at the mini consoles
specifically are there any that you guys
have been really excited about or spend
time with I think you got the SNES I
didn't get any of them no you got one of
them there I have the NES class yeah and
it's in a box I'm probably gonna put it
in my attic for next for the next wave
of nostalgia 20 or 30 years from now and
I'll be able to flip that thing so
there's nothing better than nostalgia
then you're the worst kind of treatment
getting it out of the box so I don't
want lassic classic coming in 2030 look
I'm gonna make some I'm gonna make some
like 30 year old neo millennial in the
year 2045 super happy that they get the
NES classic in box and that's great
when it did come out though I didn't
want to get one but it did remind me of
a lot of great games on the Super
Nintendo come out and I went and took a
few extra steps to just make a Raspberry
Pi mm and I played the games that I
wanted on there that actually aren't on
the SNES classic so that library was
kind of limited yeah and but that was a
lot of licensing problems I was very
disappointed the Chrono Trigger wasn't
on it this is this is a bit of like side
zone but Jonah didn't you get to play
like some version of duck hunt
yeah in VR that's totally like hard it
was a it was a VR reboot of it was
called duck season not dumb time but
they had the dog but they had the dog
you have right you shoot the dog yet you
can shoot the dog definitely shoot the
dog I definitely shot the dog I were
advocating anything about the phrase
shoot the dog except in the video game
oh absolutely let's let's I mean I'm a
vegetarian like music but at least it
might have been but I don't recall it
being like it didn't like fire off that
nostalgia like oh my gosh I totally
remember this
but in addition to it being like the
game and the premise in the format of
Conte also in the VR experience you
started out in a living room that was
totally like something out of stranger
things like it was a very 80s in between
levels of duck-hunt you would go back to
this room and there would be like you
could shoot at things in the room so you
could shoot at like it just tapes and
you can shoot at the television it would
play like a retro commercial did you
like that idea that feels like it's
trying to it's a side element to the
game you're there for the game but it's
just kind of like funny what the VR
there's so they're still exploring it so
much that it's that's very typical in
yards that you have a place where you
can just kind of like knock things over
and see what happens a little like
sandbox sort of playroom but that retro
Cade thing it's it's it's a design
aesthetic in itself with like the neon
sign and the font style why we know what
the name of it is yeah it's very easily
identifiable the same way like stainless
steel is the 1950s diners and
checkerboards and that kind of thing the
the eighties aesthetic is very easy to
identify yeah I kind of wonder like in
20 30 years from now how they're going
to identify the the the design aesthetic
I always wanted in circles it's all
circular design stuff I mean if you look
at Twitter like the avatar like they
changed it from what it used to be into
a circle Facebook followed after
Instagram do the same thing so the
rounding off of corners yep in general
yeah and buns and manbo which is rounded
off of corners in general right
[Laughter]
we also why don't why don't we switch
topics so the tech that died in 27 yeah
I don't know if you guys have to be fair
so you're gonna bring up aim right yeah
I was gonna start with aim yeah to be
fair I feel like aims been dead for a
very long time now I think now that
they're just officially killing people
like oh man I miss aim which I loved aim
I really liked being on a mom I was
gonna you rubes two three five seven no
but but that's what a lot of people's
screen names right Benny
any rubes yeah anyway - this has been
dead for a long time which I guess is
why they officially killed it I suppose
by what I mean I will say this I think
aim was really the first way that we all
communicated with each other online
would you say it opens some doors
closing this one you know like we're all
on gchat now we're all on slack facebook
Messenger and all that stuff and I
really do think aim was a peak precursor
to all that I are see yeah but I aim
mainstream yeah unfortunately even
though it was one of the earliest in the
market like that first mover advantage
didn't actually yeah there's so many
other messaging services most of them
live on mobile really I don't even know
like did aim have a mobile app yes okay
yes it makes sense the big way but I
guess I didn't have it in an absence of
it it had it in the sense that you could
text a number and then it would send
something through your screen name like
online superimpose this was like before
the like whole age of like apps like aim
was like pretty big on like the sidekick
from t-mobile and everyone was on name
there I really appreciate it just
because it was like it was the first
place where I had like developed the
concept of like online friends hmm where
like I would talk like with this one
person in Florida and Michigan like all
the time that I met through like an MMO
it was really cool it's like World of
Warcraft and all that stuff oh and you
would like you traded your yeah we'd
hang out we'd like playing the game with
each other and then it'd just be like oh
I'm signing off but like because I don't
want to play anymore but like if you
want to keep chatting I'm like here on
this screen name did you ever talk to
either of those people on the phone no
no no did you know their real names yeah
okay yeah it's a really interesting name
gave me a false sense of importance
because I felt like I always had to have
it on in case I missed something happen
it was the the first experience of FOMO
and I always felt it necessary to just
have it running to the extent where if
my parents needed to use the phone
I'm waiting for an important message and
that was kind of essentially I felt like
it needed to be my own personal there
wasn't where like without messenger was
available like the same time as aim was
but it wasn't like kosher yet to
Facebook message people like I would get
Facebook messages from people like
freshman year in high school and then it
just be like what is would you like some
kind of loser kind of thing so using
Facebook man yeah yeah it was like that
so it'd be like I know there's been
conversations for me that started on on
facebook Messenger that would be like
hey what's up I need the homework also
what's your aim cuz that's when you
transition from classmates a friend when
you talk to them on aim okay look it's
just like official at the time it was
like just like this other thing you know
I don't have any of your aim handles
which means that I guess we haven't been
friends this whole time old anyway
handles that you would share publicly
now that they're all gonna be dead track
you down I was I was shockingly I was a
real geek when I was a kid and did you
end up here how did I ever never seen it
I'm like a fish out of water and I
really liked Greek and Roman mythology
that was one of my geeky things and so
one of my handles was IO the cow which
is just from its from a Roman myth you
didn't have any numbers no no one else
wanted to be IO the cow is just me I'm
not I'm not gonna share any of my like
in between ones cuz I had gone through
like kind of like a hip hop gangster
phase were in transition yeah but my
first my first one which is still goofy
was dragon boy
11:03 which is just my birthday and I
just like dragons a lot at the time who
doesn't win dragons I still like your
hands it sounds cool yeah that fits very
well into aim what about you Ruby
like it may have been some derivative of
the dude man dude which I used for I
think AOL and Yahoo is my twitter handle
- no no it is not my Twitter handle but
I wanted to avoid to avoid using numbers
I just kept extending for such I would
dude then dude man then dude man dude
somebody out there was actually
dude man dude so I did though dude man
dude what a hack I wonder of cyclical
technology and how we're seeing so much
retro stuff come back around I don't
know if aim necessarily as a platform
we'll come back around but I wonder if
the general practice of like hokey
screen names fun silly American screen
names will ever come back into the
limelight somehow whether in practice or
in another platform I was thinking about
that actually and you actually do see
that nowadays like hokey name stuff on
Instagram with like younger people true
they don't like and fake YouTube
comments yeah so I brought this up in a
conversation that I had with a friend
who like you're not like as new parents
I don't know if you guys do this do you
squat emails for your kids yeah I
haven't I do yeah because my kids last
name is impossible right so no one's
gonna do I talked about this with
somebody though where I was basically yo
your kids not gonna use that for like
until it like they're 18 or so really
good point because like they're not
gonna think that it's cool to have like
their name like just out like as their
actual they have to send a job resume
yeah exactly yeah they're not gonna use
it to like they're 18 or something I
they're probably make like some like
goofy name which is actually really
popular on Instagram right now like even
I I switched my name to like a like the
same goofy name I used on AIM on
Instagram and then I just like squatted
my like my professional name cuz like
somebody's gonna try to take that so
yeah one of the guidance counselor in
college told me that I shouldn't put on
my resume head ciclo and i yahoo.com
which is a head Psychlo if anybody knows
is from Battlefield Earth mm-hmm he's
the head ciclo tell me more she's like
the name she immediately identify it's
like I don't remember remember but I
liked it I loved that movie so much it
was such as like a goofy movie you were
wrong it was it was a really funny movie
it was hilarious
and yeah I even had like a yahoo handle
for a while I since deleted so are
anybody once had ciclo believe it's no
longer squatting yeah full disclosure to
make things fair here one of my
first screen names was Riddick Oh 7-7
because I love terrible pitch black no
pitch black was kind of awesome weight
is the same as Riddick like pitch black
started off as like a single and then
they decided tonight he's like a
franchise out of that core and you can
make arguments either way I love to
pitch black I thought that was bad I was
like I need to break up with this guy
that was my first introduction of Indies
like I didn't really know what the
future was going to hold I thought it
was awesome I thought he was like
cutting up aliens like I want to do that
that's me right so aim was the first
time it didn't it wasn't known as this
was the first time I sub tweeted mmm
even though did you put away messages
away message like your status updates
like before Facebook existed a wedge on
a more like status updates and I totally
sub like sub tweeted yeah I would always
have a way messages that weren't
actually like when I was in a way yeah
they were just like it yeah the status
exactly and yeah I definitely did that I
go I mean I leave my slack on the way
all the time
yeah just like shoutouts all the people
who loved talking smack about me behind
my back
wait so you wait are you saying you
don't leave like Alkaline Trio song
lyrics in your away message because
that's what I did I did that too but my
favorite it was still you know how a
name if you did percent and it show
these screen names of whoever was
looking at it I didn't know yeah so I
would always do like percent n is a jerk
and then people like hey oh call me out
like that
I remember that you were that was clever
that's a deep cut I have no idea I'm
talking about I know what he's talking
about
um I I did want to be essentially
mirrored yeah but you should be like the
Facebook prank where's like check out
this profile of this idiot and it's like
a link that goes back to your own
profile no matter who clicks it har-har
and then yeah one other one this has
been a like a very enjoyable aim
conversation but do you guys want to
talk about let's say like 3d TV or
snapchat spectacles and yes I know
snapchat spectacles
aren't actually dead but it's been
big crashing light I feel really dumb
for buying them now I like yeah you saw
the whole story about waiting in line
for them and stuff and I like yeah this
is gonna be cool it was an amazing
marketing ploy yeah super really stupid
because like I kept thinking about like
yeah this is just like when I bought the
first Android phone this is I'm gonna be
able to tell people in a few years like
I got the first one be so cool and well
so you I think have used vesicles more
than any of us why did it
why did my biggest issue with it was
that it killed my phone battery life to
the point was like it is not worth it to
like and also it'd just be like I'd have
to be wearing it at all times for it to
be useful yeah and if I have to take
something and put it on my face I like
to record something I might as well just
take my phone out and read so it didn't
it didn't actually have increased
utility yeah yeah and it just felt like
I was forcing it sometimes too much
we're like so when I had it it was
around Thanksgiving when I got it so I
did stuff like oh here's me like on my
bike yeah cuz like I basically did all
the stuff like you need two hands to
record so like oh here's me like on my
bicycle and here's me cooking a meal
together and then I think about if I
didn't have the spectacles I wouldn't be
sharing this at all cuz I don't go on
snapchat that much to begin with so I'm
like I'm really only sharing this
because I've X ecause I'm not like the
spectacles don't enhance the experience
they like ya force the experience I like
there's no point of me having this and
then the second point was I'm like
killing my battery life mmm so I was
like this is this isn't really worth it
but it is cool to just sit on my mantel
or something like that and then it kind
of all went to hell after they started
making them available on like Amazon so
anybody could buy it because then it
just stopped being this commodity and it
just became like or it became a come on
yeah oh yeah stop being this yeah I
remember that like on Twitter anybody
that they need tech reporters that had
gotten their hands on snapchat
spectacles early would always like put
it in there like on their profile pics
and be like haha I got this cool new
thing whatever and yeah I totally
crashed and burned him like wasn't that
it wasn't as impressive as it could have
been and it wasn't as impressive as it
like snapshots like hope for a bunch of
different yes it was was that like
they they were so all in they were the
spectacle is that they're like we're a
camera company yeah change their entire
identity I mean they tried to yeah I
felt really dumb but I will say I don't
think I feel as dumb as Evan Spiegel
does I think you always feels right you
know things go wrong I was just ahead of
the game he's a tech CEO what are you
right back you know like that's just
that's how they operate so so we are
almost out of time
let's make predictions real quick to
close out next year what's going to come
back with no sounds like from the dead
wand or fail all at the same time Atari
box is coming next year so it's another
mini console but not from the NES you
know those consoles are gonna be I don't
know for lack of a better word a plague
for a long time and I'm yeah I don't
mean that to take that negatively I
don't have anything against so many
consoles I think they're fun but I don't
think that's gonna slow down they're all
gonna be cyclical again we will see we
will eventually see a mini switch I'm
looking forward to it I will say that
like with all these other like many
consoles though unless Sony gets into it
I do i order like Sega which they have I
think they're all going to fail just
because the Sega is a third party though
yeah that too like there's really no
quality control Plus like so that makes
me apprehensive about the inevitable
Dreamcast my favorite vault yeah that
unlike the Atari thing that you're
talking I don't like I think they're
overestimating how much people like
aren't nostalgic for like Atari like you
know like I can make the argument for
NES classic or a Super Nintendo classic
where like people like grew up like
loving these games I don't think there's
anybody that's like oh man I really
missed pong and like Space Invader but
that's hard for you to say because you
didn't grow up on those yeah funny
people still did so by the time the
timing works out that first it's the
elemental eyes are already available
like through apps and all that stuff
it's kind of hard to get super mario is
NES but like not legally it's like the
cost of anything in this super low like
like the thing is already created
there's already a baked an audience
that's why it's so easy to make these
mini consoles also covered indirect
consoles
live as long mm-hmm because the
manufacturing error is intentional
manufacturing error so NES has outlived
GameCubes so you're some bad example
GameCubes actually literally I want to
see mine its shelf porn that's what it
is more than anything like even if they
do end up collecting dust relatively
little dust because they're so small you
should want to keep having this stuff on
their shelves I think that's the biggest
part of it it's a good point so what's
what's gonna die next year I mean like
I'm gonna go out on sort of a limb a bit
and say the Apple home pod it's been
delayed to next year I think it's
overpriced
and yeah the still just this is just a
theory by that that one may end up being
a dud and an unfortunate one for Apple
so we'll say I might be totally wrong
but if we're making predictions that's
the one I'm probably not probably
Bitcoin is a very good it's gonna go up
to a hundred thousand before it flames
out do you have any on my beat there's a
lot of in digital media there's a lot of
these me to video services that nobody
uses like go 98 Verizon I'm just waiting
for like when they all just start
getting like a wave didn't they just
shut down fullscreen fullscreen s pod
their subscription video service shut
down earlier this year that's a shame I
had literally just kind of got it in the
fullscreen they have some really fun and
during original content on there but not
enough of a library to support anything
sincerely long-term yeah but they have
some really great stuff from like grace
Helbig and exclusives by the Hannah Hart
mamrie Hart and I really enjoyed that
stuff it's a shame to see that go away
cuz the app also works really well yeah
you know actually I hadn't tried their
app but like diet like complete opposite
as I know the go 90 app doesn't work
very well every time I've use it as
always I've never tried to go 90 yeah
I'm very many people have r.i.p so
there's a lot of those there's like go
90 and there's something called C so and
there's like all I know that one yeah
there's all these um little doll these
traditional media companies like we're
gonna put a lot of money into content
and put it on the digital stuff in an
app people pay us money for
it's like maybe mmm I know we're gonna
see foreign meteoric rise and fall in a
hurry Tamagotchi forever whatever that
is
Tamagotchi forever coming to mobile next
year game will mark Tamagotchis 20th
anniversary this is gonna be the Pokemon
go of 2018 yeah uh yeah I can't wait to
write about that everyday here that's
gonna be super fun 50 ways to keep your
Tamagotchi from dying 50 creative ways
