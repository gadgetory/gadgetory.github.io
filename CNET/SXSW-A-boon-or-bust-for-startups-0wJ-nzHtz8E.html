an even bigger slice of the red hot
startup scene ever since Twitter broke
out in 2007 the 20 year old festival of
music film + interactive media has been
seen as proving ground for fledgling
businesses since then the parties the
pitches and the products have come fast
and furious but some experts wonder just
how valuable the South by Southwest
experience really is for the most part I
think a lot of these companies come
they're expecting to kind of break out
and they really don't because they get
lost and my you know amidst the noise of
you know hundreds of other companies but
then there are the parties you have to
schmooze that's what you have to do if
you need customers you need partners if
you need to meet engineers or you need
to raise money you have to be there I
mean you just why why would you avoid
the OP the possibility that at some
drunken night at three in the morning
you will you know you might just run
into that person that will cut you to
check that's so important or introduce
you to the partnership that you need
cashing in on networking opportunities
isn't an easy formula most trade shows
even big ones like CES the problem with
being a startup at CES is no one cares
about you you're just in the shadow of
these big companies making big product
announcements of shiny new TVs and home
audio systems and really large
well-financed you know splashy projects
as for South by Southwest it's still the
hottest ticket in town this year it will
launch startup village a one-stop-shop
for entrepreneurs offering pitch
sessions and networking events CNET's
six years South by Southwest veteran
speculates if the festival's best years
could be behind it I worry if it's you
know kind of like gone you know jump the
shark or gone past the point of no
return and it just keeps getting bigger
and bigger and I think that you know as
you know I always ask the question of
you know do these companies know why
they're going and apparently they get
some return because the you know it just
keeps getting bigger each year for cnet
news I'm Sumi das
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
