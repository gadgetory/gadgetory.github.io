and it's time to get loaded google has
compiled a collection of high-resolution
before and after satellite images of
Japan that depict the area's most
affected by the recent devastation
google hopes that this will better
illustrate the magnitude of the event
and motivate us all to help in some form
or fashion also AT&amp;amp;T is allowing
customers to call or text to japan for
free until the end of march this is for
customers in the US and puerto rico to
communicate with japanese friends and
family and the rest of us can of course
text redcross to 90999 in order to make
a ten dollar donation to the red cross
relief effort in other Google News the
company may be ready to take yet another
attempt at building a social network
rumors of a new google social network
circulated this weekend google has
denied that it will launch this week but
not that the project exists the code
name is circles it focuses on your
smaller networks of friends and family
in a more private form of social
networking as opposed to just putting
your whole life on facebook for all the
world to see due to power limitations in
japan sony is temporarily shutting down
the servers for its massive multiplayer
online role-playing games such as Final
Fantasy and play online games and
services the games will be back but
Sonia is trying to comply with the power
companies requests to conserve so
they're going offline temporarily there
is no indication of how long this
blackout will last but your account will
not be billed while the servers are down
Netflix is not interested in selling you
movies only renting them to you movie
studio execs have been grumbling that
they have asked Netflix to sell movies
and the movie rental company has said
hmm not interested the request involved
adding a Buy button next to the rental
options but for now this is a
non-starter a new wireless spectrum is
being hotly contested by GPS
manufacturers a company called
LightSquared is planning to build a
wireless broadband system via satellite
on the l-band frequency which is
adjacent to the frequency used by GPS
GPS companies are saying this is too
close and it threatens GPS usefulness by
potentially
I mean the frequencies companies have
banded together to form save our GPS org
the SEC has issued a conditional waiver
allowing lightsquared's network to get
started and these companies want to
prevent that from happening or at the
very least they want the public to have
a 45-day comment period on the matter
and they want the SEC to conduct
conclusive research on this network and
of course the ipad2 sold like
gangbusters this weekend in fact the
device sold out in most stores and back
ordered on the Internet analysts predict
that seventy percent of iPad to buyers
our new ipad owners preliminary
estimates are that nearly 1 million
units were sold in just three days and
finally here's an app that i think apple
will probably pull from the itunes app
store soon the sexy time soundtrack app
it uses the iPhones accelerometer to
crack jokes while you're making love to
someone else or to yourself I suppose it
uses the phone's accelerometer to
measure your movement the app costs one
dollar in the App Store and please do
not send us reports of how it works none
of us here have tested it it will not be
featured on tap that out that's your
news of the day remember cnet com /
