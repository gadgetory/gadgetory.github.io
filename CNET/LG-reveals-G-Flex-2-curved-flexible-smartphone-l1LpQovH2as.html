introduce the LG G flex 2 take a moment
and take it in at LG we're in the
business of creating better lives so
I'll focus primarily on three areas of
the phone which enhance the everyday
mobile experience design innovation and
convenience let's start with the beauty
in the details last year when we
launched the original G flex people came
away with a different sense that this
was unique in the old days analog wired
phones they were curved and the receiver
and the mouthpiece fit comfortably
against her face then came smartphones
with their giant screens and we gave up
curves in favor of mobile connectivity
with the G flex and now the G flex 2 we
found a way to merge mobility and create
comfort through a view of the curved
smartphone when designing the G flex 2
repaid attention to every angle of each
curve to make sure that the phone was
more visually stunning and it was
comfortable weather was in your hand
along your face or in your pocket but
the phone doesn't have just one curve in
fact it has four along the front the
curved surface brings the mouthpiece
right to your lips the back also has a
curve for a more comfortable grip the
metallic sides top and bottom of the
phone curve accentuating the overall
design the result is a truly sculptured
smartphone that looks like a work of art
from any angle the LG G flex 2 is built
around a flexible 5.5 inch display which
we believe is the sweet spot where
you're viewing content or interacting
with your phone while remaining
comfortable in your palm of the hand
this unique flexible screen has been
bumped up to 1080p full HD which makes
everything on the screen stunning vivid
and crisp the p oled display which gives
a G flex 2 its unique shape and
durability is even more precise we
wanted to make the G flex 2 a very
special phone so we took time with the
details as an example the pattern on the
back we're inspired by the path of the
stars as they float across the night sky
the patterns wrap around the top and
bottom front bezel and as a result make
it look like more like a piece of art
the striking colors for the G flex 2 are
truly inspired by technology and passion
the bold platinum silver is a variation
of the classic color of modern machinery
at the same time we're offering the G
flex 2 in a striking flamenco red a
color than the body's emotion now let's
talk about innovation that you've never
seen before with the G flex 2 we took
everything we learn from the original G
flex including the flexible display the
curve battery the flexible chassis and
we reach further in addition to the full
HD screen that I spoke about the G flex
2 gets a brand-new chipset and our
latest lightning-fast laser autofocus
and image stabilization camera
technology the G flex 2 is the world's
first officially announced smartphone
powered by a 64 octa-core chipset we use
the Snapdragon premium 800 series
chipset from our friends at Qualcomm and
as a result its unrivaled we've paired
this powerful chipset with quartz
Android 5.0 lollipop which is right now
the best mobile operating system in the
market the G flex 2 is a beauty on the
out
side but inside it's a beast what we
have done is made sure that the G flex 2
was built to last we like to let our
consumers inspire our innovations so our
research has shown when it comes to
phones consumers are concerned about
cracking their screens so we asked our
research team to work on finding a way
to make our screens stronger and more
durable so to start as you can see from
this video of our drop test we've
increased the durability by enhancing it
up to thirty percent in part this is
because of the curve form factor itself
as well as a special treatment designed
by LG on the cover glass the curved form
factor makes the phone more absorbent to
the impact it spreads that disperses the
energy across the screen as opposed to
when the conventional flat phone is
dropped as I share the G Flex's cover
glass is treated by a proprietary by LG
and as you can see from the test results
we've increased the strength by up to
twenty percent when we introduce the
self-healing back on the original G flex
people couldn't believe it scuff up your
phone and three minutes later it looks
practically new but with the G flex 2 we
sped up the healing process so now its
measured in seconds versus minutes and
in 10 seconds is all it takes the
improve of formula works so quickly that
it's hard to see it actually just
disappeared before your eyes so you'll
hear the term innovation for a better
life from us throughout the year and
it's more than just a slogan it's a
promise from us
