look at the Sony Vaio duo 13 now this
looks like a 13 inch slate style tablet
a little bit thick for a tablet but that
is because you take the duo 13 you put
it down on the table like this take your
finger just lift up with one finger
right here and then look at that you've
got something that's kind of like a
laptop or maybe like a little all-in-one
PC it's a concept that we've seen before
even from Sony when Windows 8 first
launched they had an 11 inch version
called the duo 11 now the hinge on that
model was a little bit more complicated
it wasn't quite as overall economic and
we thought it was a good idea but the
execution did not quite nail it this new
13 inch version improves on a lot of
things about it obviously it has a
bigger screen I think the keyboard works
better instead of a tiny little track
point they've actually managed to work a
very small touchpad up in the front here
that's better than not having any
touchpad although it is a very shallow
one it's kind of a long rectangle so not
super great for navigating but I
definitely rather have that than nothing
Sony does the manage to get one of
Intel's new fourth generation Core
iSeries processes in here otherwise
known by the codenamed Haswell which
makes us one of the first Haswell
generation systems that we've seen Sony
actually has a couple of really thin
really light 11 and 13 inch ultrabooks
tile laptops that also have those and as
traditional laptops those are a lot more
useful this has the bonus of being sort
of a slate style tablet and something
you can use on a desktop I think the
biggest flaw here is this screen while
you can move it up and down sort of like
this one you fold it into tablet mode
it's not actually really adjustable it
doesn't stay at another angle and I
can't tilt it up any further than this
you can see the a fairly extreme angle
that it's at right here so this angle
may not work for you if that's the case
then you're pretty much out of luck it's
a cool experimental laptop I'd like to
have made a lot of improvements over the
last generation it starts at about
$1,300 and up that is a lot to ask
people to pay for an experiment
especially for something that may not be
as universally useful as either a
convertible tablet where you detach the
screen or just a regular
Ultra book style laptops I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Sony Vaio duo
