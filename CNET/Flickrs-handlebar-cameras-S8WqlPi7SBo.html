champs day as taken from the handlebars
of her bicycle once every minute oh look
here she is at cnet headquarters getting
ready for this interview as long as the
bike is moving and then for a few
minutes afterwards it keeps taking
pictures it's a slightly different sort
of mediated view of some of these
experience as they're traveling you know
through time and space or you know where
they live Yahoo own flickr has tricked
out 20 of these bikes with solar powered
nokia n95 camera phones there's also
plug so if it's days like this where
there may not be so much Sun coming in
you can plug it in and charge it that
snap a picture once every minute and
instantly upload them to a Flickr
photostream it has gps yes and it has
Wi-Fi capabilities while the bikes
moving and for a little bit afterwards
it's uploading the pictures 20 such
bikes were given to Flickr users all
over the world to document their daily
travels I was a little reluctant at
first because there's no way to make it
stop taking photos so like you can kind
of track me home and track me to work
and kind of live online anyway and I
Twitter a lot and I blog a lot and I
flick her a lot and I'm not that private
so I got over it pretty quick san
francisco-based ahmed gupta commutes to
work in a spike and has already recorded
more than 4,000 photos after two weeks
in the saddle I three or four friends
are gonna have it for a day or two at a
time so the bike can kind of experience
other parts of San Francisco that I
don't normally see smile you're on
camera what's the bike name uh barack
obama so i can say Barack Obama's my
bicycle as much as he loves his bike
almut says he secretly wants it to get
stolen so we can track the would-be
thieves every move through the GPS and
the camera and then watched it of course
on his flickr photostream I'm seen a
reporter Cara sue boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
