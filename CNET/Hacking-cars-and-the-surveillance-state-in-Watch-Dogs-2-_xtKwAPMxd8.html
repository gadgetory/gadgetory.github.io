I mean it's the birthplace of the modern
technology and being a Hatcher game in a
city like that
it was just a perfect sitting on top of
it it's sunny I mean there's a lot of
color and you want to shift it though so
for all these reasons we do that and
it's not only San Francisco it's the
whole Bay Area so yeah yeah Marin County
you have Oakland you have Silicon Valley
it's not a one-for-one of obviously you
know roughly twice the size of watchdogs
one but we have this you know big chunk
of the Bay Area in our game can you give
me some anecdotes about personal things
the team encounters with technology that
the team had were they like okay this is
this is in the real word we want to
bring it to the game because it affected
me in this way I mean the most important
one is as hiking cars you know that's it
that's been a big big thing in the past
few years and we obviously we use
shortcuts because it's an
action-adventure it's super quick and
fast but you know the vehicles are
really vulnerable and they enter through
all sorts of ways and they can take
control of their you know the steering
system and all of these and actually
self-driving cars now so there's a risk
there and for us too we just put it you
know as again for fun as a game play
super useful but that's our that's a
real thing is this something that now
that you know all these things are
possible because you've gotten done some
of the research are you afraid of any of
these things happening to you what are
you afraid of in terms of technology
yourself I would say I'm more aware you
know because you can't live being afraid
but you have to be aware that these
things are you know exist and there's
real real implications in those what are
you what are you the most aware of when
you go about your daily life well I
guess the things I'm most worried about
is things I don't know yeah you know if
we know about it then it's good we can
do something about it but what is being
done with all this data you know and is
it being misused in ways that I'm not
aware of like my personal data are they
you know can can you profile someone and
you know learn about his lives and then
overlap this information to be able to
get a picture of someone and you know in
a way so it's a bit big big big
brother-ish you know it's like thinking
okay where did you go what did you do
who you are with and all these things
overlap and now all this information is
very personal and if you put that in
public hands or in the wrong hands I
don't think if it could be a bit
worrying I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
