today we're taking a look at the switch
infinia LED bulb this is a 10 watt LED
that is designed to replace a 60-watt
incandescent it puts out 800 lumens
worth of light and shines at a color
temperature of 2,700 degrees Kelvin the
switch bulb claims to last 25,000 hours
before burning out which is about 25
years if you run it for 3 hours a day
that puts it on par with almost every
other LED bulb that we've looked at
unlike some other LEDs though the switch
is a good bulb when it comes to turning
on and turning off quickly it's
instantaneous it doesn't have that one
second delay that we've seen from other
bulbs like this utilitech pro bulb at a
price of 11 99 per bulb this is a
affordable LED replacement if you're
looking to upgrade your lights the
question is how does it stack up against
other affordable LED replacement lights
that we've looked at before well let's
take a look here we've got the Philips
slim style LED that this is an
affordable low-cost LED from Philips
that just came out this year it's got a
unique flat design that is very
interesting no one else is doing it
quite like that in the major
manufacturing space it produces these
sort of shadowy areas up and down here
if you look you can see them if I spin
the light and you don't love that but
it's still pretty good bulb and
definitely a good price here in the
middle I've got the crease 60 watt
replacement bulb this is an excellent
soft white bulb with a nice yellowy
incandescent hue and it's one of our
favorite bulbs with a 10 year warranty
and finally here on the right we've got
the switch infinia 60 watt replacement
bulb and you can see that it's a lot
like the Cree Bowl both in terms of its
brightness and color temperature and
they both sit on the low end of the
color temperature scale and they both
have 800 lumens so that makes a lot of
sense there's not a whole lot separating
these two in light quality if you ask me
and the price is about the same to the
switch retails for 1199 the Cree bulb
retails for about 12 97 and they're both
cheaper if you get those energy rebates
the Cree bulb has that 10-year warranty
but the switch bulb is very interesting
because it's offering a lifetime
warranty for residential use so if you
buy this bulb and it burns up ever you
can return it and get a new one that's
very cool that's a lot of reassurance
for consumers who aren't quite ready to
trust that LEDs are going to last the 25
and 30 years
that the manufacturers are promising now
there are other distinctions between the
Cree bulb and the switch bulb the Cree
has this sort of fancy collar guy might
wear in the 16th century and that's just
the heat sink that dissipates the heat
from the bulb the collar on the switch
bulb is more like something you'd put on
a sick dog it's got very simple design
you can't really see the heat sinks and
it does really put out a lot of heat
when you're running it so that's a good
thing too at six ounces the switch bulb
is also a lot heavier than the three
point eight ounce Cree bulb so if you've
got a flex lamp or something that needs
a lighter weight bulb you probably want
to go with Cree / switch but all that
said these are both very good bulbs and
I'm really glad that a bulb as good as
Cree has got some really solid
competition here that's only a good
thing for the consumer for cnet I'm
right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
