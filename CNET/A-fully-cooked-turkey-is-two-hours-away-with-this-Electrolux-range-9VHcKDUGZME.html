about with this Electrolux induction
range but let's focus on the most
outstanding one the perfect turkey
button so this cooking mode alleges that
all you need to do is plug in a
temperature probe into your turkey estoy
press the buttons and the other will do
the rest for you I have a surprised that
it actually does what it promises now
that wasn't quite perfect but a 13-pound
bird cooked in just two hours
Thanksgivings are going to be different
if you decide to take this Electrolux
home and it's not an oven that can only
be used just once a year there are some
other cool features that are really
liked such as the induction cooktop
which can boil a huge pot of water in
just 5 minutes thanks to the really
efficient safe power of induction
technology there's also to convection
fans in the oven cavity that make
cooking really anything including a
turkey a breeze now there are a few
downsides to this Electrolux oven the
oven cavity is kind of small and the
broiler works a little too hard which
means we got a lot of charred burgers
during testing and the cost of this unit
is 37 49 which is definitely going to
put this out of a lot of people's price
range but if you really value fast
cooking and want to impress folks at
Thanksgiving this Electrolux is the way
to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
