reviewing iPad keyboards and keyboard
cases for a bunch of years now I feel
like since the iPad first came out and
they're useful if you're going to type a
lot on your iPad even though you can tap
on that screen it's nice to have a
Bluetooth keyboard and your options are
to go with a detached one or go with one
that comes in a case and the Logitech
keyboard folio is sort of the perfect
example of why keyboard cases are great
in keyboard cases or maybe not so hot
now it's interesting because Logitech
made a really fantastic gadget in fact
hey it's right here
it's the Logitech ultrathin keyboard and
this was reviewed last year it's really
slim it docks in really nicely very
portable keyboard feels great it's
really hard to beat now what a Logitech
do with their latest well it got bigger
it got bulkier and in adding that case
you can see here it's become almost like
a mini laptop and the iPad docks into
this and you view this flexible plastic
you rubber bracket magnets secured at
the bottom of the case here it can stay
in one position or it can fold flat for
for plane travel or it can fold back
around into a kind of a book type form
and this is one point three eight pounds
for just this that's about the weight of
the iPad itself so you're doubling the
weight and you're really doubling the
thickness to get a clean look but it's
it's really so bulky that you know you
wonder why it needed to be this way for
maybe for institutional use for kids
because it has a nice sturdy you know
feel you feel like you could take a take
a beating and still work it might be
really useful in that regard but the
keyboard is a little bit different and
it's interesting because Logitech seems
to experiment each time with little tiny
tweaks to the keyboard even though they
had a great solution here the keyboard
has rounded slightly convex keys if your
keyboard fetishes too like me that means
that I found I didn't really hit the
keys quite a solidly as on the
ultra-thin keyboard cover also the
layout is a little bit different they
did some compression here to try to
create
larger and wider key spacing so you see
caps lock and tab keys have been
combined with Q and a theoretically
that's fine but it creates a sense of a
slight shift to the left so I found I
was fumbling for keys a little bit more
than I normally would those are minor
quibbles one of the advantages here is
hey there's a nice little loop at the
front that accepts a stylus if you're
really in a styli or capacitive
paintbrushes yes there are those all
told this is a lot better built than
most keyboard cases that I've seen there
are some that feel a little flimsy and
there's certainly some out there that
don't have that great a set of keyboards
to go with them so Logitech is still
above average but I think there's a
little bit of a disappointment if you
really like a sturdy set on your iPad to
go typing then take a look at it I'm
Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Logitech Keyboard folio available in
black and several other colors also for
the iPad Mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
