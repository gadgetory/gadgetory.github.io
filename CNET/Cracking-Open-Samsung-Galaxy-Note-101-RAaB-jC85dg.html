powerful feature packed and expensive
Android tablet but as I'll show you
today it's also a snap to open easy to
service and has a few design
improvements over last year's 10-inch
Galaxy Tab I'm Bill Detweiler and this
is cracking open after cracking open
Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 last year I
criticized the tablet for feeling flimsy
and having tamper resistant screws on
the back cover thankfully Samsung
addressed both these concerns in the new
10 inch note now opening the note 10.1
isn't difficult but there is a trick to
it you must remove the piece of trim
that runs along the device's upper edge
and the three Phillips screws underneath
then starting at the top of the back
cover and working your way down each
side pop loose the tabs with each side
free you can then lift the cover off
from the top now that we're inside a few
things jump out at us first the notes
internal design is very similar to last
year's 10-inch Galaxy Tab the battery
sits in the centre of the case with the
motherboard at the top and speakers on
either side the ribbon cables for the
digitizer display and docking connector
run from the bottom edge across the
battery to the motherboard ii like the
tab most of the notes hardware is easily
accessible and can be removed with a
triple zero Phillips screwdriver
unfortunately also like the tab the
display and front panel assembly are a
single unit the notes internal frame
which holds the LCD in place is attached
to the front panel assembly with a
process called thermoplastics taking now
to remove the frame and get to the
display you must break these steaks now
if you're careful you can do this
without damaging the display or the
internal frame so technically you can
replace one without replacing the other
but it's clear that Samsung meant for
the
screen front panel and frame to be
replaced as one piece
despite their similarities there are a
few important differences between the
note and the tab first are the storage
slot for the notes S Pen and the
embedded contact which tells the tablet
when the stylus is in use second is the
piece of molding that runs around the
tablet's outer edge and is mounted
between the front panels bezel and
internal frame those plastic stakes I
mentioned earlier are actually part of
this molding the older Galaxy Tab didn't
have this molding its front panel was
attached directly to the internal frame
now given that the notes back cover
feels just as flexible as the tabs and
their internal frames are so similar I
suspect this molding helps give the note
a more rigid feel which is a big
improvement over the Galaxy Tab overall
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a solid
Android tablet it has a 1.4 gigahertz
quad core Exynos processor two gigs of
RAM front and rear cameras a micro SD
card slot and comes with either 16 or 32
gigs of storage our test unit was a
Wi-Fi only model but an HSPA+ global
version is also available as CNN's Eric
Franklin wrote this is the best Samsung
tablet yet now for more information on
the Galaxy Note 10.1 including real
