rolling robot that's been around for
years it's also a programmable
educational toy the education targeted
Sphero spark launched last year along
with an app that works at step-by-step
programming which can create and share
educational plans with teachers and
students the new versions spark Plus
adds an anti-glare and anti scratch
coding and faster tap to connect
Bluetooth smart for educators using a
bunch in classrooms if you haven't used
Sphero spark it shows how much this
hundred $29 robot can do painting maize
running precise turning and this little
balls waterproof and shockproof Sphero
has LED lights and inductive charging
and it's motors can make it spin at
various speeds and directions using
Android iOS or Amazon tablets and phones
to remote-control it unlike bb-8 Sphero
is silent but the updated lightning labs
app adds programmable sounds to make it
feel like your little coding buddy is
beeping and beeping there are hundreds
of free activities to browse and crowd
creative projects curated by Sphero it's
already in use in over a thousand
schools and the new app has both Sphero
and community created activities some
use coding or building and completing
tasks like chariot or boat enclosures to
win races or designing completing a maze
others model systems like planetary
motion or use the sphero's to make art
or just dance a number of activities are
designed to stem challenges and the
included course instructions can
organize into classes in app it's
another great example that coding toys
for kids are everywhere and even without
a class of my own to teach they're
pretty fun too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
