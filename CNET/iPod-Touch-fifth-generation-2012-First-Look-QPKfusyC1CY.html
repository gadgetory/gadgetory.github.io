the new iPod touch which is now
available today this was announced back
at the iPhone 5 event a few weeks ago
and has not been available until now it
is a new fifth generation iPod Touch
model alongside an iPod Nano that also
came out and this brings to the table a
lot of new designs it's really kind of a
top-to-bottom reinvention of the iPod
touch in the same way that the iPhone 5
was but to a different end this is a lot
thinner and a lot lighter believe it or
not than the iPhone 5 but it also
obviously is not a phone and doesn't
require a contract but also has slightly
different set of specs under the hood
I'll go into that in a second now what's
the same here is a 4-inch Retina display
this is down to the pixel the same IPS
Retina display that you're going to get
on the iPhone 5 and that gives us a very
iPhone 5 II feel if you walk into an
Apple store you're gonna see a lot that
feels similar but the shape the design
of this iPod is very different it's a
thinner it's got hey this crazy wrist
loop which attaches to the back Apple
says is good refusing it as a camera I
also say it's good if you're using it
with kids and it also has a variety of
candy colors though you can't tell that
here this comes in black which is the
model I have plus all the others have
white faces and there are ones with blue
backs yellow backs there's a red back
and that's new for the iPod Touch that
matches what you see in the iPod nanos
and kind of returns to the Apple candy
colored theme that we see arise once in
a while and I think it's going to create
a little more of an appeal about this
it's also gonna stand out more in the
store next to the iPhone now what did I
mean by different
well this uses an a5 processor not an a6
that matches what you'd find in the
iPhone 4s and also the second generation
iPad it's a dual-core processor now it
works with Siri which is built into this
finally and all the iOS 6 apps work here
you can get Apple maps with flyover and
everything runs really smoothly but it
may have a slight impact in terms of the
way the games look but that Retina
display is going to be a killer app for
video quality the fact that you can look
at it in 16:9 and be able to look at
videos with less letterboxing and also
play games that are potentially iPhone 5
compatible and be able to take advantage
of all that stuff on the App Store
that's gonna be a big appeal here
another change is the camera now there
have been a two-year gap since the last
iPod Touch last years was really an
iteration of the same product that had
been around in 2010 that an a4 processor
and the camera back then took almost VGA
quality pictures and 720p video this is
1080p video and it shoots it with image
stabilization which is a lot like what
you find in the iPhone 5 but the camera
is 5 megapixels so it's not 8 megapixels
but it does have a lens construction
like the iPhone 5 so it's really kind of
a hybrid and it has panorama which is
that new camera feature and all the
other iOS 6 features it has HDR has a
backlit sensor and so far the pictures
look really sharp on it it's definitely
the by far the best camera that you've
ever seen on iPod Touch and Apple
clearly is indicating that with that
wrist strap they're intending that this
really becomes a replacement camera for
you that extends to the front because
you also have an HD camera which is like
the iPhone 5 so it can take 1.2
megapixel snaps you can also get 720p
front-facing video that's really great
now of course it's also a music player
won't get into that because you know you
know about that although the capacities
here are 32 gigs and 64 gigs and the
prices are a little bit high $2.99 and
399 there is no budget level one and
that's because now the fourth generation
iPod Touch the older one that's in it
$1.99 and you can get a 16 gig or a 32
gig of that so if you're pricing this
out you may want to get that budget
fourth gem but if you're buying this
it's got to start at $2.99 what you're
getting here is a very light even I've
used the iPhone for a couple of weeks
now and this is a really light really
thin when we looked at the last iPod
touch we're already marveled about all
the features that are on this it really
is a device that is a multi-use device
you're talking about using this for
games for face time for camera use and
of course you can connect this and use
it the same way you would use an iPhone
to check email to browse the web to use
a wide variety of apps the only thing
you can't do with this is get a GPS or
use it for a cellular use outside of a
Wi-Fi hotspot and that really makes this
a little pocket computer and pushes it
well beyond maybe the definitions
what an iPod was or maybe this was the
definition of an iPod in the first place
that's why it's not called a music
player it's meant to be saying
multi-purpose and this new iPod touch is
absolutely the best iPod that's been
around and it's a pretty cool device
even outside of that so there you have
it I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at
the new 5th generation iPod touch from
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
