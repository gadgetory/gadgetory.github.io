personality I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update move over Siri
there's a new girl in town and her name
is cortana she's Microsoft's version of
a voice-activated virtual assistant for
Windows Phones she's got brains and
personality and she's arriving soon to
Windows Phones in a software update
Microsoft gave us a preview during the
company's developer conference in San
Francisco which is going on now she was
named after the sexy computer assistant
from the Halo video game but she's not
as sexy on your phone because she's just
a circle but Microsoft did try to give
the Windows Cortana a certain bit of
charm in her answers and the company
hired a team of writers to craft her
dialogue if you asked who is your daddy
she'll say big deal but aside from jokes
she's designed to get smarter the more
you interact with the phone by picking
up on your interests she can warn you if
traffic is bad on the way to an
appointment in your calendar and she can
set reminders for very specific things
for example you can ask to be reminded
of something the next time your mom
calls you and some apps also work with
voice commands like you can ask Hulu to
add a show to your queue or play a show
Cortana is still in beta to work out all
the kinks but Microsoft promises Cortana
will be more intelligent than Siri don't
make a girl a promise you can't keep but
there's more coming to Windows phones
than Cortana
you'll be able to turn on the enhanced
layout of tiles no matter what your
screen sizes previously only larger
phones got that perk also among the
changes is a new Action menu that you
pull down to quickly access
notifications and settings changes are
also coming to the main Windows 8.1
operating system Microsoft is making it
easier to navigate its system that
bounces between tiles and a desktop
style screen now you can have your
computer show the desktop when it turns
on if you don't like dealing with those
tiles and there's the glorious taskbar
to pin your programs or as they call
them now
programs also have new clothes and
minimize buttons like you're accustomed
to and in tile mode there's a power down
icon on the top so you don't have to
swipe or hover a mouse in a corner to
find it there's a settings tile that's
easier to find as well those updates
will be available Tuesday April 8th as a
free download as for the mobile stuff
with Cortana Microsoft didn't give a
date all we know is that it will roll
out two phones in the coming months but
new phones will have the changes
starting next month that's your tech
