and today I have with me the HTC One m8
for Windows Phone currently available
from verizon and later with AT&amp;amp;T the one
mA is exactly the same as its previous
Android counterparts in terms of
high-end hardware that means you'll get
the same premium brushed aluminum
aesthetic a brilliant 5-inch 1080p
display with Gorilla Glass 3 and a
powerful two point three gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor
you'll also get the 1m eights unique
dual rear facing cameras armed with what
HTC calls a 4 ultrapixel lens the bigger
camera handles all your regular camera
phone duties while the one on top
handles depth perception with tools like
you focus and for grounder you can
adjust the focus of pictures after
you've taken them and add effects to the
background there's also a neat dimension
plus tool that adds an interactive 3d
effect to your photos now what makes
this one m8 variant unique is that it's
running the Windows Phone OS
specifically 8.1 point one with this
software you get an animated and clean
UI and a live tile home screen there's
also deep integration with microsoft
outlook and office and the Internet
Explorer 11 web browser the digital
voice and search assistant Cortana is
also included helpful and a bit snarky
at times it can schedule appointments
look up businesses identify music and
much more it has a notebook too to keep
tabs on your favorite restaurants and
news topics to better cater to your
interests HTC through an its signature
features to like blinkfeed a Flipboard
esque app that consolidates your news
and social media feeds into one sense TV
is loaded as well which turns your
handset into a TV remote using the IR
blaster located on the top edge while
it's true that Windows Phone doesn't
have as large as an app market as iOS or
Android it's important that HTC carved
more space in this particular platform
since it's 8 X handset two years ago
right now Nokia Lumia is dominate the
landscape so to have such a top to your
device enter the market gives more
choice to Windows Phone and zoo
this if you're interested the device is
currently available for a hundred
dollars on contract or six hundred
dollars without you can also get HTC's
dot view case which displays the time
and weather through the front cover as
well as access to Cortana with a swipe
of the finger again I'm Lynn and you've
been checking out verizon's One m8 for
Windows Phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
