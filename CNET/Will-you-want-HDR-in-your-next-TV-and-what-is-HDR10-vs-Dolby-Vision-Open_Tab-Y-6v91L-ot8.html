been dealing with for some time I just
dealt with recently with the Xbox one s
review and that is HDR so so cats yeah
that was a trial by fire huh explain
took us like two hours ago thinks it was
crazy what is HDR for people who don't
know what is HDR 10 what does Dolby
vision what is all that junk so the
first thing now HDR is high dynamic
range okay just like the HDR setting on
your phone the name but very much
nothing like it in reality okay don't
confuse it with HDR on your phone or
photography or whatever with those crazy
effects and you know they even have
video games back and a that at HDR
effects eternal like why could they use
a different three-letter combination no
super high dynamic range is what I told
them to use and they didn't want to you
well I don't understand that um so
anyway HDR is what we're stuck with and
right now in the market there's actually
two two formats of HDR there's HDR 10
which is just called HDR generic HDR and
then there's dolby vision which of
course everybody knows dolby right kind
of runs the show with audio and
theatrical video and pretty much
everything in hollywood so they have a
big name brand advantage these two
formats are not mutually exclusive so
you can have a TV that supports both or
you can have TV the sports one and the
other right now sony samsung and most
everybody else except for vizio and LG
only support HDR 10 vizio and LG support
dolby vision they paid you know dolby
you know their their licensing fee they
have this ability to take these global
vision titles and play on so right now
you can get HDR from netflix okay if you
have one of these TVs right you can also
get it from Amazon they support as well
both guys support both formats good if
you have a Sony TV you just get a little
thing that says HDR but if you have a
vizio or LG TV it'll say dolby vision
because they prioritize dolby vision you
can do both and then Vudu which is a
service at Walmart runs that's similar
they only have dole vision right now
which is interesting huh so there's
different Studios for different ones
I've looked at both the difference is
really hard to tell right now I think we
might see some more differences
merge as the master studios figure out
how she could make it pop a little more
but the real thing to know is that any
HDR really is a good picture quality
improvement right and you are watching
it yes oh the difference there is a
difference yeah it's subtle yeah it's
there though it's not going to blow your
mind
or not I mean remember when people in HD
first came out people like will standard
F in HD or not the different or you know
lie blu-rays look a lot like my DVDs
it's not as drastic of a difference is
that there's a diminishing return sort
of absolutely because at the end of the
day regular blu-ray looks frickin
phenomenal yeah so an HDR blu-ray looks
even better provided that your TV is
good enough to make it look bad right
and that's what gets a little cloudy
right like it like we just discussed
every TV manufacturer seems to have like
a different sort of idea of like what
they want to support so is it possible
that like someone could buy a TV and get
screwed out of the format that ends up
maybe winning this sort of situation I
think what's going to happen and this is
pretty pretty standard HDR 10 is is
required by the by the the consortium
that came with 4k blu-ray okay so it's
it's if there's a 4k blu-ray disc out
there which is the only way to get HDR
you know aside from streaming right now
it's gonna be HDR 10 so and every TV out
there Vizio literally last this week we
want relative firmware update that allow
their TVs to work with HDR now all these
HDR TVs all work with workings you can't
get screwed right so you're not going to
get screwed but there is a possibility
that for whatever reason Dolby vision
stuff might look better or if for
example you want to watch something on
Vudu that's Dolby vision only right for
as long as they maintain that exclusive
although I think it's going to be very
long so you might actually end up if you
have a TV that can't do Dolby vision not
being able to see all the available
content that's the case right now from
Sony and Samsung viewers but it's not
that big of a deal because that stuff is
also available on other services and non
Dolby vision so I think these two are
going to co-exist a little like DTS and
Dolby Digital which are the two audio
formats that every receiver they coexist
yeah and it all works you know but there
isn't there's very few receivers out
there there only one or the other right
now so I think next year the year after
you're going to start seeing TVs that a
little do both like LG and Vizio do this
year so okay so this does
necessarily have to do anything with HDR
but it is in your realm the question I
get asked a lot by people who are the
sort of laymen of the tech world my
basically my friends yeah um my night
people what's that wonderful people
wonderful people but just don't
necessarily know which side of the
blu-rays has the data on it okay that's
fine um
question I get asked the most is when do
we stop being able to see difference in
resolution me like how close you have to
be no no like after 4k will be 8k right
oh yeah what's that seen K we're already
there well no I feel like we're there I
feel like 8 K from what I've read a few
sort of like ophthalmologist you know
expert sort of your brains just simply
not going to know the a after a lot a
chart thing is it a K like a poison
should be well the threshold the thing
is H it's actually already happening
because if unless you're sitting really
close to a 4k TV you're not going to see
the difference right between really good
1080p which is blu-ray right and 4k
because your eyes are not sharp enough
to resolve the difference right plus
moving video is a lot more difficult to
resolve and the fact is you know it's
not going to be the very highest quality
anyway
sure so if you look at Netflix 4k vs.
1080p blu-ray often the blu-ray looks
better because there's less compression
and you know it's it's it's not about
the number of pixels and so we say like
we have a 65 inch TV unless you're
sitting like 6 feet 7 feet away from it
which is how a closed-in gigantic TV
like that you just can't see the
difference for most people if you have
great vision sure you'll see the
difference you're watching really high
quality content sure see a little
difference but again 1080p blu-ray looks
working awesome already people I feel
like people want that feeling they got
when they went from sd de Jessica can't
have you just like you'll never create
that first time right a taste which is
like yeah pulling off the clouds never
going out this is amazing and the other
thing is right now even 4k is never it's
going to be really long time for its
broadcast yeah so right now TV
broadcasters are barely doing 720p and
1080i yeah and those are the high def
formats and once you know when are we
gonna get to do some smattering of 4k
stuff you can see on TV that it's be a
long time before they change all the
trucks the camera
Ferguson's let's just skip and go to 20k
and just yeah at this point it you
wouldn't see that for us either but
that's not gonna stop from coming out
with it yeah sure how long do you think
agents and managers are wondering like
how long do you think even this HDR
thing would last cuz he wants to buy TV
he wants to make sure that it's actually
a good investment for him and he'd be
worried that like it's the next best
thing
yeah HDR is a big deal I think we spent
a lot of time crapping all over 4k
because you really couldn't see the
difference with HDR you can see a
difference there is a difference because
it's not resolution which is basically
limited by your eyesight and see there's
more color sizes - yeah it's you
mentioned wide color gamut that's a
really it's a difference you can see it
when you look at you know the trees look
greener there's right now that HD
standard is pretty limited and the color
it's based in like you know the 70s and
earlier right what the TVs could
reproduce they're a lot better now they
can get a lot whiter color that's in HDR
and then the dynamic range which makes
you know highlights glint and it makes
the clouds look more defined yes like
that better again relatively soft subtle
but instead it's much more of an
improvement than from going 1080p to 4k
absolutely I totally agree with that
you showed me a scene in in the revenant
that is very very gray the revenant is
the best home video content I've ever
seen period Wow work a blu-ray the
revenant is unbelievable cut yeah
because he just did a great job of
filming it in HDR yeah out in natural
lighting understand haven't seen that
film treat yourself well even on at
1080p you know regular TV it looks small
because movies are filmed like
specifically in HDR do you think they
fill in like a couple resolutions above
and then bring it well again HDR is not
necessarily a resolution it's about the
capturing of the dynamic range which is
again the range from from absolute white
to dark and it's also capturing the
color and all these cameras now all
these digital cameras can Aris and Sony
all these that the Hollywood cameras are
way
capable of capturing its that transfer
yeah so getting that whatever the camera
could see to your screen is that is the
question that's what HDR comes closer to
than current 1080p correct me if I'm
wrong HDR in a nutshell when it comes to
the dynamic range sort of stuff the
analogy I tried to give somebody was
like okay let's say you had like 10
shades of darkness right like 10 shades
of gray okay
HDR gives you a thousand
yeah for for all intents and purposes
like that you're basically getting the
ability to see that much more of a
difference between total white and total
black and and and it created it expands
the range and expand it increases the
number of steps in that range like
f-stops on a camera one of the analogies
that they use but it also makes the top
end of that range potentially a lot
brighter sure and so what you can do is
have like if you envision like Sun as a
plane turns sun strikes that the wing of
the plane and it this bright kind of pop
yeah HDR captures that much better than
I mean HD can't capture it and and the
whole format is designed to transmit
those highlights and give you that sort
of feel that's why revin is so good
because it's all outdoor natural
lighting sure that you're used to seeing
and it's one of these things where if
you see it side by side it's like wow
you know it does make a difference we'll
get them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
