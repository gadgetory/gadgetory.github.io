are here in the Pacific Design Center in
Los Angeles California if we found the
man behind the hamster power and hamster
drawing machine hamster poet hamster
drying machines right here in front of
us is right here in front of us we're
looking right at it in real life and
Neil Mendoza is the artist and designer
behind that thank you first of all for
letting us come here and check out the
the hamster and the Machine the hamster
pout Hampstead rowing machine no problem
that's all yeah so we have to ask you
why this like what made you think this
was a great project to embark on because
it seems like it was really a lot of
work to make happen um it was a lot of
work it kind of evolved into being what
it is today started off with kind of a
fascination with drawing machines and
the ability to encode complicated
drawings into mechanical devices so the
the drawing of the hamster is encoded
into the shape of the wheels around the
outside so I started becoming really
interested in that and then I built a
drawing machine which work but then I
was like what on earth is this thing in
a drawer and so a hamster seemed good
there's not really enough hamster art
out there so I made it oh we agree we
agree so I made a hamster drawing
machine that I'm like oh I don't want
people to turn it around or was this
fits a hamster drawing machine then it
should be powered by a hamster and so
you came over the idea to draw a hamster
before you thought of powering it with a
hamster I think so it's kind of the men
the memory is a little vague crazy all
around the same time it's sort of yeah
you your website has a lot of projects
that sort of incorporate the
intersection of digital and mechanical
technologies and how when did you first
start kind of getting into that as
medium because it's a really interesting
medium that I think not a lot of people
think of when they think of art I don't
think that combination is really
prevalent and so to see something like
this is is
hey really delightful like people are I
mean we were overjoyed to see it in
person it's just it's so exciting and
new and it feels really fresh so what
what started you down that path I think
I've always liked tinkering ever since I
was a kid like taking things to pieces
and putting them back together again and
then but then I went to university and
studied computer science and kind of
resigned myself to a career kind of like
in a gray cubicle but then yeah after
going bit like a hamster I guess you're
like a happy because I missed after well
I'm swirl of life but then like at some
point I came across like different
people doing interesting stuff with
technology and code and started trying
to get into it myself and I already had
some experience making you know doing
programming electronic so then i took
that experience i guess i started
applying it to to art making so so what
is the process of creating a drawing
machine like this it's such a it's such
a simple thing to turn a circle into a
you know complicated drawing on a
hamster and that's sarcasm so simple
you're like it so such a simple thing no
goes from a simple circle to see more
time yeah yeah yeah so what is the how
does one how does one go about making a
hamster drawing machine um how do you
help a hamster draw itself yeah I used a
piece of open source source software
called openframeworks and it's like a
coding framework that allows you to
easily make creative stuff like computer
graphics or sound or take inputs in them
I made a physics simulation of the
drawing arm part of the machine and then
I kind of like use that physics
simulation to kind of trace out where
the wheels would need to be if the pen
was in the correct place and then so
then i end up with these two circular
drawings and then i used like a machine
called a cnc machine which is basically
like a big robot to kind of cut it out
of wood for me and that's how you would
go about it and but originally i cut out
these two parts of the machine
just out of wooden and tried to make
them all rotate together but they were
far too flimsy so then the whole thing
is sitting on kind of like a big
aluminium circle behind it with like the
kind of chain you get in your bicycle
sandwich between it yeah give it some
weight and stiffness why I love the idea
of you iterating on this idea over and
over until you created what you want hit
and then you had to employ the labor of
the hamster commission taking a break
yeah well you know it's exhausting yeah
gonna run now will I can barely run down
a flight of stairs that's hard work
maybe he's going to post his selfie on
Instagram that's true maybe he's really
into social media heavy hat does the
hamster have its own social media
account is a great question um as far as
I know no but it's not actually my
hamster so the real guardians of the
hamster would have the true answer for
that this hamster feels like a celebrity
is the hamster of a name Georgie j√¥ji
can you what kind of reaction have you
been getting to this piece I mean people
are really like happy I think guys just
like they like they really like
interested in how the drawing machine
part of it works and then they're just
really happy to see the whole thing come
together I mean they like people's
interest seems to shift between the two
parts of it and then take it in as a
whole and be kind of like wow that's
really cute it's interesting because you
know from one perspective you could look
at it as almost a cage that he's forced
to have this you know this kind of
tyrannical rule to be forced to
constantly make an image of himself or
it could be this really joyous happy
experience I like that people take the
ladder I mean I kind of like it to be
open to interpretation so if you wanna
like interpret it as a kind of comment
on evil capitalism man or if you want to
interpret it as just nonsense you can
also do that whimsical happiness that
that's how I interpreted whimsical
happiness um you you also have another
piece here that is really interesting in
that I don't even know how to describe
this there are there's a microphone that
picks up your scent your words and then
it will project throw your words
literally onto a screen and then the
is a foot that can kick your words and
there's also another receptacle that if
it catches a word it will actually say
the word out loud let's talk a little
bit about that because you know one of
those machines because I really I just
love these fantastical sort of
contraptions that you put together using
technology oh this is really fascinating
to me and how you kind of come up with
the idea to sort of embark on these
projects because in my wildest dreams I
don't think of anything quite like that
and so don't them have sort of a Rube
Goldberg s very much yield to them yeah
um where you mean how do I get those
kind of ideas yeah that and also um if
you want to talk a little bit about that
particular project like I'd love to hear
about how that even came together
because it just seems like there's a lot
of for lack of a better term like moving
parts to it even though it's throwing
words around so we're at first of all
yeah where do you find inspiration for
things how do you kind of decide on a
path to take for a project I mean I
think today a lot of times we take
technology for granted like say you use
Siri on your iPhone it's doing probably
more complicated stuff than my my
installation is doing but like I think
it's really good to deconstruct that
kind of stuff and make people think
about technology and realize that a lot
of the ways we use is arbitrary and get
them to like reengage with it from a
kind of like as if they're seeing it in
you and I guess that's one of the things
I try to do with my work is to kind of
make people realize that a lot of
technology we use today is kind of
arbitrary and dictated to us by
companies who have their own agendas so
making a guess random nonsense to
reignite people with interest in
technology around us is one reason why I
make it I guess that particular piece
started with started with like voice
recognition technology and kind of here
tryna like maybe here show people the
inside of how one of those systems might
work will get people to re-engage with
that a little bit more and then I guess
just went down some kind of surreal
nonsense
my fav bit of a Monty Python 3 abstract
monty python is beginning you know his
animated bitch it feels a little like
that I mean I think I was too I was
playing around with two things at the
same time and becoming one project I was
playing around with like showing people
like the inside of series brain possibly
or and also like this idea of combining
projection with physical objects so like
the words by out the thing and then this
actual robotic book can kick them so
it's like I like kind of this interplay
between the physical and digital Turkish
often we spend our time staring at
screens kind of absorbed in this kind of
like virtual world where I think it's
nice to kind of try and bring people
back to you know three-dimensional
reality but mix the two up at the same
time because there's really interesting
things you can do with virtual start and
Peter graphic as well so do you um do
you find yourself interested at all in
augmented reality and virtual reality
since that's like a new kind of upcoming
thing is that something that maybe
you're interested in taking your art and
design to or a little bit less I mean I
actually did some projects with that
like a few years back like a fermented
reality projects before it was like cool
c'mon go can't believe I fucking won't
go came out and it was fun it's a fun
toy it it feels a little bit still feels
a little bit gimmicky but I mean Pokemon
go might be the first company that
actually kind of you know you're okay
right a killer app for sure it seems
that way but the thing I don't really
like about virtual reality is yeah it
kind of like takes you away from the
world it kind of enables escapism so
it's like fun for gaming and stuff but I
think with my work I want people so you
know engage with the moment rather than
escaping the moment and yeah even though
maybe people will be able to create a
lot awesome stuff in virtual worlds it's
still going to be created by people and
you know if we look at our cities they
were just big like rectangular boxes so
good no I think it's much easier also to
connect with people in an emotional
level if you're making
three-dimensional stuff like we've
evolved to kind of interact and perceive
the world in three dimensions and so but
yeah maybe virtual reality is going to
get rid of that barrier and we'll trick
our brains into thinking we're in some
kind of three-dimensional virtual space
but anyway so someday someday okay but
well you've certainly evoked a lot of
emotional happiness from us I'm so glad
yeah and our viewers to I'm so glad that
we got to actually see this in persons
like very excited for us and thank you
for talking to us about your projects
and your art and if you want to check
out Neil's work you go to Neil Mendoza
com we'll have all the information on
the website too and that's that's it for
our interview so we are going to take a
quick break and then we're going to
magically appear back in the studio and
continue the show so stick around its
tomorrow daily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
