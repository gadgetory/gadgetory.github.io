the most on and which new Apple product
the biggest freaking ripoff
well hey everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar
welcome to nope sorry the scene at
debate show where I argue over three
rounds with my friends and colleagues
over dead serious discourse debating me
today to my left mr. Josh Goldman how's
it going Josh hey dudes doing finger
guns like that's the thing people still
do all right here's how the game works
we've got three rounds five points up
for grabs each round
who's assigning these points you ask
well I'll tell you who it's Joseph
Kaminsky to our right hello hello judge
Joey tell us please what today's first
topic is we're ready for round one
wait yeah have we'll just release some
really serious expensive products which
one do you guys think is the biggest
ripoff go alright I'll start with this
one I'm gonna say that the iPad pro
specifically the larger one is the
biggest ripoff our reviewer Scott Stein
reviewed the thing I can't believe that
starts at $1000 to me that's just insane
you he said you need a keyboard for it
he said you need the pencil for it
before you know it you're well over
$1200 for everything I cannot understand
that if you were to buy the most
expensive version with all the bells and
whistles you're looking at 1899 that is
an insane amount of money for an iPad
considering it's not really a laptop
replacement it's sort of in the middle
it has limited functionality the USBC
for accessibility is a little wonky iPad
pro biggest ripoff right now what do you
say I was thinking you know my gut says
what's your gut but gut says iPhone yeah
but that's kind of the Android in me
sure but I'm thinking MacBook Air okay
you know it's been a while since they
released one so I understand why it's a
little bit higher now it's you know used
to be $9.99 they're still selling the
old one at that it's 12 19 or it's 1200
now that's a little high even with the
new components because frankly if
but he else has those new components all
the windows systems that go up against
that and that ultra portable category
are all cheaper with the same components
and you know no touchscreen and I'm kind
of hating things that don't have
touchscreens these day understandable I
mean there's really no wrong answer here
Joey
round one who has what in terms of
points
I got you ahead by one point three to
two okay why I liked your argument in
terms of like the accessories and the
building upon I do also agree with
Josh's but I think you made a better
argument when diving in into and also
the possibilities that are in the future
for us BC but just aren't there now all
right as long as we get all mutually
agree it's a bunch of ripoff a bunch of
a bunch of ripoffs okay all right moving
along it's time for round two Josh will
have the first say but first Joey what's
the topic people love spending money on
the latest greatest tech but what
category of products do you think they
over spend the most money on go okay
headphones yeah right off the bat
headphones there's just no reason for
anybody to own a $300 I mean I applaud
the people who stick with the ones that
come with their phone those are my
heroes really no but but at least they
haven't overpaid for a pair of
headphones that you know they're
listening in the same junk streaming
music out of their phone then you don't
need a $300 pair of headphones to do
that okay so that's a it's all you got
to say about that all right you say
headphones I agree I think people who
buy crazy expensive drones are
overspending in a way that they don't
understand who the who are the hell are
you where you need an $1,800 stabilizing
4k drone not everyone is Casey nice that
are you are you covering the Olympics
for NBC what do you do it you don't need
this over calmly complicated thing that
you know has 88 satellites connected to
it look I have a drone that's like $300
and even that's probably too much but it
is a fantastic experience you don't need
to go out of control I see all these
feel like I should I buy the $1,200
drone or the $2,500
you don't need to spend that much money
on drones they're not even as good as
they're gonna get so just maybe get
something entry-level and save your
money and you really can't fly them
anywhere and you can fly them anywhere
you're not a pilot stop buying those
expensive drone you maniac
all right Joey what do you think man I
mean I don't want Josh to take this
personal because I love the guy but uh
you got it no personal biases inside no
you got that round as well with a score
of three to two okay but so what was
about what about it well his argument
were $300 headphones which pale in
comparison to a $1,200 drone we're we're
talking most money on headphones they
fluctuate in prices and you do get some
for free but $300 I personally don't
think is a lot of money for a pair Wow
all right okay six to four I'm in the
lead I'm just squeaking by like I do
through everything in life Joey what's
round three how's this all gonna be
decided okay for the final round we're
gonna go a little of course here this
one is for the denim nerds all right
okay how long is it okay to go without
washing your jeans go okay I'm gonna say
now again let's let's think about how
much you wear jeans basically all I wear
so bright I think rotating between three
pairs of jeans I think it's okay to go
eight weeks that might sound like a lot
eight weeks between washing jeans
because after eight weeks I feel like
enough time has passed where you can
actually wash them and dry them and they
you know when jeans get like real loose
if you were and when you wash them and
dry them they're like beat you for a
second again so I'm gonna say eight
weeks is like that sweet spot and I know
what people are saying like all that
seems gross and yes jeans are
essentially towels that we wear that
they just napkins you just wipe crap on
and all that but eight weeks what do you
what do you say never
yes sir Jeff is never never no you never
well almost never
I mean sure they get a little sticky you
know or you get something like on them
you you want to wash them okay but in
general denim heads I'm not but I am
aware of denim well I'm assuming there's
like sneaker heads anyway yeah denim
aficionados okay we'll go with they
don't wash their jeans very much at all
months months they go without washing
their jeans and that allows them to get
abrasions in just the right places
so that when you do wash them they get
that nice broken in look to cut me right
off that bird so we have eight weeks
versus literally never all right Joey
what do you think honestly personally
outside of the studio I would agree with
you but his argument was great when he
went to the Jean aficionado so I gave
the slight edge to Josh for his argument
three - Wow okay he made he had good
reasoning behind in terms of the worn
and look for the denim heads all right
but how often do you wash your yeah this
did eight weeks or less okay eight weeks
is like a good rule of thumb to grab on
to prepare no I okay well look this has
been great the SEVIS and final school
are convincing what this is a good one
eight to seven you oh you buy one I want
hey big big handshake
Josh Goldman ladies and gentlemen on the
winner what did I win oh my goodness hey
it's what I always wanted an inflatable
football man then I can throw balls at
because that's what I do in my spare
time I throw footballs and inflatable
dolls tune in next week you could submit
a topic for debate by commenting in the
section below please do that thank you
so very much
