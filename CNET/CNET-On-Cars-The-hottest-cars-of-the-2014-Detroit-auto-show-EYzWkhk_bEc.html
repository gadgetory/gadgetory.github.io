Tosh the biggest story is the technology
of materials they pulled some 700 pounds
out of the weight of the f-150 much of
it by having an aluminum body just about
everything you see on the outside of the
vehicle is now aluminum that's a big
change for the truck market the other
third or so comes out of high-strength
steel being used in the ladder frame
which is tougher lighter but less sort
of bulky as a steel goes but they're
still steel underneath this guy now when
you take 700 pounds out of your vehicle
you get to do some interesting things
with how you power it including this
headline grabber a 2.7 liter v6 EcoBoost
that means direct injection and
turbocharging this is seen as heresy by
some in the truck world where anything
below a v8 is seen as just not enough to
move a proper truck but this is a small
displacement v6 on top of just having
two fewer cylinders than tradition what
we're seeing here is an engine that is
yet to have its horsepower or economy
specified that will come later as Ford
gets closer to late 2014 release but
notice this guy's got standard auto
start/stop technology that's also
interesting in a full-size pickup
although it's defeatable readily in
all-wheel drive mode or at any time
because truck demands can be so
different than regular car ford mustang
wasn't unveiled here but we got our
first really good look at both body
styles and that new engine choice that
is raising a few eyebrows ford's done a
real major redo on this car it still is
like a Mustang clearly but it's less
parodic if you will it doesn't have that
kind of big honchos you squared off face
look although it's much wider in the
back now in actual measurements compared
to the previous vehicle which gives it a
more interesting stance and perhaps
better Road dynamics as well now if the
body of the new Mustang is different any
nothing compared to this new engine this
is the new entrant a 2.3 liter
turbocharged inline-4 they haven't had a
turbo four in a Mustang since a limited
production SVO back in the mid 80s this
is big news they haven't published
horsepower numbers on it yet but guests
around 300 a little bit more than that
this is also an engine's going to slot
in the middle of the line the base
engine remains a 3.7 v 6 and of course
it's dubbed the big boy the 5 litre v8
that's iconic they could never get rid
of that Porsche unveiled the targa
version of the new 911 it's the first
target that articulates the entire rear
glass window up and away to
automatically stow the top it starts at
a hundred grand and is all wheel drive
only truly a car for all seasons if not
all budgets Chrysler's been struggling
to really compete with the Accord camry
fusion sanada Malibu that may change now
with the new chrysler 200 this new look
is a pretty indicated of Chrysler's new
design language they've got the texture
grill that's integrating the headlamps
with the floating Chrysler badge up
front it looks a little third generation
subaru impreza to me but it's a
good-looking car and it's also very
aerodynamically styled now this 200 f
model is the sporty-er of the two models
that were unveiled today the other one
being the 200 see this one's going to
have a lot of black trim sport-tuned
suspension and whatnot there's some
interesting things happening under the
hood of these vehicles the new 200 is
available either as a 2.4 liter tiger
shark inline-four engine that's going to
put out 184 horsepower or with the
Pentastar v-6 this canal put 295
horsepower that's what you're going to
want her to the hood of the sport model
now both of those engines is going to be
made it to a single option 9-speed
automatic transmission that's a lot of
forward gears and Chrysler says that's
going to help you get a really good fuel
economy without having to sacrifice a
lot of performance the new
seventh-generation corvette got hotted
up in a 06 edition with a big new v8
that can assume several positions
cylinder why's this guy will do a
minimum of 625 horsepower as probably
any more than that one hits the market
and some 635 foot-pounds of torque now
here's well that prodigious power comes
from an all new v8 they call the LT for
next to its cousin the lt1 no slouch
either they did a couple of things here
I want to call out first of all dry sump
design there is no traditional oil pan
down there allowing it to have a shorter
under care
the oil is pumped in and out under
pressure instead and they've also got a
very compact blower here sitting almost
entirely in the valley between the heads
between those two dimensionally reducing
feats they've ended up with a very
compact engine that they can allow to
sit lower in the Bay of the car that
does good things for driving dynamics
but note that brawny motors actually got
some lean and green builds into it it's
got cylinder deactivation to run in
three different modes four-cylinder
eight cylinder without the blower
engaged and eight cylinder with the
blower engaged I'll be curious to what
kind of MPG numbers they can score out
of something so overpowering but perhaps
the coolest tech actually came out just
ahead of this car with something called
the performance data recorder it grabs
forward video and overlays it with a
variety of selectable driving telemetry
the first time a car maker has built-in
what's traditionally been a specialty
aftermarket toy BMWs one series moved up
we're really moved out making room for
the new 2 series not quite as big and
expensive as a 3 and this one's coupe
only from the size of three quarter
views here's what I see it still has
kind of that tragic truncated rump of
the 1 series but they got rid of that
sad mouth scallop on the side that made
the one that I can was melting and
bending in the middle overall it's a car
with a little more presence but they can
still bring it in at a price that's
going to be in the zone of folks who
would never spend 40 on a car that's a
hot zone because Mercedes reason
introduction of the CLA has been on fire
and that car starts at just a tick under
30 before destination so all the Germans
are rushing to do something cheaper now
I'm in front of the m235i which is the
hot rod model of the two they'll have
the inline six that everyone knows and
loves but the car i think is gonna be
really interesting is that guy the 228 I
with a two-liter turbo for the puts out
240 horse gets to 60 and 5.4 seconds and
still delivers 23 35 mpg overall to me
that's a great story and again a car is
going to be starting somewhere around
thirty three thousand dollars
and what is that the toyota ft-1 concept
makes even the hottest of the past
supras look like a rental car this car
is a signal kind of a shot over the bow
that toyota has returned to dramatic
styling is returned for the kind of
sports cards that they had with the
celica in this car we see a lot of
aerodynamic features such as these huge
air intakes in front to feed the engine
these air vents on the side to add
cooling to the brakes we have this big
spoiler in the back looks like it'll
come up or down depending on the speed
of the car we even have a transparent
cover over the engine that's what about
Ferrari kind of thing we've got red
valve covers you can even see the the
strut brace on the top here now in the
cabin here we have a head-up display on
a little panel above the dashboard this
will show the drivers speed and engine
speed and stuff like that and twitter
has also put a couple of little displays
at the top of the steering wheel here we
get to see what mode the cars in whether
it's in sport mode or normal mode and
also what gear it's in of course all of
this is kind of four sho this is
actually not even intended for
production you can drive it in the Gran
Turismo 6 video game they've got a
version as downloadable content so you
can put it on the track try it out
apparently it handles really well in the
game but we won't be able to try that on
the road finally if you've always
thought of the Mercedes c-class is just
two starter check out the baby s-class
that it's become with the new model
here's the 2015 that is free to fly now
that the CLA occupies their 30 thousand
dollar price point this guys coming
upscale notice they make you very
obvious of that with that s class style
front nose and very curvaceous styling
not the kind of pedestrian entry-level
look the c-class has often been cursed
with in the cabin you're going to find a
lot of niceties from really high-end
finishes and accoutrement twitch this
car didn't always have to a finger
handwriting recognition pad you'll see
on this car kind of a tablet shaped
center screen and the main head unit
this car doesn't say mid or low scale
anywhere and
will include a 235 horsepower 2-liter
turbo inline 4 or a 329 horsepower
3-liter v6 they are going to make a
wagon version of this but because they
hate me they're not going to bring it to
the US ah this car comes out in
September of 2014 pricing will be locked
in around him
