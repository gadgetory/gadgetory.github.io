Mobile World Congress in Barcelona we're
taking a look at the lenovo s 6000 a
10.1 inch tablet alright so this is a
fairly basic Android tablet that 10.1
inch screen has a 720p resolution which
looks pretty good and inside there's a
quad-core 1.2 gigahertz processor which
keeps everything running with a pleasing
snap around the size one nice Street is
a micro HDMI port which means you'll be
able to hook this tablet up to your TV
and export what's going on on the screen
so you can watch your videos home movies
and stuff all things you downloaded from
Google Play on the big screen it's also
got a micro SD card so you can expand
its available storage it weighs about
560 grams and it's about 8.6 millimeters
thick which means that it is quite
possible and it definitely feels quite
thin and light in my hands that said
though it does feel a little bit
plasticky so there is that trade-off to
be made there this doesn't feel quite as
luxurious as say the iPad around the
back there's a five megapixel camera and
there's a front-facing camera as well
which should help you out when you want
to make some video calls it's running
Android version 4.2 jellybean which is a
very recent version of Google's mobile
operating system so it's coming out
later this year I think basically it's
all going to come down to pricing if
this is a lot cheaper than the
equivalent size devices like the iPad or
say Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 then it
could be quite a tempting device but if
it's too expensive then there won't be
much reason to bother i'm the
restoration CNET and this is the lenovo
a6000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
