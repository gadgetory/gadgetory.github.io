has seen more wild success and crushing
failure than tablet computers but as the
dust begins to settle CNN's list of
their best five tablets is a much
stronger lineup than we saw a year ago
here our editors top five tablets as of
May 2012 number five is the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 now Samsung just
released an update to this called the
samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 but that guy
didn't make the list we're talking about
the tab 10.1 from May of 2011 which is a
thinner lighter tablet and uses a better
screen the only worthwhile feature on
the tab 2 is it's slightly lower price
number four is the sony tablet s sony
took their sweet time getting to the
tablet market but at least they arrived
in style the fold / design feels great
the screen uses this bravia true black
technology and you even get a built in a
remote control it's on the pricey side
but it's a beautiful piece of gear
number three is the asuste transformer
pad tf300 this is the follow-up to last
year's epad transformer prime they drop
the ease drop the price and drop the
word Prime to keep hasbro from suing
them again so quad-core tablet is fast
it runs ice cream sandwich out of the
box and an extra $150 gets you a
keyboard attachment that turns the whole
thing into a sort of laptop number two
is the asus eee pad transformer prime
the old man has all the specs found in
the newer tf300 but in the original
thinner design with a metal finish and a
slightly faster processor it's not cheap
but if you want a best-in-class Android
tablet this is still the one now before
we get into the number one tablet let's
take a look at why both the Zeus and
Samsung are more focused on making their
tablets cheaper instead of better bees
are seen its top budget tablets with all
the options out there around one hundred
ninety-nine dollars it's hard to justify
spending twice as much on a premium
tablet unless of course you're buying an
ipad our number one tablet pick can't be
much of a surprise the third-generation
iPad offers the best screen the best
apps the coolest accessories in the
widest selection of music
movies TV shows podcasts and games no
one even talks about unseating the iPad
at this point it's all a race for second
place so those are our top tablets I've
selected by our Cena editors for more
top five like this head over top five
