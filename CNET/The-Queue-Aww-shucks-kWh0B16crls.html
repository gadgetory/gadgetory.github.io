cnet TV and you are in the queue roll
those calls to voicemail for the next
three minutes you're gonna need it let's
get you started with your must see
moment so is your true what they say
about oysters being a turn-on hey never
mind get a room she's freaking mollusks
all they think about is getting shot raw
talk from the raw bar a video created by
the restaurant group legal seafoods
playing on the theme of fresh
crustaceans with some raunchy punchlines
fit for a sailor get your catch at
YouTube you finally have a place besides
ebay to unload that old computer staples
introducing in-store electronics
recycling and you don't have to wait
until every other third Saturday to take
advantage the service available everyday
you can drop off as much as you want
including used computers monitors
laptops printers and fax machines large
items will cost you ten bucks to unload
while small incidentals like keyboards
and mice are free I remember my 5th
grade science fair the one where I
showcase live caterpillars to show how
they change into butterflies somehow
they escaped before the metamorphosis in
the morning well this science fair is
nothing like that the International
Science and Engineering Fair is the
world's largest bringing together high
school students from 51 countries around
the world this year's projects included
a solar-powered water generator a cancer
treatment and a smart swim drowning
alert for children 4 million bucks went
to top projects one of the big winners
this year determining carbon nanotubes
thermodynamic solubility the missing
link to a practical super material we
could all use that oh yeah that was done
by 16 year old time for the beta a poor
man's PowerPoint thumb stacks calm is an
easy way to make presentations on the
web then you can share with anyone
create your presentation and thumb
stacks using a rich text editor
drag-and-drop text or pictures into
several easy to use themes a link then
lets you share your presentation with
anyone in the world using a web browser
now you won't get slide transitions
animations or sound but you do get a
free and easy way to share thoughts kind
of like the cue and thanks to Ben
Creighton who suggested today's beta
finally a new segment tech de loco plain
old bottled water just
doesn't cut it anymore these days it's
all about the flavor now pure has a way
to make sure the tap doesn't feel left
out a crazy idea but hey it probably
works pure flavor options transform your
municipal sister it in tap water into
deliciously filtered flavored water just
install the flavor option on your faucet
mount press a button and there's
strawberry raspberry or peach in your
glass and just to be clear not all the
water from the tap turns flavored that
would cause all kinds of fruit flavored
problems like strawberry pasta all right
go get your eight glasses because you my
friend are in the queue I'm rich demuro
wit seen a TV in New York City don't say
I didn't tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
