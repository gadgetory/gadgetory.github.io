want in a car this is gonna be a weird
episode so buckle up yeah I said it
years ago I loved cars especially fast
once I used to even repair cars in
automotive school when I moved to
Manhattan I dropped out of car culture I
haven't bought a car since 2003 and I
haven't owned one since 2011 but the
weird thing is more and more tech has
found its way into cars and it's got me
interested again at number five it's got
to be connected somehow getting data
from your car has never been easier you
can make almost any car smarter with
something like the automatic which
attaches to your car's obd2 sensor then
there are cars that have their own apps
that let you start the car or control
your door locks that's pretty awesome
and number 4 smart home integration when
I pull my car into my garage I wished I
could trigger my air-conditioning or
home theater now this is a thing Ford
brought Amazon's assistant to its cars
and that lets you control your smart
home from your car it also works the
other way where you can find out
information about your car from a smart
speaker BMW is also jumping in on the
Amazon bandwagon and number three it's
got to be electric or hybrid yep I'm
dating myself here back in my day
electric cars were ugly and kind of a
joke now they're mainstream
Tesla showed that electric cars can be
gorgeous and fast there's an
infrastructure for charging now electric
cars have a lot more support with many
more major manufacturers offering pure
electric vehicles Volvo even said it
will only produce electric or hybrid
vehicles starting a 2019 and number two
car play or Android Auto when it came to
in-car entertainment my options were CDs
or an ox jack for my music player now
you can link up your iPhone or Android
phone using car play or Android auto so
instead of trying to deal with some car
makers janky apps you can use the
athlete used to with your phone and a
number one self-driving the advances in
self-driving technology are insane
Tesla's autopilot feature is amazing
even though it's not fully autonomous a
number of cars can handle parking
themselves at this point on top of that
there are some great collision avoidance
systems that make cars much safer to
operate I'm not sure I'll get another
car anytime soon but to find out the
latest in cars check out the road show
calm for more top fives check out
five cnet.com am i as actor I'll see you
online
or maybe in the subway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
