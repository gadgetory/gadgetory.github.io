gathered here today to bid farewell to
the technology that died in 2017 this
year we saw several Microsoft products
meet their blue screen of death in April
Microsoft ended life support for Windows
Vista the company also hung up on
Windows Phone with an executive saying
no new features were coming for the
Windows Mobile operating system groove
music faded from existence subscribers
of the streaming music service were
encouraged to migrate to Spotify and
Microsoft pulled the plug on connect the
motion sensing system for the Xbox 360
and Xbox one ceased production it was
also game over for Lego dimensions
developers announced in October there
will be no more updates to the game
platform that used collectible figurines
to unlock gameplay plenty of luxury tech
lost its shine virtu made crazy
expensive cell phones made of gold and
snakeskin but the company went belly-up
and my condolences to anyone who bought
a 3d TV as that television technology is
officially extinct
remember Jusuru the $400 Wi-Fi connected
juicer felt the squeeze when it became
apparent that you could just bypass the
overpriced machine by hand squeezing
juice bags into a glass apple let go of
the shuffle and nano this year it seems
Apple lost faith and plain old mp3
players
Mattel also didn't think that Aristotle
had a prayer it decided not to release
the smart speaker which served as a baby
monitor and also would answer keep
questions but perhaps the loss that
stings the most is having to say goodbye
forever to AOL Instant Messenger better
known as aim aim defined what shot was
for an entire generation but many turned
their back on their buddy list when
smartphones and social media made aim
irrelevant aim launched in 1997 but alas
20 years later the new owner Verizon has
forced aim
set a permanent away message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
