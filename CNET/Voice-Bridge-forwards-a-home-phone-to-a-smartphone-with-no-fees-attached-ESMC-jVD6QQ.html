mission to forward calls from a landline
to your smartphone even better it
promises to do this with no monthly fee
which up until now has been a common
trait for voice over IP products the
voice bridge cost $99 in the box is
small enough that it can fit in the palm
of your hand it's a simple design and
should be easy to hide behind something
for example your router the box has an
Ethernet port telephone jack a microUSB
port and a reset button the front is a
small notification light while
simplicity is great it concerns make the
product harder to set up took me two
tries to get the voice bridge working
some issues arose when trying to connect
to my voice bridge from my iPhone with
the companion application this is not
where the product signs the app is not
as refined as umas which sets out to do
the same thing and more it will get the
job done but at times it can take a
while to make the phone call
successfully plus what it rings in the
phone is locked a notification appears
but you can't enter it right from the
lock screen instead you have to unlock
and open the app which might result in
missing the call missed calls can also
happen if you have an answering machine
as you might pick it up but it might
also take too long to connect and the
machine might grab it before you can for
now the voice bridge fulfills its
promise of letting you take landline
calls from your smartphone but there are
a few hurdles along the way then again
at $99 with no subscription fee and
hopefully future updates or fixes you
can't complain about the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
