drip coffee maker and set it to brew in
many different ways
styles and drink sizes now imagine if
you took that gizmo and added an
internal milk frother what you have
before you is what we have here right
now the new and improved ninja coffee
bar cf0 9 - it has presets to brew many
different styles of coffees such as
specialty concentrated rich you can brew
in small cups to travel mugs all the way
up to 1/2 crafts and full crafts like I
said before this machine has its own
integrated milk frother it swings out
from behind the machine and you just put
your milk in a container and use it to
get your nice frothy cappuccinos and
lattes there are some issues with this
machine though like its predecessor it
has a tendency to over extract its
coffee beans and that gives coffee it
makes a little rougher taste and a
little bit of a bitter aftertaste and
this milk frother isn't actually a true
milk frother it doesn't actually heat
the milk or steam it in any way what it
is is it actually blends and aerates the
milk so you have to put it in the
microwave before if you want warm froth
milk and priced at $200 this coffee
maker is expensive so while this new
updated ninja coffee bar might seem like
a bargain if you take into account its
new features and performance
it doesn't quite add up to its high
price I suggest you go with a Bonavita
which is a much better Brewer and cost a
little less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
