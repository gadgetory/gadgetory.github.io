it's a subcompact car that slots in
under the Focus and Ford's lineup as
such it's Ford's cheapest and smallest
car that they've got Ford offers this
car is a sedan or a hatchback we've got
the hatchback and I think it looks
better and it's more practical than the
sedan we've got room for five passengers
in here although the rear seats a little
bit of a squeeze of course we can throw
these seats down here and expand the
room a lot inside the Fiesta we have
monochrome display here much bigger than
a standard radio display but it does not
have navigation navigation in this car
only comes through the sync TDI which is
called traffic directions and
information and that will give you turn
by turn direction but sync does permit
us to connect phones via bluetooth and
mp3 players via this USB port here so
right now I've got an iPhone hooked up
to that USB so I can use Singh's voice
command call up any artist from my music
library USB please say a command
play artists geographer playing artist
geographer you can also use the buttons
on the dashboard to find your way
through a music library you know this is
just not really a convenient way or a
good way while you're driving down the
road sync also offers app integration
with your smart phone we have a separate
video and you can get a detailed look at
that just search for Ford Sync mobile
apps on CNET TV music coming out of the
stereo will play through a very simple
audio system but it's an above average
sounding system because it has these
tweeters in the doors and they shoot
straight across the cabin here and that
adds a nice crisp detailed element to
the sound
under the hood we have this 1.6 liter
engine it's sitting sideways so it can
turn those front wheels it's a small
engine but it produces 120 horsepower
which is not bad for this little car and
that small size also means decent fuel
economy the EPA ratings are 29 miles per
gallon city 39 miles per gallon highway
let's go take a drive and see how this
thing handles the Ford Fiesta comes bass
with a 5-speed manual transmission now
we have this six-speed dual-clutch
transmission so I put it in Drive
there's not a lot of creep it starts to
move a little bit but you really have to
give a gas to get going as opposed to a
standard torque converter automatic it
has a low range you can put it in that
and this low range is really aggressive
lets the RPMs rise really high and you
really hear that too I think it comes
from the European design that the sound
in it it's a little harsher it seems a
little louder a little harder ride than
you'd expect from an American car and a
lot of Americans might drive this and
think how it feels is kind of cheap it
kind of feels you know harsh but it's
also designed to be a little more
maneuverable that suspension that makes
a little tougher is also more rigid so I
feel a lot of the road coming through it
and the steering which is also
electrically power booster steering
feels a little more responsive overall I
like the feeling of this car the way it
handles it can feel a little twitchy but
it definitely feels very connected with
the road it feels like you're driving
the base model of the 2012 Ford Fiesta
goes for about sixteen thousand dollars
we had the SES trim which goes for 17
500 that comes standard with sync so
there's not a lot you need to option up
in this car the dual clutch automated
manual transmission I showed you who
goes for 1095 that will bump the price
up to over eighteen five there's a lot
of competition in the subcompact space
cars with softer rides maybe a little
more comfortable than the Ford Fiesta
but I really like Sync and I think that
gives the Fiesta a bit
edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
