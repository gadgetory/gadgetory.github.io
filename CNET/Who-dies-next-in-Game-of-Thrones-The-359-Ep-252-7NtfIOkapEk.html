359 we're taping a little bit in advance
this week for Thursday July 13th because
we're going to be out of the office for
a little bit apologies for the hiatus
but we have something special in store
for you today my name's BVG in the house
we got Ben Fox Reuben Roger Chang and
Joni salzman and I can't contribute
because why cuz you're not a game of
Thrones fan oh yeah old things I know
I'm sorry it's just so no it's not at
all not a fan it's just that I'm
clueless I have no idea okay
of all like of all the sort of the key
trends you're into like not into nothing
and god it's just surprising that's all
it's no judgments not a preferences I
don't have the attention span first
season you don't know what's going on
and even like the cliffnotes TV version
compared to the books so many characters
yeah actually the TV show actually
simplifies greatly simplifies the plot
the number of characters from so many
still yeah yeah there's some chapters
after chapters of this sigils and stupid
save all that so before we jump in let's
give people like a general framework of
what we're doing today
yeah sorry so usually we break down the
news of the day but since we're taping
ahead of time and we can't guess what
technology news is gonna be on the 13th
well we could try it's not gonna work
too well we're decided to devote the
show to Game of Thrones which the
premiere is as you're listening to this
will be on Sunday so timely enough that
we can talk about you know hopes
expectations fears many many fears
everyone dying
oh and spoiler alert they're gonna be
spoilers so yes don't watch a game of
Thrones stop watching this and you would
like want to watch Jill definitely stop
watching this so definitely watching
this like we're not gonna like withhold
like we're gonna talk about season sex
we're gonna talk about the season 6
finale so you've been well yeah we're
talking about everything I mean it's
look it's been how long was it pin like
almost a year year and a half year the
house usually the new seasons were a lot
like April yeah they had to extend it
because of the whole
winter so every winter's coming so yeah
really coming right they had they had to
shoot I they could get older environment
because winter's coming so that's why
they delay to show that okay so all
right let's get into it yeah just to set
this you have to like write this all
down because we have a compelling care
deal with so in the north we've got
brands stuck in the other side of the
wall he's the only one who knows Jon
Snow's secret heritage down in
Winterfell you've got Jon Snow and
Satsuma finally reunited hanging out and
rallied the North is the new king of the
north
although I don't know if it's John or
Sansa actually I'm in charge
yeah I know but you know it seems like
charge too because little fingers
hanging around making these little
devious suggestions we've got Arya on
her way after killing Walder Frey and we
think yeah that was pretty badass damn
in King's Landing we have Circe's the
Queen Jamie potentially the the hand of
the coin I forget that was declared
officially I can't remember like it's
like finally Cersei is the Queen right
so she was like the shadow Queen right
after basically are you killing
everybody yes he's a finale which is
that was pretty sweet
Oh surprising also people getting killed
everybody can kill all her kids like yes
all the Lannisters that are left are
just the three siblings that's right and
then we've got obviously crossing the
Narrow Sea finally making her way to
Westeros in a while Tyrion alongside
Tyrion the Dothraki and the unsullied so
and three obviously the three dragons
and the children's sister from the iron
eye exactly they're sailing my ships
they're captured by yar Greyjoy a Theon
Greyjoy yep
in pursuit their uncle Aron I think it's
a rule I don't wanna pronounce please
this crazy evil guy and in the South
lastly we've got Dorne it's also allied
with Danny because you know they want to
pay Cersei back for the death of Oberyn
a while back when he got smooshed by the
mountain and I think also sorry which
one was the one that married Tommen Oh
family Margaery that's right Margery
which is Jerry's family is allied with
Danny too I think
right the mother is alive yeah she's
dead you know the words yes we can get
very good okay what's that was it there
I've set the seed what that's usually
complicated but what do you so what do
you think is gonna happen I just want to
throw it out there just a small comment
that I'm pretty sad that Marjorie is
dead I saw I saw great things for that
character I thought like she was they
were building something up like she was
playing this long game a lot that a lot
where they make it sound like they're
just gonna stick around for a long time
and then lop their head off nobody
seemed like she was playing some game
right the way she was sort of acting and
for the sparrow right she had something
going on right she had some sort of con
going on and like it all just poof that
all the storylines just ended in one
blow this is why Game of Thrones is a
good show yeah always surprised by that
imagine like everyone was surprised
about that since obviously were we're
way off book territory now so yeah it's
everyone's basically speculating yeah so
what are you hoping to see I really want
to know what happens between Jon Snow
and Danny yes maybe some interaction
because we now know that they're related
yes I don't know I would say that it's
now unlikely they'll become king and
queen of the Iron Throne but no other
show no I feel like that's pretty pretty
normal for the toydarians but don't you
think that so as much as I feel like the
audience would be super into that and
like wouldn't this be such a nice happy
ending like why when has that ever
happened on Game of Thrones like that
just seems like the unlikeliest of
scenarios for for that show I don't know
I've seen the other theory that that Jon
and Sansa get married to legitimize his
whole north which would be awesome not
oh he's not I've learned at all he's not
no no okay
well knows Liana right right
half-brother half-sister they're like
cousins they're the same amount of
incest Danny wasn't like a rapist she
was married a chariot before Tara was
yeah I was telling Jeb before as I was
watching me watching season one even
knowing like all the terribleness like I
was still really annoyed by her like
that first season where she worried
about how she loved Joffrey like she
only will ever wanted to be Queen and
married Jefferson has beautiful blond
babies right and back then even back
then loved are you love Tyrion like they
were pretty much badass from the start
yeah but Sasa like took years character
as much as we all root for Aria and like
those characters it makes her character
a lot more interesting is that true from
a place that there was definitely art to
that yeah yeah yeah yeah and Theon
Greyjoy too Greyjoy was in that first
season yeah he was pretty it was very
obnoxious but I kind of like that
version of him a lot more than the
sniveling you know like like the
squashed bug yeah you know but that was
also a very interesting character I have
to admit that during that first season
the first half of the season I confused
Jon Snow and Theon Greyjoy and the
eldest oh yeah former king of the north
former king of the north those three of
Mike I literally looked identical to me
first few episodes like who what okay
[Laughter]
you got Crowley hair black earlier
they're all looking like I mean you kind
of have a point there yes Danny finally
making her way to Westeros yeah bring
some justice
seven years only six Austin's yeah just
get on with it already
problem is is that anytime somebody
tries to take King's Landing it's it
turns into her total mess it doesn't
happen so it seems like Oh Cersei is
like in huge trouble you know she has a
much bigger Denarius has a much bigger
army I have a feeling that this is not
gonna go well I mean we did see the
trailers and it did seem like there was
some sort of epic battle where the
Dothraki or flaunt or riding dragons are
like above them and it seems like the
way I was cut like they're facing off
against Jamie's army so seems like
there's gonna be a pretty a clash and
you know they've been hinting that this
story goes a lot faster this season than
previously so I wonder if they like so
fast deal with molasses if they deal
with all that really quickly and like
they all kind of look up north because
that's where the real threat is right
yeah these duel wars that are coming the
one that everyone pays attention to and
the one that's everyone's kind of
worried yeah except for I want to thank
everyone take a short break to try to
see so Brian how much of that Detroit
follow it's like it's pretty much
another language if you don't understand
or know anything from the show right it
just it's true I mean like there are why
are these guys talking about his says so
much might be so casual about actual
incest yeah yeah I mean like Superman
it's been around long enough to like you
you understand like the cultural points
of like yes certain major characters but
like with Game of Thrones it is you know
certain signs its own little universe
yeah yeah yeah I mean you probably if
you don't watch the show you probably
know it as like the uber violent movie
nudity and beheading filled so much less
nudity though yeah earlier is the season
in the seasons I felt like in the show
like yeah there was that the term sex
position was born from season one which
every time they need to dump lots of
information on you they throw naked
women on
it's green it's seriously maybe like
doing it and like I remember watching
like Daenerys his brother who died oh
yeah yeah they were like basically doing
it while I was talking about dragons or
whatever like the history of dragons up
like all the explanation all the
exposition happens during like right
little figure talked about his little
backstory that's like Nicky would be the
background best show ever
of course this is why that was like the
way that they are and their bona fides
with HP yeah I have to imagine if you're
an HP looks like you probably give them
yeah we need more creatures yeah this
isn't an HBO show so one other aspect
that I wanted to throw out there so
Brandon Stark
yeah is the guy that was getting trained
by the three-eyed Raven yeah well I'm
waiting for like something awesome to
happen they're like but what sort of
what sort of powers could he possibly
have like I mean trolling yeah no he
didn't read the past yeah basically I
mean so I'm hoping something really
interesting happens with that because
he's fine he's been out on his own
narrative his own plot for like a really
long time yeah I'm waiting for like
sometime Ely it looks like I'm what I'm
looking for actually is seeing like a
full-on star I know it seems like there
was a scene where brand was in
Winterfell in the trailer right so he's
heading back up north but I feel like
they're all gonna converge and like
they're all like the Superfriends at
this going but they go out and kill
everybody basically that would be great
I mean like you know that's probably
gonna happen where those brand had one
of the more compelling stories last
season with the Hodor episode mmm right
and the idea that he can influence
things in the past I think they're gonna
hit upon more the season yeah it just
they just got to be careful you don't
want to get into time cops territory I
feel like that's what they're gonna end
up doing gonna get weird it's like a
little ball of time travel minute of all
the time-travel movies you reference he
referenced touching jean-claude Van
Damme
like the most mediocre time-travel
movies well it was intentional I was
like you don't want to do right like a
crab version of time-travel right I got
that reference yes yes we've got Brian
on boy here we go let's just talk about
Back to the Future actually pretty good
okay that time travel was pretty smart
actually okay so also who do you think
is gonna end up like on the irons run at
the end of the show this is like usually
like this is this is the game I'm
usually playing in my head as I'm
watching the show so I think would be
fun if the Iron Throne ceased to be the
like thing that everyone liked the
CyberPower that got melted down that's a
really cool idea I didn't even think of
that the whole idea that the size of the
narrative yeah awesome I don't know like
my impression was that it was like
always gonna end up being Littlefinger
for like the London oh yeah I mean he
was the puppet master for the longest
time right by it I like what you guys
are saying we're like you don't guess
like who's gonna be the one that ends up
setting their like they just get rid of
it in time I think it would always be
the person behind the scenes doing stuff
like he's never gonna be somebody that
he's never gonna be like a Daenerys that
can rally giant armies to support her
he's the one who like manipulates he has
to rally that army some behind the
scenes manipulator for life he like see
me you may see the last like this will
be his last season oh yeah he's only
getting killed I feel like there's like
a reckoning big all over all this so
much all I care no no not just him but
like a bunch of characters do they have
to get a super villain they need a new
super villain terrible walkers the
Whitewater
definitely yeah ultimate like a human
super villain to like really I mean
there's still the uncle the Greyjoy
uncle Greyjoy uncle I suppose right I
don't know if he's super villain but
he's definitely like easy to hate he's
easy to hate he's sort of like a in
turmeric intermediary Dylan before
nice they're gonna fill many bars right
a mini-boss exactly because the White
Walkers are probably in season eight
issue right yes to left well technically
I think like it's we have one more
season but it's split in half isn't that
what they're doing well it's two short
seasons basically but they're longer
episodes yeah longer episodes watch it
makes sense that is if you if you break
down the episodes you've got like I
guess two different themes and different
settings longer episodes means you could
focus more on certain stories yeah I
don't know like I think the season
finale I suppose to be like movie length
basically I don't know my kids not gonna
stay awake or asleep for them they did a
pretty good job with like an epic fight
sequence oh I think like if they're
gonna do all-out war this time they're
not gonna I don't imagine that they'll
screw it out well I wonder how they're
gonna top it though they've had some
really epic battles over this the last
couple times except for the very first
one where it's basically Tyrion gets hit
he's like later on that season like okay
they just showed a bunch of horses or uh
like Jaime had already been captured
like they'd show it's really active math
of about like you could tell back then
HBO was like what you proved yourself
for a couple seasons before I think it
was about Blackwater well the first time
they like yeah that was really had an
epic epic all-out war scene and that was
cool it was very cool nice yeah what
else is there to look forward to um I
don't know just transporting things up
dragons more dragons more dragons
yeah it's here Ian's fate we haven't
talked a lot about Syrian know there's
one character everybody gets a happy
ending Shh you don't know that no that's
true it could be okay
it's Charlie I think if I carry this had
a happy ending they're just like oh and
I wonder what happens to Gilly and Sam
yeah
like disappear yeah I think they're
supposed to play I mean I'm sure the
place some sort of rule right they made
a big deal then yeah what was that place
it's like they're all the others we're
all the Meister's get trained so I can't
imagine that they've like spent all the
money on the effects for that place just
doing that's it bye I stole that sword
those days that sword is critical for
killing White Walkers yeah yeah yeah so
what I would also like to see is another
one of those like Giants come back yeah
like the awesome giant didn't wasn't the
one who died like the last one
oh no is that true I think so yeah stick
now she kind of sucks totally loved that
guy yeah it's so much hard it's like a
giant with a giant heart
fight yeah by nature he's got a big
heart he's he's a giant he's a big heart
is big I mean like I'm not trying to be
literal here's a big garden anyway I
like that guy
alright well that's that's a
heartwarming way to end things yeah well
while we wrap things up thank you for
humoring us and our our got discussion
will be eagerly watching the show on
Sunday can't wait it's been a really
long time yeah so alright stay tuned for
our next we'll have a show I don't know
