smart speaker that is a connected
speaker with a built-in voice assistant
you had to be content with the Amazon
echo while it's an insanely popular
product and offers the widest
compatibility of any competitor its main
problem is it doesn't sound very good
what if you want something that is good
at playing tunes enter the Apple home
pod Apple says this is a music speaker
first and a smart speaker second but at
three hundred and fifty dollars is it
the best option for the money for
example for that price you can get not
one but two Sonos ones which also
incorporate Amazon Alexa and work in
stereo I compared notes we've seen its
own audio fairly active Guttenberg to
get his take on the smart speaker
phenomenon now Steve you're
predominantly a two-channel type of
person but you spent a lot of time with
the Apple home pod what surprised you
about it how fussy it was to use really
I mean I thought it'd be you know more
Apple friendly it knows I'm an Apple
person say hey you're one of us but it
was aloof it was distant distant as far
as sound quality is concerned well
distant it sounded small but then it
sounded big sound quality changed a lot
from when I change one tune to the next
to the next right and I think it's got
something to do with the lobes these the
system of life stereo sort of beams
which changed depending on when you move
the speaker around but whatever its best
qualities its size okay
I'm best you know if you're into the
whole Apple ecosystem it's it's a great
thing what about bass response makes a
lot of bass for a very small speaker and
I would say that is its best quality
more so than any of the other three
speakers here it has a surprising amount
of bass yes
quality I mean this is a really good
product if you wanted to stick it on
your bench and you know you're doing
your cooking or doing something like
that you need to ask Siri something
it's really good for that absolutely now
compared to something like the Google
home how do you think it compares you
know size matters it sounds like a
bigger more satisfying speaker I mean I
imagine that some people who especially
would by the max you know one a party
and have fun and stuff and I think it's
it's a more fun can play louder more
rock and roll right it also has a 3.5
millimeter import it's done I don't know
so you can I guess hook it up to
anything you wanted like a TV you could
use it as a sender speaker for TV which
is something you can't do for this or
for the dishonest ones
really but we've obviously compared all
the these three speakers which one is
the winner for you the two the two one
it's actually are definitely my far and
away favorite because they're the
closest to sounding like important
expression a high five right so what is
it about these that these can't do there
one okay
they're mono speakers they just sounded
more contained and sound like coming out
of a box supposed to sound filling a
room right so what would you use the
Sunnis wants for see I can imagine the
son√≠s ones being someone's home audio
system as like in terms of listening to
music as opposed to just having it on
his background I would say the SONA
swans would definitely fit that bill
right even if it would say you know on a
side table or something would you still
buy if you had a choice between in any
of these three products if you wanted
something that you could use for
background music would you still choose
the ones I think they're all acceptable
for background music and if that's the
priority just to have sound I would say
the home pod would be fine right I guess
it depends on which ecosystem you tied
into that's true if you're in Google you
probably get this one if you're with
Apple this one this one's going to be
the interesting product because coming
this year sometime you're going to get
Google and Amazon the problem with that
being the mics aren't as sensitive as
either of these two products right you
were saying before we started that the
voice recognition on the solises yeah
the microphones aren't as sensitive as
either of these two products that's that
is this this Apple home pods biggest
claim to fame apart from the bass
response is that it's microphones are
very sensitive
very good but I think for me for 350
dollars the Sonos one is a really good
product and as you're saying it's it's a
great stereo replacement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
