styles we have cases in aluminum and
stainless steel as well as a new
material we've been working on for quite
some time
ceramic this this new white Apple watch
and ceramic has this gorgeous pearl like
shine it the finish is remarkably smooth
it's actually four times harder than
stainless steel so it's this ultimate
combination of beauty and strength and
it looks great paired with a variety of
vans we think it's going to be a
wonderful addition to the Apple watch
family
the Apple watch Nike Plus this isn't
just a watch it's your perfect running
partner it's simple it's fun and it's
easy to use and we think it delivers the
best the best running experience that's
out there starting to run has never been
easier and we give you a shortcut that
takes you straight into your run and if
you prefer you can just tell Siri to
start a run and off you go it's that
simple but when you go out for a run you
don't want to be distracted so we give
you just what you need at a glance your
distance or your pace on a big clear
screaming and if you're the type though
who really wants a lot of detail we've
always got advance mode just for you but
one of the biggest hurdles that all
runners face is actually motivation so
we started with a simple idea of an
invitation
are we running today and we motivate you
through insightful invitations
personalized just for you been a few
days since your last run maybe the
weather isn't perfect or it is perfect
today you can get out and if your
friends have a head start we'll let you
know
Jeff's got two miles ahead clearly I got
a catch-up we also know at sea we also
know that those who run on Sundays are
more active and will be more active
throughout the rest of the week so every
Sunday we invite you to join runners
from all around the world to run at your
own pace wherever you are
we call it just - it's Sunday's with
invitations like these running is made
easier and simply a part of your life
now most devices today they focus solely
on data and metrics not this one
the Apple watch Nike+ focuses on you and
your life it's a powerful device with a
simple solution your perfect running
partner and it's available in four
amazing cool colors and we can't wait
for you to try it out
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
