taking a very early look at the new a
sous ultrabook this is the zenbook you x
32 and you may recall the original a
sous ultrabook was the zenbook you x 31
that one we liked a lot at the end of
2011 it was very macbook air like as
this one is we thought was a little bit
too expensive and it had a couple of
physical flaws the lid was hard to open
we weren't crazy about the touchpad this
new updated version actually fixes some
of those problems and has some better
hardware the price is still going to be
a little bit on the high side now this
new updated system has one of Intel's
3rd generation core i series processes
in it otherwise known as ivory bridge
but it's not one of the initial quad
core Core i7 ivory bitch processes that
have already been released it's one of
the next wave of them that's going to be
announced and released within the next
couple of weeks so we've agreed in this
early preview not to name the actual
processor inside but I was overall
playing around with it fairly happy with
the performance partially because
besides the integrated intel HD 4000
graphics this particular ultrabook also
has a discrete nvidia geforce 620m
graphics card and it will switch back
and forth between the two graphics
subsystems as needed that actually gives
you a real boost when it comes to
playing games i ran the street fighter
foreign here at full 1920 x 1080
resolution there's a very high end
screen here and it ran it like 57 frames
per second which is fantastic when you
consider this is a super thin super
light ultra but it's a tiny bit thicker
tiny bit heavier than the original you
x31 then book but i think the trade-off
is definitely worth it even though this
updated version of the zenbook looks
almost exactly like the original there
is one change I'm pretty happy with on
the original when the lid was closed it
was actually kind of hard to open it
when you reach down your finger wouldn't
quite catch on it in this new version
they must have gone back and done a
little bit of re-engineering because now
it's actually quite easy to open and I'm
pretty pleased with that improvement
hopefully we'll have a final shipping
version of this product pretty soon to
bring you a full review and full
benchmark scores of i'm dan ackerman and
that
