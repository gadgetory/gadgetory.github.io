Los Angeles International Auto Show we
always like to give you a full overview
of the show but then we want to make
sure that we give you an idea of the
cars that speak to us personally let's
take a look at those cars now I faker
the 2015 LA Auto Show has got to be the
porsche cayman gt4 clubsport what is it
well you take a min GT for which is
already a pretty ridiculous car rip out
the interior weld in a roll cage give it
raised your suspension a central air
jack and my heart just goes to flutter
it cost one hundred and sixty five
thousand dollars it's not real legal but
I don't care I still want one I'm going
fiat 124 because it recon jerz the last
best thing Fiat did in this country
before they left in the 80s now if you
remember the 124 you immediately see
this in July at 124 if you don't recall
the 124 you look at this and say hot
looking version of the miata which is
what it is now it's fascinating to me is
that Fiat says they redid every piece of
sheet metal so why does it look so much
like a Miata from the side that was a
long way around to come back at the same
place but the face in the rump are
definitely I think real classy and very
retro cool bottom line this guy's a
crowd-pleaser which is always what I
look for in a belle of the ball at one
of the major auto shows
my pick of the show is the alfa romeo
giulia and i will tell you why
rear-wheel drive v6 with a manual
transmission and fifty fifty weight
distribution no let's just let's just
take a look at these specs here shall we
so I start at the top 505 horsepower a
little bit lower 443 pound-feet of
torque oh just a little lower 3.8
seconds from zero to 60 Oh lower lower
still 191 top speed and be pinnacle the
peak the apex of the spec sheet is a
Nurburgring time of seven minutes and 39
seconds Thank You Elsa my favorite car
is the subaru impreza sedan concept
because I mean well look at it it's
absolutely gorgeous and there's a good
chance it might come into production in
this form although i think the lad door
handles my pick for the show is this
2017 mercedes-benz sl550 this has all
the power of the much bigger and heavier
s550 but in a two-seater roadster so it
should be a lot of fun to drive I'm not
crazy about mercedes-benz current cabin
electronics but this supports apple
carplay so that takes care of that
well Brian beat me to the feet and I
can't in good conscience trick the miata
yet again so I'm going with the infiniti
QX 34 my pic it's a small crossover from
infinity and i think it's one of their
better looking cars in recent memory I
mean look at it in this gorgeous
metallic Coco it's just sleek and sexy
just love it about the only bad thing I
can think about the infiniti QX 30 is
that well it makes all the other
crossovers in this booth look just sort
of frumpy by comparison get the rest of
your line together infinity that's it
here from Los Angeles let us know what
you think do you like the new Fiat tell
us we're at Roadshow on Twitter it's the
end of the 2015 auto show season but
we're gonna be back in Detroit in early
2016 we look forward to seeing you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
