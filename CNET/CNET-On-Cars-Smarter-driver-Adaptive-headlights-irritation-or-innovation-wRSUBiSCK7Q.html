swiveling headlights that some cars have
have been clearly linked to lower
insurance claims on cars that have them
and also been proven to give drivers
earlier detection of objects ahead on
the road yet a lot of folks think that
these swiveling lights create more glare
when the other guy has them and they
still remain pretty rare on a lot of
cars let's find out what's going on in
October 2014 the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety had 20 sample
participants few cars with oncoming
headlights of different types and rate
the visual pane if you will on what's
called the de Bourgh visual discomfort
index now high-intensity discharge
headlights are really bright white ones
like we have here rated higher than
standard headlights as you might imagine
on that discomfort scale but not in the
realm of being unacceptable what's
interesting is the swiveling or adaptive
front lighting system headlights did not
rate meaningfully higher than ones that
are fixed dead ahead another finding by
the IIHS is that these swiveling
adaptive headlights can allow a driver
to spot something as soon as a third of
a second sooner on a curved road that
can translate to let's say 15 feet
sooner detection of a pedestrian let's
say when you're driving at 30 miles an
hour BMW and Lexus were among the first
brands I encountered with these adaptive
front lighting systems almost 10 years
ago back in the 2004 model year now 10
plus years later they're still kind of
rare
as of 2014 14% of models of cars that
were offered in the market had them
standard 22% had them optional still in
the minority of the market so adaptive
front lighting despite its documented
benefits and apparent livability still
remains in the luxury tech category not
the you must offer it safety tech
category
next time you buy a car it pays to
double check if it offers these
headlights that give you a bit of an
edge more realities of modern driving
