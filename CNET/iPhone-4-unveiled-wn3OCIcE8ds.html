leap since the original iPhone we're
introducing iPhone 4 this is really hot
and there are there are well over a
hundred new features and we don't have
time to cover all of them today so I get
to cover eight of them with you eight
new features of the iPhone 4 the first
one an all-new design now stop me if
you've already seen this
believe me you ain't seeing it you've
got to see this thing in person it is
one of the most beautiful designs you've
ever seen this is beyond the doubt the
most precise thing one of the most
beautiful things we've ever made
glass on the front and the rear and
stainless steel running around and the
precision of which this is made is is
beyond any consumer product we've ever
seen its closest kin is like a beautiful
old Leica camera it's unheard of in
consumer products today just gorgeous
and it's really thin this is the new
iPhone 4
it is just 9.3 millimeters thick that is
24% thinner than the iPhone GS again a
quarter thinner in something you didn't
think could get any thinner as a matter
of fact it is the thinnest smartphone on
the planet let me point out a few things
a few of the external things on it here
are the volume controls volume up volume
down and mute on the front we have a
front-facing camera we have the receiver
we have a home button people have asked
what's this
some have even said this doesn't seem
like Apple what are these lines in this
beautiful stainless steel band well it
turns out there's not just one of them
there's three of them and they are part
of the entire structure of this phone
that stainless steel band that runs
around is the primary structural element
of the phone and there are these three
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some brilliant engineering which
actually uses the stainless steel band
as part of the antenna system and so yes
and the other is UMTS and GSM so it's
got these integrated antennas right in
the structure of the phone it's never
been done before three and a half inches
the same size as the iPhone 3GS
yet with 960 by 640 pixels that's four
times more pixels than the iPhone gia
iPhone 3GS 326 pixels per inch an 800 to
1 contrast ratio which is again four
times better than the 3GS we're using
IPS technology this is a very advanced
LCD technology which is quite a bit in
our opinion quite a bit better than the
OLED technology for these types of
products and provides much more accurate
color and much higher resolution you
can't make an OLED display with this
type of resolution right now and so we
think the IPS technology is really quite
superior and it results in incredibly
sharp text images and video
