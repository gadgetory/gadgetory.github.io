your Google licious for everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
and if you didn't think Google search
could get any smarter it just did and it
will continue to do so now Google search
can now answer a variety of more complex
questions that can understand the
semantics of each part of the question
so you can ask you something like what
was the Warriors roster in 2011 and
you'll find a roster from the previous
season and not the current one look how
stack that team was with mba greats like
charles Jenkins and dominic McGuire all
right now Google can also list results
in ascending or descending order so you
can ask what are the largest cities in
California by area boom and maybe you
want to try a complex combination how
about this what was the US population
when ronda rousey was born see there you
go she was born in 1987 and it got that
too geez google you're really smart but
just wait until their knowledge graph
gets placed into the head of an
independent thinking machine from the
future
I'll be back what all right google gets
major props after the horrible and
tragic events in Paris they are making
phone calls to France free on Google
Hangouts you can get hangouts on both
the google play store or the Apple App
Store and it's great to really see tech
companies step up when they can so thank
you google also swiftkey is still
popular on the Play Store and their
latest version 6.0 brings double word
predictions so you can select two words
together that swiftkey predicts are
coming next you'll also get new
languages supported and an improved
emoji panel which is obviously very
important alright Motorola partnered
with Ashton Kutcher for a fun video
series to promote the new Moto X phone
they told unknowing victims that they
were running an experiment that required
them to keep their hands in two circles
on a table then they started sending
notifications to the person's phone to
see how long it took for them to look at
it see one person took all of six
seconds and yes people are that sad
alright Monument Valley was one of the
great games from 2014 and the team has
brought their expertise for a new VR
game for the galaxy s6 called Lands End
it's an adventure through landscapes to
awake a lost civilization and anyone
with a gear VR setup needs to get on
this right now and for all you galaxy
users still waiting patiently a leaked
roadmap has revealed when you can expect
to receive the Android marshmallow
update with most of the current mobile
devices getting the update as early as
this year and through februari 2016 for
others now they're part of phase one
right now but some of the less popular
models are coming in phase two which
still doesn't have specific target
months and what's old is new again and I
could prove that to you last week a new
samsung phone was certified by the
chinese regulatory authority and the
images of the device have been leaked
out to reveal a samsung flip phone I'm
being serious it takes design cues from
the s6 of the note 5 on the top with
that flip phone design it has two three
point nine inch screens on both sides of
the phone with a 16 megapixel rear
camera a 5-megapixel front-facing and
three gigs of ram see somewhere in a
phone recycling facility overseas the
motorola razr is smiling alright that's
going to do for this week's show you can
email us at Google Isha's at cnet com
or tweet me at Brian Tom thanks so much
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for some more of that Google issues
