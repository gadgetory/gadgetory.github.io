ten nine eight seven six five four three
two one
they're going from panel JC copies will
go
two hours 47 seconds into flight Falcon
9 performing nominally we're currently
throttling down the nine merlin 1d
engines on the first stage preparing for
the period of maximum dynamic pressure
and going supersonic we're seeing the
view from a ground camera and obviously
we're having trouble with the autofocus
but Falcon 9 continues to track down
range well power on the merlin 1d
engines looks good and avionics power
looks good now the sequence of events
coming up at t-plus 2:45 we will have
main engine cutoff will shut down the
nine merlin engines the first stage will
then separate and we will light the
second stage engine saw those activities
coming up in just under 20 seconds from
now
we're throttling down the engines and
preparation for Miko
at that conditioned stage 180s we've had
a successful shutdown at separation
second stage engine has lit major
activity coming up in about 14 seconds
is separation to the payload fairing
separation confirmed you can see three
and the alidium Nick satellites of the
set of five as I mentioned the grace
satellites Manning on top of that but
not visible from the kids below the
normal trajectory in half minutes into
flight we've heard the call out the
trajectory is nominal the power in the
upper stage engine is good great payload
deployed converted we have confirmation
of deployment of the base follow-on
satellites so if they're the first major
milestone today the first satellites
have been deployed we're now going into
a Coast phase with the second stage with
the five iridium next satellites still
attached we're just past sixty five
minutes since a great launch of Falcon 9
we're setting up for the first of five
deployments of iridium next satellites
the first satellite planned to deploy in
about 25 seconds from now
first iridium satellite caleb deploy
confirmed and a nice visual confirmation
of the first of the five iridium next
satellites being deployed off of the
dispenser mounted on top of the second
stage of Falcon nine coming up on the
second deployment in about five seconds
from now
that could already a satellite payload
to play confirmative another nice view
of the second iridium satellite being
deployed Iridium satellite payload
deploy confirmed on nice view of iridium
deployment off of the dispenser thanks
for letting us share the mission of
Falcon 9 with you and join us on our
next upcoming flight out of Cape
Canaveral at the end of May with that
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
