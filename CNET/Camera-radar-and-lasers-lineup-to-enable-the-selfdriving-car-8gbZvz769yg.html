building the self-driving car of the
future is getting the sensors right
letting the car know what's in the world
around it right now I'm in a car by
Renaissance a chip company that supplies
chips to automotive manufacturers around
the world they're just testing out their
new our car h2 chip that can actually
enable self-driving but at this point
we're just looking at the sensor fusion
what how these chips process the sensors
around the car
so we've got a view right now a surround
view from cameras around this car we're
in and this is showing us what's all the
way around the car and this is being
processed by the computers the computers
can use this to help determine what not
to hit and where to go where it's safe
to go in a self-driving car but now
let's look to another step in this how
the car finds the lanes it can go into
with this view we're looking at the
forward cameras the car is looking at
the lanes and the cameras are
identifying lane lines and it's using
this green band here to show us that
it's recognized where the lanes are it's
looking at the markings on the road
that's obviously crucially important for
self-driving cars so can determine where
it can actually go and how to stay in
its own lane this is what engineers call
a scatter pattern this is sensor fusion
it's taking all the input from those
cameras and light our sensors around the
car showing what's around and you
actually see on here to identify
specific things like there's a car
coming up here and again you can see it
up here that is telling us that's a car
the libraries the computers in the back
of this car will recognize these things
and apply a label to them now this is
just a sensor demonstration at this
point but what Renaissance engineers are
doing are taking this data and figuring
out how they can make the car understand
what to do in these circumstances when
they find these things on the road so
this is one of the first steps in
developing the self-driving car that
we're looking forward to in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
