the office and this year not much has
changed with Apple's new phone so we're
not expecting a lot of surprises but
let's see what's in the box first thing
you'll notice is this big battery
warning wonder why open it from here
with this fancy box cutter alright and
here it is it's the new gold color which
is different from last year's it's more
of a cream color from what I can tell
from the box lastic alright it's a 64
gig iPhone plus I'm gonna throw away the
box it's in the way and continue on and
here we go same thing designed by Apple
continue on we're gonna put these
instructions on the side because we will
be needing them and from the front it
looks very very similar to last year's
iPhone 7 and the previous iPhones up
until this redesign take the plastic off
on the back what's different this year
is the back is now glass take the
plastic off the front put this aside and
again this is more of a bronze color on
the side and a cream color I don't know
why they're calling it gold it's not
quite the gold we expected and still the
touch ID again not much has changed
gonna put that aside inside the box same
thing you have the wall connector and
dongil which a lot of us have lost by
now and the earphones inside the cable
and that's about it
again not a lot of surprises stay tuned
for more we have the full review up on
cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
