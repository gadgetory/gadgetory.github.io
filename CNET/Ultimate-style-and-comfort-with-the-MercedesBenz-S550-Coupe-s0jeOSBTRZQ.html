the body styling straight out of the jet
age and supreme levels of comfort you
don't mind losing a couple doors for the
mercedes-benz s-class coupe
this is the mercedes-benz this is the
mercedes-benz S five to do this here ah
now this is much better this is the 2015
mercedes-benz s550 coupe I really love
the styling of this car it's just really
beautiful from the outside of course
this being the Rossetti's benz coupe
version of the s550 it only has two
doors and the rear seat isn't nearly as
comfortable as the front here if you
want rear seat comfort you need the
sedan the dashboard here is also really
beautiful it's got this really simple
and spare styling leather across here
too big LCDs here for most of the car
control functions here mercedes-benz
doesn't really do too much with this
instrument cluster LCD like it doesn't
change color when you go into sport mode
but one thing it does it's really cool
is it shows night vision so if I push
this button here it's dark outside this
will actually show me a infrared vision
of the road ahead now of course this is
my main screen here and it is huge this
is for the infotainment functions I
control the content on here with this
dial and buttons down here now this is
pretty typical mercedes-benz stuff we
see this in a lot of cars this is the
latest generation of what they call
their command interface so if I push up
I get this upper ribbon that shows me
the main functions navigation radio
media telephone they've actually added
internet to telephone as well and then
vehicle settings if I push down then I
get specific things along a lower ribbon
for whatever function is up but I have
noticed this can be a little bit slow
especially the PIO eye searches first
off I have to enter everything letter by
letter and this does not have the finger
tracing recognition that BMW and Audi
both have so to enter letters I actually
have to turn this dial along the strip
it's like using an old rotary dial
telephone really slow and every time I
try to access one of the internet
functions in this car one of its apps
the dashboard it takes forever I get
this establishing internet connection
screen coming up
it just takes such a long time it's
really just not worth using this
function in the car for other audio
sources I have the typical ones for a
high-end car I've got an onboard hard
drive here I've got T USB ports in the
console I've got HD radio satellite
radio and I've also got bluetooth
streaming audio what I don't get is any
way to search the music library on my
phone I actually have to go to my phone
to bring up music and that's a little
bit behind the times look behind some of
the other luxury carmakers as for the
audio system that's one of the fantastic
points about this car standard you get a
brewmaster audio system with 13 speakers
that should sound really good but in
this car I've actually got the Burmester
3d surround sound system I didn't even
really know what 3d sound means but this
has 24 speakers 1540 watts of
amplification and the fidelity is just
amazing it's just beautiful one of the
key things that makes the mercedes-benz
s550 coupe comfortable is the air
suspension a really smooth ride and it
just adds so much to the comfort level
especially with the soundproofing in the
cabin with his aromatic suspension
though I can just push a button on the
console here and take it from comfort
mode to sport mode sport mode makes the
throb a little more sensitive adds a
little more pepper to it and with its
standard 4matic all-wheel drive
suspension it handles pretty well under
the hood I've got a 4.7 liter v8 twin
turbos one on each bank of cylinders
that's good for 449 horsepower 516
pound-feet of torque
one thing mercedes-benz does really well
lately is driver-assistance features and
we got all of them on this car this
should be able to drive almost
autonomously in stop-and-go traffic and
really free you up I've tested a little
bit and it seems to work pretty well but
not fully autonomous yet base-price
hundred and nineteen thousand nine
hundred dollars there's a Premium
Package for $3500
then there's the audio system in the
Burmester premium 3d surround sound
system that'll run you sixty four
hundred dollars the package that really
sounds like a bargain after those prices
is the driver assistance package that's
only $2,800 add those together you come
to about a hundred and fifty four
thousand total with destination and of
course all our things like navigation
and all that that comes standard as it
should in a car at this level it's a
pretty big price to pay but this is a
really unique looking car and it is just
uniquely comfortable and its general
capabilities as an all-around car it
does everything so well
