best portable bluetooth speakers but it
did have a few small shortcomings
now bose has addressed them in the
Soundlink mini - which comes in two
colors carbon and pearl and costs the
same $200 hi I'm David Carly from
cnet.com and this new one point five
pound model looks nearly identical to
the original sound like mini but it now
has a built-in microphone for
speakerphone capabilities another
improvement is its 10 hour battery
rating up from 7 hours in the previous
model the other important change is that
it now charges via a standard USB cable
rather than a proprietary AC adapter you
can charge it with most USB sources and
the speaker also ships with a charging
cradle that uses a standard USB cord the
speaker which has a wireless range of
around 30 feet allows you to pair two
devices to it at the same time you can
switch back and forth between the
devices alternating audio streams and it
can remember up to 8 devices boses also
streamline the pairing process with new
voice prompts and the speaker identifies
your devices by name using
text-to-speech connected to David's
iPhone 3 as far as I can tell the sound
hasn't changed the original sound like
mini was able to produce impressive
sound for its tiny size and this model
does as well it just plays a lot bigger
than it looks with a decent amount of
bass and relatively clean natural sound
like with all these small Bluetooth
speakers you don't get any stereo
separation and when you throw
complicated music at it or music with a
lot of bass the speaker compensates by
restraining the volume a little and
clipping certain frequencies so the
speaker doesn't distort in other words
it has its limitations that caveat aside
it is ideal for smaller rooms and is
clearly one of the best compact wireless
speakers with an excellent design strong
sound and improved feature set and
battery life the more rugged UE boom and
Sony's SRS x-33 and SRS x 55 our other
top notch Bluetooth speakers in this
size and price class
but it's hard to go wrong with the sound
like mini - I'm David Carr doughy thanks
