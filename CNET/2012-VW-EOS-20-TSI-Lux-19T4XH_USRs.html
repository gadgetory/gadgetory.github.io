you reinvigorate the legendary VW gone
and really well with jaw-dropping
engineering overhead instead of a canvas
rag but can that one thing outweigh all
this car does rather badly let's drive
to 2012 VW EOS check the tech
it costs more than any VW should looks
too much like every jetta does and
drives like an overpowered circus car
might but if you want the most number of
roof styles in one car this isn't on
your list it is your list now this is
why you buy a Volkswagen Eos watch what
happens here comes the most amazing
piece of automotive machinery rising up
out of the bowels of this thing you've
got the following your overhead rails a
glass moonroof is tucked in there a
glass backlight is tucked in there and
it's all going to work around that rear
quarter panel that also lifts up to
clamshell this whole thing into
availability by the way this is the only
retractable in the world that also has a
moving glass moonroof pretty slick the
top is a wonder but you'll also wonder
what you're going to do without a trunk
much of the space is taken up by this
folding wind blocker thing in what looks
like a huge Domino's delivery bag make
room for the Cinna Stix in the cabin now
inside the EOS a pretty standard VW
arrangement you've seen this kind of
gauge cluster and we've seen this head
unit before kind of chintzy on the
screen size but let's check out what's
driven behind it you turn the center
controller here which is rotate and
click and it gets you through various
icons that pop up as you go there
there's something wrong with it it just
doesn't really make any sense there's
nothing about a hemispherical array that
aids my navigation of these things the
map is pretty good quality though and as
you can see you've got several views
this 3d view is quite nice you've also
got the usual 2ds street names are nice
and clear and the rendering and the dot
pitch is also nice again though on a
small screen if I want to hit those
buttons that's a little too small but
it's right there I want to do it they
should have bumped those up in size oh
you notice what's missing here is I go
in and out of the map yeah traffic a car
this price ought to have that let's go
to the media options now you've got two
buttons for media band and Media button
itself band is obviously which radio
band you listening to AM FM or Sirius
satellite radio no HD radio here by the
way if I go to my media choices those
two are on a little carousel CD single
optical slot up here SD card right along
here that incredibly popular media
format aux Jack lives right here MDI is
the multimedia device interface in this
case a pigtail connected for an iPhone
or iPod Touch and Bluetooth audio along
with Bluetooth hands-free calling though
I was able to get them to work about 50%
of the time getting in and out of this
car with a Droid 2 paired 2 it is hit
and miss you never know if they're gonna
find each other again
my last gripes the volume knob it makes
me nuts for some reason that it's got
the universal on/off indicator on it
which looks like an indicator of where
you are in volume but it isn't because
this is a universal rotator it goes
around and round a hundred times I kept
looking at it thinking that's where my
volume was but it doesn't tell you that
you do have a set of good steering wheel
controls quite elaborate here for
getting through various menus phone
calls voice command which is for the
Bluetooth setup and bluetooth streaming
media only not for nav and a back button
echoed here like you have here like you
often have on the screen a lot of back
buttons in this car they should have
applied that to the whole design but
we'll get to that later I will get VW
this in an open-top car you want good
seat heaters this car has got them three
levels from roast to parboil to
tolerable by a human's ass plenty of
heat and whatever you're listening to
once you find it comes out of eight
speakers around the cabin and there
aren't any upgrades on this unless you
go to what they call the executive trim
car and that has a dine audio system no
rear camera available on this vehicle
only Park distance sensors front and
rear again a little chintzy for a car in
this price class one transmission a DSG
this is a dual clutch sequential
automated manual pretty elaborate stuff
so that helps to build this cars
placement in the market you've got a
standard Tiptronic gate pull it back to
drive one more for sport behavior or
back to drive and over to the right to
get your shift ability
now every EOS has the same stuff in the
engine bay regardless of which trim
level you get this 2-liter sidesaddle
inline 4 with intercooled turbo charging
and direct injection there's a lot of
good stuff there if it's a Ford they
call an EcoBoost and the VW's they call
it TSI your numbers are 200 horse 207
foot-pounds of torque gets this
relatively dense small car up to 60 and
7.3 seconds remember is a lot of weight
in that top apparatus and the mileage is
also pretty good 20 to 29 doesn't quite
propel this car into the top echelon of
fuel zippers but still efficient are
there two fundamental places where this
car falls down flat on its face the
first is something called cowl shake
that's when you've got a convertible
with the top open and as you're driving
over anything but a glass smooth Road
the car is kind of doing this kind of
twisting longitudinally you see the cowl
go like so dead giveaway is to look in
your rear-view mirror and see it
bouncing all over the place even see it
here in the header on top of the
windshield my 69 Ford convertible does
that but it's a 69 Ford the other
problem in this car is wheel speed
that's the sort of ungainly equivalent
of a burnout but it's when a front-wheel
drive car does it and it's not cool
it's just slippery
it's a real bad thing that front-wheel
drive cars used to do like back in the
80s when they were new again
shouldn't happen today those two things
and perhaps something to do with a
weight distribution or the sheer weight
of this car with the top I'm not
entirely sure lead it to miss most of
that Volkswagen schwa divvy that I love
about their cars but of course as I'm
telling you all this I'm loving the fact
that I've got this wide-open car that I
know I can button up into a hardtop and
also roll back the glass roof if I want
to you buy this car for the top bottom
line the EOS isn't worthy of being VW's
most expensive car it just makes you
want the golf cab to come back which it
is but not to the US making this guy
that much harder to take
okay let's price our 2012 VW EOS luxe
trim this is the middle car by the way
38 grand base that includes destination
charge now there aren't any tech options
to speak of although they think there is
there's a thing called the tech package
it's actually a lighting package it
gives you bi-xenon adaptive front
steering headlights and headlamp washers
but I don't call that a tech package I
call that a headlamp package I wouldn't
buy the car with it without
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
