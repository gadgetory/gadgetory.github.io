today I'm looking at the ax period eres
wireless speaker years ago you needed to
spend tens of thousands of dollars to
get a multi-room system but now thanks
to standards such as bluetooth and apple
airplay streaming music between rooms is
easy and cheap appearance new era
speaker is designed along airplay lines
but works with DLNA to stream music from
your Windows device or smartphone the
eris is fairly striking from a design
standpoint with this red metal stand and
two matching pairs of woofers one of
which is a set of passive bass radiators
the speaker uses a 100 watt amplifier
and while it's designed to be used
wirelessly via Wi-Fi there is also an
ethnic connector and a 3.5 millimeter
auxiliary input to play you can either
use the play to feature in windows media
player that's windows 7 or 8 or use a
DLNA app of your choice or aperion zone
eres app for smartphone when it works as
it should the eris has a very intimate
sound which is suited to folk music or
instrumentals and is much more detailed
than the similarly priced bowers &amp;amp;
wilkins zeppelin air the only problem is
that it sometimes doesn't work windows
media players streaming capability is
very flaky and the eris app is finicky
and so i ended up using the audio input
back most of the time anyway while an
apple airplay module is rumored at the
moment the wireless capability is a
little unreliable and a pair of audio
engine 5 plusses for example is not only
cheaper but will give you better sound
this has been ty pendlebury for senate
local</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
