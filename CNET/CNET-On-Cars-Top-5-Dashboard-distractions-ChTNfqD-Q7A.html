to solve in-car distraction they lied
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five voice
oriented dashboard distractions
according to new research by the
triple-eight and university of utah
we're gonna rank these for you by a
scale of relative distraction value and
show you how talking to your car keeps
your mind on that and less on driving
number five climate or radio commands
via voice I've always found these kind
of ridiculous I mean radio and climate
is pretty darn easy without talking to
the car in the time it takes you to
simply activate voice command you could
already change the station or the temp
number for destination search via voice
even if it's error-free
it's real tricky getting the voice
command gear to understand every command
you say every detail of Street and that
happens about once a year that it gets
it right remains a complex task number
three emails and texts this should be a
no-brainer I'm actually surprised they
aren't number one a range of scores here
is because it varies whether you're
composing or listening and whether you
have a natural or one of those
computerized voices coming out of your
car either way composing is always
foreground obviously as can be listening
when the texture email is infuriated
number two is just sheer menu navigation
let's face it you can't just talk to
your car
it ain't that smart on most cars you
need to give it the exact stilted
command it wants to hear from a strict
menu of choices that means you either
memorize all those right or glanced at
those on-screen prompts that's sort of
like getting around a foreign country
with nothing but a phrase book and you
know how well that goes before I get you
to our surprising number one dashboard
distraction here's a list of how the
same study ranks some of the most
popular in-car systems overall the
number one voice oriented dashboard
distraction is believe it or not Apple
Siri being used for almost anything this
will surprise some folks because Siri is
a natural conversation tool but that
open-endedness along with the range of
tasks it can control along with the fact
that you might end up drifting off into
an inane conversation with her
it makes it perhaps a bit too much more
top 5 lists to wait the car lover go to
scenic on cars calm but on top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
