call configuration the enterprise
focused HP elite slice really moonlights
as an intriguing option for remote and
home-based workers who spend a lot of
time on calls what sets it apart are its
sheek stackable design and options that
equip it for double duty as a voice over
IP conference phone the basic slice is
smaller than a Mac Mini optional add-on
choices include the collaboration cover
which gives it touch conference call
controls and a more powerful noise
cancelling microphone there's also an
audio module with Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
speakers that get louder than any
conference phone I've ever listened to
other available modules include an
optical drive and a Visa compatible
mounting plate the modules connect to
the slice using an internal USBC
connector and it's easy to snap them on
and off an alternative version of the
chassis has a fingerprint sensor there's
not a lot to the system it's got a power
button charger connection Ethernet jack
USB C and two USB a connectors
DisplayPort and HDMI for connecting to a
display and Kensington locks on each
module on the sides a headphone jack and
a thunderbolt compatible USBC connector
with a compatible monitor you can power
the computer through this port as well
what none of HP's cable free marketing
photos show you though is the less than
sleek power brick you need to attach
otherwise and the unsightly cables at
the back there's a specific 950 dollar
configuration with the collaboration
cover and audio module called the elite
slice for meeting rooms and that's the
one we have here you can't customize the
components which is too bad because it's
kind of slow without a solid-state drive
so I suggest you configure from scratch
with an SSD and one downside of buying
it for home is that you're paying for a
ton of enterprise security and
administration features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
