band I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene that update as the end of the year
draws near Twitter released a report on
the top tweets trends and hashtags of
2015 and what did it show that Twitter
users care more about the band One
Direction than anything else oh dear a
few band members of one direction of the
most retweeted messages of the year even
more than when the President of the
United States tweeted about legalizing
gay marriage President Obama created his
own president account this year in May
and his tweet on gay marriage was the
fourth most retweeted guests not even
the president can compare with boyband
fans some other big retweets included a
tweet from the king of Saudi Arabia
after he was crowned he sent out a
message of prayer and support to his
people twitter is very big in Saudi
Arabia also among the top retweeted
messages was one from Star Trek's
Leonard Nimoy the last tweet he sent
before he died in February some of the
biggest news events shared on Twitter
include the Paris terrorist attacks with
hashtag pray for Paris and hashtag black
lives matter also was a powerful social
movement that phrase was tweeted 9
million times also on the list was
hashtag Pluto flyby when NASA's new
Horizons spacecraft captured close-up
images of Pluto's surface in July and
there was that dress you know that dress
with 4.4 million tweets of people
arguing if it was blue and black or
white and gold and let's never forget
that white-and-gold people were the
right people twitter also tracked the
top emojis used no surprise the crying
while laughing face also known as tears
of joy was the top emoji of Twitter this
year and this year twitter has made a
few of its own emojis that show up when
you use a hashtag and a new one will
begin to show up Tuesday with the
hashtag I am a witness it is an eyeball
inside of a speech bubble it's an icon
created for the anti-bullying campaign
by the ad council those are the same
folks that brought us Smokey the Bear
and McGruff the Crime Dog the hope is
that when you see someone being bullied
online you'll use this emoji to reply
that you saw what happened you support
the person and that bullies are not
welcome Apple added this non-official
emoji to its emoji keyboard in the
latest iOS update and Google's also
starting to put the icon in its keyboard
because new emoji art is rolling out for
Android users this week Google is coming
out with about 200 or so new icons to
the keyboard these are icons that iphone
users already can use from an update
that came out in October that includes
new foods animals objects and faces but
android of course has its own art that's
different from apple's art the first to
get the new emoji icons will be those
with android marshmallow which are
mostly Nexus devices that's it for this
tech news update and there's more cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
