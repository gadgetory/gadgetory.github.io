budget laptops well almost
I'm Dan Ackerman and this is the Lenovo
IdeaPad 100's it is a newer entry in
this growing field of computers that
cost basically less than $200 and yet
are still fairly functional fairly
usable for everyday tasks you've got
things like the HP stream 11 which is
about $200 clamshell 11 inch laptop much
like this runs Windows 10
you've got inexpensive things like the
Intel compute stick guy that's basically
a full mini desktop PC the size of a big
USB key that's only a little bit more
than $100 and now we have the Lenovo
IdeaPad 100's for 199 dollars comes in a
variety of fun colors which is nice
including this muted red right here
there's also blue silver and white and
it's got an Intel Atom processor as you
would expect from something this price
range along with 2 gigs of ram and a
very small amount of storage 32 gigs of
solid-state storage but that's pretty
much what you get in this category along
with a low res non-touch 1366 by 768
display the reason the lenovo stands out
as one of the better examples of this
genre is because it's got it typically
excellent ovo keyboard on it island
style keys but like other lenovo systems
they curved out just a little bit of the
bottom give you something for your
finger to catch on to really the best
keyboard I've seen on one of these ultra
budget systems
unfortunately the flip side to that is
that the touchpad is a huge source of
frustration and might be a deal-breaker
for you if you're looking at the system
because it's not a click pad style pad
it's an older style that has separate
left and right mouse buttons and it also
does not support multi-touch gestures so
you can't do two fingers scrolling when
you're going up and down long webpages
or tap two fingers down to get a
right-click especially without a
touchscreen that's that's very important
to have if you're reading an article or
scrolling through your Facebook feed and
not having it hugely hugely frustrating
I could very easily cause you to put
aside this system and get something else
like the HP version instead even though
the design and chassis and keyboard are
much better
here but any way you slice it you are
getting something that'll work for you
know everyday tasks web surfing online
shopping social media from less than
$200 that's something that would have
been unimaginable just a few years ago
