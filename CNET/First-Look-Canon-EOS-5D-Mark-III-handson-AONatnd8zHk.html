more capabilities and better performance
than its predecessor but despite a new
sensor a new image processor it's not so
different on the basics meaning photo
and video quality as you'd expect of
course the 5d mark two is pretty great
in those respects so no drastic change
isn't necessarily a bad thing with a
couple of exceptions I really like the
design of the mark 3 which is pretty
similar to the mark to my favorite
aspects are the large lockable control
dial which can double is a silent
touchpad for adjusting settings during
movie capture and the updated one
hundred percent coverage viewfinder the
controls are extremely customizable vo
well-designed and easily accessible
interface Canon added a small
programmable button to the top of the
camera and the depth of field preview
button also programmable now sits near
the grip for operation with your right
ring finger Tenon's updated the
recording interface moving and
consolidating the control for easier
access well it's great that the mode
dial now locks it uses the center push
button that debuted in the 60d in which
I find a bit awkward and while I don't
dislike the location of the power switch
it does routinely flip from off to on
when moving in and out of my camera bag
incorporating digit 5 plus processing
adds a lot of important features to the
camera which includes support for udma 7
compact flash the camera now has dual CF
SD card slots which is really a useful
feature the mark 3 also gets a dedicated
headphone jack timecode support and
sixty four levels of audio control plus
a wind filter one video disappointment
the camera only outputs the display view
via HDMI so you can't get high
resolution video capture that way
there's no doubt that the mark 3 offers
excellent photo quality the unprocessed
images do seem to have less pronounced
color noise than the mark 2 and it mid
range to high ISO sensitivities the
JPEGs do look a little cleaner but it
low to middle ISO sensitivities I
actually think the jpeg photos from the
mark to look a little better with more
naturally defined detail and fewer
processing artifacts
that said the Marquis JPEGs do look fine
better than fine up through iso 1600 and
depending upon the scene in your needs
that can be quite good through iso 6400
and the larger higher resolution LCD is
much better for gauging sharpness though
you still really need a third party
viewfinder for shooting video I'd love
to see a peaking feature which would
help a bit unlike the d800 the mark 3
isn't a no-brainer upgrade for 5d mark
two shooters but I think that's more of
a testament to the quality of the mark 2
than anything lacking in the mark
through it does have some important
advantages over its predecessor though
including a much faster autofocus system
improved video quality and controls and
a far more configurable feature set if
those are important to you it's
definitely worth the price premium over
the now reduced mark 2 i'm lori groanin
and this is the canon eos 5d mark III</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
