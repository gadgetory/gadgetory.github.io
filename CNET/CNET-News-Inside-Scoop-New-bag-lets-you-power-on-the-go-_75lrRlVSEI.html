I'm cnet.com Skaro tsuboi joined by
senior editor Seth Rosenblatt hey and
Seth when we're on the go we carry a lot
of gadgets with us and what you're about
to show us today is not really a gadget
but an accessory that kind of saved your
life last week it was a major help in
getting my work done last week I was
stuck in New York during the sandy
aftermath and this is Timbuktu's new
power commute bag looks like their
standard I suggested your bag yeah
what's really interesting about it you
have you know your typical Timbuktu
three panel design and it's TSA
compliant which is really cool
definitely but the most important thing
for me last week was that it comes with
this battery pack that up and inside
especially designed pockets inside of
special pocket it's got this a battery
pack from Joey it's called the t1 and as
you can see here it has USB and micro
USB ports and you're able to plug in
your devices on the go and it charges
them pretty rapidly when got my phone
from five percent to about thirty
percent battery life in about 20 minutes
Wow so the idea is that you charge this
battery packs a overnight exactly and
then all day when you're on the go you
can plug in your devices precisely okay
so smart phones have you tried charging
your laptop or tablet a laptop doesn't
work unless it has a USB or micro USB
connection and laptops don't yet do that
tablets that were great smartphones are
great certain cameras will charge off of
it and what's really neat about the
about the t1 is that a auto detects the
proper amperage for your device so you
don't have to worry about frying it oh
that is a nice feature and something i
also like about this bag is how smartly
designed it is i mean they've obviously
been in the business of designing
messenger bags for a long time but show
off how it all kind of connects inside
sure so on the back we have our TSA
compliant section you can put your
laptop or tablets in here the laptop
sections up here tablets would go down
here but what's really cool is that you
can
feed the Joey cable through the back of
the bag so you don't if it's if there's
bad weather out or if you don't want
your devices to be exposed you can have
them charging without you know anybody
seeing that you're actually charging
them and in fact one thing I was doing
was on the new york subway i would have
the bag on my back and the cable running
to my phone in my pocket phone was
useless in the subway anyway and by the
time i got off the subway i had enough
charge to go about my business that's
great yeah so this is the timbuk2 power
commute and it is part of that commute
line so all accessories for example we
have the camera insert yes there's still
compatible absolutely it'll wait in
that's right zip this up so this is the
camera accessory that just steps padded
for four cameras lenses film and that
will slip right inside but this is the
bag that debuts this today I've used
today it retails I believe for 199 and
Timbuktu is also doing a backpack
version of it what can I say that fits
and there you go great well thank you
set thank you very much I guess to get
your hands on a bag go to Timbuktu's
website Timbuktu com awesome Seth
Rosenblatt I'm car tsuboi thanks for
