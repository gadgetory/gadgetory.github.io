horizon hobby and if you've got a little
over a thousand dollars to spend on a
camera drone you'll want to check it out
inside is basically the same as the
unique typhoon q500 4k but outside is
very different it's much smaller for one
and can easily be disassembled for
travel or repairs the slot loading
battery offers up to 30 minutes of
flight but I typically got just over 20
minutes before I had to bring it in for
a landing it has a smart mode that
always moves the quadcopter in the
direction you move the stick regardless
of the direction the nose is pointed and
you'll also have follow me in tracking
options that use GPS to keep tabs on
whoever or whatever has the controller
if you want more control you can drop it
into angle mode and when you're ready to
land just flip the controller switch to
home and it will fly back to you in land
the controller is pretty key to the
package in general it has a built-in 5.5
inch touchscreen to give you a
first-person view from the camera and
flight info and access to settings as
well other quads generally rely on a
tablet or smartphone for this so going
with the chroma means you'll have one
less battery to worry about keeping
charged it also gives you the camera
controls including buttons for stills
and video and a slider for camera tilt
so why would you look elsewhere well the
main reason would be to get features
like Waypoint navigation or other
autonomous flight options that you could
get with the DJI phantom 3 or 3d
robotics solo but if you're looking for
a simple ready to fly camera drone the
blade chroma is easy to recommend
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
