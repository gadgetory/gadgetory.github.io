day but it's easy to tame if you know
the right tricks some basics first
the main day of the sale is Tuesday July
11th and it goes on for 30 hours so
depending on where you live in the world
the sale can actually start Monday here
in the US on the East Coast it's 9:00
p.m. and there are even earlier sales
perks for anyone who shops with their
voice using the voice assistant Alexa
there are tons and tons of odd items on
sale things you may not normally buy and
things you may never have thought of
buying but suddenly want to buy because
it's on sale and why not right but not
everything goes on sale right away
amazon spreads out the deals throughout
the day you can browse what will go on
sale at amazon.com slash prime day if
you spot something interesting click
watch this deal if you have the amazon
app you'll get a notification when the
sale begins now the biggest deals in
gadgetry tend to be with Amazon's own
devices the echo is 50% off priced at
$90 there are also sales on Amazon's
tablets and e-readers some video games
and accessories are half off if you only
care about a TV go to amazon.com slash
Prime day TV deals there's a 55 inch 4k
Ultra HD TV with Amazon fire built in
it's normally 650 but it'll be $400 an
assortment of gift cards are also on
sale lots of grocery items are half off
but once an item is on sale there is a
limited amount available you can add
something to your cart but if you don't
buy it within 15 minutes you may lose
the item and anyone who is on the wait
list will have a chance to snag it but
just because something says it's
discounted doesn't mean it's the best
deal do your homework
the site camel camel camel is one place
that tracks the history of prices on
Amazon plus if you only care about one
specific thing use camel camel camel to
notify you when that item drops in price
the mid-year shopping sale is something
Amazon started doing a few years ago and
last year it was Amazon's biggest sales
day ever with more orders than even
Black Friday this year it's expanding to
more countries you can only shop the
deals if you are a member of the prime
subscription service now
that normally costs around $100 a year
if he never had crime before you can
sign up for a free trial to access the
deals I'm Bridget Carey for more tips on
tackling primed a head-to cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
