already waiting in line for it but the
sane among you are probably waiting for
a little more information
unfortunately Apple isn't saying
anything Tim Cook hasn't even admitted
that they're working on a new iPhone so
that leaves us with the rumors Dom Bell
and then this top five I'm counting down
the five iPhone six rumors worth paying
attention to starting off at number five
new buttons hardly earth-shattering news
but the mock-ups and leaked case designs
we've seen so far I'll show a new oval
design for the volume buttons and a
power button that's moved from the top
of the iPhone down to the side maybe you
like it maybe you don't but it's gonna
take a minute to get used to the new
layout and number four a more expensive
price rumor has it that Apple has been
negotiating with carriers to raise the
price of the iPhone by a hundred bucks
sounds crazy but with the relative
drought of compelling phones on the
shelves right now Apple might be able to
have the leverage to pull this off
assuming that the carrier subsidy will
eat up half of that price you might be
just looking at about a $50 bump in your
phone maybe not such a big deal but if
you're hoping for a less expensive
iPhone I wouldn't count on it coming in
at number three a fall release the Apple
Worldwide Developers Conference is just
around the corner but you won't be
getting your hands on that new iPhone
until the fall that's a fairly
predictable strategy for Apple they've
stuck to a september/october iPhone
rollout since 2011
now some rumors say that the phone could
be finished as early as August but Apple
is in no position to rush I bet Tim Cook
will stick to the script on this one at
number two a bigger screen you know how
Apple spent all that time last year
convincing you that the current four
inch screen size was the optimal size
for the human hand and yet somehow in
the meantime Samsung has unloaded
millions of Galaxy phones without giving
us customers carpal tunnel now Apple may
keep a discounted iPhone 5 around to
keep their small hand fans happy but
expect a significant jump in screen size
for the Apple iPhone 6 and that leaves
us with the number one juiciest rumor
for the iPhone 6 more models no not not
those models though honestly a woman a
tap
product launch would be a refreshing
change rumor is that there will be three
distinct models of iPhone you're gonna
get the reheated leftovers of the iPhone
5 as the entry-level model then a 4.7
inch iPhone 6 due out in the fall and
then a 5.5 inch iPhone phablet early
next year
it seems unthinkable after all of
Apple's type on the virtues of smaller
phones but this 5.5 inch LCD panel keeps
popping up an Apple supply chain now
I'll be intrigued if this actually comes
out I'll be even more curious to see if
all you Galaxy Note fans can contain
your smug feelings of superiority when
this thing hits the market so there you
go five of the most notable tantalizing
rumors circulating about the iPhone 6
