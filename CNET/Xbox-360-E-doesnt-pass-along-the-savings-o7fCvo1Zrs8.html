cnet.com this is a first look at the
Xbox 360 II so here it is the Xbox 360
II which Microsoft announced at e3 2013
first things first this is exactly the
same as the Xbox 360s there's literally
no difference in terms of the
functionality when you turn on this it's
going to look just like the old one it
is exactly the same it's not quicker
it's not slower it's exactly the same
you're not going to notice any
difference there's a few things
aesthetically on the boxes that you will
notice are different we're talking like
millimeters in difference the e is maybe
designed a little bit to resemble what
the Xbox one is going to look like
aesthetically other than that you're not
going to find any difference they've
taken out a usb on this one so you get
four ports instead of five compared to
this guy on the bottom there's a little
port for the for the hard drive and you
can access fairly easily you pop this in
and out no problem just like this guy
over here and you're all set and done
microsoft says the Xbox 360 II runs
quieter and cooler yes it definitely is
a little quieter cooler I couldn't
really tell when I had these two running
side-by-side but it's nowhere near the
dramatic jump you got from the original
white 360 down to this slim 360s so on
the Xbox 360 II which is the brand-new
version it's actually taking out an
optical audio output now if you're like
me and you have an older receiver that
only uses audio through a separate
source outside of HDMI you're come out
of luck because there's no way to get
separate audio out of this system for
surround sound which is kind of a bummer
so what you're going to need to do is
you're going to need to either have a
receiver that uses audio over HDMI which
most current ones do or you're going to
use this new interface that they put on
the back which is a breakout eighth inch
AV cable it's 2013 to the
day you can still not play xbox in HD
out of the box it's been eight years and
this is this is what we're dealing with
still go give yourself an HDMI cable for
five dollars it's fine
so another thing people want to know
about the new one if it has an IR port
in the front so you can hook it up to
like your universal remote control yes
it has that don't worry also on the
front you'll notice compared to the s
there's physical buttons this was all
touch on the s these are actual physical
buttons that you have to push not a big
deal I just spit on it a little bit
that's gross let's say you have an xbox
360's and you're like oh well there's a
new Xbox out should I buy it I don't
know why anyone would want to buy this
because there's literally no difference
in fact you get less for the same amount
of money and plus I've been on like
Amazon and you have these deals right
now where you can get this bundled with
Arkham City with Darksiders 2 and it's
the same price as this brand-new one
that's arguably an inferior box it turns
out this is a lot cheaper to make than
the 360s so that's what's happening
you're getting a console for the same
price as what you paid last time but it
costs Microsoft a little less to make it
so that's what's going on here I guess
eventually the S will go away and we'll
only be left with the e but for the time
being if you're looking for an Xbox 360
for your first time you've never had one
before
get this one the S is the way to go the
e not so sure who it's for it's not for
you it's not for me it's really just
here to I don't know make more money for
Microsoft so that's what I got to say
about that that's going to do it for me
I'm Jeff Bakalar checking out the Xbox
360 II for cnet.com thank you for
