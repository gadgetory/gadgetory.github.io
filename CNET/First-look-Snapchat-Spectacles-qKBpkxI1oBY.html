out of a vending machine
these are snapchat spectacles early this
morning snapchat dropped a beautiful
large yellow vending machine on the
Venice Beach Boardwalk in Santa Monica
California what happened next was
exactly what they hoped for hundreds of
snapchat users lined up in the Southern
California heat for an opportunity to
pick up a pair of spectacles so let's
take a look the packaging is really cool
the case acts as the charger for your
spectacles and it's actually really easy
to use they're lightweight when you put
them on which I wasn't expecting and
pairing them to your device is as easy
as opening up the snapchat app and
looking at your snap code with
spectacles once you've done that you can
click the button to take 10 seconds
snaps if you click it before the ten
seconds is over it'll continue your
video if not that 10 seconds of footage
gets uploaded to your memories in
snapchat and you can then publish them
as you choose one of the coolest
features of snapchat spectacles was
something I didn't expect once you
record your 10-second footage you can
view it in either landscape or portrait
mode and it will be beautifully centered
no matter what that's a great feature
spectacles sold out pretty quickly
during the day but snapchat says that
the vending machine isn't going to stay
in Venice Beach it'll be traveling and
if you want to find out where it'll show
up next you can head over to spectacles
