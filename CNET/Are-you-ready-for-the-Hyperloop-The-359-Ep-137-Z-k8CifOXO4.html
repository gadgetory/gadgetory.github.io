it's election day and we voted and were
here for the daily podcast 359 episode
137 with Roger Cheng and Joanie salesman
good morning everybody how are we
morning morning are you guys doing at
the election day we actually be all
about it can we officially use that
prefix happy to be yeah we'll see we'll
see ya having um civic responsibilities
every true I absolutely agree so that's
worthy of celebration um Oh we'll see
tonight so we're here to record a
podcast yes yes let's get going on that
so we skip at without we're talking
about the the hyperloop one using a a
they're actually getting started this is
actually gonna happen in the United Arab
Emirates they announced the plans to
build this thing for 2020 so it's not
just a pipe dream it's not just Elan
losses crazy sketches on a napkin it's
it's a thing next up will be talking
about Samsung issuing another baya Copa
both in a full-page ad in several US
papers today as well as a letter written
customers in Europe then lastly our own
Dara Kerr had an inside look at the
secret oh maybe it's not so secret
Facebook group not a secret anymore
Austin nation Thank what's your right
with two million members I guess isn't
really much of a secret but but yes well
we'll take a look at that sort of a
topical election theme story to round
things out so with that let's let's get
started as always if you've any
questions leave them in the comments
section Brian will grab the best and
we'll we'll try to answer looking
forward to hearing your feedback and
talking tech with you after we record
the podcast in three two welcome to the
359 when we talk about the top tech news
of the day I live the crap we want to
throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Joni
salzman so hyper loop one announced that
it will build its super fast transport
system in the United Arab Emirates first
the cubby promises to get you from a
buddha by Abu Dhabi to Dubai in 12
minutes trip that usually takes about
two hours by bus so Joan are you ready
for the Hyperloop I'm ready for
Hyperloop to move from the
make cool trailers about Hyperloop phase
it's actually making Hyperloop yes if
you check out the video that's on our
site right now it's its thumping bass
music it's it really got me amped up to
yeah sure that may or may not be sure
that at least several years away but but
like you said only three years alright
2020 theoretically this is all goes
smoothly yeah and it's supposed to be
the start of a network of systems first
the United Arab Emirates but really they
want to they want to build sort of a set
of these things around the world yeah
what is it like what's the thing they
say is San Francisco to New York and
four hours or something like right we'll
wait that's gonna do yeah is that right
maybe faster faster should be faster
right I feel like it should be faster
should be much much faster faster better
uh either way if it cuts off on time and
I don't have to go through TSA security
then yeah yeah I'm all for Hyperloop I'm
all for being put into this little tube
and shuttled at what 500 600 miles an
hour yeah I'll for it all for it dangers
are risky huh be damned all right next
up more samsung news Samsung issued a
open letter of apology to its galaxy
note 7 users in Europe and it as well as
took took out a full-page ad in several
major US newspapers CEO greg lee
apologize you know say they're truly
sorry about the defective and dangerous
notes evans is this enough to kind of
get people to to forget about it or to
give Samsung one of the things that they
say in the ad is we know that what I
can't remember the words but it's like
we know that your loyalty has to be
earned all right it's not your loyalties
earned not given I mean it's saying all
the things that you need to say but it's
easy to say things in an ad it's yeah
that's important out like Volkswagen
think did the same thing they took a
full-page ad after their massive recall
well sprocket holes from tech related
but it was right it's the same deal like
they've they've also violated the
public's trust I mean we'll see like I
think Volkswagen and ethical Fargo
hasn't really doesn't really rebound it
yet so I don't know we'll see you know
the
espa depends on whether or not the s8
kind of blows people away or we'll see I
don't know it's a just more more
troubles for samsung then going and
saying I'm sorry a lot is the right
thing to say yes the thing I'm hoping
that they follow up with I'm sorry and
here's what happened here's what here's
why here's what the next phone's not
gonna blow up your face all right lastly
our own Derek her as an inside look at
the the secret so-called secret facebook
group pantsuit nation that exploded in
popularity just really a day before the
election it really went viral racked up
two million members and there's a even a
public version of this page you know
it's provided safe space for folks to
comment which is increasingly important
and this this really vitriolic season I
mean wait what do you think is this is
this gonna help Hillary or what what's
the deal well there's nothing that
that's not gonna hurt Hillary to have
people who love her getting together and
tell me each other why they love her
that can't hurt I mean do you think
that's gonna I mean is this for the
start of any kind trend for private
groups or I think that it's interesting
that this election season has emphasized
how much social media can be it can be a
kind of noisy uncomfortable space yeah
there's preferable that disagree with
you and when their rhetoric can be
abusive or lessen it's easy to say
things in an unkind way if you have an
amenity well just check out this lots of
feed yeah there's less of that on
facebook then there isn't places like
Twitter yeah but um but there could be
something in the idea that private
groups become more popular if you're
looking for a way to share your own
thoughts without having to worry about
yeah other people attacking you for them
definitely all right for more about
these stories check us out on Cena I'm
Roger J I'm Joanie salzman thanks for
listening so just out of curiosity how
much our ticket price is looking like
for the Hyperloop do we have any idea
what that speculation is it's got to be
daunting I think they're so far with ya
ok I don't I don't know the whole deal
about this is supposed to be attainable
yeah yeah so they got a strife or
something but right we'll just have to
wait and see although night near the
first I don't know after the first
couple tickets are free they like you
aren't right
like take your shot you know all the
dice with this thing you gotta wonder
who would be on the front line for
volunteers for that test flight test
earnest quote-unquote flight oh so just
to just to clear it up apparently the
they've clocked the top speed of 760
miles per hour Wow yeah yeah i mean
that's cool that's pretty cool that's
cool however you look at it that's cool
anybody in the chat interested in taking
the Hyperloop we want to hear your
feedback how much would you pay for a
ticket to go from your origin to your
destination just putting that out there
really be a Hyperloop what do you think
is a fair price for that kind of service
I dolla yeah not the MTA I would be
outraged of them seats for dollars
though for dollars if you bought like a
toy trip pass right there's a guy in
fault cuz it's really been snacks like
on an airplane but they're sprinting
down the aisle whipping peanuts at your
face cuz there's not enough time um I
don't know actually that's that's a fair
question I don't know how much i'd pay
probably i don't know clutter bucks i
guess if i can get to from here to LA
and what an hour yeah wait so it's baidu
Abu Dhabi in in 12 minutes and that's a
two-hour trip normally like LA to New
York it's like five hours if you kind of
do the math that's like 45 minutes or so
that's but an hourish I would say yeah
like an hour I mean getting to la an
hour would be fantastic so let's start
with the base base price point how much
are you paying now to go to LA not like
300 bucks yeah there's no you think
paying a little more than that would be
worthwhile I'll probably pay a little
bit more yeah yeah at the interest um
for those of our listeners international
who have traveled to Abu Dhabi and
whatnot what do you pay now and what do
you think would be a fair hike to speed
the process up I'm just curious I'm
really curious to see where this could
go no I imagine what those things were
initially the price is gonna be pretty
high yeah of course you know it's new
but the whole idea of these things it's
attainable it's supposed to come down
price the whole thing is supposed to be
fairly cost effective to run so right if
it was if it was completely on
affordable it wouldn't survive no no
one's gonna use it then what's the point
I'm definitely interested uh scanning
the chat thanks everybody we're looking
at here some price points $200 100
pounds 45 to 60 okay 50 to 80 20 to 40
he's a pretty standard you know yeah
transit prices must took it yeah
basically sounds about right yeah um I'm
okay with that I'd be okay with the
cheaper price what what kind of services
should be available on the Hyperloop
with everything like it in loop movies
or something it's just our podcasts like
sure yeah right haha the YouTube clip of
the podcast would be too long totally
would be right flatly for that initial
run at 12 minutes but yeah watch I guess
will you can I mean would you have in
Hyperloop connectivity because you
couldn't connect your cellular network
no probably not but think it's probably
a way that they could probably deliver
something at UV like the internals and
internal Wi-Fi sort of yeah I don't know
if its internal Wi-Fi are like maybe
maybe they'll help just pre-loaded
youtube videos in the pod itself like I
can imagine connectivity at that speed
okay yeah that would be I mean of course
I do it earlier they kind of do it on
here theoretically possible yeah yeah
now this is out of my realm I'll say
yeah yeah I don't know I like a moving
Sun hundred miles an hour and on the
ground don't know probably all I wish
can pick up on that baked potato games
is probably just a video about Hyperloop
yeah they're just gonna loop promo video
service at night hey they're exciting
videos love us now they're all like boom
boom boom just it's very it's very
catchy I was very pumped afterward
here's a good question i don't know if
we're not really physicist here but what
what stops the feeling of g-force from
inside the Hyperloop well G forces when
you are increasing or decreasing
momentum right like that's the feeling
that you feel and so I don't know enough
about how Hyperloop works um that's a
really good question i don't know
there's a really good question getting
on that speed how you let me call mr.
muskie yeah I mean I imagine you'd feel
something initially and then that would
be it right like once you hit your speed
you're fine though yeah it's really that
a physicist yeah it's really the the
take-off and the landing or the
beginning of the at the end of the ride
that you'd feel something I guess I
don't know that Ben points out that the
slow speed up removes a gene much like
the acceleration on a lot of roller
coasters I suppose in a similar ride
concept correct me if I'm wrong please
I'm very often seven minutes of the
12-minute trap is just like getting up
to speed and slowing down baby and then
and throwing up there going out so yes
there's the back to services on the
Hyperloop do we need barf bags yet do we
need bathrooms that would be interesting
to see uh so sorry to all of our
international listeners and viewers out
there but we're gonna talk election real
quick how was everybody's election or
polling process this morning out of it
well yeah mine was pretty smooth yeah I
mean I live down the burbs we have
fairly short lines everything was really
organized you knows it was not bad you
didn't get a sticker though I didn't get
a sticker poorly organized and I'm like
looking at your NYC scary cuz is really
cool like one of our colleagues offered
to give me an extra one of her time like
I'm not in NYC voter I don't even can't
even qualify for that I stole an extra
sticker the election is rigged for your
daughter for my daughter how's the thing
I wanted to get one for my son but yeah
it's not gonna care another he's second
it does either way going back to the
former topic sleepy engineer thank you
for putting this out you'd only feel the
acceleration but not at the cruising
speed but when you're in an airplane
there's compression involved we're
curious as to how that applies and being
that you are an engineer maybe you could
help us out how does this apply on land
transportation on this hyper speed
Hyperloop Travie yeah I agree on
cruising speed like once you're at
you're obviously yeah you'll be fine
it's the it's the beginning of the end
being that we're not engineers we're not
physicist we do EV alone in planes you
feel it when you're taking off right you
feel the acceleration and then the
pressure stabilizes in the cabin right
because of technology that I don't
understand in airplanes sleep engineer
please help us out here I think you
might have a more background for us well
he's got the name for it for sure it's
not mean engineer it is pretty early in
the morning for some people
so back to back to election so we had a
really good question yesterday on the
show somebody asked like could there
ever be in app voting you know now I am
voting and we've like it's a curious
thought but a dangerous thought like
it'd be very easy to exploit we've had
everything from paper polls to some
electronic polls I I personally had the
scantron yeah at the scantron some
interesting what other technologies
could improve voting processes outside
of just like text to vote yeah right
well one of the things I don't not
incredibly inform this but one of the
things that makes our electoral system
safe as the fact that it's not connected
to yeah a massive network in order to
have some sort of like vote by text or
text or vote by your phone you would
have to you it'd be so hard to divorce
that from the kind of connectivity and
security issues that would make it
challenging to implement though it would
be wonderful in terms of get off the
boat efforts if you made it so simple
that anyone but then you also raise
these issues where could that be a
disenfranchisement for people who can't
afford to have powerful trap you know
like I mean I don't I I don't foresee
polling places going away but yeah and
like you said in the effort to get out
and vote one of the things that could
improve the process like as you as we
said we collectively here had a pretty
pleasant experience yeah there are lines
yeah it takes a couple minutes but
honestly as I said before the show
started if the entire candidacy was as
polite and smooth as my voting process
went this morning it would have been a
much better year yeah right well that's
because there's also laws saying that
you can't campaign at a polling place so
maybe why it was Politis because people
are legally not allowed to be rude about
their candidate there people have broken
the law before yeah jerks yeah heads
it's what I'm saying is it's one place
where there are limitations to free
speech and free speech is more important
than like politeness sure you know what
I mean yeah yeah I think it was more
matter i think what Brian's saying those
it was less like there wasn't pushing or
shoving or anything like that that kind
of yeah the quorum was
yeah yeah yeah here we go here's a
really good point being that we're also
connected and online and registered for
a thousand different things that we opt
into anyways automatic registration
automatic with what was like butter in
your automatic voter registration when
as soon as you turn 18 you're registered
voter instead of going through the
process manually mmm if you were just
ace it isn't an electronic something huh
I could see some village of that there
are folks unlike me who are lazy and
didn't register to vote for a while so
uh uh that I mean yeah I find that a
good idea I think that is a good idea
like whether or not because if you
skipped one headache yeah it's still up
to you whether or not you want to vote
but totally get past the one hurdle I
mean that was my big thing when I moved
from LA to New York like I was still
voting in California for a while but
after a while like I lost that right
right never registered in New York so
the registration process can be very
confusing yeah Gaby I made a few like if
you're starting from zero from scratch
yeah i mean it's it's pretty easy and
what if it didn't just things well I
mean what if you it just automatically
followed you like if you did chain if
you moved and didn't have to go that
would be huge district 8 it followed you
from district to district or state to
state that would be great like it was
just sort of up to date but yeah again
it goes back to that's the whole
bringing innovation technology but that
also brings security concerns and issues
with I don't know that's I think of
course it's all I mean that's largely I
feel like that's why we haven't really
progressed in terms of voting technology
is the fear that oh we're just pipe
dreaming here yeah we are I would be
interested to see that I think that's a
really good idea Ben thank you for
suggesting that any other ideas well
we're still been from yesterday I'm I
can't I I think so not one hundred
percent certain it could very welcome
back then if you're the same guy and if
you're not welcome period there you go
sylviane says none keep it low tech keep
it fair if you want to make a vote make
the effort that's also really really
good point yeah absolutely we're saying
like by making it easy to easy to vote
then that has its own issues right like
that invites like
patrollers element to come in right like
having that extra required that extra
effort to go out and though definitely
kind of weeds out folks who would vote
as a joke yeah that's a good point to a
lot of got points today boaty mcboatface
baked potato game says I mean my google
assistant knows what city I'm in why
can't the voting registration why can't
the registers know it's difficult man it
is yeah is walk around with google
assistant let Google assistant vote for
you that's that's a really bad idea
Alexa is the make the right decision I
know that is a bad precedent it has been
from yesterday hi Ben thank you again
rise we're happy to have you welcome
back um we got some anti Hyperloop
sentiment okay please share well i mean
obvious the danger aspect yeah the
Hyperloop is basically an unrealistic
concept if there is a break in the tube
or change in pressure too great it'd be
a train hitting the passengers yeah
that's true right like it's it's
supposed to be like this complete seal
and that's what helps with the whatever
achieving all those in 10 speed so if
there's ever like a crack or if it gets
punctured at any point absolutely but i
mean these are risks that were taken for
the space shuttle for submarines right
for the original automotive to an extent
anytime they want to make a leap forward
in technology especially transportation
where there are bodies within a device
that you you got to take risks and I
mean I'm sure they're sparing no expense
that's not her eyeball board man like i
said i fucking if i can get to LA in an
hour sign me up and the concept is an
exercise in Japan its Otis know so I
think I misread this I apologize I think
he's stating the registration concept we
were speaking Oh or it's an effect in
Japan got it no no that makes a lot of
sense you could remove a hurdle but you
still have to be you still have to make
the effort to go on vote I agree yeah
all right I think that's a good place to
end it for today all right then thanks
everybody thanks my Ben and everybody
get out vote if you haven't please go on
bug and our us listeners always please
yes us listeners ding good luck to
everyone hope your experience was this
planet pleasant as ours yeah you liked
anything you saw or heard here
it sounds seen it or podcasts also
