less for television TiVo has reasons for
you to pay more I'm Bridget Carey this
is your scene at update TiVo doesn't
want to be seen as just a DVR in fact
the newest model isn't even a black box
anymore it's white has no buttons and
there's a design that looks like someone
kicked it because you know Ben's make it
seemed futuristic and edgy and maybe
that edginess will make you feel okay
about paying a monthly $15 service fee
this is the bolts and yes it still
records TV shows it can record four
shows at once if you're unfamiliar with
how Tebow's work instead of renting the
cable box your TV service provider gives
you a special cable card ship to insert
inside but it also works for customers
that cut the cord I want to record free
over-the-air broadcast from an HD
antenna or if you want a stream video
from apps over the Internet this
upgraded model supports 4k known as
ultra high-definition so about that
service fee the bolt itself starts at
three hundred dollars but after the
first year you have to pay a hundred and
fifty dollars a year for tivo service
which lets you skip commercials of
recorded shows with one button tap and
you can speed up the playback of shows
by thirty percent and the dialogue still
sounds normal not all chipmunky you can
do one search across all cable TV and
streaming apps to find shows in one menu
it also has parent or controls offer
suggestions on what you may like to
watch and it's James video to your
mobile phone or tablet in a time where
you want to spend less on television
TiVo gives TV lover's reasons to spend
more money now you see why they had to
make it look so snazzy and that's not
the only tech that's bending in new ways
Tesla just unveiled the Model X it's an
all-electric SUV with Falcon wing doors
that make it easy to get in not only to
the doors look cool but there are so
sirs so it won't bang into things it's a
car for the family that wants to zip off
to soccer practice from zero to 60 in
3.2 seconds that speed boost is an extra
feature called ludicrous speed mode but
before you get too excited it's pretty
expensive it's not coming out anytime
soon the top model with the ludicrous
speed boost costs a hundred and
forty-two thousand dollars but
estimate that the base model could start
at 80 grand you may not be able to order
one until next year and here's a new
SmartWatch that's going on sale without
much notice Samsung just announced that
the round gear s2 is going on sale in
the US this friday starting at three
hundred dollars you navigate by twisting
the outside rim it'll be at best buy
stores if you want to try it on in
person there's a model that has a 3g
cellular connection but that's not
coming out into the fall and we don't
know the price of that yet all of this
stuff is so expensive but if you're
looking for something for free well the
Mac update for OS 10 El Capitan is now
available to download you can get a
detailed overview of all the features at
cnet com that's it for this tech news
update from our studios in New York I'm
