fitbit's I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNN update with the growing trend
of Health tracking wristbands it was
only a matter of time before the world
gave us wearables for newborns the
sprout lean wants to be baby's first
body monitor it's designed to give
parents peace of mind when their baby is
asleep you wrap it around the baby's
ankle and it measures heart rate skin
temperature motion and position and it
sends alerts to the parents smartphone
if something's wrong like if the heart
rate drops or the baby needs to be
rolled over the app also alerts if the
baby's kicking and fussy to recharge you
place it in a wireless charging dish but
that dish also measures room conditions
like temperature humidity and the sound
and light levels those that preorder it
now can get it for two hundred and fifty
dollars and it'll go up to three hundred
dollars after it comes out next year in
March it's in the same price range as
Wireless video monitors but there's no
video here just health alerts and this
isn't the first sensor for babies
there's also the MIMO
it's a monitor that attaches to a
machine washable onesie it doesn't track
heart rate but it does measure skin
temperature breathing body position and
movement through the app a parent can
also listen to audio from the room the
starter kit with three onesies is two
hundred dollars and that's sold now at
Babies R Us another one still in
production is called the owlet which is
worn like a bootie on the foot to
measure vitals and when the baby rolls
over
that'll be priced at two hundred and
fifty dollars if you want to track your
own sleep but you're rather not wear
something around your wrist there's a
new type of gadget that you can put on
your nightstand it's the sense by a
startup company called hello it's
raising money now on Kickstarter and it
won't be out until November but for $100
this orb tracks things that could get in
the way of your sleep it'll measure the
ambient light the temperature humidity
sound and dust and pollen levels you put
a sensor on your pillowcase to track how
much you're tossing and turning so when
you wake up the app puts the data to get
to tell that maybe when you tossed it
was because there was noise detected
maybe from your snoring partner it also
is a smart alarm that you turn off with
the wave of the hand it can tell when
you may be waking up naturally so
instead of going off when you're in a
deep sleep which leaves your groggy
the alarm may sound a few minutes
earlier now although not everyone needs
a sleep tracker it is one way to help
put you on the path to sleeping like a
baby that your tech news update and you
can catch more episodes at cnet.com and
