situation for refugees from across the
world trying to reach Australia by boat
who are intercepted by the Australian
Government and sent to detention camps
offshore I tried to apply for a visa to
get to new room it's eight thousand
dollars non-refundable many journalists
have paid that money and never actually
been I was never able to actually apply
I was told there was an accommodation
shortage on the island it was so
frustrating to have no real genuine
reason as to why I couldn't actually get
into one of these camps i sent interview
requests to four former Prime Minister's
a former Immigration Minister they all
declined the current prime minister of
australia declined to be interviewed i
sent eight interview requests to the
current immigration minister he never
actually responded to my final request
these are the people that have put in
policies that send people off shore and
yet they're not willing to front up to
the media and actually answer questions
I got in touch with a refugee living on
Manus Island in Papua New Guinean via
whatsapp his name is Behrooz bouhanni
he's an Iranian journalist who fled and
ended up on manners he sends out photos
showings the really really green living
conditions people writing messages on
the walls of the camp in their own blood
he's sending out updates about
day-to-day incidents about his feelings
of spending three years in detention
reading that is just incredibly
heartbreaking because I have no sense of
how you could spend that long in this
one camp i spoke to martin Appleby he
was a former security worker who
actually worked in the Manus Island camp
hearing his voice crack hearing him
struggle to put into words the things
that he'd seen affected me so much I was
brought to tears hours before publishing
the news broke that the Manus Island
camp would be shut down I immediately
sent off a message to burrows and he
said it was wonderful news but then the
statement came out from the Australian
Government and it became clear that
these people would never be settled in
Australia so the future is still
incredibly uncertain
