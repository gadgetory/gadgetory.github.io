smartphone I'm here to tell you it's
probably not your fault there are dozens
of factors that make typing on a
smartphone a total nightmare it could be
the size of the screen or the size of
your hands or the autocorrect software
or the spacing between the keys
fortunately if you and your keyboard
software aren't getting along there are
some great options out there worth
trying I'm gonna show you four keyboard
replacements for Android that with any
luck will also come out to iPhone users
this fall with iOS 8 lets start with the
Google keyboard one that you'll probably
never see on Apple's App Store now just
because you're running Android doesn't
mean you're actually using Google stock
Android keyboard in many cases like on
this HTC One m8 you get the
manufacturer's spin on the keyboard if
you do nothing else look up the Google
keyboard in the Play Store and give it a
shot it's a free download and for a lot
of people it's the keyboard to end all
keyboards aside from having a nice
spacing and a swipe to type option for
one finger typing there are features
here that Google is uniquely great at
one is text-to-speech which google has
been perfecting for years the quick
brown fox the other is an intelligent
predictive text software that minds
everything Google knows about you to
predict your next word it's the next
best thing to a full Google brain
transplant and did I mention it's free
another great option out there that's
free is SwiftKey this one also does a
great job of tailoring its predictive
text suggestions based on the access you
give it to your emails and your text
messages I don't know why it creeps me
out more than Google's constant spying
on me but at least the process is
entirely opt-in SwiftKey does a lot of
what Google keyboard does swipe typing
predictive text custom dictionaries but
what makes SwiftKey unique is that the
keyboard itself can be resized to match
up nicely with those sausages you call
fingers just press and hold the swift
key icon and you get a menu of all sorts
of resizing options
next up we have swipe which is well
worth the 399 price tag swipe was one of
the first companies to come up with a
whole one finger swiping texting method
and are arguably the best at it if you
really want to be speedy with one finger
typing this is the one and because
they're owned by nuance you also get
their whole Dragon Dictation software
built-in which does a great job at
letting you dictate your writing the
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
but if the whole swipe typing thing just
doesn't feel natural give flexi a shot
it's 399 but this is my choice if you
want to just get blazing fast at typing
there's no swipe text no dictation just
an insanely smart and forgiving
autocorrect and the ability to move
forward and backward through your
sentence by flicking left and right you
can mash on this thing and a wild
drunken stupor and still make sense when
you go full Jedi you can even make the
keyboard invisible and then just trust
in the force to make a coherent sentence
so there you have it four ways to take
your smartphone typing to the next level
now instead of hunting and pecking
you'll be swiping and dictating and
mashing your way to a better keyboard
