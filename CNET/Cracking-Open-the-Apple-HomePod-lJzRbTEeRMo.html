Heiner with we have got bill Detweiler
our cracking open experts we've been
doing cracking opens for over a decade
on tech republic and we're here with our
sister site
CNET talking about the Apple home pod
today so bill this device has been
anticipated for quite some time is now
available and as always we do with new
technologies we're gonna break it apart
see what's inside and see what we can
learn about it and what we can share
with all of our viewers yeah yeah tell
me what you're gonna do with this one
you know just like we did with the Alexa
or the echo M and we've done with other
smart tech you know it's really
interesting to take these things apart
and see all the chips all the technology
that's packed inside these devices that
actually make them smart so more than
just a regular speaker right and so with
the home pod where we're gonna start is
we're actually gonna go through the
bottom right here now this is the rubber
silicone ring that people might have
heard so much about in the news that
leaves as Apple calls that our Apple to
scraps I think a light mark on some wood
furniture or a light ring but we're
gonna remove that here you know it's not
something probably the average user
should do at home but for our purposes
that's where we're gonna start so we do
it so you don't have to that's right now
to do this these rings are usually held
on with an adhesive so we're gonna use
our handy heat gun here a little bit of
a low setting to try and heat up the
glue and then we're just gonna pry the
rubber ring off and that's gonna be our
point of entry so this device of course
has been long anticipated it was delayed
but it is finally here and there is a
lot of interest in it you know people
who are our Apple fans Apple users have
been waiting for a device like this of
course Siri came out before Alexa but
has not made as much progress in AI and
natural language processing we see some
of the competitors which we're going to
talk about through that we have the home
pod and the Sonos one and we have
Google's home max which are all
competitors up to this device bill what
is it about this device that's that's
driving
a lot of interest why is it that there
are people buying this and that are
people obviously watching that are
interested in learning more about why
they might want to get this device yeah
so if you have one of if you're already
in the Apple ecosystem then this device
sort of fits within that ecosystem you
know very well right and that's and it
also sounds really good it's it's a good
quality speaker especially when it comes
to bags they don't really want the
average person you only get this apart
so that's why we're doing it so that you
can see what's in there and we can learn
a little bit um this thing has a four
inch woofer which is near the top as
well as seven tweeters so this is a
pretty serious speaker and that's why it
costs so much this is the high end of
the the speaker category in in typical
Apple fashion so you can kind of see
I've got one of the screws out which was
a Torx t5 screw now we're taking out
these there's about one two three four
five oh there's another one hidden under
the when you're cracking these devices
open that's what's really kind of
interesting here you don't know what
you're gonna encounter
yeah and a lot of the times because
people don't want you to take the
manufacturers don't want you to take
these apart then you have to sort of
find and learn as you go you know
sometimes you other people have cracked
him open online or you can do some
research a lot of times when you're
doing these devices you just sort of go
along and see what you can find and what
we're doing here is you know it's kind
of hard to to see and this is the part
that can be kind of frustrating when
we're taking these things apart yeah is
that you know there are screws attached
to this plastic ring at the bottom I
don't know how many exactly screws there
are or how you know sometimes how the
screws are configured and so you kind of
have to work your way around work your
way in the device so what I'm trying to
do is we have a variety of tools that we
use these are little metal plastic picks
we use things Ledger's we do our best
not to damage the devices I don't know
if we're gonna do that on this one here
because you know we again it it's made
to be taken apart and repaired but by
professional and not a a repair facility
and not really by the end-user yeah
you've been doing these for a long time
yeah you know
99% of the devices we crack open we put
back together again and still use his
bill kind of has the mind of an engineer
and they try surgeon you know so you
know part of that is patience you're
you're very patient when you are doing a
device like this and if you are getting
into one of your own devices you have to
be really patient you can't push it you
can't force it
that's when you're gonna break something
you're gonna break a knob you're gonna
break a connector that you need to to
get something back together and so we
found here and this is kind of those
unique situation we have a hold this to
the camera so everybody can see what we
found is basically that this plastic
ring here once I've removed the screws
from the center it's it's held in place
not just with adhesive but it's also
held in place by the outside cover okay
now we're gonna try and remove the cover
without cutting it I don't know if we're
gonna be successful in that but we're
gonna give it a shot all right that's
the one part you know if I had to cut
this you know it wouldn't you know I
wouldn't be able to replace that very
easily I wouldn't be able to put that
back on so I'm gonna pry this off of
this little metal tool here and this
should come off if I can let's see here
work our way around there we go oh no
now this is a little so we can see here
another little plastic ring more
adhesive our favorite things when you
take these apart you can see the
adhesive right here that's always a pain
to deal with you know it's funny old
when we first started cracking things
all our our we've started cracking
things open we we didn't really see a
lot of adhesive we see how more
mechanical connection we saw screws when
apps tab especially on mobile phones as
the devices have gotten thinner we see
and as people wanted more water
resistance more dust resistance we've
seen a increased use in adhesives which
makes taking them apart at least in our
opinion a lot harder
yeah and that's the the heat gun and
sort of trying to be more careful now we
we've gotten the bass off we've gotten
the internal little bass off what I
don't see or any other screws we're
gonna try and attack this from the top
now we're gonna try and move this
plastic piece here see if there's any
more please it's important to know this
is a touchscreen up here this is where
your operating Siri
and working with Siri and so you know
this is something you're gonna we're
gonna be real careful with that and try
not to damage it we don't see and this
is why I said we're trying to remove
this without cutting it this is like a
sock almost on the out is your hope that
you're gonna be able to peel it we're
gonna try now that we've got the bottom
off we're gonna try to take the top off
and keep going
so you mentioned the microphones that
that might be microphones at the bottom
that is one of the things that this
device has done well in in early tests
from schema and and others as well this
has a very good mic system so Siri
sometimes even it will miss hear you or
won't hear you if you're too far away
this device has very sensitive
microphone system and so that the base
and the room filling sound and the good
microphone system are are one of the
benefits of this device especially
versus of the Sonos one not a very good
mic system in the soilless one but this
is an excellent sound system not quite
as good as this but it's also less you
can get two of these basically for the
price of one of these and not as good of
a mic system but it has good sound much
less expensive and it is like the
speaker system so we had a little bit of
a yeah we had a little bit of a damage
here so that this is the danger whenever
you take things apart so yeah we were
really trying to take this part without
damaging the sock here without cutting
it and unfortunately I had my heat gun
and this is why sometimes we use a
hairdryer instead of a heat gun I think
you've done for the video is a little
faster and to keep this video under an
hour we just have to pull with a little
more heat and it's a little more
dangerous right and so we have melted a
little bit of the cover here and we're
still gonna try and heat this up I'm
still gonna try and remove this but yeah
the cover is probably a lost cause at
this point battle bar yeah it's just a
battle scar here that will have to live
with
learning experience again we do this so
you don't have to with your home pod so
so bill touch screen makes this
definitely more treacherous be right
because there's gonna be more
electronics there's any more wires
attached to the bottom of this and
that's gonna make it more of a challenge
right it is and so that's why that's
what we use the heat that's why we use
these small devices you know when we
first started cracking like this this is
sort of a modified guitar pick right and
we can slide this plastic device in here
and try to slide it through the glue
yeah um and not crack this if I order to
take one these metal devices and not
just sort of shove it in there the
guitar picks tend to work pretty well
for this because they are flexible
they're plastic and usually don't
scratch the underlying you know they
won't scratch the underlying components
and they can cut through the adhesive
you can see this is pretty strong stuff
yeah thus the I'm pushing pretty hard to
get through here that's what the heat
does and these are really the holes then
we used to have oh yeah right so early
on we started we used anything that we
could we used razor blades we use
kitchen knives we use on the on the
first iPhone that we did I think I use
the kitchen knife right yeah
now we've gotten a little bit more
sophistication to there's a great old
photo out there on the Internet of when
we've cracked open the first iPad you
remember in that there are there's like
Swiss Army knives stuck in the side
there's spatulas there's all kinds of
things that are all stuck in at once as
we're trying to pry that screen off of
the back casing all right let's see how
let's see what we can do this one's
being difficult yeah it's being a little
tougher than normal but that's okay we
expect it to be all right so we're
finally sort of through the top of this
we've heated the adhesive enough and
I've kind of worked my way around and so
we're hopefully we're gonna be able to
lift this off now I really have tried to
do this you know if you get impatient
you can just pull this back right here I
suspect this was this this part here
would just snap off you don't want to do
that but we also know because this is a
an LCD or a screen of some type right
there's going to be a connector there's
gonna be a cord it's gonna be something
connected to it I really don't want to
take a metal tool like this go all the
way around without kind of knowing where
that cord is or trying to at least avoid
it somewhat
yeah well as destroying the the
technology right yeah yeah yeah and it
looks like the light actually this may
just be a cover that the light shines
through I might even have to worry about
that but that's what you don't know you
really don't necessarily know until you
get in here what you're gonna find
yep now let's talk about Siri a little
bit because Siri is what's powering this
device and Siri really pioneered this
smart smart assistant revolution but
serious fallen pretty far behind it is
just a cover yeah so this is actually is
just a cover and it the lights are
actually mounted yeah that's so you can
show that off like taking this off and
yeah you can see the plus and minus
volume the power and then of course the
the logo the Siri logo that pops up as
we're talking about Siri had a nice lead
in smart assistance from several years
ago and they have they really lost that
unfortunately so this is not a device
that's gonna be you know your smart home
control center that's going to be your
smart assistant because it doesn't have
as many third-party integrations as
Alexa and it doesn't have as good of
native integrations as Google assistant
nor does it have the language
capabilities that that Google assistant
has in multiple languages so this is a
pretty us-centric
device and definitely sort of English
centric device much more than than
Google and an even Alexa so so you do
have to keep that in mind with this
speaker that said it is Apple's first
speaker and you have to expect that
they'll learn from this so we removed
for these are Torx screws these were
actually T 5s on the bottom I use the T
ticks or t6 to remove these okay and
that's another frustrating thing that
you find inside these devices is that
manufacturers for whatever reason like
to use different sizes of screw and I'm
all different for different columns
especially Apple
I don't know what it is if you take a
part of Samsung phone if you take apart
something else like that they use the
same screws or they use similar screws
no no no not inside an Apple device will
be 15 different sizes lengths you know
different head types so it really it
does help with your taking these apart
they have a pretty good assortment of
tools to help you do that so we've got
the screws out of here again I'm gonna
try and pry this off and see if it's
gonna pop off easily or if we're gonna
have sort of more trouble underneath I'm
trying to feel how much resistance is
here yeah I don't see any other screws
here I don't know if there's any screws
under the Sirian tap there is not
actually this is just a little white cap
there's no hélène LED lights right there
it looks like oh so I can't really see
whether or not you know this plastic
piece is separate from this so we're
gonna try and pop this off and see what
happens
oh and it looks like interestingly
enough there's another there so here we
go so there's more adhesive down there
yeah so we're again we're gonna pry this
off very gently now so this is this
piece of hardware right here has the
Seri the LED lights yeah it had the
screw holes passing through it it has
the ambient what what I suspect is an
ambient light sensor right yeah and the
controls the you know the plus and minus
can controls here for volume yeah we can
see here at the back it's connected by
this little really thin ribbon cable you
see those a lot or we call them ribbon
cables I think they're actually called
flat flexible folding cables or so okay
like that so okay they stop calling them
ribbon cables that shows our age right
old ribbon printer cables yeah so but
it's connected I don't want to damage
that so what I'm gonna do is be very
careful there's a small gating connector
right here that the cable plugs into
actually should be able to pop that
loose with a little bit of a metal tool
here may be or it may just pull out if
it actually doesn't have a gate on it I
think that it does there we go there we
release the gate like that and then I
can pull this out well and it's gone so
this is what I talked about with being
able to sort of remove these parts
without causing too much damage yeah so
on this board now this is interesting
with
with these devices you see these shields
here the metal shields the end of those
emi RF some type of electro magnetic
interference shields design protect the
circuits underneath and with some
devices those are actually here I'll
take it with some devices these shields
are actually you can pop them off the
pack with other devices you can't
so some manufacturers when they put
these shields on they actually solder
them to the boards now what's likely
under their bill well so there's going
to be the controllers for the LEDs
there's going to be the controllers for
the touch sensors is probably going to
be the controller for the ambient light
sensor I hate you think I know I think
that's further I would suspect that's
kind of further down I could be wrong I
haven't looked at the chip that's under
here it's possible that it's there but
the only way to find out is to kind of
keep going and keep getting further into
the vise now we can see down here more
screws right so we're gonna try our t6
see if that'll did it does yay so we're
gonna go ahead and we're gonna keep
taking off screws now you can kind of
see we built up a little pile of screws
or piles of notes we're throwing things
around piles of components here's
another one it's like you know 19th
century clothing it's just one layer and
then another layer then another layer
these really are like nesting dolls
right you know it's you keep going
deeper and deeper now I will say this
the apple homekit you know this we don't
know this episode of cracking open may
be like our longest episode ever you
know feel like a marathon here okay but
you never need these speakers are
actually really complicated to take
apart the echo was and this one is
because you know they're more than just
small devices like a phone usually you
pop the top off of the thing and you can
get right into it now what we've done
here is we've actually and this is what
really annoys me about some of these
cracking opens right now I've figured
out we found that there's this seam
right for the cover and it's there's
these couple strings here that are
wrapped around some plastic pegs on this
sort of on this little piece of plastic
here inside the inside the speaker and
if we remove these pieces of string and
we pull this out you can see how this
comes apart here we have this little
plastic ring you know it's just a holder
and I suspect and just as I suspected
enough that's game let it if I hold this
like this you know it's kind of like
shoelaces right yeah you can pull this
like this we can get a shot like that's
great good shot and we can hold this Oh
cut it so I won't have to cut it that's
great pull the sock down there we go
then we can see a magic moment there we
can see the plastic frame yeah it'll
just come loose like this now yeah
obviously and we can remove the whole
thing - totally
once we actually take the speaker apart
and we remove the power cord from from
the speaker yeah this would just slide
off that way yeah now that's also the
good news is this thing's gonna go back
together or go back together
won't work just perfectly now one thing
is else that we've noticed so this is
where we first start to see the main
board for the home pot okay it's good
there's a port as a circuit board right
here whoo
and I can tell that this shield right
here is not soldered to the board I'm
able to pop that off okay and we're
gonna be able to see the stuff
underneath
I believe that a eight maybe is there
well yeah well we'll see what we'll see
oh we can see the big subwoofer right
there yep or the woofer that's orient
woofer right here yep you can hear it
yeah a little bit if we tap on it that's
where that great bass remember this
device probably the best bass of any of
these speakers so if you really care
about bass if you're you know into you
know music with a lot of bass the bass
this is probably your device you know
right here it's claw and very good one
thing I'm gonna do right now is in order
to get this board out the board's was
held in with the screws that I took out
earlier but there is a another one of
these flexible cables that runs down in
the device this is like an what connects
to the speakers or connects to some
other circuitry possibly inside that we
haven't seen yet it's this large flat
cable here alright we're going to go
ahead on this gate up right here there's
a there's a gate on the back of this
this lifts up and then real gently we
should be able to pop that right out
just like that so with that we have
another circuit board so this is circuit
board I think we've got this circuit
board in heck who knows there's sound in
there and um we also do I want to be
able to take these shields off so we can
statutes under underneath there we can
already see one of the chips right here
and outside of this we're gonna go ahead
and pop these larger shields off alright
to pop this one off though we're first
gonna have to remove the ribbon cable
there's a little bit of adhesive I don't
really like pulling on the end much yeah
we're gonna use another one of our
guitar picks just slide it kind of under
there very gently okay to go through the
adhesive again I don't want to pull on
this too much I don't want to like
that's where you could make it look I
know it looks like there's a gate on
this side so we're not even gonna do
that I'm gonna pull this out here and
because this this metal shielding comes
off yes I'm gonna open the gate there
we're gonna take another little thin mat
we're gonna take a metal tool okay or
something equally thin we're gonna pop
off this yam up this shielding here you
see me and the ribbon will just come off
with it and we're gonna see what's under
there now this one has lots of little
bitty metal tabs yeah they're being kind
of frustrating that's okay okay so you
just have to be patient a little metal
bit a little bit at a time you know so
it'll go it'll go over - it'll go back
together no problem even if one of the
tabs were to pop off or something like
that as long as it's held back on in
place yep that's no problem we're
looking for that Apple a8 processor to
see where that is if it's in here
great it's possible it could be in this
unit from the top but very likely it's
in here remember the a8 that's not the
latest processor that's in the iPhone
it's a couple generations behind I don't
see any chips so we've removed the metal
shield yeah but that down there I don't
see any chips yeah really you know
significant chips on this side of the
board this is all motherboard primarily
yeah a little printed circuit board here
so now we're gonna take the we're gonna
take this larger one off on the back so
you can see the photos of this device
yeah we'll have on TechRepublic
you can also if you know what some of
the chips are you know sometimes they're
people that watch these shows that they
work at some of the companies that you
know put these chips in here partnered
with them then you can of course
anonymously
I'm leaving some message in the comments
and let us know you can also use the
comments to let us know if there's other
things you'd like us to crack open
because we're always looking for for new
stuff to break into I suspect under this
right here I suspect this is the okay so
we're gonna take this little uh and here
it is here's the a8 and here it will
take this little cushion here is
probably a little bit of a you don't
source the thermal paste any more on
these Yang's to sort of connect it but
that's what this sort of pad serves and
it helps protect the chip and serves as
a little bit of a heatsink and so right
here we can see a memory Chapel you see
the a8 processor now this is one is easy
to identify because it has large a8 on
it yeah this one it's really hard to
tell one of these is probably a Wi-Fi
chip in here it's yeah just super hard
to read the the markings on these but
there's definitely a Wi-Fi chip in here
we know there's going to be a process of
audio processing chips in here because
it's a big part of this yeah as well so
you know here's definitely the guts of
the speaker and this is what makes it
actually smart so at this point if we
just wanted to see what this was we can
kind of stop right but I suspect what
they've done is they made a calculation
that looked this component is a whole is
not likely to be repaired they've made
the calculation that this component
right here they're just going to replace
this as a unit this is manufactured to
be replaced so if the repair center gets
it back in they're gonna have this unit
they'll be able to remove all this other
stuff but we Obul to remove the cover
but then that'll be it that'll be it
there's no other ways to do that so like
we in here is just the power unit the
tweeters the subwoofer and the
microphone that's probably all that's
left in there the only way I suspect I
think this is all solid yeah only way to
get to that is to break out our dremel a
dremel and try that it go down the see
this yeah we're gonna break out we'll
break out a rotary cutter and you would
cut along this side and then lift this
part off and then the speaker's will
come out to for our purpose what we're
gonna do is we're not going to do that
we've we're decide that we really want
to try and put this back together and do
some further testing on it yes so and
we've kind of showed the most important
tech that we think is inside the device
and so we're gonna call it quits here
and we're going to
we're gonna unlike the bb-8 that we
cracked open and see yes a couple years
ago the little Star Wars sparrow toy
yeah bb-8 we're gonna spare that to it
we're gonna spare the home pod and and
stop right here
very good all right so you can find more
photos of all the things we've cracked
open in the past and more future
cracking opens on TechRepublic and find
videos on CNET and let us know what kind
of things you'd like to see us crack
open next leave us a comment in the
comment section and we will look and see
what kind of stuff that we will do next
time alright thanks for watching see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
