the Apple Viper all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now in our
first order of business we talked about
the iOS 5 battery issues last week an
apple is now released the iOS 5 update
to the public so if you haven't done it
already on your device you can jump into
your settings then general then software
update you won't even have to plug it in
if you have enough battery life the
issue it's meant to fix its all done
over the air iOS 5 so check that out now
big news dropped when adobe announced
its completely stopping development for
flash on mobile browsers instead Adobe
will focus on mobile apps and
implementing adobe air with them
increasing their investments and
supporting html5 Steve Jobs had such a
strong stance on flash but it didn't
fail entirely because Apple never
supported it it really failed in the
mobile space because even to this day it
didn't work that well with the hit or
miss experience it didn't support the
touch screens on the open standards for
mobile devices and html5 adoption
continues to grow now you can bet
somewhere SJ is smiling or he's pairing
deep into our soul saying I told you so
now we always like to look at what might
be coming in the future of Apple devices
and patently Apple is posting some of
the latest apple patents that have been
published didja Times reported the big a
was looking into using a dual LED light
bar design for the ipad 3 to maintain
the brightness of the reported higher
res display that will be used now one of
the apple patents describes the use of
multiple o le d backlights not only in
the design of the iPad put in Apple's
other products like the iPhone cinema
displays macbooks and IMAX now there was
also a patent revealed for implementing
a speaker on the clip of the ipod nano
as well it would be a small integrated
yet so electric speaker that could be a
nice addition for listening without
headphones or even used in voice control
features and in something that we could
actually use on our current devices one
of the new patent filings also proposes
new gestures that can be used for
smaller screens the answer could be a
hold then swipe gesture and a swipe then
hold gesture would be able to determine
the speed of the swipe it can be used to
cycle through objects or clusters of
information and the filing also
described how you could vary the speed
by tilting the orientation of the screen
now we know patents are no guarantee
that we'll see all these things
implemented but a simple gesture like
this might see its way into future
devices alright let's stick with iOS 5
and here's a tip they'll let you take
full advantage of the reminders out
brian song here with cnet.com and if
you're using iOS 5 one of the additions
is the reminders app it could be super
helpful but we're going to show you how
to make it even more helpful by sharing
your reminders list with a friend or
loved one then it gets started you'll
need a few things a device that's
running iOS 5 you'll need to set up a
free iCloud account with apple and
you'll also need a computer now most of
the time reminders are created when
we're on the go so let's jump into the
reminders app on our phone and on the
top left hand corner click on the icon
that will allow you to create different
reminder lists it could be anything from
groceries to your upcoming vacation but
i'm going to add another list for a
dinner party then we'll jump into that
specific list and add a few reminders
because who doesn't like a little
Cabernet and candles for a dinner date
yeah now once we put in a few things
let's go to our computer and log in to
icloud.com with our free account we've
already created we'll get access to our
calendar and in the left-hand column
you'll see our reminder list we can see
our dinner party list and there's a
sharing icon next to it click on it and
it will prompt you to add a person to
share the reminder list with they will
also need their own free iCloud account
but once you enter in their email
address and click Share they'll receive
an email to join the reminders list once
they accept they'll be able to view and
edit the reminder list and will be
shared between two people that really
care about each other raincoat so there
you have it i'm brian Tong for cnet.com
and there's your how-to for sharing your
reminders in iOS 5 use it wisely so you
guys I told you that guy
smart now there's plenty of other
secrets on iOS 5 and there are two
hidden features that aren't public but
can be accessed with a little tweaking
there's a hidden camera panorama mode
built into the camera app that
jailbreakers have found but Apple is yet
to make it available to users it's a
pretty simple interface and yeah it's
cool I mean it's there but there are
plenty of better apps that are a buck or
two on the App Store now the other
secret in iOS 5 is that it's also hiding
an autocorrect keyboard bar similar to
Android you can get access to it by
backing up your device through a
separate app called I back up bot and
then reloading it from that app and then
adding some code it's really not worth
it to me but it might be worth it for
you bottom line these two features exist
in iOS 5 we might see them down the road
now something we won't see is serial on
phones like the iPhone 4 and the 3gs
developers have been able to
successfully port serial on to both
phones and everyone can't wait for Apple
to make it happen but the fruit company
pretty much shot down any hopes that it
would with the response Siri only works
on iphone 4s and we currently have no
plans to support older devices now
developer Ryan Patrick admits there were
some quality issues on 3gs but let's be
honest Apple's never gonna let this
happen especially when mms was only
available on the 3gs and especially when
series one of the main features they're
touting for the 4s I'll write to the
quick bytes and with tim cook at the
helm Apple opened up a program to match
charitable donations by employees for up
to ten thousand dollars per employee now
up to this point Apple's worker bees
have donated 1.3 million dollars and the
queen bee has matched that for a total
of two point six million dollars in
donations since mid-september which is
amazing and deserves major kudos you
know it's something I thought I'd never
see just like I thought I'd never see
this
see now that that is amazing and check
out the guy at 148 you know what I'm
talking about all right Steve Jobs his
impact is still being felt he was
recently nominated for time magazine's
Person of the Year in his biography SJ
believed he was going to be times man of
the year nineteen eighty-two when the
magazine went for the computer instead
if he wins he would be the first person
to receive the award posthumously all
right that's going to do it for this
week's show thanks for watching you guys
can email us at the apple byte at cnet
com i'm brian Tong and we'll see you
guys next week for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
