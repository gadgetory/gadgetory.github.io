in wearable tech very early on and it's
hoping that that extra experience can
but it's later SmartWatch the gear s2 a
cut above its rivals let's take a look
let's start with the biggest change and
that's the design Samsung smartwatches
up until now have had a square look but
the s2 is round and there's a new way of
navigating the device to match so to
move through options you twist this
bezel on the side a little bit like a
classic diving watch now most of
Samsung's apps make good use of this and
because finding the best way to control
smartwatches is still an industry-wide
question it's cool to see Samsung trying
something new I actually really like
this mechanic I think the company could
be on to something feels quite cool to
use now the gear s2 comes in a few
flavors as well as the standard model
there's the gear s2 classic which has
this luxurious leather band and there's
also going to be a 3G option which can
make calls when it's not tethered to a
phone all three models are going to be
dust proof and water resistance so a
question a lot of people are still
asking is what exactly are you supposed
to do with a SmartWatch well apart from
tracking your activity for use in
Samsung's s health app this devices main
function will be as an extension to your
phone so it'll show you incoming calls
texts emails and so on without you
having to pull your phone out of your
pocket so I'm intrigued by that circular
navigation and the claims about battery
life but with many people still
unconvinced about smartwatches and with
competition really hotting up from other
manufacturers will be looking for some
really special results when it comes to
the full review until then stay tuned

much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
