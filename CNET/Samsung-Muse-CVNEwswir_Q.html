giving you a first look at the samsung
muse a $60 mp3 player that Samsung is
really branding is more of a smartphone
accessory they're saying with this and
one of their Samsung Galaxy products you
can move your mp3s directly off of this
phone and onto the mp3 player without
having a computer intervene with this
and the supplied cable you can connect
this to your samsung galaxy note or a
galaxy s3 smartphone and move your mp3s
directly from the phone and on to the
mp3 player the idea being that these
phones have gotten so darn big
you don't want to take these to the gym
or take these on a jog if you just
offload the mp3s onto the muse mp3
player you can clip this on put on your
headphones go for a jog and enjoy your
active lifestyle unfortunately there's a
lot of problems with this mp3 player
actually it might be the worst design
mp3 player I've seen in a while so first
off the worst thing off the bat here is
the fact that the controls on the front
of the mp3 player are absolutely
impossible to see impossible to touch is
using a capacitive sensor in here which
looks really neat because this is
perfectly smooth front of the mp3 player
but if you're jogging and you're being
active and you don't want to actually
take time to look at this thing there's
no way to actually tell which are the
volume controls where the play pause is
where the track skip is it's just this
entirely ambiguous interface very pretty
very smooth but not easy to navigate if
without taking the time to look right at
it and even when you're looking right at
it
Samsung puts the interface to sleep
after a few seconds so you have to touch
it once hold it for a couple seconds and
that'll wake up the interface and after
you wake it up then you can squint
really hard and try to figure out where
the track skip and volume controls are
and hope that they respond to your touch
but otherwise it's really confusing
because you're having to do two presses
instead of one and even then you're
still having to look at the thing to
figure out where the heck the controls
are so the other controls on here you
get the on/off switch that also pushes
you into a sound Maximizer mode which
has a pretty good job of
a little extra base to the otherwise
awful earbuds that come in the box then
you've got a whole switch on the side
which is kind of pointless because it
does an automatic hold feature by making
the navigation go to sleep after a few
seconds but you've got it and then
you've got the shuffle switch over here
there's a headphone jack at the top
which is also the charging jack thanks
to a little headphone jack the USB
dongle that comes with this thing which
you're probably going to lose and then
you've got the clip it's a plastic clip
does a pretty good job of staying on
stuff so you're probably saying Donald I
couldn't live with this interface it's
really beautiful just show me how to
transfer songs off of my smartphone and
onto the galaxy muse mp3 player well
I'll show you you have to download a
free app called muse sync and like the
name implies it you know goes through
your music library and allows you to
connect your muse mp3 player select the
songs you want to transfer over and sync
them so chemic that into the muse you
connect this part into your Android
Samsung mp3 player of choice it
recognizes that you're connected you
select the tracks that you want to
transfer over and there it goes it's
doing the syncing process it's moving
all my mp3's from the smartphone over to
the mp3 player so that I don't want to
sacrifice my smartphone when I want to
go on that marathon let me show you a
few other options you have reasons why I
would not buy the muse mp3 player first
of all say what you will about the iPod
shuffle $50 it's a much better built
product it's an all metal design and it
has buttons you can actually figure out
what you're doing just by touching this
thing and not looking at it you can
figure out just with the ridge of the
track skip controls what it's going to
do but if you're really looking for a
disposable mp3 player that works with
anything you really can't do any better
than the sandisk sansa clip zip you get
the tactile controls you get a built in
screen and you get that plastic clip I
will say this for Samsung I think
they're onto something there is
something to be said about a small
relatively affordable little companion
music player to go with your smartphone
I just think that they could have made
this go wirelessly would have been
really neat if they could have used
their Samsung smart transfer or
Bluetooth transfer to get your music
onto here without having to use a bunch
of
cables that you're gonna lose I also
think that would be really easy for them
to revise this and have tactile controls
on here so if you're running around you
don't have to stare at this thing and do
the two touch feature just to wake this
thing up and figure out what you're
doing so there you go that's a first
look at the Samsung muse mp3 player
slash smartphone accessory that really
isn't worth your time or your money for
