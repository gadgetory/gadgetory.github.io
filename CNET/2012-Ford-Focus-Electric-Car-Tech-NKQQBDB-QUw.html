that you can barely tell it's different
by looking at it quite the opposite of
what happens when you drive it let's
connect with the 2012 Ford Focus
Electric and check the tech now spotting
a focus Evy isn't that easy and that's
part of the story on this car you see
car makers fall in two camps if they
make electric cars either make it
electric and weird-looking see
Mitsubishi or make it electric and
totally stealth see Ford the main dead
giveaway is this face this really
good-looking Aston Martin s grille
except it isn't the grille at all
because there's no radiator you don't
need the airflow there's no engine up
here just an electric motor so this is a
solid fashio
over here's another dead giveaway this
really slick rotating pop-up charger
port door I have grave doubts about it
lasting more than a year before you have
to replace it or working at all in heavy
snow but I still like it
now nothing in here is gonna look like a
typical engine bay because there's no
engine electric motor here a 107
kilowatt electric motor what does that
equate to about 143 horsepower but
because it's electric it's a torque
monster 184 foot-pounds of torque that
is a great number in a car in this class
in particular and equally dissimilar to
the focus you may drive is the
transmission or basic lack thereof it's
a one speed conversion gearbox is what
it is there's no shifting going on here
but there's a gear conversion to match
up the engines rpms which are relatively
high over to the wheels rpm that you
want on the road now of course an
electric car the batteries as important
or more important than the electric
motor and here it is it's a 23 kilowatt
hour unit it's a big battery about the
same size capacity wise as that in a
Nissan Leaf but a Nissan Leaf being a
clean sheet design has the whole thing
buried in the belly of the vehicle here
on the Focus evie you do give up a fair
amount of trunk space it's just right
there in your way you got to bear that
in mind now in terms of Range official
estimate about 76 miles on this guy and
that's also part of a 110 MP
GEEP a rating that's that new number
that tries to equate the energy used to
power a gas car against an electric car
now the charge time and cost are
interesting to charge this battery this
is ford's big headline on this car it
takes three to four hours using a
level-two charger that's one that plugs
into a 240 volt outlet like the one your
dryer uses a Nissan Leaf using the same
kind of charger takes roughly twice as
long not only is it charged just three
to four hours for full capacity from
zero but the top ups will go much faster
as well and that's the real-world
charging will be doing more often now
the cost of that charge about two
dollars and seventy five cents using a
national average cost of electricity
however is we're about to learn they've
got some technology in this car that
lets you tell it to charge only when the
rates are low which could bring your
total charge cost down by more than half
now inside the Focus TV is pretty
standard high trim focused stuff with a
couple of differences first of all the
gear selector here looks like an
automatic but as we mentioned it's
really not such a one speed transfer
case you're normally going to be in
Drive but if you want to get greater
brake regen you'll go too low now on the
left side of the speedo one affords
unique displays here that's controlled
by this left hand wing controller you
have a range view a 5-minute history
view of course you got your battery
range in both level and predicted
mileage you've also got something called
budget which is the mileage calculation
against your destination or the next
charging station on the map that you've
input and the interface gets even more
interesting when you install the my Ford
mobile app currently available for
iPhone coming shortly after we shoot
this video for blackberry and Android
you've got a status that shows mile
range and battery capacity this next tab
here shows you charging stations you can
also plot those on the navigation system
and the car will figure out if you're
going to make it or not and that also
goes into that budget readout here's a
trip planner that's also cognizant of
can you make it on your current charge
and if not it plots out charging
stations along the way you're going to
have to stop at and some standard
telematics like remote control to turn
the car on or off unlock the doors fine
the thing when you've lost it and very
interestingly set up the most ambitious
charging schedule using some data from
Microsoft a database on the backend and
the cloud that takes into account where
you are the best times to charge based
on your usage of the car though so it's
not just going to say I only charge
between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m. if in fact
you for some reason drive a car a lot
that time and the system also lets you
take your best green driving performance
and upload it to Facebook as a challenge
to other Ford Focus evie drivers I won't
be doing that the power on the focus EB
is ample but it's not tuned for
performance like it could be I mean
there's a lot of torque and power here
but it's been tuned for range as well as
responsiveness so that's the word I give
it responsive but it's not a sports car
but by no means does it feel like a slug
it's a nice balance I think now the ride
quality compared to a leaf I recall the
leaf feeling a little more a little more
luxurious a little more floaty in this
car I feel like is a little more
responsive and slightly towards sporting
what area I'm not entirely a fan of is
the regenerative braking on this car
when you get on the brakes with any
significance like going down a hail or a
short stop in traffic it's not really
linear how it kicks in it feels like it
kicks in in notches that feel a little
bit unrefined but it might just mean I'm
driving in a very hilly area in San
Francisco now this energy gauge here on
the my view panel on the left is a
little busy for my taste I'm getting so
many indications of budgeted mileage
predicted mileage battery charge battery
recharge five-minute time slices of
battery usage and two other things I
have no idea what they are I don't want
to study that much all I need to know is
how much range do I have left
and basically how am i recharging how
well am i regenerating power and it does
that with brake coach at the end of
coming to a full stop it'll show you how
much of the energy the kinetic energy of
the car you recaptured by braking in the
proper manner it coaches you to brake
very linearly and very gradually as you
come to a stop
okay pricing a focus evie it's a $40,000
car but you take 7,500 off in the tax
year that you buy one new
your federal return and your state may
offer a nice chunk off as well here in
California right now is 2500 bucks and
you get the nice stickers for the HOV
Lane now a leaf is anywhere from two to
four thousand dollars less depending on
trim level this comes in only one trim
level the other thing to consider is
which ride dynamics do you like better I
find the leaf a little more luxurious
this car little more sporty if you will
and the last consideration is the charge
difference a vastly shorter charge time
on this vehicle that's the price you pay
both in dollars and in some compromised
trunk space in the tax year you buy one
new not use they're so new that's all
Jesus still running if it is what does
keep rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
