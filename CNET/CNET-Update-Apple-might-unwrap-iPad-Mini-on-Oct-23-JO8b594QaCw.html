amazon I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update best buy will match any
price on Amazon during the holiday
season this is according to a report
from the wall street journal now best
buy has always matched competitive
prices if that company has a
brick-and-mortar store like Walmart or
radio shack you just have to show the
price on your cell phone at the cashier
but best buy never before matched a
price with an online store best buy is
doing this to fight back against the
trend of people using best buy as an
in-person showroom for browsing and then
walking out to order later on amazon
best buy is also offering free home
delivery if there's a product you want
that's out of stock there's no official
word yet about when this will start and
if best buy will match prices with other
online stores like overstock or newegg
but next time you're picking up anything
at a Best Buy use a barcode scanner app
like scan or shopsavvy see how much the
item is going for at other retailers
then show the cashier if anyone's
selling it for less I've done it for
things like games and DVDs and it works
but it has to be the same product
sometimes you'll find a better cable or
memory card online for a lot less but if
it has a different product SKU you could
be out of luck Apple could finally show
off the much-talked-about iPad Mini at a
news event on tuesday October 23rd this
is according to all things digital and
their reports tend to pan out but you
won't know for sure until Apple breaks
and silence everyone's waiting to see
what features apple pack into this
smaller tablet and how much it's going
to cost and Amazon's Chief Jeff Bezos
said the Kindles are sold at cost
Amazon's not making any profit because
they were rather make the profit off the
media you buy with the tablet now don't
count on Apple to follow the same path
some have estimated that Apple makes
about a forty percent profit on the iPad
