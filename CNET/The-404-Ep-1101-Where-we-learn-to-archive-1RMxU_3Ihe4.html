bunch in your career you're at the daily

TechCrunch or a tech land crunch gear

TechCrunch and the entire time we've
been here we literally haven't moved to
the back radiation that's fine no great
that's good you're always rolling over I
like that but something happened what so
so let's really get to understand what
just happened here you apparently sent a
photo oh boy I've Justin to someone that
Justin knows from your past just were
tell the guy sitting next to me to
explain the story about what happened
cuz I'm not sure actually talking to him
right okay so do you guys are fighting
which is awesome i gave you the trucker
hat age is how you repay just gave me
stink eye you guys not how friends do
read each other Asian on Asian crime is
an epidemic okay we can't have that
happen in our studio it's true what
happened Peter tell me your side of the
story I want to hear it we're gonna this
is going to be like a People's Court
sort of situations that hammer that we
keep in here well hammer so Justin asked
me if one of my co-workers if I knew who
this person was and I said yes okay why
do you ask like oh I went to middle
school in high school with I was like oh
that's cool hmm
so then I just texted her and said
brought up his middle school or the
middle school that you two went to
Angela's middle school she corrected me
Indianapolis I never learned how to read
alright alright use like this hour well
I don't know you didn't clarify i wasn't
sure i don't know how things work and
don't sass me in each other California
so so what happened to you so you that i
sent she was like she asked me why are
you there i was like well now and then i
sent a photo of justin that I took yeah
without him knowing yeah so a little
upset and that she remembers him which
is good it's man like 12 years what do
you remember of this girl um not oh well
I'm you went to middle school in high
school together I remember we had mrs.
karey's English right that's very
specific I want I want to know like what
did you have a relationship with this
girl we're your friends yeah well we
were friends but you know didn't really
maintain contact afterward but then I
saw a press release that she had gotten
a job as a community manager i believe
right techcrunch couple months ago and
when you got the job there's like hello
let me ask Peter about this guy not
knowing that you were just gonna send
some candid photo of me yes in 12 years
man hey you know what sure members e
that's the most important part speaking
of which have you been to your high
school reunion oh really coming up or
over free I have opted out of the 5 and
the 10 yeah so cux i Facebook you had a
five and ten yeah I mean I've never
heard of a five well that's what happens
when you go to a school for your classes
less than a hundred people oh yeah I
guess so then you guys all probably are
on the same email chain anyway you can
keep in touch that way right or that
thing called facebook is why I didn't go
to either my Iranian so I was like I
already know what you guys are doing
Facebook kind of killed that didn't it
yeah yeah it didn't though mostly better
than all of them I mean who else are
many of the Managing Editors I don't
think so I don't know you just crap all
over him i love it so so now you got
upset because he sent you this pic G
sent this girl this picture of you why
did you get so upset man no no reason I
just it's weird that people are just
taking photos of me and sending about
aunt he is visibly upset with her he's
upset because it's not like there aren't
any photos of you on the Internet yes
that's the problem the internet too
tricky because asking all right so the
answer
it's so there right now tell her to tune
in to the show yeah tell her stream
stream live because now live stream
doctor yeah yeah well is it live stream
place is just breaking live stream what
livestream com okay she'll get it no no
no livestream com what / 404 no just
livestream com I think we're on the
front there okay the ship is sinking
right now I microphones cutting in and
out oh man still not working no 001 back
there you can back yay all right anyway
we'll follow up on that saga as it
develops yes what's going on Tegra what
uh what what are you guys up to you
these days right now we're just guys
scooping everybody right now we're just
getting ready for our crunch up on
friday and palo alto your what our
crunch up are you going out there now
i'm not know what scrunch up it's uh
it's a little mini sort of panel
discussion around a very specific topic
leading into our annual summer August
capital party sounds pretty exciting
yeah what the hell do you do there would
I don't get it so this year's theme is a
built around the Facebook ecosystem
we're going to talk to the developers
and then folks from facebook and say
like here's what's happening what are
you guys doing mm-hmm a very lively
discussion about the ecosystem there and
what that entails bright are you going
to ask them about all the fake users
that have sort of played their site I
think someone will hopefully so that
just came out there what is it eight
point five percent of facebook users are
not real yeah yeah that's a lot that's
all these low alien users though I mean
no it's not yeah that's a 955 million
you know what way I would mean there no
that's right now there's 950 million
total users Total what's eight percent
of that number this BBC news article
that would mean there are like would be
way more many people in the world than
there are there's no yeah there's just
there just the Miss that's a misper
weights 950 million right total you told
ya so it's eight percent of that
whatever that is that's what like 90
million I don't know where is it nine no
I I met without Matt I mean you gotta
I'm sitting
front of you two guys you're not going
to know neither of you are gonna give me
the roll medical answer now I'm banding
back together with Peter just go you I
mean for that what I thought that's what
we pay you for um uh oh that's not
necessarily spam users though right like
I'm sure a lot a big percentage of those
fake accounts probably for like people
that dogs and like you know exactly
where multiple profiles counts though am
I count on enough accounts let me look
at that I'm looking at this article it
says duplicate profiles make up about
four point eight percent of the users
and then 1.5 are just undesirables which
are like spam bot accounts I just click
on likes to her marketing interesting
and then 2.4% our user misclassified
accounts I mean that means that yeah
that means that people that are you know
creating multiple accounts or ones that
just for like fake celebrities oh I have
maybe one or two friends who have
duplicate again what about you you got a
fake one now don't lie I do not know I
wish I did why would you need a
duplicate account is that like a lurker
account I know Franco why would I now
could I live how can you possibly learn
exactly is booking but what point is
that you have to be friends with people
right so you can't lurk if you're not if
you have a fake account unless you
create a fake profile for someone that
they know that is so twisted and screwed
up that's really weird that is really
weird um no I have duplicate accounts on
okcupid but that's well that's your
problem you really do that no I don't
yeah you know I actually don't you know
what the girls do I've heard a couple
girls tell me that they have duplicate
accounts on okcupid so they have one it
was like the real one right like a saucy
one another one where they can just lurk
around it dudes and look at their
profiles before they decide yet actually
use their real account to hit them up I
can't relate but it sounds like a good
idea that's right you're out of the
dating game I've been the reason for
that is because okcupid is like LinkedIn
right like people can see why you give
in to you in their profile but you can't
see who's viewed yours unless you have
that option turned on really so that's
why people create multiple so they can
lurk on others to like screen them I
think before sending a message okay is
that right right I'm learning yeah I
don't know I think so yeah I I just know
that you can see who's looked at your
profile illness or like enough then
there's like a private motor something
which you are on mo but
war on okcupid I am do you like it you
have you had success I've only been on
one date but you know honestly like I'm
trying to do a story about dating in
this day and age compared to let's say
10 to 15 years ago I mean I just saw all
these photos of you with surrounded by
chicks on facebook I was like man was
fun i was looking at it my wife's like
that be that Peter hi he gets around
doesn't it is a ladies man I'm like I
guess it was just you surrounded by a
bunch of white chicks it was cool
there's one asian in there yeah you
there's a hopper I'm there so so what
was that like I was at a wedding those
are what i figured she only had one day
through okcupid uh correct that's it
correct yeah and that's it you're not
are you are you like actively seek I
mean now because I think it's so a
little bit boring it's kind of like all
right what's the next thing that I could
possibly look at ya alright if you have
a go to first date for your okcupid
dates I'm gonna close my god I feel like
we're the ABC sportscaster what's your
preferred first online no I have a
little place I like to go on the first
date yeah well what is it yeah when
you'll ever know you about come on let
me guess let me guess then is it a flea
market no oh well that's always mine did
like the dim sum place where's that
hammer that we do oh we're not gonna be
talking about my dating life I want to
hear more about it because you see
there's this little bears a little wine
bar and the Lower East Side that I like
to go to would go okay I got peter has
OkCupid profile yeah I would love to
look at that i'll give you the URL there
what are the five things people notice
first about you how do you know there
anyone in because that's part of the
okcupid profile ask because I Asian what
happened to anybody into that what do
you mean how could anyone answer what
other people think about well yeah I
mean a lot of people do like that you
told me things or my face or something
or when it used to be like age sex sex
location oh yeah ask me can you tell us
about you said you've only been on one
date right so you haven't had any really
terrible like nightmarish States I feel
like everyone either has those or like
really creepy messages that they've
gotten actually it's always girls that
have them check if I've told this this
girl my last name wait what okay the one
that I wanted that's okay no one can
find the show I don't wanna that's okay
you can use Mac disclose that yeah uh so
yeah I've only been on one day nothing
terrible so far mm-hmm although there
have been a couple instances where I'll
message a girl and then they will
respond and then we'll kind of go back
and forth about trying to figure a time
they like go grab a drink and then they
sort of drop off cuz that's like a
relationship in itself the back and
forth I try and keep those very limited
like what would we possibly talk about
if we actually did go on a date see I
feel like the key to doing the online
dating thing is to only exchange a very
limited amount of first messages and
then immediately meet up so that you
don't waste too much time if well that's
what I that was my approach I was like
hey we should grab a drink right and
she's like sure when I give him her give
her a time and she's like oh that
doesn't work how about something else so
I can come back to her with another time
and then that's where it's dropped off
for a couple girls right she's like this
guy's do you busy for me I don't even
want to deal I but i'm confuse them like
you're the one asking me for an
alternate time yeah then why would you
just think would you have a problem
giving out your phone number to someone
that you presume isn't a serial killer
after a few messages well that's why i
have a google voice number two oh there
you don't so you should start doing that
and then you can take and send funny
photos to each other that's pretty small
a photo that's what I always do ya like
funny photos if your hats and dogs and
stuff that's your currency that's really
networks dude you girls love pets that's
your game currency yeah but that's like
saying here's my brother's baby who I'm
just gonna like take around and get some
it's more like look at this is what I'm
seeing right now like it's just
something to talk about I'd you know
what interesting as weird as he is and
as strange about the things that the
things that he does are here he you know
he knows what he's doing in some
capacity I may ask you to coach me then
we'll have a 404 red light episode I
would love to pick apart except Jetta
yeah we need like a pickup artist
everything all right I want to talk a
little bit about your
three so the news came out of the daily
or used to work correct they laid off a
third of their work for us yeah it's uh
it's a bit of a bummer it is a bummer
when anyone loses their job of course
yeah I'm not really sure who is a part
of that layoff yeah let me talk to a
couple people and a couple people I've
talked to they still have their jobs but
it's just really unfortunate you know it
was very lofty aspirational project
begin with and I don't think they're
gonna go in anyway they're not going to
go away anytime soon yeah that's what
I'm kind of worried about because I
subscribe I really do have to daily a
lot but it's just uh I don't know I want
and we can only assume we can only sort
of guess that though at the reasons I
would imagine maybe subscriptions
weren't awesome remember looking at your
iPad at the daily yeah that's what I was
really impressed with all the graphic
designs of course in the photos were
incredible as well I'd imagine that for
a daily newspaper that's going to
require a huge amount of a graphics team
I read online that a lot a lot of the
cuts were made to the graphics team as
well as sports an opinion that's a
bummer yeah I don't know that that's got
to be really tough to maintain also I
feel like a lot of work The Daily was
kind of competing with the internet
right like the old messaging seemed like
it was a way to you know cut through the
fat of the interview you know like their
daily curators you don't have to search
any other websites that's a tough enemy
to make right i mean if you're trying to
compete against something as big as the
web right it's a hard sell you know i
had some suggestions for them during my
tenure there and before I left but you
know it's it's a you just got Rupert
Murdoch on speed dial hey Rupert hey
we're all gonna do is just call him
Ruffy be like hey dude you got some got
some ideas for you sir it more or less
went something like yeah maybe like look
Peter I gotta call you back you are my
number one priority but have to call you
got some other stuff going on some other
fish to fry yeah alright well you can
still check the daily out if you're
interested it's pretty cheap though
subscription was always pretty cheap I
feel like it's very possible for the
year yeah well what crossword sodoku
weather and horoscope every single day
for the price of admission to get one is
it not
I would pay for that if they had like a
web-based app where you can just look at
her on a computer well you know what
it's still evolving they're still trying
to figure it out so you know we'll see
what happens all right I want to shift
gears back to you and where you're at
right now what are you interested the
summer is always a very lame in my
opinion very lame sort of let down in
terms of tech news and stuff like that
what are you into right now you're sort
of like me you sort of hate first and
ask questions later that sort of thing I
hate all the way through yeah oh it's
deep it runs deep and you and I but what
are you what's making you upset what's
making you happy these days with tech
what you know you know right now because
we're getting ready for disrupt in
September in San Francisco yeah I've
actually been able to see a lot of
really cool startups that have been
thought of applied for our battlefield
and reviewing those and kind of going
through that so it's been pretty
exciting to see I guess in terms of
trends what people think are going to be
important for this year and next year
hmm so it's pretty exciting to see that
but I think we're gonna have a pretty
good battlefield in September in San
Francisco so if you guys are want to
come check it out there's going to be
some really really cool stuff and I I
don't say that lightly I know and I and
you I really that's like a huge thing
for you to say yeah because nothing
impresses you yeah you know a lot of the
stuff that's happened in the past is
always been sort of software based web
based products right I think you're
gonna start to see some more hardware
startups coming up not like Kickstarter
maker people like actual tease us though
blokes gimme give us it gives us a
little taste um you know gives a little
flavor a little bit later yeah one that
I'm really excited about is a
two-wheeler with a really weird and
crazy engine so you're inside it's a
bicycle is a bike something like that
huh what does it do a little like true
this is for kids this is like oh this is
like legit it's gonna like a good mini
motorcycle what does it dude what is so
cool that he can't say it's a fully
enclosed sort of 2-wheeled motorized
vehicle oh that is going to change the
world is it a bicycle or is it a car
you're describing the
I sauna look at our car arises is it
wrong it's the tumba it's not quite the
tumbler the back wheels aren't going to
tumble quite like that no it's it's uh
it's an atypical motorcycle is the
easiest way to put it okay that a
typical capable uh no typical correct Oh
like the Segway is there a gyroscope in
it that's not like that Glee in any way
shape or form soso way but early
something that can't crash or flip
correct ooh this is a fun game hmm it's
pretty sweet so it is the toddler it
could be the tumbler that's so cool
interesting so when can we expect to see
this for ourselves September absolutely
12 okay all right all right and you'll
be out there covering yes very cool ah
so what else what about apples back in
the news with their announcements
incoming yeah oddly next month right
yeah what do you think about the smaller
the idea of a smaller iPad look man I
honestly just based on what I see with
any other 7-inch tablet it'll probably
do really well with the female
demographic Oh interesting with Jay love
it because of the smaller they can put
it in their person not be like sexist
but that's the feedback that I've heard
from girls are like I suppose the iPad
the iPad as light as it is it still just
a little bit happier than a 7-inch
tablet horse and I remember when Samsung
came out with that very very very first
Android how about seven inches like he
go back and look at all the reviews
joanna stern from ABC i think she was at
engadget at the time she was like I love
this tablet yeah she's like cuz it was
small I didn't like feel like I was in
drop it on my face if I'm reading in bed
right that was my first company about
the first I PES that was too heavy yeah
I remember netbooks took off right away
with the female demographic for the same
reason was that they wanted something
light to carry around in their bag that
makes sense and again there's nothing
it's you're right it's not sexist if it
was culturally acceptable for men to
carry around Merces we'd all be psyched
about it i right you know but we carry
around backpacks and bigger like which
is which letter back carry cuz you know
we have like larger big things on her
back did you guys see the photo of that
guy
i think it was in a subway station in
New York actually he had an iPad stuffed
into the back of his belt what oh yeah
yeah he was entering that around yeah it
was in Grand Central huge I had his iPad
tucked in between his pants or not in
between spans but in like like in
between is a tucked-in shirt and his
pants correct yeah I my thing with the
ipad is that I'm never comfortable
carrying it outside of a hard shell sort
of case you don't want to drop it I
don't want to drop it I don't want it to
get you know squashed a little bit
because even if you have that smart
cover on it and you put it somewhere
like on a couch someone sits on it by
accident all right it's gonna get so I
always really I'm obsessed with keeping
it inside this hard case unless I'm
leaving it on a call it always amazes me
to see people who are walking around the
streets of even Manhattan yeah I know
she was using it then I'm like what are
you doing that's what does somebody like
your lumps you right it's over grabs it
and then takes off down the street I
that you're totally right now blows my
mind when I see someone just rip it out
of love us leave yeah and it's just
naked there's nothing around it maybe we
just hold these products at such a
higher level but it like i'm just
worried a survey maybe I'm a klutz but I
feel like any little tiny movement could
possibly just go flying out of my hand
right that's why I feel like a 7-inch
tablet would be kind of more annoying to
have to keep track of right i feel like
i would lose it a lot of here you know
you're not putting that in your pocket
still it's too big guarantee that I I
would hate to have to keep pulling like
a calculator sized object in and out of
my bag right I'm going to be more prone
to just set it on the counter when I
need to pick something up there it is
like it's just going to have either of
you guys been at like a major event like
a concert or a sporting event where
people have pulled out their iPads to
take photos or videos well sporting
events and a concerts are two very
different things okay but I waited at a
sporting event you're not in a concert
I've seen a lot at baseball game right
facebook I mean you can read a newspaper
while you're at the baseball game 40
friggin boring but that sort of
environment I think allows you to take
it out there do you mean so a little bit
it never looks cool it's something that
looks cool I don't care if it looks cool
or not it's just is it practical it's
just not practical in the sunlight
affinity
terrible sunlight is terrible too yeah
yeah I remember I saw a lot of people
using it in manhattanhenge New York it's
like a very local thing but yeah
apparently like couple times a year the
Sun lines up in between the buildings of
the avenues in New York yeah it gives
like a really cool image of a sunset
which apparently Yorkers don't see ya
and wait like illuminates the buildings
on the streets yeah it's kind of cool
it's something like on thirty-fourth or
42nd whatever one of those long
corridors right you can see from river
to river and yes I'm like gets in
between hmm it is a very local thing
yeah people might be like oh that sounds
stupid but I know I don't sit when you
live in Manhattan and he don't really
see the Sun that often right it's kind
of cool to see it like it's true you're
oh yeah used to these very odd casted
shadows and these strange sort of
reflections that only happen for like 15
minutes a day and stuff like that
especially if you sit next they have a
window in your offer and you sit there
you're like oh let's let's drink oh
there's oh there's the Sun I can make it
off for different reflections there it
is amazing little there you know what
I'm hoping that apple announces pretty
soon is a new ipod nano I feel like dad
hardware is up for refresh I remember
when we did the walking dead escape at
comic-con I was saying that all they
need to do is put a camera inside one of
those things and it could be the new
GoPro and like GoPros have taken off
over the past few months and athletes
love that kind of thing all they have to
do is add either a watch strap that's
Apple endorsed or a bunch of different
straps that you can put in a helmet you
know like you're a big motorcyclist well
that's a huge thing to just take videos
of you know yeah gross driver huge last
couple years yeah I mean why has an
apple taken an advantage of that and
just put an HD camera you're not hardly
enough yeah mophie announced I think
yesterday this like action sports
package for iPhones Oh essentially out
there yeah it's like in a hard shell and
then you can mount it like on a helmet
or whatever it is see the thing with the
GoPro though is that it is most
certainly designed for that yeah
absolutely the if they ever did that for
a nano that would be an afterthought but
it's not the camera itself that's really
special it's just the case it's like
indestructible plastic case and then
this the rubber strap I still think
they're there they're more sturdy and
sort of rugged
and then then an ipod not naina right I
mean like I feel like that thing still
is more if it wasn't there recently like
a prototype week of the new nano the
showed that it had a camera I think it
wasn't that all the way I believe
actually it still has that small clip
form factor I also think the lens on the
GoPro is really good they have a lot
better I have a great sort of image
quality on that tight little package I
mean that thing's no bigger than you
know I don't like a mouse it's like
hamster stuff yeah it's amazing foxes
imagine it it's covering degree or four
boxes and and the quality is amazing the
audio yeah you're not going to get the
great greatest audio at any sort of go

we'll do like Lady and the Tramp to her
style it'll be sick um all right do we
have anything else before we gotta say
goodbye um well we got a couple words
that were added to the Oxford English
Dictionary all right um let this be the
last story that we talk about her what
you know it's really sad is that I feel
like every year Jeff you and I talked
about the new words that are added to
the Oxford English Dictionary like I
think we did that no nine that's okay
only a few years prior but you know with
like social media getting so popular in
urban dictionary man I I must check that
site like four or five times you know
the last thing I looked up on urban
dictionary was beez in the trap and I
felt like such a white guy when I did
that cuz I just didn't know what that
was yeah that's not normal like I don't
know what that is anyone is gonna you
gotta be easy wanna try for ya are y'all
you know I'm talking about there's that
Nicki Minaj song using the tribe Tony
can be singing are you using no idea go
this way you got lucky today wait so I'm
sorry we can't really beat a quaint
anything serious that she says no but
beez in the trap I mean if she's like
I'm honey super well ya better be what
do you think that means bees and i beez
in the trap i beez in the trap is that
saying that's the lyric I ends in the
trap the letter i peeing somewhere I
don't know no no we got to figure this
out he's in the trap yeah she's she's
saying I myself beez in the trap yeah
i beez ambar maybe like a buzzing
there's some sort of buzzing in the
usual getting a haircut is that what do
you raise its stupid wait no give us a
hint he's saying the trap is what the
trap is Lady part yes a project ok so
the trap is a busy ok so beez in the
trap i beez in the trap yeah I think
you're overthinking it no she's doing
enjoy in the trap she's in the trap I
think that's what that means like I've
had nothing to do it she's in the
Trotters so she's the trap is really the
thing that we should be looking on right
yeah it makes it that none of us know
what that means cuz yeah none of us are
in the trap ok I think we need to stop
giving her money but anyway I do I think
that's the lesson area yeah stop giving
Nicki Minaj money you're it is the
lesson go by sriracha a lot like
seriously you're better off more value
with the fam oh man all right way love
those lawyers there's a lot of new words
that it came out this year that are
actually added to the Oxford English
Dictionary a bunch of which probably
shouldn't be and they're old to like
chillax knowing you really is the worst
right bromance bling bling just got
added to the Oxford English Dictionary
which is got to be the whitest thing
ever jeggings come on wait but dough
like Homer Simpson's dough is in the
dictionary now a locavore I've never
heard that before but it makes sense
it's yeah that's been around for a while
one of those combination words diet that
you only locally produced food correct
you're thinking of port Mentos right
point in Joey I was a lot of these are
ya bro that's just lube is now a word
allows the MELD knows he's not serious
you know like noob saibot yeah totes oh
man those are all different set of words
that I really is like short nurse
Twitterati that's interesting are you
kidding me he nor frequent users of the
social that is sweet a word I
been away for a lil always a word but I
think they just amended to reflect what
are now useful I think some of the more
interesting ones don't have to do with
tech like there's 35 of them I think
like 30 are all like cyber-related yeah
stuff but truthiness is one of them
wasn't that the colbert thing where he
got that edit a while ago was it I don't
know is that the origin of that that's a
the quality of seeming to be true or
upcycled as another one um I didn't
realize that wasn't a word yeah how's
that not a word and then whatevs its
alternate Ari's sure what about whovian
