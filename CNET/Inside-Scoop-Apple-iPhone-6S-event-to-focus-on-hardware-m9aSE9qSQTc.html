September 9 event I'm Lexus avedis
joined by Shara to consume your rider
for cnet now Shara what have we
expecting since the invites have gone
out a couple of weeks ago to this event
do we know anything extra about what's
coming yeah we think this is going to be
a pretty packed event we're definitely
going to see the new iphone but we also
think we're going to hear about new
iPads and the Apple TV as well so just a
lot of things for them to get through
and in terms of a flagship product to
stand out are we going to expect that to
be the Apple tea this time around yeah
they haven't updated the Apple TV in
about three years all of their
competitors have come out with new
products so it's really really time for
an update to the apple TV whether that
also includes a new content service
where you can watch TV over the Internet
we don't know but at the very least
we're expecting people to be able to
make apps for the Apple TV maybe be able
to do some gaming sort of things with it
so we're really just going to have to
see I want to touch a bit on smartphone
fatigue this is something that you
covered a lot now a lot of people are
saying that this particular event this
time around the iphones are not going to
be anything exceptional in terms of big
upgrades how do you see this playing out
for Apple of people kind of over the
smartphone iteration wars now yeah we're
kind of at this place in the smartphone
market where most people who want a
smartphone have one so all of the growth
in smartphones is coming from emerging
markets and traditionally that's been
China the issue is that now China is
also maturing so there aren't quite as
many people who are getting their first
smartphones so last year at the sep
tember event Apple announced the watch
and then it didn't come out for another
couple of months into this year 2015 do
you think we're going to see the same
kind of scenario this time around if
Apple talks about as many products as
we're expecting the iPhone the iPad
Apple TV we can definitely see more of a
staggered sort of release the iphone
will probably come out first you know
traditionally that's come out in
September and we can potentially see
bigger iPads an apple TV roll out later
there also could be something where we
see a sort of Apple TV content come at a
later time as well where you can access
programs over the Internet you know
deals with cable providers whatever form
that takes it sounds like that's
something that could be later sharra

check out the rest of cnet's live
