sorry the debate show or I Jeff Bakalar
argue with my friends and colleagues
over three rounds of dead series debate
joining me on the program today is mr.
David Katz Meyer TV reviewer
extraordinaire how are you sir I'm
pretty good okay I like the sound of
that David and I will be arguing over
three rounds and being awarded a total
of five points depending on how well we
make our case assigning those points and
announcing the topics is none other than
our own Scott Stein what's going on
Scott Scott you look like you're at
Mission Control here what is happening
keep up my screams ready got my screens
organized and ready to judge he's gonna
smoke that stylus it looks like alright
we flipped a coin before the show to see
who would go first I'm gonna go first in
rounds one and three Scott please let us
know the first topic so we kissed a lot
of tech goodbye in 2018 and there were a
lot of things that sucked but which one
sucked the most you got 90 seconds go
alright who on earth is going to miss
Google+ shout out to Google+ the only
social network that existed that you
never knew if you were on it or not it
was just part of like your email and you
didn't really know if you were logged in
it was a disaster oh and let's not
mention that like they shada ly leaked
tons and tons of information about
people over the course of four years or
wherever it was and never bothered to
tell anyone and that's the whole reason
why they're shuttering it earlier then
they said they were going to rest in
peace Google+ no on earth is gonna miss
you I don't know I really won't miss
this robot Curie Curie Curie $700 robot
it's an optional robot no necessary it's
designed to drive around your house take
pictures of stuff and be your friend I'm
sorry if a robot is your friend and
you're lonely
curling that thing up next to you is the
most depressing thing in the world and
this thing is just it's yeah it's cute
looking but it really doesn't do
anything except for take up a lot of
batteries and you know what $700 get a
dog dogs a great companion dogs not
going to do anything and you're gonna
grow up with a dog and have a really
good time fair enough
I feel like Google Plus is the thing
that I'm gonna miss the least because
we're ever like involved in any of the
community stuff they didn't Google+
it was the most haphazard ridiculous
environment you didn't know if you were
like somehow in some sort of advertisers
astroturfed environment or you were just
trying to check your google photos
either way yeah we see in Google Plus
that's things from doing the SEO of
Google Play it was a disaster speaking
of disasters Scott what do you think was
the worst tech that died last year well
I think Katz has got a point in that
there are a lot of bad smart robots that
need to kick the can but the one that
caused me active pain was Google Plus
that I remember that we had to sign up
for it we were encouraged to be part of
it company-wide now I'm experiencing
that pain Yammer and I'm gonna give or
to Jeb okay and I'm gonna give the
remaining one Wow
doing out of a whole lot of fresh pain
on that there's trails left cats plenty
of time to make up those points anyway
all right round two cats is gonna go
first this time Scott what's the topic
okay I'm really curious about this I
just I just want to know there are a lot
of streaming devices out there which one
is the best decide you have 90 seconds
go Roku obviously and a story Roku is
the guys that wrote the streaming box
the streaming box device they came out
with these devices that are very
inexpensive the cheapest Roku is like 35
bucks and it does everything the thing
about streaming is you're gonna get some
Netflix you're gonna want to watch
Netflix that's all you need you don't
need to spend a heck of a lot of money
on some device that can fly around and
do a bunch of stuff Roku actually has 4k
HDR versions for less than anybody they
have great convenience features like you
can control the TV volume and with the
remote you do a lot of great things with
these things they're dirt cheap super
simple to use people would go to the
house can use it for the first time my
kids can use them with no problem at all
you can speak in the remote search fine
whatever you want it does everything you
need it's cheap simple great to use okay
maybe I shouldn't have picked this topic
I'm gonna choose Apple TV 4k okay I know
it seems crazy but here's why I have
Roku and I have an apple for TFO TV 4k
at home and I find that the picture
quality is better on Apple TV especially
for direct team
now I find the HDR looks really good and
I've noticed that it's the only
streaming device I have that can
reliably internally stream those 4k
videos I have Roku seen seems to like
not be able to keep up with that sort of
stuff and look this is just a long way
of me getting to the point that men
those screen savers are where it's at I
mean Apple TV if I could just slowly fly
over Dubai whenever I want in 4k and
just kind of like sit down on the couch
and have that drone fly over what you're
trying to say you spent a honey bucket
and and you know I can I can really
enjoy that that's money well spent I'm
an Apple guy you know it's a great thing
I'm telling you you do not need spend
$180 to get a wonderful experience with
the 4k streamer and the video quality
I'm sorry but that's okay placebo effect
fair enough Scott Stein how bad did I do
there I mean you made a convincing for
human in the end because I was I was
dead set I was gonna give this I was
gonna give all five points to cats okay
I would give you one point oh I do use
an Apple TV and I can see what you're
saying
one point to Jeff for the cat's Meyer
who is the king of streaming himself
right I it's like what I picked up I
tried to get into the mood the ring with
a professional battle you picked a
battle with the king of streaming what
then what was I thinking all right it's
five five this is the third and final
round I'll be hitting it off as soon as
I get the topic from you Scott Stein
well it's the holidays so we're all
gonna be eating it alive and in terms of
food let's decide once and for all white
meat versus red meat which is the way to
go for meat eaters of course 90 seconds
go okay I think the answer is clear it's
white meat because white meat is chicken
and chicken as we all know ask any chef
or sous chef and they will tell you that
chicken is the blank canvas of the world
of cooking because you can make you can
make chicken tastes like anything you
could make chicken do any dance you want
it to do it's gonna take you wanna you
want a scampi chicken okay that's
it'll wear any Hut you know wear any
dress you put on it and that's the
beauty of chicken is it it's super it's
the most flexible plus white meat is
also like fish really healthy it's
really healthy red meat come on we all
know what happens with red meat
get those go be clear go those meat
sweats no meat sweats with chicken I've
never had meat sweats from chicken what
do you think I mean I don't want to eat
a blank canvas any any chicken dish
replace it with tofu just the same Oh
difference I don't use a little
flavoring it's the same thing
red meat is the flavor red meat is umami
it's a real flavor this is fat this is
the real thing when you cook red meat it
actually stays juicy delicious steak try
to replace that with tofu steak is
irreplaceable it is it is like
unobtainium it is the thing that you
cannot get enough of steak is the best
thing ever by the way
the best fish that's red tuna you know
how you've ruined tuna you cook it
that's truly supposed to have tuna raw
but to this technically it's not red
meats white you mean it's as red as meat
yeah let's call it the colors red but
it's not the you don't get the bad
effects like red meat red meat it's
better for your heart it's bad for
you'll go up being and then come on any
doctor will tell you you've got to
choose between steak and chicken yeah
screw doctors after I eat a meal of
steak you know it's my well-being me I'm
sitting there going wow you know what I
can look at for my other man's meal a
steak all right Scott should we screw
all doctors Scott what do you think
Graham three who's it go to so what was
the last time that I try to get food
opinions from tech writers I'm going
somewhere else next time but let me you
know I think Jeff there are many things
to enjoy in the world of chicken but the
idea of a blank canvas wearing many hats
is not the way that it would have feel
to me um you can have vegetables instead
any healthy vegetables so I give all
five points all five to David Katz
mantras for a deeper clean meat and you
don't have to eat meat but definitely
don't eat it the way that Jeff chicken
any point me doing you make it into a
dancing class price chicken
it sanitizes you pickin it was already
like that
kind of made me never want to eat
chicken again the way you describe why
never do I done did it sorry check
they're not appealing you're garbage on
the heels of CES the winner of today's
episode of nope sorry wins what happens

you thanks so much to Scott to David Wow
