CNET and next to me is physios 2014 M
series this is their mid-range TV for
this year it's a 60-inch model right
next to me but the series goes from 32
all the way up to 80 inches this year so
it's a nice large range of sizes this
TVs a little bit different from the
step-down eseries that we looked at
recently one of the biggest differences
is the styling the set has a sort of
silver look around the edge there's also
a matching silver stand slightly cooler
styling than on the e series which is
all black if you actually like that
silver look another big step up is the
remote control it's a lot better than on
the E series the button arrangement on
the top side is really nice but when you
flip it over is the real story it's got
a full QWERTY keyboard on the bottom so
you can actually turn that remote over
and type in passwords and searches and
things like that and it works really
well a couple of great things about that
keyboard a it's backlit and B it
actually works with Netflix so you can
search Netflix something that some
keyboards don't actually work with all
apps this one doesn't work with everyone
but at least worth with Netflix the TV
does have a lot of smart TV
functionality it's just like the e
series you can click on the Smart TV
button and get a little line of apps
along the bottom you can customize and
rearrange that line of apps it doesn't
really interfere with what you're
watching
select any app from there you can also
double click on videos app button and
will bring up a full screen interface it
gives you a lot more space to navigate
and find different apps that you want to
and again customize that little strip
that pops up all told it's an excellent
selection of content you don't get HBO
GO but then again that's not found on
any other TV except for Samsung you do
get Amazon and it actually it's the new
updated Amazon app which is a little bit
of again an improvement over the e
series around back there's ample
connectivity between four HDMI inputs as
a single USB port for photo video and
music
there's also single component video
input and of course an Ethernet jack of
course you can also connect this TV via
Wi-Fi to the internet speaking the
internet one of the things this set
doesn't have as a built-in web browser
found on a lot of other TVs at this
level flipside I'm not really a fan of
those built in web browsers usually
you're get a lot better results using
your phone or a tablet in conjunction
with the TV vizio does promote the
improved picture quality of the M series
compared to the e but when we took it in
the lab the two were very similar the m
and the
are both excellent performers this set
can get extremely deep black levels and
it also gets a slightly brighter area
and highlights compared to the E Series
that's probably thanks to its additional
local dimming zones although you don't
get really all that much improvement so
again even the M very similar in terms
of picture quality one a little
advantage on the M series is we did get
slightly better color out of this TV but
again it's really difficult to see the
difference unless you're looking at it
side by side the M series does have
improved motion specs but again in the
lab you really could only get that
improved motion if you turn on
soap-opera effect of course the flip
side of that is that everything kind of
looks like a so proper and looks really
smooth so if you want to get the best
film like picture out of this TV you're
gonna have to turn all that off and deal
with slightly lower motion resolution
than found on some of the competitors
picture quality also features excellent
bright room capability and very good
picture uniformity so all told one of
the better LCD performers we expect to
see this year that's a quick look at
Vizio m-series TV mid-range price
excellent picture quality and pretty
good styling again one of the better TVs
we reviewed this year for 2014 I'm David
