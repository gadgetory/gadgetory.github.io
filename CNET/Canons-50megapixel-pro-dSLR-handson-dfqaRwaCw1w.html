sr is the highest resolution full-frame
DSLR to date but while canon earns a
first for that it's definitely the last
manufacturer to offer a camera without
the blurring effect of an anti-aliasing
filter the camera's not shipping yet but
I got a chance to shoot with a
pre-production version for a couple of
weeks and here's my take the photos from
the pre-release version are certainly
sharper than any I've seen from a Canon
and they're a whole new level of quality
compared to the 5d Mark 3 but the photos
from the pre-production version weren't
quite as good as those I've seen from
the Nikon d810 they've got more noise in
the rows starting at mid-range ISO
sensitivities and the d810
seems to have a broader tonal range in
general the Canon does offer a fine
detail picture style that enhances
sharpness and helps with photos at about
ISO 800 and higher but that mode also
increases artifacts the higher
resolution does help in cases where the
focus is slightly off though making
scaled down images look a little sharper
than they might have otherwise plus the
5d SR did a little better than the Nikon
when it came to moir√© in fact it was
really hard to find any and the video
even though it's only two megapixel HD
looks a lot sharper than from canons
other models the price you pay for all
those pixels is performance once again
this is a pre-production model but
moving all that data through the image
pipeline even with dual processors does
take its toll Canon seems to have
settled on a body design for its non
rebel DSLRs a 5d sr body is almost
identical to the 70 mark - and even the
three year old 5d Mark 3 there are
really only a few menu items that differ
from the 70 mark - and those apply to
features that exist only in one camera
or the other for example five detail has
the fine detail picture style a delay
option when shooting with the mirror in
the locked and upright position and an
option to retract an STM lens on power
off and it has a really nice crop view
in the viewfinder when working in a crop
mode these are just my initial
impressions though I'll be back with a
full review once I've got a final model
