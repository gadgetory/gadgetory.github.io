a look at two Sheba's new Kiera book
this is part of a new cure line of
products from Toshiba
it's their super top end line above the
satellite the portage a the tetra the
Cosmo whatever else they have the only
product in that cure line right now is
this the Kiera book it is a 13 inch
laptop looks and feels a lot like other
13-inch ultra book style laptops
including some that Toshiba makes the
big difference here is that this guy has
a very very high resolution screen
Toshiba calls it pixel pure and it's
about 25 and change by 1440 that's the
screen resolution it's very similar to
what you would get in an Apple MacBook
Pro with Retina display laptop even
though obviously Toshiba does not want
you to make that comparison they really
do want you to kind of make that
comparison
another great comparison between the
retina MacBook Pros and the q book is in
price this guy starts out at $15.99 and
that's for a 13-inch you know Core i5
laptop and it goes up to $19.99 that's
actually the version we have here
because this thing adds a core i7
processor and it adds a touchscreen
that's right the $15.99 base model does
not have a touchscreen on mac books you
expect that but for a Windows laptop
that's actually kind of crazy for that
price editing touchscreen it's actually
$200 more so $15.99 16 $17.99 just to
get the core i5 version with a
touchscreen now Toshiba is hoping that
the super-high resolution screen is
going to be worth that to you in
addition to the very very nice materials
and construction this thing is made of a
magnesium alloy that's actually lighter
and stronger than aluminum this is
actually lighter than a comparable
13-inch MacBook it's it's got a smaller
footprint it's a little bit thicker
however as a laptop this performs great
it's got a nice big touchpad it's got a
a keyboard that's better than the
keyboards on the other Toshiba
ultrabooks that we've tested the
question is is it $2,000 nice when you
can get a perfectly good Ultrabook from
Toshiba for eight
and that's where I think this system
misses the mark a little bit you want a
$1600 two thousand dollar laptop to
really wow you and the design here is
very nice but it doesn't look like a two
thousand dollar laptop I think they
needed to go a little bit more out there
with the design to really pull you in
some other guys have done that with
expensive laptops whether it's the
retina MacBook Pros or the samsung
series 9 or the Acer Aspire s7 you know
these systems may not have been worth
though what they were asking for him but
they certainly took the paint's to look
different enough so you really felt like
it was something that there wasn't a
regular laptop anyway I'm Dan Ackerman
and that is the Toshiba Kyra book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
