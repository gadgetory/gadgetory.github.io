you agree to shell out a wad of cash
each month for a couple of years and in
return you can have a phone that
normally costs hundreds of dollars for a
fraction of the price or even for free
pretty good deal right then why does C
not receive a steady stream of
complaints and questions about bailing
on their contract early without paying
up to $350 in penalty fees
I'm Jessica dual core for C net and I'm
gonna dish out some tips for getting out
of your contract or at least for solving
your underlying issue without coughing
up the early termination fee you're not
gonna like this but it is extremely
difficult to squirm out of an early
termination fee even in some cases when
you're dead there are a few loophole
clauses that could help you avoid the
charge if the carrier were too seriously
significantly drastically change the
terms of your contract or if there are
material negative changes to your
service like to be really extreme one
day you have full signal strength and
the next day you have none even then a
complaint could get you a signal booster
or a bill credit so what do you do I say
embrace your role is a squeaky wheel and
hang out on hold with customer service
yeah it's a pain I won't lie but it is
worth every minute if you can resolve
your problem rather than suffer in
silence when in doubt you can always
escalate to a supervisor in the loyalty
department or in customer care managers
generally have more power to make
exceptions for you or at least to
provide more detailed information on
your situation you might be frustrated
but I do warn you watch that temper you
really don't want to be ticking off one
of the few people who could actually
help you carriers have also flocked to
social networks like Twitter and
Facebook in a big way and they have
people on hand to help you fast they do
not want you starting a Twitter riot so
they'll get back to you another option
is to use websites like sell trade USA
which will match you up with someone who
is willing to take over the rest of your
contract the service costs $20 and
expect tuned ago
with her contracts new owner before
sealing the deal in extreme cases there
is also the option of arbitration which
the carriers pay for but if you think
that waiting on hold is bad then this is
not the option for you keep in mind that
the four major carriers now prorate
their termination penalty fees which
means that the closer you are to the end
of your contract the less it will cost
you to leave the bottom line is that
your carrier will not release you from
that agreement that you signed if you're
interested it is fueled only by that
shiny a new phone over there at the
rival carrier if that's the case then
you might as well start saving your
pennies for that early termination fee
or simply grate your teeth and write out
your contract if you've got your own
questions or comments about anything
cell phone or smartphone related then
you can email cnut's mobile crew as
dialed in at cnet.com I'm Jessica's
