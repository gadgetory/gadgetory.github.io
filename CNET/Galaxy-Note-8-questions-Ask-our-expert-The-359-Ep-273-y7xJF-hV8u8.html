in the aftermath of the Samsung
experience it's episode 273 of the 359
podcast on BPG and in the house today we
got Ben Fox Ruben Rodger Chang and
Jessica Dolkar is back with us again
good morning everybody how we recovering
as suggested by our headline we are
going to be answering even more
questions on the Galaxy Note 8 and
because you did the kind of affair
without a great job yesterday
that's why Jessica they flew me out and
here we go for the recording of the
podcast see you back in the chat in a
couple of minutes here and three -
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon and with us a special
guest
Jessica dual-core hey hey hello so we
tried to give you everything on the
Galaxy Note 8 and yesterday and we
failed miserably so we had to bring in
the professional brand Jessica who's
probably spent the most time with the
note 8 yeah anyone had seen that she's
had that she has a hands on so just
quickly to sum up bottom line from the
hands off early impressions that you got
from the phone what do you think I think
it's pretty good I said before and I'll
say it again that I feel like this is
the note 7 that we should have had but
and then some right so this is Samsung's
first phone that's the note returned
after the note 7 debacle it's also the
first phone ever from Samsung with dual
cameras which is really cool but also
necessary because pretty much every
other high-end phone has dual cameras or
will have dual cameras so it's something
they kind of like
and to have it would have been a huge
fail so to that point I mean would how
do you think the note eight will stack
up because we're getting into phone
season oh god the iPhone coming out
we've got a pixel - coming out LGV 33
lots of super premium phones coming out
how do you think this is gonna stack up
I think pretty good for my early
impressions there's a feature that's
basically their version of portrait mode
that they're calling live focus and I
think it goes a step further from what
we have now right on the iPhone 7 plus
but that of course could change with
apples next phone there are just a few
more features in it there are some more
controls over the blur there's a little
bit more that you can do with capturing
images and Samsung has a really good
track record with photography with
low-light photography there's dual
optical zoom which is something that we
expected but there's also dual optical
image stabilization oh is on both the
camera lenses and that's gonna be really
good for low-light pictures when you
take video it means that you know it
won't shake as much so your video image
will remain more steady at the hands-on
briefing that I went to they had set up
a box and you know the company has loved
to troll each other so they had set up
this demo station where they had that
iPhone 7 plus you know kind of like
shaking shaking and then they had the
note 8 shaking I always a noticeable
difference I suppose you want to test it
yourself I saw the Box too and I always
wondered like maybe they like a justice
wagon they were whacking at the box the
demo that I saw Mike oh I actually
dropped the box myself oh and it was
right in the middle okay so with the no
date though is the camera really the big
selling point I kind of feel like it's
supposed to be like the stylus like it's
supposed to be like for power users that
you supposed to get a lot of work done
with this thing
yeah so traditionally the note series is
for power users it's got the stylus and
usually it has the more cutting-edge
features but this is really a blend
between the no7 of last year and the
Galaxy s8 of this year s 8 plus really
cuz it's pretty much the same size so I
think that you know Samsung these phones
are closer together than they ever have
been there's less differentiation so the
camera is pretty much it the stylus is
pretty much
we didn't have a lot of the features
that they were talking about in all the
rumors like being able to talk into the
pan sensitive screen right like the
iPhone has and just all of these things
and in the end you're kind of like okay
it is the most premium Samsung phone
that you can get if you're not gonna get
it for the stylus you're probably
getting it for the camera right but then
again like I would say six months ago if
you drew up a list of features that the
note would have had like that list would
probably be pretty accurate there was
like nothing that really kind of
surprised correct I think Samsung played
it safe and I think it's very obvious
that part of the reason is because you
know people didn't get to keep their
notes Evan yeah so if you're making the
jump from the note five number they say
you note six name but if you're making
the jump from the note 5 to the note 8
it's cut yeah you're gonna see a lot of
difference there if you are wondering if
you're gonna get an S 8 and sa plus or
the node 8 it's going to be a lot closer
it might come down to price for you or
it might come down to features Samsung
is definitely going to try to sweeten
the deal by offering deals and bundles
and carriers might reduce the price one
great thing about the holiday season if
you are considering getting this phone
is that there are a ton of promotions so
Samsung's trying to get you to preorder
the phone with gifts however if you
waited to see what came out with all the
phones that we have coming up and you
wait for a holiday there will be a lot
more promotions and deals so it might
actually wind up being cheaper in
certain ways that's a really good point
yeah all right well we got wrap it up
here for all justice coverages CNET's
coverage on the Galaxy Note 8 checks on
SEANET I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox
ribbon and I think that's a good all
current still
we have a few questions about additional
features in the chat can we floor those
do it bring it alright she's here for
Perry asks does it have a heart rate
sensor oh yeah it's all it's Samsung
hasn't taken away features so if it was
in the s7 the s8 etc it's going to be in
the note II realize a heart rate sensor
wasn't tends to talk about the new
features and we were having this
discussion yesterday like oh whatever
happened to smart stay which is if you
look at the screen and then you look
away so Samsung doesn't really strip
those away you know I didn't check but
it hasn't been removed to the best of my
knowledge or sometimes like these aren't
pre-loaded but you can still get them
through various samsung apps where you
just download certain individual items
but they're still there there are just
so many features it's overwhelming and
most people aren't using all of them so
I feel like every year there are more
features I mean well
sometimes I think that there are really
good Samsung features and sometimes
Android adopts them and then everyone's
really excited like oh my god Android
gods like Android Beam was a great
example of I can't oh yeah yeah yeah but
there are other times when you remember
that Samsung is not really a great
software company and they should stick
to hardware but what they're trying to
do what every vendor om as we would call
them tries to do is differentiate and
really the only way to do that is to
layer their own software on top of what
Google is providing so by the way where
is the fingerprint sensor
yeah yeah yeah and it's a really big
deal for me because I you know Dan this
design I think it's the worst it doesn't
make any see is it even worse for the no
day because of the way it's long yeah so
to answer your question the fingerprint
reader is on the back and it is off to
the side of the camera okay now I
haven't measured it which is something
that I'm gonna do when I get the review
unit in but it's a tall phone so the s8
you know me my hands are like not the
biggest in the world so you know I'm
reaching on the s8 I'm really reaching
on the s8 plus and I'm curious to see
again I haven't measured it I didn't
really spend a lot of time like deeply
comparing that I will I want to see if
it's moved even further off to the side
because of the dual camera array on the
back I just don't understand why the
sensor can't be centralized underneath
it's a natural way I also like
fingerprint readers in the power/lock
button on the side I think it's a great
area it's like 100 percent accuracy with
Sony phones do that in the next bit
Robin it's really actually it's really
great it's sensible because part of the
problem for me with a fingerprint sensor
on the back is like how many of you sent
with your phone just laying down you
know it's next to you do you really want
to pick up your phone or do you really
want to swipe and then do your backup
pin or gonna pick it up and do the iris
scanner when it's laying down I find out
really annoying
side bun side button is pretty easy yeah
or even on the front like that's fairly
easy as well alrighty next bit Robin so
let's add okay we are the essential to
talk about instead as the next like
up-and-comer let's branch off what you
were just talking about with the design
because Sarada and the chat asks do you
guys like that tall design I he says he
or she says I can't tell it means it's
very unconventional uncomfortable to
handle it seems how do you feel about it
I don't find it uncomfortable at all the
rounded sides really help with that
but again like for me like that phone is
never going to be a one-handed phone for
me actually argue that it's it's
becoming the new convention because I
think the iPhones gonna have very
similar so for a while for a while we
were seeing really chunky phones you
know I'd like there's like an HTC brick
that I remember just trying to hold and
for me if they're heavy if they have
like sort of thick sides and sharp edges
and it's wide in my grip then that is
what's uncomfortable for me I don't
really mind I also personally believe
that people are adaptable we kind of get
used to it yeah that's true we got
another question here from Lord havoc he
says Jessica what's the battery
consumption like so far how long does it
last
that's a great question yeah well I
don't have the note we do know the
battery is smaller than last year's
model
so Samsung said that they did
acknowledge that part of the reduced
capacity of the battery itself is
because they wanted to leave more space
in the cavities within the cavity of the
phone so that they wouldn't repeat the
same mistakes of last year but they also
promised oh well really it's faster than
the note seven which is possible because
if there are streamlining they say it's
mostly the processor is yes they say
they kept saying all-day battery life
which was common and big it was turn
like all days different for right
depending on what you're doing you're
not gonna get all day battery life if
you're navigating five hours a day and
just really music streaming this podcast
on repeat exactly this very part all the
time we have another good question here
yeah from boycott the carry I think I'm
getting that right great now asking it
does it support all of the apps for the
multi window split view I don't believe
so
yeah because the app has to itself be
provisioned to be used in in those
dimensions basically yeah I think they
said Android
multi-view right thing which is in every
app which was another thing by the way
that started in Google adopted actually
does Samsung LG service I feel like LG
had a multi window thing that no one
cared about because I might be wrong but
I'm putting my money on Samsung like LG
well maybe I'm wrong I just remember
they had it like animals ago that's cool
and then proceeded not by the phone
which Braden asks is a special offer for
previous note 7 owners worldwide or just
for the US well I got an update
yesterday that it's just for the US I'm
hoping fingers crossed it's just for the
US for now
although I think that they got it they
have to start and target different areas
from a legal perspective so they're
probably starting here and then it'll
move to the other regions start here
right yeah the real question is how much
did my article influence this because I
would like to take your welcome there
should be like an asterisk in that press
release thing because of scene that's
exactly one thing I will say though is
that it appears that this promotional
deal apology money no it appears that
this is only happening through Samsung
yes and I'm not sure I've been asked
before but I'm not sure if the carriers
will participate in any way my guess is
probably not
yes I've actually got I got I think I
think you're just gonna have to decide I
got I know from Samsung this morning
actually just confirming that yeah you
have to basically if you register with
if you register the phone with Samsung
then it should be a problem but you have
to do it through Samsung if you didn't
register your phone which some people
don't you have to present a proof of
purchase for the phone to get the to be
able to be eligible for this discount
you would think they'd be able to tell
through activations but that might just
be the activations on the counter yeah
but they were working with the carriers
to retrieve the best thing I don't think
they weren't taking down Lee I don't
think the carriers have their own
promotions exactly as you
yeah as you pointed out like once those
other phones pop up like you're gonna
see a ton of promotion it's like I I
know there's supposed to be bundling
stuff with the phone now but like it
seems like a better bet to wait for sure
unless you really want to gear 360 right
who doesn't
Cyril in the chat is really adamant to
find out if there's going to be action
memo I don't even know what that means
there is a new note app I'm trying to
remember like specifically I didn't I
don't recall if I saw action memo but
you should totally watch the video and
look in the air command wheel to see if
it's there there's definitely screen off
memo which is when you can write on the
lock screen basically really cool it's
really cool I love that what is action
memo it was it's like a it's like an
easier way to create a little memo oh
okay I know to yourself there was a new
write a note I samsung has tried to
simplify all of the note apps and the
writing apps it was getting a little
confusing I think action memo is one of
those things that always confused me
because I was gonna use it but in the
air command that's the little like wheel
the menu wheel the navigation menu wheel
for the stylus there is a direct write a
note from there and I thought that was
pretty handy there you go
we got a to party here from lost legacy
they asked how was the latency on the
s-pen and the UI in general and is big
space no pointless I don't know which
one I want to answer first I can't any
answer Bixby first but latency um seemed
really good in my test so far again I
don't have the review unit that's
something that would pop up I that was a
big issue that I noticed when I reviewed
the original Galaxy Note there were all
these issues with writing and I think
that Samsung has really gotten pretty
good they're licensing all of this from
Wacom so it's not all their technology
but they're also creating the software
interface and connection
so that their software will talk to that
pen what about this what about Bixby oh
my okay well there's the Bixby button
Samsung has it exists yeah maybe a theme
in 200 countries now right which it
doesn't speak English right now
English English okay yeah I mean it was
in South Korea and it was in the US yet
launched but it is still very much a
work in progress they said that I think
the figure I got was that there was
uptake of 30% of users in the US I'm not
sure how many of those activations were
on purpose and how much was somebody
pressing the button so I mean the big
thing to remember is that Bixby is not
Siri Bixby is not Google Assistant
Google assistants on the phone Bixby is
the voice analog for everything you can
do tapping the phone right so there are
all these crazy commands that they
showed off but the thing is like all of
those commands are things that you can
do it just has to occur to you either to
do it or to ask for it in that way right
I don't know that I'm a person who has
trained myself to think that way so the
example that they gave yesterday was
like open the camera and take the
picture in food mode so I really like
nested commands I think that was cool
too I think it's really great and what's
exciting about it is what it can mean
for every other digital assistant or
virtual assistant is that once you have
that structure in place there's so much
that you can do I mean imagine using it
the way that you would use Siri or
Google assistant where you're on asking
like a nested command and it totally
understands what you want and then you
can just sort of like
stream-of-consciousness you know go
about it but the problem is that Bixby
is still very limited in that way to
only things that you can do on your
phone so if it's something simple where
you're like oh my hands are full but hey
turn off Wi-Fi or turn on Wi-Fi or
something like that that's actually a
really nice use case or like you know I
use phones all day so like sometimes my
hands get tired and I don't want to use
them right and that's when something
like voice dictation is very useful for
me
so it
useless I mean it doesn't do everything
that it could do and I think that if you
want to take full advantage of it you
kind of have to play around with it and
really invest in all these actors so
that accuracy is is okay it's pretty
accurate for some things but I also just
feel like voice assistance in general
don't always work yeah so sometimes I
don't do them because I'm like wow I've
wasted all this time trying to make it
easier on myself and I didn't the one
thing I will say about Bixby that is
kind of great is that it will get you
halfway there so if it doesn't know like
fully what you're saying you should say
if you say open the camera and take this
in food mode and it messes up you know
but it might open the camera so it's
kind of like Grandma it's the grandma
voice assistant as well and they try and
it's very sweet but sometimes it misses
the mark it's not a good review sounds
like you need to call your grandma it's
there
Samsung is planning on now putting this
into a smart speaker right right so the
goal with Bixby was always that it is
gonna be ecosystem wine so you can
imagine that your washing machine we're
not and so this is a test bed really and
so they're going slow and I think that's
okay in a way you know in a way they
might not really care who uses it on the
phone if the goal is to just start
slowly and kind of not like mangle it so
badly that they have to pull it back and
release all these OTAs and blah blah
blah blah just going back to the the
screen off memo or just the memo and
generally like jot down a to-do list
they will convert it to text really not
on screen off memo I don't think but on
a regular note yes really
I remember the Newton I'm like that I
needed by that but again it's one of
those things where I write in my writing
is so bad that I keep like looking like
to get it right so to get a write to him
and I'll just type it myself all right
we're almost out of time but we want to
get at least one more question and
Matthew Cox has a really good one he
says with this phone shape our case is
practical I think a case is always
necessary yeah especially
I just think if you're gonna invest this
much money in a phone okay like that's
almost a thousand bucks yeah well let's
say it's not let's say that you go
through Samsung's trade-in because you
were known seven owner and you get 425
bucks off right like so it's still an
expensive phone you still want to
preserve the resale value and the
trade-in value if especially well always
I mean if you want to sell it if you
want to pass it on to somebody else like
you never want to go out of your way to
break your phone so I always recommend
the case and I always recommend I'm also
like a butterfingers so cases have saved
my devices I would recommend a case and
I would recommend a screen protector but
at least a case that kind of has a lip
that comes out over the side so that if
it does falls flat first you know
face-first although with the curved
screen how would that even work yeah
Samsung has made cases and all the case
makers have I think that's why I think
that's why he was asking that is what's
the point then the point is protecting
your investment yeah ever nobody's gonna
force you to get a case risk yeah you do
and do you have a crack on the back of
the glass pixel no it's only a matter of
time a while I want to say one more
thing about the colors I'm really sad
that the US doesn't get the maple golden
deep sea blue like an orchid gray its
orchid gray right so it's supposed to be
sort of like purpley vaguely like suede
or something I think it looks like a
brown gray I think it looks a little
money personally I think it's fine so we
got to wrap it up real quick but
elephant in the room is price and one
last question will the price of the SA
or si plus reduced because of the no 8
release and does it come with dual SIM
option I would be very surprised if the
price were to reduce
no the price has gone down for that
state already like you see discounts
everywhere cuz it's been out since
because it's been out for a while let me
finish
I don't know that Samsung will reduce
the retail price but I think that the
retailer is will exactly as Roger said
the carriers are gonna drop it to move
product
I mean they've bought the product like
carriers the stores they've already
bought it they've got it sitting around
so they can do whatever they want with
it so yes I think that will drop
obviously we're gonna see last year's
model drop not the note 7 because nobody
hasn't the note 5 will probably do it
really cheap all of those I've already
dropped but I think that we're gonna
start to see some really competitive
pricing especially if you're patient in
you wait a little while all right I
think it's about where we gotta wrap it
up for the day
all right thanks for already
we blew through this week yeah thank you
a blur like portrait mode I mean live
focus all right if you like to anything
you saw her hurt here check us out on
CNET our podcast is also available on
