little bit
there you go do it again do that again
all right cool that's awesome
hi I'm James Martin senior photographer
for CNET we're here with the iPhone 8
plus we're taking it out to try some of
the features of the new camera but like
last year's iPhone 7 plus the iPhone 8
plus has dual rear cameras a 1.8
aperture standard lens as well as a 2.8
aperture telephoto lens the cameras have
a new sensor that gives both lenses 12
megapixel image quality there I was up
at sunrise at the Golden Gate Bridge
this morning and the color noise in the
dark parts of the photo are noticeably
less there's it's not noisy at all the
colors are really pretty this true tone
colors are even in this kind of like
drab overcast light the colors are
really beautiful I mean it's probably
the biggest thing that I've noticed so
far is portrait lighting is a new
feature on the iPhone 8 plus which uses
the phone's two cameras to create a
depth map of a person's face allowing
you to change the lighting okay so
here's a portrait mode natural light
very nice and studio light
it's like she's lit with another light
it's pretty amazing the contour light
gives her face a little bit more drama a
little more contrast and then the stage
lighting is gonna give us the dramatic
cutout effect the edges are a little
unrefined you can still see the
background and then the stage laid by
the cutting out is still imperfect as I
used a portrait mode stage lighting I
noticed that it worked better when the
background was clear and clean I took a
couple of portraits over the weekend
that are really very dramatic and very
cool a second really interesting is that
editing can all be done after you take
the photo as well I think the lighting
modes are interesting but clearly new
the color of the flash continued to be
like a little problematic for me and you
can see how she looks a little greenish
and a little muddier the bokeh effect on
the iPhone A+ is much better than it
wasn't a 7 that is so cute except you're
blinking when were in the 7 plus it
looked a little bit like a blurred
background and in the iPhone A+ it looks
more like DSLR bokeh that is a good
portrait I've noticed when I'm zooming
the quality of the image degrades far
less on this it seems to me like a big
step forward from the 7 plus it's
getting close to my DSLR I'm really
happy with a lot of these colors and the
textures of the city and nature and the
ocean and there are really some
fantastic photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
