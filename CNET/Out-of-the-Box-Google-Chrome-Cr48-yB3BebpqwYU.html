and today we're taking a look at the
Google Chrome cr-48 laptop running the
Google Chrome OS beta so we've got this
really interesting logo on the box if
you can see it it's got a mouse here
jet engine here and let's see what we've
got inside we've got here a sheet that
tells us how to learn the controls so
here's the laptop in the bag now let's
take it out comes with the battery out
so we're gonna put that in heads down
snaps right in as you can see this isn't
it quite as thin as a MacBook Air but
it's got a really thin form factor very
small very light so as you can see the
laptop boots right up into Google Chrome
it's pretty fancy and instantly it wants
to get started so as you can see the
laptop has an oversized trackpad it's
really quite easy to use very smooth
feeling and the sides of the trackpad
are rubberized which makes it really
easy to rest your wrists on and as you
can also see up here there's a webcam
one interesting thing about the laptop
while it's working is you can see it
doesn't have very many ports all right
so Google Chrome is ready for me to log
in if you have a gmail account already
you can sign in using that information
or down at the bottom you can hit skip
sign in and browse as a guest so from
opening the laptop to loading a website
took about a minute it's extremely fast
process the cr-48 has a 12.1 inch LCD
display it's got Wi-Fi 802 a live-in
it's got a built-in 3G chip from
Qualcomm flash-based storage there's a
webcam as I said the full-size keyboard
is nice even without the caps lock key
there's the oversized touchpad it weighs
just a hair under 4 pounds and Google
says that the battery will give you 8
hours of runtime or 8 days of standby
time
it should take about 10 seconds to boot
up according to Google and we did see
speeds that were pretty close
to that and it's expected to resume
instant leaf when it's sleeping for more
