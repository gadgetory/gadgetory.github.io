saw in sci-fi movies
well maybe I'm the only one old enough
to actually remember that but thankfully
it's not a fantasy it's real and now we
can video chat with multiple people
completely free of charge first probably
the best way to get a group chat session
going is they use a service like Skype
now you will need either a PC a Mac or
an Xbox one to get into a group chat
just make sure you have the latest
version of Skype installed will show you
how to do this on both a PC and a Mac
open Skype and sign in on a Mac select
File then a new conversation then start
typing the names of the contacts you
want to add to the call and then click
on each one when you're ready to start a
video call click the arrow next to the
call button and choose a video as
participant to answer the call they'll
be added to the group chat on skype
gonna have three to ten people in a
group chat tap more members just click
the plus button and add new names as you
did before
however for performance sake it's best
not to go over five if using a PC once
you're signed in just select the create
a group icon from the contact list just
drag the contacts you'd like to add to
the group conversation into the
highlighted area then click video call
just reminder you can't use your smart
phone if you want to get into a group
chat on skype at least not right now if
you do want to use your smart phone to
get into a group chat you can use Google
Hangouts however that requires a Google
account now on Google Plus start a new
hangout click on the names you want to
add and then click the video icon
now you can add up to nine names to
start your group video chat session
however for performance sake it's best
not to max it up on your Android phone
tap the plus button add the names to
start a session then tap the video icon
there are other free apps that allow you
to do group conferencing but these two
are not only the easiest to get up and
running with but because of the
popularity of Skype and Gmail they're
probably the ones your friends and
colleagues will most likely already have
a count sport group chat is a great way
to communicate with your friends conduct
interviews and catch up with your
relatives now did you know how to use it
you have no excuse have your mom watch
this video and then start calling her
every week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
