to 3500
but this 2015 GMC Sierra 2500 HD
is no middleweight and with this Denali
trim I've got a near luxury cab with
navigation a boatload of charging ports
and even driver assistance features that
keep me from running over houses if you
get a GMC Sierra 2500 HD with a gasoline
engine but I've got the Duramax diesel
6.6 liter turbocharged v8 in this truck
and with the six-speed automatic
transmission that makes 397 horsepower
and 765 pound-feet of torque that's a
lot of twist at the wheels but it's more
about pulling power than it is about
screeching the tires off the line and
get this this Kanto 13,000 pounds that's
for adult Buffalo or 65 Donald Trump's
the six and a half foot bed behind the
crew cab can also carry about 2,500
pounds but that's only 12 Donald Trump's
before you ask about fuel economy know
that GMC doesn't have to post standard
passenger vehicle numbers for this CR
2500 HD that's because at over 10,000
pounds gross vehicle weight this
qualifies is a heavy duty truck and is
therefore exempt that said with this
diesel engine I was getting about 17
miles per gallon on the highway with
rear leaf springs and body-on-frame
construction CR 2500 HD balances over
the bumps but that ride quality will
change quite a bit when you load it down
they'll probably change a lot more after
fifty or hundred thousand miles as
everything breaks in this example has
four wheel drive and I can switch
between
two-wheel four-wheel high and four-wheel
low with this dial on the dashboard here
and - we'll grab it will get better fuel
economy and in four-wheel drive I notice
the steering binds a bit at lock losing
power and limiting maneuverability
because the Sierra 2500 HD with crew cab
and six and a half foot bed is almost
long and six and a half feet high at the
roofline manoeuvrability can't be tough
help me out I've got a backup camera and
I've got rear and front sonar distance
warnings that's all pretty good but I
prefer a surround view camera system for
driver assists on the road I've got
front collision warning and lane
departure warning and this uses GM's
safety seat which actually buzzes my but
it's hard to ignore that instead of a
blind spot monitoring system I have
these huge mirrors with two parts here a
bubble in the bottom and a flat mirror
on top that's good for trailering but it
is a bit old-school because this is the
Denali version I've got GM's IntelliLink
system here on an 8 inch touch screen in
the dashboard this icon base screen is
pretty easy to understand and it's
responsive to the touch for navigation
the maps show good detail and I've got
live traffic one thing I really like
about this system is it'll warn me about
traffic problems on the road ahead even
if I don't have a destination programmed
in OnStar comes standard with all its
roadside crash and stolen vehicle
assistance features and that also means
a 4G data pipe and a Wi-Fi hotspot I'd
like to see GM do more with that big
data pipe like have online destination
search for navigation but that Wi-Fi
hotspot will come in handy for powering
laptops and tablets on job sites to
power any electronics I bring into the
car I've got three USB ports I've also
got two other USB ports in the console
I've got three 12-volt power points and
a grounded AC outlet there's plenty of
power in this truck and also plenty of
power under the hood
all right let's price out our 2015 GMC
Sierra 2500 Denali HD base price is
fifty four thousand five hundred forty
five dollars and that's with the crew
cab and navigation now we add thirty two
hundred dollars to get four wheel drive
and another eight thousand eight hundred
and forty five dollars to get the
Duramax plus package that gives us the
diesel engine and driver assistance
features total sixty six thousand five
hundred ninety dollars the GMC Sierra
2500 HD is obviously a work truck it's
not something you're gonna want to drive
around parking garages on the weekend
that said there's some nice features
here like the navigation a 4G Wi-Fi
hotspot and the collision avoidance
system I would like to see a surround
view camera system here but that diesel
engine is also good for fuel economy and
pulling power
