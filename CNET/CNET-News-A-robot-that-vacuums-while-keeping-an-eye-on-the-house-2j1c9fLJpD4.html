for anyone to turn their home into a
smart home most popular uses are things
like pizza mine so watching over your
home from wherever you are on your phone
or saving sort of automatically turning
things on or off when you come and go or
lots of little life conveniences we've
got more than 7,000 devices have been
integrated with the platform more than
12,000 apps of different sorts the house
can automatically know when I arrived
home and it could do that based on
knowledge of my presence from this
wearable device so even without my phone
like can know that I'm I'm arriving home
can unlock the door automatically the
kitchen is the heart of a lot of homes
and so smart things can connect to all
of the appliances and a lot of things
that might happen in the kitchen the
Samsung refrigerators integrated into
smart things and so it can know very
simple things like the smart things can
know if the refrigerator is open or shut
or what the temperature is the
refrigerator can act as a notification
center so if something's happening in
the house like the laundry is done it'll
let you know somebody at the front door
and then other things like you can
receive a phone call you know without
getting your phone out of the plot of
your pocket and receive it right here on
the fridge so another example of going
deeper into the smart home is connection
to the common appliances like the like
the washer and so you know this is it is
those things that related to convenience
and savings so maybe you want to
automatically have it run when your
leave the house for the day so it's not
running when you're there or another
examples this has got a reservoir and it
where you pour all the detergent and it
only it'll automatically meters it out
and they'll send you a notification when
you need more once a month or something
like that so another fun use cases
things like even like a robotic vacuum
being integrated with the platform and
so this could of course do the little
things like you know clean up when you
leave the house this is got an
integrated camera and microphones and
can move around the house so maybe
instead of just being a vacuum it might
be a roaming security device for a
couple hundred dollars somebody can
outfit their home and if common things
go wrong whether it's security and
they're away from home or like moisture
or smoke or a kid not getting home from
school they can know about that from
anywhere
