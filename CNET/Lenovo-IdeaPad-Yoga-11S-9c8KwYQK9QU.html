a first look at the Lenovo IdeaPad yoga
11s this is a laptop you've actually
been waiting for for a long time when
Windows 8 first came out we had the yoga
13 and that was actually pretty popular
for that first generation of Windows 8
laptop tablet hybrids Lenovo also made a
smaller 11 inch version of the yoga mat
that had Windows RT I really nobody
wants that everyone was waiting for the
Windows 8 version of it and now it's
finally here and I'm going to show you
why it's called the yoga looks like a
fairly standard ultra portable 11 inch
laptop but then you can take the lid and
tilt it back like this and then you can
keep going and you end up with first
sort of a kiosk mode that's what I kind
of call this where you want to display
something you can also hold it as like a
tabletop sort of cut and I don't really
feel that's terribly useful but you can
take it all the way back like this and
now you've got a touchscreen Windows 8
tablet it's a little thick for a tablet
and you've still got this keyboard here
on the back which is a little weird but
it turns off the keyboard and the touch
pad when you start folding it so at
least the stuff is is deactivated while
you're messing around with it a little
bit thick and heavy for a tablet but I
like it unlike a lot of other windows 8
hybrids and there you can see you can
just flip it right back into laptop mode
it this system knows it's a laptop first
and doesn't compromise that clamshell
form factor it gives you all the tablet
and kiosk stuff it's sort of an extra
now there are a lot of other 11 inch
laptops coming out right now it's an
oddly popular size you get Sony's vaio
11 you've got the new revamped 11 inch
MacBook Air if you want something that
has a touchscreen and converts into a
tablet this is still one of my favorites
in this size the one caveat is even
though it's very reasonably priced eight
hundred nine hundred dollars depending
on the configuration you're stuck with
the last generation of Intel processors
for right now if they added the new
fourth-generation they call those
Haswell chips you'd see a huge jump in
battery life and now we'd make this a
much more appealing system I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Lenovo IdeaPad
