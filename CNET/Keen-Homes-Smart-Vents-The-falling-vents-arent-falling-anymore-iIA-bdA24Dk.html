vents poor connectivity made features
borderline untestable and a design flaw
made installing them in the ceiling
dangerous but now thanks to solutions to
both of those problems these $80 smart
vents are back for round two Keene
system has a couple big upgrades first
off the app is still streamlined but
also helpful and responsive when I had
problems connecting with one of my vents
within a few minutes a little pop-up
noticed two problems and offered
troubleshooting advice I also like the
relatively low price prevent while 80
bucks per unit will add up it's not
nearly the expense of installing say
smart shades one thing I don't like is
the difficult ceiling installations
which require fiddling with small pieces
to make sure that the vents don't fall
out anymore but the idea of smart vents
that you can integrate them with a smart
thermostat and that they help your HVAC
system heat and cool your home more
effectively is cool for instance with
Keene when you adjust the vent in one
room to help warm air reach it better
vents in other rooms automatically
adjust to divert air but without
temperature sensors in each room there's
no temperature responsive automation
although this may be solved with the
coming partnership with ecobee after all
these upgrades the system is much
improved its stylish design and winning
app are no longer overshadowed by
product breaking flaws instead the vents
are just solid products with room to
improve regarding automation so if you
have a compatible thermostat or an
interest in smart home climate control
then Keene home smart runs are
definitely worth considering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
