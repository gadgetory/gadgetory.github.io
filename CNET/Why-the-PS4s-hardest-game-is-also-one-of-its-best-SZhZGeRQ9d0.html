Bakalar and if I look a little weird
it's because I haven't slept in about
thirty hours and too busy playing
blood-borne it's one of the most
infuriating unforgiving relentless games
I've ever played but it's awesome to
help me talk more about the game I'm
joined by GameSpot senior editor
Kevin vanore thank you for joining me
today sir
oh it's my pleasure thanks for inviting
me so when I talk about me being crazy
about blood-borne it's a lot of people
have come to me said hey Jeff this game
is too hard I can't play this game what
do you have to say to those people it
introduced what blood-borne is to those
people and why Lord blood-borne is a
third-person action RPG that's built in
a way in which you are supposed to die
over and over in order to learn its
patterns in order to learn how to
progress and so there's a lot of risk
and moving forward into new areas but
there's also a lot of reward and doing
so but it is it is quite hard one hit
from an enemy can take off a huge chunk
of your life or as I found out the hard
way kill you entirely with one shot oh
yeah that's that's absolutely true
depending on the enemy you're facing so
I guess for me you know I have a tough
time explaining to someone who's a
casual game or who even maybe there was
someone who's a seasoned gamer who plays
a couple new titles a month and then
they jump into something like
blood-borne and it rips their their legs
off essentially how do you sort of give
someone a tempered expectation about
what they can experience in the game for
me I sort of say look this is a game
that honors the the you know traditional
sort of difficulty that the games of
yesteryear used to use to possess but
now you know it's this sort of
contemporary Flair if you will that that
blood-borne in some of the games made
made by these guys in the past I've been
able to achieve how do you how do you
all wrap it up I mean the important
thing to note I think is that it's
always fair
you'll see speedruns of of this game and
games like Dark Souls from you know from
from people that can get through the
entire game without ever levelling up
using their using the starting weapon so
it's important to note that you always
have the tools to win you know it's its
little stuff like learning how much
space to put between you and the enemy
or or how much you know how much
distance the enemy can cover between you
and him so you know you always have the
tools to succeed but it's it's all about
not so much a reward from moment to
moment but like the tension leading to
that moment and then getting the
incredible reward when you finally when
you're finally victorious against a huge
giant monster the likes of which you've
probably never seen yeah that's a big
thing for me
I've played about a little over 20 hours
of blood-borne and after I got through
that first boss it took me about 11
times or so and which I feel like is is
good right yeah a clear beast is that
the one you're talking about
yeah the Clerc beast real ugly viewed
and you know I I just I you know I got
to the point where I had done it and
then I was like wow I'm nowhere near any
level of progression in this game at all
for me it's it's it's it's tough to have
someone wrap their heads around that
this is gonna be a game you have to do
your homework on that you have to commit
on a level that you've never committed
maybe not just a game but in life -
anything like this before and I think
for me it's that barrier to entry that
is such a turn-off and I think with
blood-borne you get this sort of weird
juxtaposition where you know this is a
game that's being advertised on a
mainstream level it comes off as this
you know easily accessible maybe
actually almost like a /m up sort of
game but then you know you you look at
it from the other end
alright you you paid your $60 you boot
up blood-borne and you are just pounded
relentlessly for me that's that's the
internal conflict that I experienced
with this game what do you think about
that well I understand that I you know
I'm coming from a place where I play
all of the games that sort of led to
blood-borne which are Demon Souls Dark
Souls and Dark Souls - and then you you
have to kind of let the game teach you
how to play video games all over again
because all of the things that you bring
to it that you've sort of filled your
mind with and sort of wrapped your
fingers around that the stuff doesn't
work anymore
yeah and so you have to kind of you know
like let the game speak to you and sort
of look at the intricacies and and and
sort of forget all of the things that
you brought to the game and you still
are not told and anything about the game
you're not told what to do you're not
told where to go how do you feel about
that angle to the whole experience well
I finished all on my own and and in
about 60 hours so but I get bit again
it's important to note that I come in
with a with a pretty rich experience
with all the games that came up to it so
forth so I so I knew more or less how it
was gonna work for me I'm curious about
blood-borne popularity I don't know if
you've been messing around on Twitter
today it's been trending for almost 15
hours what's going on this none of these
games have ever gotten this public sort
of groundswell why do you think
blood-borne is getting that treatment
people I mean people love it and and
part of it is that it's it's still
fairly singular I mean I mean it does
come from a tradition that that I sort
of started with Demon Souls and went to
Dark Souls so but it's not really a
tradition that's made its way into other
mainstream games and I think there's
another part of it too which is you're
you're talking about a console exclusive
you're talking about something that's
only on the PlayStation 4 and by very
nature I mean I mean you know how it
goes in in the world of system wars and
things like that sure people really care
about their system exclusives and I I
think those those two things combined
especially when this is the first game
from from software that's the the
developer of blood-borne and and Dark
Souls and those other games I mentioned
this is the first one that takes it into
a new
somatic territory so the other games
were were all they were all you know
dark medieval fantasy and this takes
place in sort of a more there's sort of
a more Victorian London semi steampunk
vibe to it
sure and so you know be you you've got
that formula but you've taken it to a
new place and there are enough tweaks to
it to make it seem legitimately
different from from the games that led
to it
III read your review you obviously liked
it a lot is there anything that you
would sort of knock against it oh yeah
I mean one of those things is one of the
the new things to this series of games
is something called chalice dungeons so
these are sort of standalone
procedurally generated dungeons that you
can create by performing a particular
ritual within the game and they're
they're a little problematic and if you
don't keep up with them as you play
through the the main storyline you can
end up running into some problems
because they don't scale to the
difficulty so you might have to go back
and play a whole bunch of really easy
dungeons and when something's really
easy in blood-borne it's honestly not
all that much fun because it takes the
tension out of the game and the game
thrives on tension so without that you
sort of miss out plus the glitches and
and I will say that it's been a while
since I played a game with loading
screens this long as a game it's amazing
as a piece of software maybe not quite
so much sure yeah I found the loading
times to be a little suspicious as well
sounds like they're working on it but
we'll have to wait and see how the dust
settles and hopefully that improves
Kevin Van Ord ladies and gentlemen

pleasure that's gonna do it for me make
