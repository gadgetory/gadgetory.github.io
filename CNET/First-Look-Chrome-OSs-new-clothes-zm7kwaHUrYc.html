the mantra of many a tech project and
Google's Chrome OS is no different
hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt frissina and
today we're taking a first look at
Chrome OS as new desktop and new
features this is the new default desktop
for Chrome OS you have apps pinned here
Chrome itself
Gmail Google search YouTube and your
apps these are not the default apps
these are apps that I have added and
synchronized when you jump into Chrome
you get the browser apps here over on
this side you have obviously your time
and your profile which you can then use
to reveal settings shut down sign out
lock date internet connection
Bluetooth status keyboard status sound
brightness settings and help which open
like everything else in a chrome tab
here you have your browsing history
extensions and settings you can pin apps
to the desktop as you can in Windows 7
pin to launcher and there is IMO chat in
any Chrome browser if you go to the
wrench and go to about Chrome OS you can
see the version of Chrome OS that you're
running and the channel that you're on
Chrome OS updates fairly regularly and
the updates will make legacy hardware
work better over time the new Chrome OS
supports a wide range of files including
docx docx PowerPoint PDF spreadsheet and
zip files still Chrome OS is really
meant for those people who love their
Google accounts Google sync carries
things like apps autofill bookmarks
extensions history passwords settings
themes and even open tab
if you're worried about security you can
choose a two-factor authentication you
can print in Chrome OS to using either a
local printer or print to your local
FedEx office the past years worth of
updates to Google's Chrome OS have made
it much more viable as an operating
system that you can live with day in and
day out however it's still extremely
tied to Google's ecosystem and so it's
really for those people who just cannot
live without the Google with a first
look at Google's new Chrome OS I'm Seth
