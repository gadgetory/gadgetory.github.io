soon be a thing of the past I'm Bridget
Carey this is your scene that update if
you can't stand getting candy crush game
invites on facebook you may not have to
put up with it for much longer facebook
founder mark zuckerberg pledged to put
an end to those annoying game invites
that pop up in your notifications when
your friends pester you to join a game
and one of the most frequent offenders
is of course candy crush the game was
specifically mentioned during a
question-and-answer session that
zuckerberg held in india in an online
thread the top voted question for
zuckerberg was if there was a way to
stop candy crush invites zuckerberg told
the audience that the network is coming
up with a way to shut off invites you
know we hadn't prioritized shutting that
down because we just had other
priorities but if this is the top thing
that people care about then we'll
prioritize that and we'll do it so we're
doing it now that's tasty if you wonder
why you get so many invites it's because
the incentive is tied into how the game
works when you run out of lives the game
will not let you continue playing until
you wait about 15 minutes or you can
play right away by inviting your friends
on Facebook and there's another feature
Facebook is killing off in your message
inbox the other folder is being removed
now when someone you don't know tries to
message you it's going to go to your
main inbox as a message request you can
open it to see a description of who is
messaging you and they won't know you
read the message until you reply
facebook says they won't live spam
messages get through and let's hope
that's the case I also hope Facebook as
some settings to stop people you don't
know from flooding your main inbox
because that can be creepy the other
folder was something you could only see
when you logged in from the web not in
the app also in messaging news skype is
adding filters to its video but it's not
video calls just the video messages on
the app which are short recorded clips
you can send in a chat there are ghosts
hearts balloons general weird stuff
earlier this month skype also added new
animated emojis and video snippets from
the bcc Universal and the Muppets to
spice up
conversation Skype is playing catch-up
to other messaging apps that already
offer silly ways to message friends and
as for google it's adding a feature to
its music service that feels long
overdue google play music is adding
podcasts along with being able to search
and subscribe to a podcast show the app
is going to recommend a podcast based on
your mood or interests it's not
available yet but yes you'll soon be
able to subscribe to see that update
podcast through google groovy that's it
for this tech news update and there's
more at sina com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey divine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
