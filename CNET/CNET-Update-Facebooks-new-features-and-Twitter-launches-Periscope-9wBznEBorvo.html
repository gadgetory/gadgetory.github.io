twitter is going after meerkat I'm japal
are in for Bridget Carey today and this
is your cnet update Facebook's FA
developer conference shed some light on
some new Facebook features that won't
just impact the site domestically the
announcements include opening up the
messenger platform for developers a
major upgrade to the Facebook commenting
system that will provide real-time
syncing across different sites also
Facebook videos will now be in bed ilan
external sites and the player will
support 360 degree 3d spherical videos
likely the first product of the oculus
acquisition Facebook will also launch
something called sparse which is an
Internet of Things platform that'll let
developers use Facebook data to interact
with smart products around your house
watch out meerkat there's a new live
streaming app that's hunting for your
furry little but periscope does exactly
what meerkat did when it first debuted a
few weeks ago but periscope has the
support and backing from Twitter in
addition to letting users livestream
anything they want scope lets viewers
comment and show their approval by
superimposing hearts on the feed that's
cool hearts what's more these feeds can
be replayed for up to 24 hours and
streamers have the option to limit their
viewing audience to whomever they choose
which app will win the live streaming
Wars we're not sure just yet but I'll
tell you who the losers are it's you and
me with an android phone because these
apps well they only work with iOS for
now that kind of sucks the samsung
galaxy s6 goes on sale april 10th but
we've got our review in progress posted
today right here on cnet our reviewer
Jessica dull Court praises the s6 for
its smooth glass and metal body though I
mean let's be honest this thing looks
just like an iphone right now but she
also liked the improved fingerprint
scanner and camera shortcut button but
the phone's non-removable battery and an
absence of an expandable storage slot
has this kind of bummed out and
finally just a little bit of pop geek
news the ultra-popular 80s nostalgic
Willy Wonka meets the matrix novel ready
player one will be reportedly directed
by Steven Spielberg the novel follows a
young man in the year twenty forty four
who must make his way through a virtual
world called the Oasis after an Easter
egg hunt is started by that world's
creator now if you haven't already read
the book it's definitely going to take
you back especially if you were born
before 1990 okay that's it that's your
news update for today be sure to follow
me on twitter and you can stay updated

studios here in New York i'm jeff bag
