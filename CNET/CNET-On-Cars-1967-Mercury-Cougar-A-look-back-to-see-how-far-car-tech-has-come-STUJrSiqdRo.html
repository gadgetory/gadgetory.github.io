appreciate the cars of the presence
explain why it takes so long to get warm
on a cold morning and run down the
hottest-selling Eevee's it's time to
check the town pc cars differently she
loved them on the road and under the
hood but also check the tech and are
known for telling it like it is ugly is
included at no extra cost the good the
bad the bottom line this is C net on
cars
welcome to see that on cars a show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis we bring you nearly a
hundred of the latest modern high-tech
cars every year here at c net and to be
honest it's kind of easy to take for
granted how far vehicles have come in
terms of power convenience reliability
and safety what if this show had been
around back in 1967 and the mercury sent
us something to review how different
would things of that
motor trends Car of the Year 467 the
back let's see how lincoln-mercury
pronounces Mustang as we drive the
all-new Mercury Cougar I check the tech
well Mercury's finally got their Pony
car and yes based very much on the
mechanicals of the Mustang but you're
never gonna mistake the two on the road
in fact the Cougar and the Mustangs
share no sheetmetal they have a
different wheelbase as well
this guy's 111 inch axle 2 axle the
Mustang is 3 inches shorter cougar
devotes its extra length to longer more
compliant leaf springs and a little more
room for the legs in the back other
unique identifiers are of course that
cougar face what people are already
calling the electric shaver front end
with standard hidden headlights
sequential taillights in the back are
standard as well
and Ford's offering an electric sunroof
on Cougars the first they've ever
installed from the factory inside all
Cougars is a sporting european-style
cockpit you've got a three spoke sport
wheel this by the way has collapsible
impact technology as well as a padded
center hub for safety on the left is
your speedometer in the main pod on the
right the other main pod has not only a
fuel gauge but also a temperature gauge
and an oil pressure and amp light the
center clock is optional climate control
includes heaters standard you can delete
that if you like air conditioning is
optional the turn signal if you order a
speed control is going to have a knob on
the end of it to actuate and disable it
now the entertainment options your entry
level rig is going to be an AM radio
with full transistorized chassis and
five preset buttons step up from there
with an AM stereo tape all integral or
go-to AM and FM radio but then you lose
the tape
clever little storage bin down here with
a rollup kind of chrome piano top
now most Cougars are going to ship with
a c3 automatic it's a three-speed
automatic plus reverse with a chrome
t-handle shifter right here there's also
a three on the tree manual it's gonna be
pretty rare in the middle is going to be
the four-speed four on the floor manual
gearbox now the xr7 which we don't have
here would add gauges across the center
of the dash here you'll also get some
toggle switches a roof console leather
and vinyl upholstery we have all vinyl
in this vehicle now speaking of safety
the 67 cougar also has a full padded -
padded pillar over here and a breakaway
rear view mirror headrests remain
optional however in that same place you
might instead choose to hang a
television from the dealer you can get a
9 inch black and white fill khou-tv with
custom made hooks that hang right over
the back of the seat for your rear seat
passengers seat belt includes a tongue
side retractor standard on all four
positions around the car
another big differentiator between
cougar and Mustang lies under the hood
these guys do not come with any kind of
a6 they're all v8 the most popular is
gonna be this one here the 289 two
barrel
good for 200 horsepower 282 foot-pounds
of torque 0 to 60 according to motor
trend is about 11 seconds for a car that
weighs a tick over 3,000 pounds observed
mpg just under 16 you can also get this
engine with a dual exhaust a four-barrel
carb and a nine point eight to one
compression ratio and that gives you 225
horsepower or just go all the way with a
390 cubic inch engine in the cougar GT
that's good for 320 horse
lincoln-mercury is not kidding when they
say this car has some of that Lincoln
fine car touch maybe good marketing copy
but it's actually relatively true and
quite a bit quieter car in general it
comes out to be a more sedate sounding
and a little less hotly sprung Mustang
that also means high marks for the base
engine this 289 - barrel is a willing
runner you really feel that hefty bias
toward torque at 282 pounds and because
we have the optional a added
dealer-installed Shelby style exhaust we
get a good note
the only sour note in our car is the
fact that we do not have the optional
power disc brakes
we have unassisted four-wheel drums
there adequate but coming down a road of
uneven pavement and having to make a
relatively hard stop you need to hang on
and try and guess which way it's gonna
pull okay let's price our Cougar the
base car as I mentioned has a v8 - 289 -
barrel and configured thusly we're just
under three thousand dollars now come a
number of options emission controls are
50 dollars and 64 cents our automatic
transmission just under two hundred and
seven dollars power steering 95 that
sports consoles fifty-seven dollars we
have the AM radio at 60 bucks but I'm
intrigued by the AM stereo sonic tape at
180 850 more of that European sports car
look for just 84 dollars that gets you
the vinyl Oxford roof all in our test
car with some of those features but not
all of them is 36 50 and change
the Cougar lies somewhere between
Mustang and Thunderbird it brings a more
compliant ride and also a quieter ride
thanks to over a hundred pounds more
sound deadening than a Mustang it fits
somewhere in the range of the person who
wants more of a GT than a sports car
with that European touch
oh by the way for another interesting
look at how different the automotive
landscape is from 4050 years ago head
over to see net on cars comm and check
our show notes links for the federal
motor vehicle safety standards this is
the Bible the federal government puts
out that basically tells car makers what
they can and can't do when they design
and build cars it's very interesting to
peruse here in the US we take for
granted things like government crash
test ratings and independent testing and
ratings from groups like the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety
but those watchdogs aren't on duty
everywhere that's coming up when CNET on
cars continues
it's been years since you could buy a
new car in the US without stability
control dual front airbags have been
required on cars here since 96 and yet
there are places in the world right now
where new 2015's are rolling out of the
showroom without a single airbag or
stability control or even much of a body
structure look at how this Indian market
Datsun go fails in a crash test the main
impact absorbing structure seems to be
the driver the Dacia Sandero sold in
Europe gets a four star rating a version
sold in Brazil last model gear got a 1
star rating as you can imagine they
improved it after that because nothing
chases dangerous cars out of the
marketplace faster than miserable crash
rating but who is minding the store
globally enter global endcap global new
car assessment program the idea is to
stitch together crash testing programs
in different regions around the world
into one global standard to get auto
makers to basically have no excuse for
offering less safe cars Europe already
has Euro endcap Australia and New
Zealand have n cap there's latin end cap
china's CN cap and Bharat end cap under
consideration in India but a true global
standard will be sought at a major auto
safety conference in Brazil this
November when the UN will push for
global end cap that means all cars
worldwide would have common passenger
cell strength standards common
pedestrian impact protection standards
and electronic stability control of
course the big problem here is cost that
Datsun go we saw earlier cost like 60
100 bucks a Tata Nano is under three
thousand some of the safety gear in
American cars cost more than that
nevermind the price of the car so we'll
watch with keen interest how they sort
out that her
approach that cost gap at the conference
in Brazil in the meantime whatever you
drive it pays to double-check that it's
got good crash test safety ratings
welcome back to CNN on cars coming to
you from our home at the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge blind spot technology whether
it's passive beeps and lights or even
active avoidance of someone over your
shoulder you don't see is becoming
pretty common in cars but we're not done
yet our blind spot tech works and the
way that it should work make for an
interesting car Tech 101 blind spot
detection systems use sensors that
monitor nearby lanes and determine when
other vehicles approach or enter a
vehicle's blind spot blind spot check is
getting pretty common in fact about
three-quarters of all new cars in the
2014 model year at least offered it
blind spot technology typically uses
radar in the 24 gigahertz or 76
gigahertz bands then they report back to
you with either upbeat or a buzz or or
some kind of a chime or a light going
off somewhere any number of manners to
tell you don't go there but a bit of
buzzkill has arisen as groups like the
triple-a and highway loss data Institute
have found that blind spot tech is good
but certainly not perfect sometimes
warnings come too late
fast closing vehicles may be missed and
all those buzzes dings and lights it
generates are starting to all sound like
other systems
so here are some technologies coming to
get us to blind-spot 2.0 Infiniti and
Mercedes are among pioneers in active
blind-spot technology it guides your car
back from a misguided lane change that
would put you into a car in your blind
spot and likely does so faster than you
could even sort out what's flashing and
pinging and why Blind Spot Assist can
take active measures by applying the
brakes on the wheels on the opposite
side of the vehicle
the vehicle is steered out of the danger
zone Subarus lane change assist is a
derivative of blind spot tech that warns
you if a car is coming up from the rear
side at a rate that would result in both
of you being in the same place at the
same time as you change lanes
if you switch lanes or signal to change
lanes and lane change assist senses that
the approaching vehicle is still there
it gives you a flashing warning to
further alert you to the vehicles
presence further out Jaguar Land Rover
is working on a concept of putting
display technology in a car's b-pillars
making them virtually transparent so you
can see over there where a car alongside
might otherwise hide now all car makers
buy their blind spot equipment the
hardware they put in their cars from one
of the same handful of suppliers so it's
not different at that level but the car
maker customizes how sensitive it is and
how it alerts you all right so three
things to look for in that respect how
visible are the lights or how audible
are the indicators how they choose to
alert you big lights or little I see
little tiny indicators on this
Volkswagen virtually useless some other
cars put huge ones here in the a-pillar
others will give you tones or beeps
others will actually vibrate the wheel
where are those lights position are they
in a place that naturally makes you
think blind spot issue you want to find
one that you feel is going to be
effective for you and how is the blind
spot tech calibrated on the given make
and model of car it varies test drive
the car does it seem to pick up a car
that you really miss or is it warning
you about cars that you would obviously
see I've seen both out there
interesting sidenote a paper published
by the Society of Automotive Engineers
back in 1995 said that if you adjust
your side mirrors out further so they
are pitched out form you actually would
eliminate the blind spot have them this
paper says just barely overlap the view
you have in your rear-view mirror most
of us tilt in our side mirrors a lot so
we can see our own car this paper says
don't worry about that kick them out and
you'll actually see everything and on
many late-model cars you probably notice
the increasing prevalence of these
wide-angle regions out toward the far
ends of the mirror glass that's also
aimed at helping to eliminate the blind
spot wherever you've got the mirror
pointed in a moment the hottest-selling
cars that don't have an engine when CNET
on cars continues
you
sometimes you don't need to climb a
mountain you don't need a massive car
and you don't need up the most exquisite
luxury sometimes you need a motor that
you know will hack a field or two so you
don't mind getting muddy that's
practical and Land Rover has made just
that car buy more from the ex car team

welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian coolie that point in the show we
take one of your emails this one comes
in from I'm on in North Dakota he writes
in that he lives in one of the coldest
states in the US that's for sure
driving here he says comes with a lot of
challenges but there's one that I think
can be overcome easily by car
manufacturers a cold interior why do I
have to wait twenty minutes he asked in
a freezing cold car before any hot air
starts coming out of the vents well I'm
on this is one of the longest held
irritations in modern motoring and it's
been this way for decades here's why
this thing this is called the heater
core this is the essential piece of your
car's heater it lives up underneath the
dash and it gets hot because coolant
from the running engine goes in and out
of these pipes does the same coolant
that keeps the engine from overheating
this coolant makes this coil warm air is
blown across it and that heats up your
cabin the problem is until the engines
warm
there's no hot coolant to send to this
thing that's the delay you're
experiencing and the colder the outside
temperature the longer the warm up for
the engine as well
this kind of system dates back to the
late 30s by the way when it was first
developed by a car maker called Nash and
an appliance maker called Kelvinator so
if this resembles a bit the coils in the
back of your fridge that's not really a
coincidence and to make matters worse
many modern engines are designed to keep
their heat to themselves when they're
warming up that way they get their oil
and lubricants working faster and they
also hit their clean emissions
temperature sooner then they start to
send coolant out to the heater so that's
not in your favor either now electric
cars are a whole different situation
there's no combustion engine so there's
no hot coolant so there's nothing to
come into something like this instead
Eevee's use what is kind of like the
heater you might have under your desk at
work
hot coils heated by electrical current
that is going into resistance and then
you blow air across it and there's your
heat great idea but that's not easy to
do in a typical combustion engine car
because it's a whole nother system it
adds cost it would need a more robust
battery heavier gauge wiring very likely
a change to a different voltage system
we use 12 volts in cars today that's not
really ideal for doing a resistance
electrical heater system so none of
that's going
happen so it sounds like you need to
basically be cold in your car for a few
minutes especially in your chilly
winters or look at adding an aftermarket
remote start kit to your car it'll give
you a new key fob that will start your
car as long as it's an automatic and
it's in park and within range while
you're still in your nice warm home give
it a few minutes by the time you go out
there and it's all nice and toasty
that's the biggest allure of remote
start tech and a lot of modern cars have
it on their standard but if you don't
you can graft it on for a few hundred
bucks you can also use an engine block
heater that it's mostly intended to make
the engine easier to start but it can
aid cabin heat up time a bit as well in
our last episode we took a look at the
top rated CNET cars from all of 2014 now
we're going to go look at a little
different slice of that picture here are
the top five best selling electric cars
in the market right now
we're gonna rank these guys by their
2014 u.s. full-year sales numbers which
by the way amounted to about one and a
half percent of all non truck vehicle
sales in 2014 and only about a half a
percent of all new vehicle sales
globally in the same year let's go
number five the Ford Fusion Energi
plug-in 11,000 copies or so were sold 19
miles on electric charge and overall 88
mpge
now to most eyes this is the
best-looking car in the affordable
electric world but note it's a plug-in
not a pure battery car now the Focus
Electric which is pure battery from Ford
would come in a week eighth on our list
after the smart electric car that has to
hurt number four is Toyota's Prius
plug-in little over 13,000 sold to six
miles on a charge but 95 MPGe now the
standard Prius that remains the
undisputed king of hybrids but this
plug-in variant makes a list of V's but
just barely in terms of sales kind of
measly evie range that battery does give
it killer MPGe
although it's gas MPG is about the same
as the regular prius so there's a whole
lot of myth here no wonder it lags for
and no wonder Toyota is in hot pursuit
of hydrogen right now as its encore for
the Prius number three the Tesla Model S
little over 17,000 sold
265 miles of range is the big boy in the
list eighty nine mpge
from that the most lauded car on our
list pure battery of course the highest
range as well if you have the money and
want a pure battery electric car this is
your benchmark it's also the only Eevee
from a company whose entire existence
rides on EVs going big so all eyes are
now on the launch of the more affordable
Falcon wing dork Ross / Model X later
this year
that will make the company more than a
one-note tune for the first time in a
number of years
number two the Chevy Volt little under
19,000 sold
gets 38 miles on a charge ninety-eight
MPGe
and it is of course not a pure battery
car but also a plug-in hybrid of the
range extender class with a gas engine
that is largely just used as a generator
yeah it's a bit of a complicated story
to tell even recent volt TV commercials
seem to admit that but these were
electric yes it's a Chevy Volt what are
you doing at a gas station the new model
we just saw unveiled in Detroit is going
to arrive soon with sleeker looks and
now a 50 mile electric range on a charge
before we hit number one the EVs that
sell so slowly you wonder why they're
sold at all include Porsches Panamera S
II at least if you buy a Tesla 100,000
gets you an actual electric car this
just gets you a hybrid and not the one
you're wealthy greeni friends are
impressed by fewer than 900 last year
Honda's a corne plug-in and fit evie
both around a measly 400 units sold each
year what can I say
Honda has never been great at selling
anything electrified and the Mitsubishi
I mean I forgot they still sold this
thing in the US at 196 total units for
the year apparently you get as well it
looks like a prop from Caddyshack not a
real car and that doesn't really fly in
the US the number one Eevee in 2014 by
sales was the Nissan Leaf over 30,000
moved out the door it gets 84 miles on a
charge and has 114 MPGe
the leaf was the sales champ every month
of the year except December when Tesla
had a spike this is the Eevee to beat a
sort of book end in a way to the Model X
it's goofy looking as all get-out and
rumor has it Nissan will make the next
version look more like a car and perhaps
offer a choice of longer range battery
packs but that's not for a year or two
so this is the one to look at for a
regular budget
thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed
this episode keep the emails coming it's
on cars at cnet.com I read every one a
lot of them make it into the show as
well as you've noticed and wherever you
like to watch video poke around and I'm
sure you'll find us there we're on all
the major platforms and a few that
aren't so major I'll see you next time
we check the tech
