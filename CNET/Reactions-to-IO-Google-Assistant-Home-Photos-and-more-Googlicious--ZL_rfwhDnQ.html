welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you can think of this week it's
all the reactions from the Google i/o
keynote so let's just dive in and the
star of the show without a doubt was the
Google assistant Google leads the
industry with their AI voice assistant
and they made that gap even bigger with
the demo of how they're combining their
Google lends tech with the assistant to
take things to the next level I just tap
the Google lens icon point the camera
and my assistant can instantly translate
them into English and now I continue the
conversation now google lens is a set of
vision based computing capabilities that
can do things like specifically
identifying a flower or if you're
walking in the street because your phone
knows where you are with GPS it can help
identify the businesses around you with
information cards or even take that
Wi-Fi router label with its name and
password and instantly connect you to
the network is your mind blown yet now
the Google assistant gets smarter and
can now work with third-party
applications to do things like order
lunch from a Panera and respond to
specific changes you want to make they
still didn't show us the promise of how
conversational it's supposed to be in
action so we'll wait for that but the
brains of Google's assistant is
ridiculous and getting a whole lot
smarter as we speak and if you want to
try it out on your iPhone because I've
heard a lot of people have this thing
called the iPhone Google released the
Google assistant for iOS and you can get
it today now it's not the full assistant
since it's not directly connected to the
iOS ecosystem but you'll see how much
better it is
all right the assistant is the heart of
the Google home and that receives some
new improvements like hands-free calling
to use it as a speakerphone like the
echo does it also added the ad-supported
Spotify if you aren't a subscriber and
you can use the home as a Bluetooth
speaker if you want to send audio from
another device to it but the Google
assistant gets bumped up another level
if you're watching content with the
connected chromecast it now sends visual
responses to your TV when you ask for
help from the Google home so it could be
your calendar the weather or YouTube
videos to pick from and all this will be
personalized depending on who uses it
because it can support and distinguish
between six different use
no one has anything remotely close to
this right now and Google showed that
they are the smartest company in tech
when it comes to artificial intelligence
for the consumer all right a new
standalone VR headset from Google was
also announced kind of in concept
Google's standalone VR headset has no
cables no phone no PC everything is
inside the headset and it uses inside
out positional tracking to detect where
you are in the world without the need
for any external camera set up in a room
now Google has built a prototype
reference model with Qualcomm's help and
the coming months Lenovo and HTC vive
will release commercial versions of the
VR headset with no names still yet to be
announced now that was some of the big
news that were still also no official
name given to Android Oh which will
officially roll out this summer with
picture picture instead of badges they
like to call these things notification
dots and better battery management but
the biggest cheers from the entire
keynote came from the announcement that
the added Kotlin as the new official
programming language for Android
see that's why it's a Developers
Conference but I don't know why they
were getting like horny with the
features since one of the themes of
Android Oh was to provide a fluid
experiences and it makes you wonder if
it's going to be called Android Oh face
like oh all right the goups can really
do anything they want but if you could
tell they didn't have any big
announcements to make beyond the
assistant and the home they brought
YouTube to stage for the first time to
tell us about 360 video on your TV from
the YouTube app something normally
reserved for a blog post and they didn't
show us anything striking that made me
say I got to do this like I love 360
video but on a TV screen objects that
are small because of the 360 perspective
become even smaller so I wasn't feeling
that now Google photos also get some
time to shine at Google i/o but it's
never a good thing when they spend way
more time on photos than they did
individually for the assistant or home
it gets suggested sharing based on who's
in the photos shared libraries which
lets people you select see photos taken
in real time but let's hope it's image
recognition is really good and leaves
out all the and a cool idea that will
save you a whole bunch of time with
Google's photo book see you just select
a whole bunch of photos even multiple
shots it doesn't matter then Google
takes the best ones edits them and
orders them and voila you have a photo
book right now it kind of like sounds
nice at first but to me this is for lazy
people or people who are too busy to
even care to put in time to make a photo
book with this thing called a love like
l.o.v.e love but if it lands you the
person of your dreams for 9.99 maybe
it's worth it's you and i know a lot of
you just nodded your heads
alright that's going to do it for this
week you can email me at Google lynches
at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
tell us what you thought about Google
i/o and we'll put some of your thoughts
in next week's show thanks much for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for some more of that Google issues
