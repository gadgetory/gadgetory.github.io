a first look at two of canons brand-new
entry-level DSLRs the AR 750d and AR
760d otherwise known as the t6 I and T
6s in the US both of these cameras are
designed for photographers who are
stepping up to a DSLR for the first time
they both share the same gut inside so
they've got a twenty four point two
megapixel aps-c CMOS sensor there is a
touch screen that flips up and rotates
on free and they also have Wi-Fi and NFC
connectivity let's focus a bit more on
the 760d though because there are a
couple of different features that
differentiate it from the 750 first up
on the top here is an LCD panel now this
is something that normally only appears
on higher end DSLRs so you get
information on your ISO and your
exposure without needing to look at the
screen or through the viewfinder also
moving down to the mode down here there
is a locking button so if you're out and
about and you're moving the model around
you're not accidentally knocking it out
of place also around the back you are
getting rather than a four-way
directional pad like on the 750 there is
a proper control wheel here that's also
more in line with higher-end DSLRs and
on the inside you get a couple of extra
features for videographers and movie
makers for example HDR video this is
taking the video at 60 frames a second
now one frame is underexposed and one
frame is on the exposure then it merges
it together in-camera and you get a
final results of a 30 frames per second
video at 720p there is also a miniature
movie mode as well both of the new
cameras will be available in April
globally if you want to check out more
information on these two new canons you
can find more info at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
