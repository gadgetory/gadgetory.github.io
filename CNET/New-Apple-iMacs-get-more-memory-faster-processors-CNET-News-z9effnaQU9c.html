of desktops for many years but we're
going to raise the bar once again and as
always on the iMac it starts with the
display because the 4k and 5k retina
iMac displays with their high resolution
excellent brightness and P 3 color gamut
are the best displays on any desktop but
we're going to make them even better so
these new displays are now going to be
500 nits that's 43% brighter than the
previous generation and for the first
time we're going to support 10 bit
dithering which means these displays can
reproduce up to a billion colors so your
content is going to look more true to
life than ever before now in addition
we've got some great internal updates
for these IMAX so we'll start with the
CPU because the whole line is moving to
Intel's 7th generation Core processor
also known as KB Lake now KB Lake gets
us better base in turbo frequencies for
more performance as well as hardware
base 10 bit HEV C decode which is great
for playing back high quality video
in addition these eye mechs are getting
a boost when it comes to memory capacity
so the 21.5 inch systems can now be
configured with up to 32 gigs of memory
and the 27-inch can go all the way up to
64 gigabytes of memory both of those are
twice what the previous generation could
do now fast storage has always been a
key part of the iMac and so we're going
to now make our fusion drive standard on
all 27-inch configs and it's also going
to be standard on the high-end 21.5 inch
config as well in addition our SSD
options are going to be up to 50% faster
and now available up to 2 terabytes and
the IMAX are getting an i/o upgrade as
well because we're giving them two USB C
connectors which support Thunderbolt 3
and we think our customers especially
our pro users are really going to love
this because you can do some cool things
like hook up a high performance raid
array and an external 5k display at the
same time so now let's talk about
graphics and as you heard earlier we're
investing heavily in graphics software
technologies like metal - well we're
also investing in graphics hardware and
every configuration in this new iMac
line is going to get a big bump in its
graphics performance so we'll start with
the entry-level iMac now they
system gets a boost in its integrated
GPU by way of Intel's Irish Plus
graphics which now has 64 megabytes of
video RAM and the performance that we're
getting out of this is pretty amazing
because this system is up to eighty
percent faster in graphics than the
previous generation now next up is the
21.5 inch iMac with retina 4k display
and the big news here is that we're
going to be moving to discrete graphics
and making it standard on all 4k IMAX
and that's going to come there you go
and that's going to come in this Radeon
Pro Series GPUs with up to 4 gigabytes
of vram and again this moved to discrete
graphics yields a pretty spectacular
performance increase because this new
system is up to three times faster than
the previous generations of graphics now
lastly we have our 27-inch iMac and this
is our most popular desktop for our pro
customers so obviously it's going to get
a bump in graphics today as well so it's
going to have these Radeon Pro 500
series GPUs with up to 8 gigabytes of
vram and again we get a great
performance uplift in fact this 27-inch
iMac can now deliver up to
five-and-a-half teraflop of graphics
compute and to recap they have the best
Mac displays we've ever made faster
processors higher memory capacity super
fast storage Thunderbolt 3 and as you
saw incredible graphics performance so
here's the line and but there's one more
change because we're going to bring even
more value to the iMac product line for
the first time ever we're going to have
a 4k iMac that starts at just $12.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
