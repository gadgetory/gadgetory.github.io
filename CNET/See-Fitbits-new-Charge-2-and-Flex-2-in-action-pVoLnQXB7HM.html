the charge - and flex to these new
fitness trackers join fitbit's already
large lineup of choices charged to is a
full-fledged heart rate tracking band
with a large display and lots of band
styles and the others a waterproof
little tracker that can be worn as
jewelry and doesn't have a display at
all so what's new the $150 charge - is a
replacement to our favorite charge HR
and now resembles that already available
Fitbit Alta it has a metal body
interchangeable bands with a larger
display to show text messages calendar
alerts and caller ID when your
smartphone is connected an interesting
feature is the new guided breathing
sessions the tracker is able to
determine your breathing rate and will
then guide you to relaxation the charge
- also includes a variety of sport
profiles for running strength training
interval training and more it still has
an optical heart rate sensor Fitbit is
also using that sensor for a new feature
called cardio fitness level which is a
rough estimate to determine how fit you
are as for the $100 flex - this is
fitbit's first swim proof fitness
tracker and perhaps its most stylish it
supports a variety of different bands
bangles and there's even a necklace you
can place the pot into because it's
waterproof the flex 2 can now track
swimming workouts and while there isn't
a display 5 small LED lights are used to
notify you about step progress remind
you to move into incoming calls and text
messages
the Fitbit app has also received a
slight update adding a new adventures'
feature this is a non competitive
challenge that lets you digitally travel
to remote locations based on your daily
step goal as of right now there's only
one location Yosemite National Park
which consists of three different trails
both trackers are available for order
now we will have a full review in the
coming weeks so be sure to keep an eye
