2nd it's time for episode 3 10 of the
359 podcast on BB G and your host today
include Ben Fox Ruben
Roger Chang and Alfred and good morning
everybody what are we talking about
today it wasn't obvious from the
headlines yeah we're gonna be talking
about Russia
oh good chorus yeah yeah no way look
Alvin just got back from DC he actually
was in attendance
yesterday's two congressional hearings
at which Google Facebook Twitter
basically got spanked got spanked hard
yeah the Senators representatives were
just sort of laying in on all of them I
will also be talking about Google's
pixel to excel warranty and how weird
and confusing it is as a little scoop
from our colleague Sean Hollister and
lastly we'll talk about smart dining
it's part of a new package we're putting
together called dining redefined our
very own Katie Collins has come for the
first three stories in this package
looking at the role of tech and how it's
changing the way we're eating so now
further ado if you have any questions
leave in the comments section
Brian will pick up the best and we'll
get them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds at
the Q&amp;amp;A session after we record the
podcast starting in 3 2 welcome to the
359 I'm Roger Chang I'm Albert Aang I'm
Ben Fox River Congress gave Google
Facebook and Twitter earful yesterday
testifying in parts of the their role
the Russia's influence in the u.s.
elections alfred was there at the
hearings let's get to it what was it
like in there being there in person I
mean it was kind of awkward you know
when you're at your friend's house and
their parents are yelling at them and
kind of just there was that for like
five hours yeah but this was a lot more
tense obviously it's a national security
issue yeah a lot of it was you know
because they have closed hearings
beforehand and you know the public
doesn't know about them so a lot of this
was them kind of letting the public know
here's what we know
right and here's what we want the
companies to talk about about what they
know and and it seems that you know they
know that Facebook Google and Twitter
are completely unprepared for
they know that they had known about it
for years you know as early as 2015 they
had picked up you know Russian activity
and propaganda on their respective
platform right and they just hadn't done
anything about it yeah I mean the issue
of rubles they kept talking about rubles
are you taking political ads taking
rubles for political ads and I felt like
rubles and bad actors like to terms like
I kept hearing over and over I think one
of the most telling stories was when
senator burr from the Senate
Intelligence Committee he brought out
these two signs so they were very big on
like billboards and signs right no I
like the visual age yeah so they brought
him out and it was these two events one
of them was a stop Islam sizing America
kind of event for and it was like
setting up a protest at a mosque in
Texas in Houston oh well and then the
exact same event and time for a like Pro
Muslim like group like counter protest
and this was both set up by them and he
showed a photo afterward of like the the
fights that had happened there you know
and and he he made up a good point where
he's like there's during the several
news articles that popped up a lot of
people are saying we don't know where
the organizers were and he said you know
it's hard to be there in Houston Texas
when you're trolling from st. Petersburg
Russia right no that's and that's a
great point and ultimately it actually
goes beyond or the influence of the
presidential election bottom-line like
ultimately it was about getting
Americans to fight well yeah when
Facebook talked about the hundred
thousand dollars that was spent on their
ads only forty six percent of that was
before the election so the majority of
it is still being spent right after and
they're still effective yeah right all
right so next up we've got to talk about
Google's pixel to excel burnin issues
now Google has extended its warranty for
the phone up to two years very generous
except for the fact that they don't
necessarily concert' consider this
burnin issue problem that would be
covered under the warranty it's really
confusing you know they sort of they
sort of reassure people you know if
you've got concerns about this call our
customer service will build a case by
case basis right but they've also kind
of argue that this burnin issue this
that affects the bottom of the screen
isn't covering the warrant because it's
not considered defect well they what are
they considered they if I'm to
understand this correctly they're
claiming that the burnin is endemic to
OLED screens yes and it's not directly
related to specific pixel to excels so
burnin usually happens after extensive
use so it's it's a little weird a little
uh if you do have this problem I would
probably recommend call and complain to
Google they'll probably honor it yes I
would hope so well we hope lastly we
want to talk about smart dining we're
talking about dining and redefined is a
first story Kay Collins has a first
story in a series that we were putting
out today looking at the role of tech
and influency how you eat she had a
couple of interesting she looked at a
couple restaurants one that actually
took your DNA data and customized your
meal based on it based on sort of the
nutritional value for as in she she
needs less carbs she needs more more
fish more omega-3 so go figure
check out this package we'll have a
couple so we'll have three stories
coming out the next three days that's
gonna be an ongoing series though it's
CNET so for more on that check us out
don't see that I'm Roger Chang I'm
Alfred hang I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening Alfred you just had to go and
mess with the natural order of things
didn't you well I was waiting for Ben
and then it was just like minor pause
yes I was like alright I guess I'll go
then no I contributed almost nothing the
second-tier was well it's like three
people and a four-minute podcast
it's not easy well what you have you say
right now okay this was the primary
question that I wanted to answer about
the congressional hearings yesterday a
lot of people in just just like the
public in general complains about the
fact that congressional hearings you
know it's great to like spank any you
know executives or bankers or you know
tech industry people out in public this
is this is like a feel-good thing you
guys did something like a starter it's
cathartic but like it was there any
actual action that you predicted might
actually come out of this
they have requested for them to send
further details and they have a week
deadline for them just about you know I
think the money flow this time with like
the ads one of the major questions as
they weren't able to ask was comparing
the ratio of Russian ads versus like
actual ads like how much money they took
from like ads in general compared to
like just how much our budget is pretty
small right yeah it's very small not
even even when they compared the Russian
ads during the election compared to the
amount of money that the Trump and
Clinton campaign had spent mmm like that
was like a revealing like piece of
anyone was 81 million dollars from the
treating the yeah and that wasn't out
there before so they were kind of
looking for so for details like that but
I think this also draws back to the
point about how unprepared they were I
for several of the questions that would
have really helped out a lot with
details a lot of the answers we don't
know or we have to look into that yeah
which is which is super troubling that
like these platforms have gotten so big
and so influential that they don't
actually know who's advertising anything
and I think some of the details that
surface really showed a lack of
oversight from from these companies on
themselves when Facebook was trying to
distance themselves from the Russian ads
one of their excuses that they kind of
made was these ads came to us through
our ad platforms where anybody can
actually buy an ad online ad right now
without ever talking to anybody from
Facebook which is super which and they
from Facebook's perspective is super
scalable yeah and that's why they do it
and as it's a very easy and quick way
and they created it as like a yeah they
created it when they announced that
program was basically look anybody can
buy an ad now and you know it's so easy
known it's so fast and then you have to
think that there's somebody out there
yeah yeah it's been ten dollars
advertising on Facebook for my
journalist page just to like see
whatever you like yeah it was super you
know um I got like yes I mean like I got
a handful of followers but I wish I was
as good as the Russian trolls because
yeah you guys didn't really study you
got some really controversial material
well yeah they definitely make it very
simple and it's not like anybody but I
think I think them pointing that out
really worked against them because they
were trying to say like look we can't be
responsible for this because we didn't
even talk to anybody on it and like that
sounds why didn't you talk to anybody
around a dog yeah and then Twitter also
I mean I think if anything this really
showed you know the scale of like how
much they had missed so a lot of the
trolls on Twitter had come from this
Russian trolling forum and st. Peter's
probably call the internet research
agency they don't do research on the
Internet right but they're really good
at viral post like when one of the yeah
so they're really good at rolling online
and one of the senators had asked
basically you know how did you find out
about them and Twitter answered through
news reports and the thing is you really
shouldn't yeah rely on news reports to
find out about your own company yeah
like that's and you know that's I think
that's some of the details to take away
from the hearings yesterday maybe that's
not that you know you guys are terrible
we hate you me one of the bigger themes
or I guess directions I was looking for
was you know these companies were going
to Capitol Hill to basically placate
them so basically be contrite and
convince these regulators that they
don't need laws joined them right now I
don't know if they really succeed know
when the House Rep had asked all of them
Mesa what can Congress do to make your
jobs easier to you know like how can we
help basically right
they didn't say legislation they didn't
say you know push forward if the ads Act
or anything like that there they
basically said make sure that we
communicate with each other basically
right make sure that we but not the
government yes I don't want to talk to
you yeah you just want to work this out
amongst ourselves tell us
alright the honest ads Act is by the way
for anybody that doesn't know it was an
ad vet sorry it was an act that a few
senators including John McCain and HR
yeah and Senator Warner from Virginia
had pitched where it's basically treat
online ads on Facebook Twitter social
media the same way that we treat ads on
vision political ads on television where
it's like this message yeah you have to
see you also know you have to know who's
actually what the thing is it's
different on Facebook because even if it
says like pay for by whatever they're
disguising themselves already yeah like
they could run these ads and say like
paid for by LGBTQ like for America
they're already not LGBTQ for America so
even if it says that like it really
wouldn't matter no wait a minute that
all these social networks have embraced
the whole verified account type thing
why can't that come into play in a
situation like this why can't that those
are but those are the difference between
accounts creating content which is its
own problem and I think the back end is
ad system that is basically built so you
can anonymously buy ads and and send
them out also to suppose yourself as
somebody that you're not is already like
against Facebook's Terms of Service but
they're already breaking the rules by
and on top of that creating only
verified accounts to advertise means
that all of a sudden it's gonna be more
complicated and difficult to actually
get that delicious and I think Facebook
likes to hide behind their argument if
you know everybody has to put their real
names on Facebook and it just no they
don't what are you talking about that's
not really a good verification process I
think they rely too much of nobody lies
on the internet like come on yeah like
that's their argument and it's just it's
so plainly like a myth but I don't know
why they stand by it all right Brian
what questions do we got we have a great
comment actually here that kind of a
devil's advocate from Randall Global
says you can't blame them 100% for the
misuse of platforms oversight on
oversight where do you draw the line I
kind of love that you know this is
igniting a little bit of a fire in the
conversation at the chat today wait we
can't blame who the company's yeah wait
why can we blame the tech company's
perspective on it I mean I think that I
think one of the more harrowing comments
from the Twitter legal counsel Shawn ed
get was he talked about the spread of
fake news on Twitter and he pointed out
it was pride saying one of at one of
them there was like a voter suppression
campaign whereas a hey you can text a
vote now like and then oh yeah and it
was up on Twitter for a very long time
right
and then he points out that story it's
like you know we all there there were
more comment on that tweet than there
were retweets saying this is alive this
is a lie and so he's like you know our
user base is so good at detecting these
things and you know warning everybody
else and my whole point was like your
team should have detected that on its
own it's like imagine you go to a
restaurant and there's like dirty dishes
everywhere on all the tables right and
you're the one that has to like clean it
up and then the restaurant owner says
like you know our customers are so good
at cleaning up the dishes here like
that's not the point but you don't go to
Twitter to find like fake content and
report them you go on Twitter to be on
Twitter so that's such a weird thing for
him to like brag about so my whole point
is that if you're on a platform that is
free that like you know that platform
should be the one monitoring like this
stuff not you myself I think going back
to the comment or there's it's probably
accurate to say that there is plenty of
blame to go around and if we do like if
the country decides to move in the
direction of legislation that would be
really complicated and interesting I see
if social media actually does have some
sort of he'll be just you see how
effective some of this legislation would
because his point of the honest ads Act
only really fixes one small part of this
huge yeah right fake news is not it's
not advertising these posts are not
advertising so how do you stop that and
what I got kind of gathered from the
testimony was these are huge huge
platforms that even Facebook and Twitter
don't really have a full grasp of right
they don't for whatever for all those
smart to learn but they just they don't
seem to be able to kind of manage or see
what's going on yeah a lot of where they
can actually effectively yeah and to be
fair you know it is a massive platform
and when you have you know hundreds of
millions on a 2 billion case billions
right users it you can't siphon through
every like comment down just and you
know that's why they rely on these
algorithms alone they all of them talked
up there a I when they asked like how
are you gonna fix this every single
platform was basically we're gonna fix
up our algorithm that's the thing now I
mean that's but that's the only way that
is so Silicon Valley rare because it's
like it's just a book have an answer
have an answer to the problem and the
answer lies in software technology right
yeah right because when you're a hammer
everything's in there exactly so Brent
anything else yeah first day is on your
side al Freddie they agree with you
Microsoft AI josh Josh boy to set agrees
to says I need to have some kind of
verified add a new system for political
ads on social media and I agree with
that 100% I have no idea how to even
begin to implement I think I think Rob
right no one really has a good solution
for screens a lot of these weren't even
political ads though they were just kind
of like you know like respect police
officers which yeah which you know I
guess we can debate whether or not
that's political but I think when
they're talking about the honest ads
campaign when they're talking about
political ads or talking the other thing
and you know vote for this person yeah
right those calls for like gatherings
for yeah black lives matter those aren't
ads yeah it was like the two examples
that senator burr brought up those were
just events yeah exactly events on
Facebook yeah you can't even pay to
promote those you know it goes a lot
deeper than just like paying for
sponsored like posts well it's also
worth mentioning that it's good that
we're talking about all this now I mean
like 2018 the midterms are gonna be
around the corner at Brad point and
they're gonna be next year they're gonna
be next like a and E and the expectation
that this is gonna go away anytime soon
is you know very wishful thinking if
anything you know it's gonna turn into a
cat-and-mouse game where both sides are
gonna get better at their jobs but it's
not gonna go away
Christopher Burke in the chat says bring
back geo cities and that's kind of a
thought I had yesterday not specifically
geo cities but I wonder if this is going
to lay rise or maybe rebirth to some of
the older social networks that were
imposed by commercialism maybe the
return of friends check out my angel
fire but think about it though I wonder
if there will be some kind of backlash
from this where we'll see a new
alternative kind of thing you know like
I don't want ads I don't want you know
politics I just want to see what my
event ends st. Louis is doing I think
it's a very idealistic view I just don't
think that's gonna happen if
at Facebook's earnings yesterday they is
going to bury Facebook but I'm wondering
if there will in fact be an alternative
to come out of this where people make
jump ship - yeah but that alternative if
there's not gonna be any ads or anything
like that it's how's it gonna draw a
single dime Facebook didn't have ads
when it started yeah when it started I
think but eventually they all they all
need to make money that's the problem
true we were talking about this before
the pirate fund that that snapchat and
that's doing fairly well yeah all things
considered they didn't have to go to
Congress because they didn't deal with
the same Russian trolling problem
they're probably in as good a position
as anybody to capitalize on the
situation snapchats done a really good
job at insulating itself from this zone
issues subscription basis yeah but most
snapchat has been able to keep out of
this you know cesspool mostly because
their content isn't completely public
right not everybody but also they have
very very tight connection yes
limitations when it comes to everything
yeah there's a there's an anecdote in a
Bloomberg article about how snapchat
kept out of the fake news like Spiral
because they actually have human editors
moderating all the content that comes in
so during the Charlottesville like
protest stuff when they finally arrested
the person like behind the wheels yeah
somebody sent a snapchat to and that
with the caption says like got him like
got the guy or whatever somebody from
snapchat actually when they put her on
their official story like Chronicle
izing it they changed the handle to it
appears a suspect was around just to
make sure that they like accidentally
get the wrong guy right right right yeah
all right that's all the time we have
what's more corruptible people or
computers computers Peters can be easily
fooled that's true there are some other
really great questions and comments in
the chat we're not gonna be able to get
to him we'll try to we'll try to bring
them back next week or something yeah
thanks everybody cuz that's obviously be
an ongoing conversation sometimes oh
yeah thanks everyone all right if you
like taint that you saw her hurt here
check us out in CNET our podcast is also
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
SoundCloud if you
google play music see y'all next week
take care everyone have a great weekend
so you know it Connect connect goodbye
