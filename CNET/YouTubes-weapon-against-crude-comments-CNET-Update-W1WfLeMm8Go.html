protection laws and that it lit yay
overcharged for games like madden well
four years later those lawyers say EA
has agreed to a settlement which
includes giving up the exclusive rights
to NCAA games for at least five years
and this settlement still needs to be
approved by the court but if it's passed
it also means anyone who bought an e a
