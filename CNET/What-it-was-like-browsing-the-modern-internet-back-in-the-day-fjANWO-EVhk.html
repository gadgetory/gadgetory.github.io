across the Internet today there are
three different conversions from analog
to digital signals between your internet
service provider your telephone company
on your computer my first internet was
taking a black rotary phone getting my
acoustic coupler having anything hooked
up to my Tandy 1000 desktop computer you
dial the phone on your rotary phone then
you plug the handset into the acoustic
coupler and then you had like this
little all text menu which is where
people got together with red messages
and les messages key key takeaway here
I really old when the internet was
brought into my house was this strange
notion of oh well you can look at a
thing that you like but it's a new way
to look at it I think I had like one of
those like clamshell like tangerine
MacBooks and you could plug the internet
in it was early after you're like hmm
okay I captured the Internet how am I
gonna use this I remember my dad getting
AOL and sitting me down and explained
that this was something you pay for by
the minute and so we can only go on it
in short amounts of time if you've spent
any time on line you know how painfully
slow it can be waiting for graphics and
audio and video to download oh yeah back
then you had to negotiate between
talking on the phone time and using the
phone to call your local access provider
time the internet came over the phone
line and you paid a monthly fee for it
just like anything else
oh man logging on that's right it took
forever and the oh the fact that you
were basically the first people online
you could tell like and I would just be
sitting there like looking at like a
blank white screen and that was when I
first started that I was like why is it
taking so long
there was dated times of like hey this
is internet time but like also we need
to call your grandparents so get off the
internet and that lasted for a really
long time god help you if your mom
picked up the phone because then it's
all over you gotta start again cuz we
had one phone line in the beginning and
mom would pick up and hear that you're
like oh no I'm kicked off I was in the
middle of an AOL chat room game think of
the information highway as a real
highway for a moment audio video and
other information is broken up into
little packets like cars and then sent
along different lanes and highways to be
assembled at the other end the internet
for us especially the beginning of the
web browsing era of the internet was so
amazing so one of the first things I
read on the internet was look up Sailor
Moon I would just look up Sailor Moon
pictures and images and then I would
print them whole like print the web
pages then I would put them like in
binders and then in a three-hole punch
binder or like in sleaze and I was just
like look and flip through them and I
was pretty much all I did big part of my
early internet days was like sound bites
from movies and we were just like
download then you download a 15-second
audio clip and you finally get it and it
would just be like chris farley singing
like a little COO and that's it and you
and you'd be like thank you humanity
we've done it we got this I looked up
the status of my friends online we could
sounds of dirty you can finger people so
you would just type in finger and then
their login name and it would tell you
whether they were online cuz they did
not your fingering No
if they were there you knew they were
there haha I fingered you I know there's
no way to respond to this I think I was
like 12 years old so I think I'm mostly
hung out in chat he was talking to their
12 year olds or people pretending to be
like 14 or 15 years old I would find
these mysterious things called
things about fishing with pH and I just
poke around and see people were talking
about and they would be like ASL you
know how old are you and I'm like oh
well I'm 13 and oh well you even know
what fishing is I do too it's a band I
totally know what it is the bigger the
file you want the more cars or packets
you force onto that road and everything
ends up traveling on what's known as the
Internet's backbone the super high speed
network that connects all the other
networks I remember somebody we were
sitting in like a in a class I remember
that couple kids in front of me and they
were laughing and giggling and I
remember them just typing and naked
people and I don't know what came up I
mean the internet was so slow back then
probably they didn't see anything so we
definitely had moments where like there
would be like a stray a message like in
the background that I forgot to close
and was like oh why are your friends
cursing a window open on accident yeah
no good when I just recently went to
visit my parents I found old AOL CDs
they kept them hey Ken 300 CDs it's
crazy I mean this is one of the older
ones it's a well 9.0 optimized and I
blessed my parents hearts that they that
they thought that they may need this and
and they kept it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
