being started off with a bang with a
game nearly a decade in the making The
Last Guardian it's really happening the
game was given a 2016 release date along
with a fantastic demo it ok so where
Microsoft said a lot of exclusive games
are coming to their console in 2015
Shoni answered back with games that
maybe aren't coming out this year but
for 2016 and beyond we also got to see
the next game from the developer
guerrilla games the makers of the kill
zone franchise their new title is called
horizon zero dawn and it showcased an
unbelievable demo with animal like
robots that take over an uninhabited
world sony also showcased some more
footage of Street Fighter 5 which will
be a console exclusive for PlayStation 4
no man's sky which stole the show last
year got a proper gameplay demo live at
the e3 stage we finally got to see what
medium molecule was up to the creators
of little big planet will release a game
called dreams which actually doesn't
really feel much like a game we don't
know much about it but it looks amazing
and is intriguing nevertheless then sony
began to pull some nostalgic strings
they introduced a kickstarter fund for
Shenmue 3 which is basically asking
people to pay for a game that everyone
wants which forced the crab to go nuts
speaking of going nuts this place went
crazy when Sony announced to remake a
final fantasy 7
devolver digital had a significant
presence at the show as well displaying
a barrage of their independent games and
a big surprise came with the
announcement that call of duty black ops
3 will get DLC first on PlayStation 4
which ends a historic relationship
between that franchise and Microsoft
finally we were treated to an extended
demo of uncharted 4 which as expected
look fantastic details were a little
light on Morpheus but will experience
more of that on the show floor this week
so there you have it 2015 maybe not the
biggest year persona but things
certainly look right for 2016 and beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
