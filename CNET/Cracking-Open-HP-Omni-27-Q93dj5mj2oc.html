screen all-in-one with its 27-inch iMac
but in 2012 Windows PC makers are
fighting back with 27 inch machines of
their own I'm Bill Detweiler head
technology editor at C net sister site
tech Republic and I'm going to crack
open HP's first 27 inch all-in-one the
omni 27 opening the omni 27 s case is
straightforward and doesn't require any
special tools just a Philips screwdriver
first I removed the wireless keyboard
and mouse receiver from its hidden
compartment then I removed a square
cover that hides the unit's VESA mount
screw holes and a hidden case screw
after removing all the external case
screws I popped loose the back cover and
removed it now once inside the machine I
removed the remaining case components
the hard drive the optical drive and the
speakers next I remove the metal shields
that cover the LCD controller board and
motherboard with the shield's off I
removed the CPU cooling assembly and fan
after removing one more metal shield I
disconnected all the motherboard cables
and removed the motherboard itself at
this point I decided not to remove any
other components from the machines
chassis why well because we can see most
of them without dissecting the machine
any further and there's not really that
much to be gained by removing the LCD so
after removing the RAM chips wireless
card and processor from the motherboard
my teardown was complete so what did I
learn about the HP omni 27 from our
cracking open
well like the HP compact 6000 all in one
that I cracked open last year
disassembling the Omni 27 is a simple
straightforward process
the machine has standard Phillips and
Torx screws the case is a snap to remove
and the internal components are easily
accessible I also like that the omni's
back cover comes off as a single piece
and that you can remove it without
detaching the stand which wasn't
possible on the 6000
leaving the standard hatch lets you work
on the machine while it's standing
upright which is a little easier than
having to lay it down flat other
improvements include the much larger
display the addition of Intel Core i5
and i7 processors and the ability to
upgrade from the integrated Intel HD
graphics to a discreet Nvidia or AMD
graphics card as for storage and memory
the Omni is available with a SATA hard
drive up to three terabytes a 160
gigabyte or a 256 gigabyte solid state
drive and comes with six gigs of RAM
standard our test unit had eight also
new is an HDMI input available as an
upgrade which lets you use the Omni as a
display for any video source with an
HDMI output another interesting
difference between the Omni and the 6000
is the newer machines single fan and
smaller cooling assembly now this change
makes sense as Intel's Sandy Bridge
microarchitecture should run cooler than
the 6000 sold Core 2 Duo processors as I
noted it at the beginning
Apple was first to the 27 inch
all-in-one party and no examination of a
windows-based 27-inch machine would be
complete without a comparison to the
iMac so let's look at Hardware and price
as of this taping a 27-inch iMac with a
2.7 gigahertz core i5 CPU 4 gigs of RAM
a 1 terabyte hard drive and a 512
megabyte Radeon 67 70 M graphics card
costs one thousand six hundred and
ninety nine dollars an omni 27 with a
2.7 gigahertz processor eight gigs of
ram thanks to a free upgrade from the
standard 6 gigs a one terabyte hard
drive and a one gigabyte Radeon HD 74-58
graphics card costs one thousand four
hundred and seventy dollars and 99 cents
or one thousand three hundred twenty
dollars and ninety nine cents with a
hundred and fifty dollar instant rebate
from HP so even without the HP discount
the Omni is more than two hundred
dollars cheaper than the iMac and
clearly wins on price but the iMac has a
significantly higher resolution display
2560 by 14
forty compared to the omni's 1920 by
1080 and it has a thunderbolt port if
you need one on the other hand the Omni
has an HDMI input and you can get it
with a blu ray/dvd combo Drive basically
with the exception of the screen the
Omni 27 and the 27-inch iMac can be
configured with comparable hardware
unless of course you max out the IMAX
hardware options which also maxes out
its price know the decision about which
is really right for you comes down to
whether you want a machine from Apple or
HP whether you want Windows or OS 10 and
whether you're willing to pay apples
higher price now for more information on
the Omni 27 including performance tests
