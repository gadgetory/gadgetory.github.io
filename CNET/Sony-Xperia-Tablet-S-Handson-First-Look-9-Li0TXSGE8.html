tablets have been focused on being TV
accessories and the new Xperia Tablet S
continues that tradition but it brings
in the xperia name brand and update some
software and also some specs inside this
nine point four inch IPS screen uses a
quad-core Tegra 3 processor inside and
the configurations are 16 32 64 gigabyte
going up to 5 99 and inside there's some
interesting software ranging from a
universal remote that will you work like
an IR blaster and turn on and off all
the devices in your home theater and
also there's a new watch now app that
kind of work is like a socially
connected TV Guide to show you what's
actually on live television what's hot
and what people you might be interested
in based on your interest that you put
in there and it's a different type of a
look kind of a social grid and when you
flip up here it'll actually change to
that channel another clever addition to
the software on this xperia tablet is
guest mode finally allowing you to
switch to different user modes including
four children and limit the access to
their apps switching back and forth this
something that I've wished the iPad had
for years the rest of its android 4.0 it
pretty lightweight and that same funky
wedge design that was in the previous
Sony Tablet line including PlayStation
mobile connectivity there are a whole
bunch of new accessories as well
including a wafer-thin keyboard case and
a bunch of new interesting stands it's a
crowded landscape with tablets but the
Xperia Tablet S looks like it's going to
dive into the TV accessory territory
banking off its usability there and I'm
Scott Stein and that's a look at the new
Sony Xperia Tablet S check out Cena calm
