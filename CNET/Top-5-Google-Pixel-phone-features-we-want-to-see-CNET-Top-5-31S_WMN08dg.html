building its own non-nexus phone known
on the Internet as the pixel phone here
are the top 5 features we want to see in
a true google phone at number five
fingerprint sensor as good as touch ID
android fingerprint sensors are good but
apple's touch ID is excellent and very
reliable if google is putting together a
phone matching that biometric sensor
would be great at number 4 premium build
quality the Nexus 6p and a number of
other android phones are built out of
great materials the Nexus 5x and not so
much should Google make its own phone
especially under the pixel bring this
phone should be made out of metal or
other high quality materials to set it
apart from a sea of phones and number
three a great camera Samsung phones have
had some truly great cameras Nexus
phones can't really say that Google has
to realize that picture quality is
incredibly important and a pixel phone
needs to have a camera or multiple
cameras that outshine the rest at number
two the basics I'm just going to lump in
some features that should be on any
major phone in this one USBC wireless
charging water resisted and a headphone
jack at number one customized Android
stock Android is really solid but if
Google is building a phone and has full
control of everything from end to end
maybe it's time to customize whatever
version of Android is on this new phone
sometimes when a company has full
control of hardware and software the end
product is really awesome you want more
top 5s you're in luck go to top 5 cnet
com forum or am I as act hard I'll see
you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
