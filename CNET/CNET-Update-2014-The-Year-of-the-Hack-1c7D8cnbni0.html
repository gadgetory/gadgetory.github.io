the hack I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update as 2014 draws to a
close we're ending the same way we
started with hackers the tone was set in
January as we comb through details about
the target credit card hack as well as a
snapchat hack when millions of users had
their phone numbers leaked there have
been multiple cybersecurity issues this
year you had heartbleed the Home Depot
hack and iCloud just name a few of the
big ones and now we're witnessing
hackers crippled sony pictures
entertainment stealing 47,000 employees
social security numbers releasing
countless private emails and stopping
the release of the movie the interview
you could say 2014 is the year of the
hack and because of it the world is
waking up and paying more attention to
security and privacy issues some
lawmakers are calling for a
cybersecurity bill to better protect
citizens and companies previously such
bills have failed to pass now layered on
top of all the hacking reports this year
were paying more attention to government
surveillance and corporations that
collect data on us to just sell targeted
advertising or in the case of Facebook
to test our emotions like lab rats the
folks at Pew Research have been looking
into these issues and for a recent
report it asked technology experts about
the state of privacy over the next
decade and where we're heading just over
half of the respondents revealed that
they have little faith that will create
a standard to govern privacy rights in
the next ten years many argue that since
people are willing to give up privacy to
use convenient tools consumer tracking
is going to increase and that is
especially true when we have more
internet connected gadgets in the home
that report our actions back to tech
companies perhaps privacy will become a
luxury but forty-five percent of those
surveyed do have hope for a global
privacy standard because citizens will
have access to more privacy tools and
perhaps businesses will follow a
standard to avoid backlash how about we
shift from cyber security to another
stressful topic holiday shopping amazon
