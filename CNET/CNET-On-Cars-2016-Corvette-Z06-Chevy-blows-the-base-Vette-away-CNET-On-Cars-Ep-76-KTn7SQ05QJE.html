whole lot more understanding wheel
alignment and the top five things that
VW has to do next it's time to check the
tech PC cars differently we love them on
the road and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is
ugly is included at no extra cost the
good the bad the bottom line this is
CNET on cars
welcome to CNET on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis
well the seventh generation Corvettes
quite a handful just the way it stands
but then go and add a supercharger to it
a smart suspension and smart gearbox and
a body that handles air like a magician
and you've got something entirely
different
let's drive the zo6 flavor and check the
tech
well we do have a supercharger here
because the power is correct oh yeah
few would argue this is the new golden
age of horsepower but for the most part
brawny cars today do it with much
smaller displacement and a lot more tank
under the hood except for the big vent
which keeps things big so what is the
zo6 it's basically king of a hill right
now in the c7 seventh generation
Corvette you take what's already an
impressive 6.2 liter v8 base car and
then you add a bunch of brawn a
supercharger on top of that v8 a
standard 7-speed manual with rev
matching magnetic we illogical adaptive
suspension standard wider fenders up
front to cover way bigger wheels and
treads all kinds of radical airflow and
cooling management around the body and a
steel-reinforced Jesus bar where the
view
new 416 you've got a front curb and chin
camera rear lid that doesn't require you
to slam it it cinches itself and carplay
or Android auto with carplay out first
but you don't buy a car like this to
play with your smartphone yeah buy it to
play with a motorized screen instead I
can't get enough of that okay let's get
serious 7-speed manual gearbox this is
bass but notice our manual has paddles
on the wheel
those are your toggles to turn on or off
rev matching we'll try that on the road
and the track momentarily and now here
is your mode controller for the vehicle
and it's very simple compared to like a
BMW M car there's weather eco-tour which
is normal sport and track not a ton of
variables around that under the home
menu is something you won't find on any
other car we Chevy MyLink and that's
this the PDR the performance data
recorder which is a misnomer it's a
forward-looking video camera that also
has a data recorder that overlays
telemetry on the HD view forward this is
basically a smart GoPro built in the car
and no one else does it quite like this
and generally around the cabin this is a
mix of traditional and modern cabin
technology a partial LCD instrument
panel but real gauges around it for
other functions you got your touch
screen here of course but a ton of
tactile knobs right below it
now the simplest headline around a zo6
is that the engine is supercharged and
here's your supercharger and planted
right at the top and I mean right at the
top look at this thing it just barely
fits in the profile of the engine bay
it's right here at the height of the
hood gasket so when you add some mass on
top you want to lower it on the bottom
as a result this engine has dry sump
lubrication a very shallow pan below to
keep overall height managed and not add
a bunch of tall center of gravity
killing mass and in between those two
components you've got tougher forged
internals to handle the chaos that this
guy brings upon them and you've also got
stronger better breathing
high-performance heads the output
numbers are a pleasant pair 650 horse
650 pound feet of torque 7-speed manuals
bass you can get an 8-speed automatic I
won't be speaking to you after that
however with that 8-speed in a high
performance package you can get to zero
to 60 down under 3 seconds for this 3500
pounds worth of Becks and should you
care the average mpg is 18 that's not
bad for something that puts out 650 gets
there partly because of direct injection
and very much because of cylinder
deactivation
you never get used to this kind of big
big power
I'll be honest I'm more of a naturally
aspirated kind of guy I kind of like
that smooth linear feel but this is just
a hoot now we're at the simraceway
performance driving Center at Sonoma a
course layout that constantly reminds
you how light and sharp the turn in is
on this car coupled with that responsive
throttle this Vette feels about half its
weight I'm in let's see sport mode right
now and I've got tremendous power
at that great throttle ability I do not
even miss the rev matcher when it's on
or off because this engine blips and
modulates so beautifully which is
interesting for a great big engine it
breathes very lightly I would say it's
not hard to get it up or down on the rev
clock because it's a nimble set of
internals this bed has a perfect 50:50
weight spread largely because that
7-speed manual I'm working is a
transaxle not a transmission in other
words it's located at the back of the
car instead of ganging it up all
lopsided lis with the engine at the
front of the car nice gearbox and clutch
by the way Corvettes used to have condom
kind of horsey drivelines in the last
couple generations not anymore this guy
is just easy to drive but man is there
some stuff under there and we've got the
magnet area logical adaptive suspensions
doing wonders of course to keep me in
good shape that's also the technology
that will keep you enjoying your zo6 on
the ride home after the track okay done
up seeing that style of zo6 is going to
start you about eighty thousand four
with a 7-speed manual it's for the coupe
by the way more for the convertible then
there's that zero seven additional
Performance Package 7,500 bucks I'm
gonna pass I'm good here eighteen
hundred for the PDR track recorder with
telemetry laid over the video I love
that I'm all-in now you're at about
eighty to two out the door the way I'd
do it well automotive history is
littered with examples of technologies
that made cars safer starting off being
nice to have and then expected and then
required by law look at things like
airbags anti-lock brakes even seatbelts
we come back I'll tell the smarter
driver what's coming next on that list
we see that on cars returns
just as we expect new cars to have
mirrors parking brake seatbelts abs and
airbags regardless of their price or
type we may soon expect the same of
automatic emergency braking automatic
emergency braking will apply partial
braking and alert the driver of a
potential collision 10 automakers who
are responsible for more than half the
cars and light trucks sold in the US
have pledged to make the technology
available across their lives which
certainly points down the road to it
eventually being required now how and
when a EBE goes mainstream will be
worked out with the US National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration and the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
they're consulting now and by the time
they get that done it'll be hard for all
the other car makers to stay out the
u.s. new car assessment program which
addresses standards for many systems
includes ten formal tests of safety gear
but automatic emergency braking is not
yet one of them as you drive collision
prevention assist is comparing your
speed to vehicles or objects ahead
AEV is just another term for a tech you
may already know subaru calls it
pre-collision braking system acura and
honda collision mitigation braking
system and Mercedes dubs at the wordy
Distronic plus with pre-safe brake but
all of these currently live in the world
of a nice-to-have option not common or
standard the way it works is cameras
lasers and ultrasonic sensors constantly
watch the space ahead of your car and if
the processor they're connected to
determines you're closing on an object
moving or still too rapidly
and seem to be making no inputs on the
brake or steering the car will brake for
you a car that can see trouble
and stop itself to avoid it even if it
doesn't eliminate the impact it would
lessen its energy and if it appears you
cannot avoid the collision the system
engages the features of pre-safe to help
prepare the occupants the safety and
insurance communities have been falling
in love with this tech for a few years
making it the early darling of all the
active driver assist the IIHS has found
that cars with this basic tech are
associated with up to 35% fewer accident
injury claims they like paying fewer
claims you like not being involved until
a EB is required in new cars
it pays to double check if the one
you're considering buying has it any one
how many times he brought your car in
for a front-end alignment and what I'm
kinda sure what was going on the car
came out probably driving straighter and
you were told it was going to wear the
tires less but in the middle there was
kind of a black box so let's sort that
out by introducing you to the big three
of alignment camber caster and toe
to help us I've enlisted the guy whose
shop has done dozens of alignments on my
car's ron Vasconcelos of dependable tire
and break in San Rafael California all
right Ron first of all tell us what is
tow that's the people mostly think of
when their tires are out of alignment
tow in tow out pigeon-toed duck toes yep
okay okay
tow Ian is gonna wear the tires on the
outside edge yeah go out just gonna wear
the tires on the inside edge so when
your tires are kind of towed in
pigeon-toed the outsides wear out more
crack because they're kind of scrubbing
as you draw exactly but why do you tow
wheels in or out at all well you're
pretty much toe in because you have
friction as the car rolls down the road
friction is pulling them apart okay as
all the bushings move and all that kind
of stuff if it's towed in you tow it in
just a little bit and it toes out to
about zero oh it doesn't everything gets
pulled back by all the motion everything
gets pulled back by them somewhat by the
motion obviously some suspension systems
are tighter than others
old front-wheel drive cars used to tow
them out because the wheels would pull
them in from the tour from the torque
pulling it in so if your towed out or if
you're not totally you're gonna have
less forward stability you're gonna have
you have tow out the car wants to turn
on siddhart watch Dart right so if
you're going down the freeway the car
wanders just wandering a bit you know it
might have some toe out okay so let's
now go to camber this is one people
often misunderstand what is negative and
what is positive camber negative camber
the tire is leaning in at the top
so it's squatting a little typically if
you look at an old Volkswagen the rear
wheels have negative camber a lot of it
right Porsches these days have a lot of
negative camber so when you have a lot
of negative camber you're getting what
benefit you're getting cornering
benefits gonna handle better I dive into
that corner that thing is kind of higher
than a plant instead of if it's leaning
over positive it's gonna want to roll
the other way so you're kind of pre
setting it for the dig that's gonna get
into the road and also if you're not
driving the car hard you're just driving
it back and forth down the freeway well
the tires already sitting that way it's
gonna wear on the inside
ok so it's a waste of performance if you
really have an extreme negative camber
correct okay so then the one that's
trickiest of the of the big three is
caster I still struggle with this one a
little bit how do you describe caster to
someone caster is the angle between the
upper ball joint and the lower ball
joint with the lower ball joint leading
that would be positive caster this is
front of the car yep
the blower ball joint or the lower pivot
of the steering of the steering forward
is positive caster so that's like a
bicycle fork correct and that is for
what purpose why isn't that straight up
and down
stability a straight up and down caster
angle would make for a wheel that
nervously tracks left or right at almost
any whim or input a little positive
caster or lean back in the angle the
wheel pivots along comes this down a car
will pull towards low caster say you
have four degrees on the right side and
three degrees on the left side the car
is going to want to drift to the left
cuz think about it the ball joint is
going backwards it wants to go that way
and all this stuff interacts car pulls
towards negative caster pulls towards
positive camber so you can have one one
way and one the other in the car I'll
Drive straight where they're both over
there go file correct now of these three
why do they go wrong these are all big
metal parts in here and people look at
it so how could that every budge
well a lot of parts these days are made
of aluminum yeah aluminum soft they do
like aluminum because it's lighter
weight aluminum is stronger per pound
and steel but but easier to bend
couple that with low-profile tires to
transmit more Road impact to those
aluminum parts and the fact that the
joints and mounts that hold your
suspension in place where and then allow
things to drift and that's why you need
an occasional realignment so when
someone hits a pothole should they be
concerned and if so why um number of
different things you can bend a wheel
you can bend suspension parts you can
break the bead and a tire you see a lot
of people with bulge on the side of it
what's happened is they've hit something
so hard that it's broken the belts in
there if I've hit something and I'm not
sure if it did any damage or there any
telltale things I can look or feel for
um general is straight before when I was
going straight
now the sharing wheels off while you're
going straight while you're going
straight it's something got bent and
giveaway shake now I hit that pothole
now my car shakes is I'm doing 60 miles
an hour down the freeway possibly been a
wheel something like that many of us
only get our cars aligned when we get
new tires but notice things like pole or
vibration is you drive a sign that
things aren't aligned anymore and
potentially costing you some tire life
handling quality maybe even a little
fuel economy in a moment your email
white turbos aren't found in every car
and is driver assist technology worth
getting in your next one you can see
that on cars continues
it's called the Abingdon addition and it
cost about 80 grand now that seems like
an awful lot of money for what looks
like an MGB but there's more to it than
that see this is the latest in a long
line of resto mod e classics this isn't
just a pretty body over some crusty
mechanicals this was designed from the
ground up to be a real modern day
performance sports card as you can
probably hear from the noise it goes
like sneak by more from the ex car team
of C net UK at C Netcom slash
welcome back to C net on cars I'm Brian
Cooley one of my favorite parts of the
show is right now I take a bunch of your
emails and the first one comes in the
blue rocker who says my son wants a 15
Toyota Camry with all the tech features
he says though I'm worried even though
it has pre collision blind spot and rear
traffic alerts do these systems work any
tips well blue rocker here's the thing
when you go on a test drive make sure
you and your son go on enough different
kinds of roads and traffic conditions
where you can test these various systems
but ever the car has on it including
things like forward collision prevention
lane departure tech which you mentioned
blind spot detection cross traffic alert
which is related similar it's in the
rear of the car of course and adaptive
cruise control is also when I put in
that basket
so get on some different roads and
traffic and see how it feels then you
get some idea of how what's gonna work
now know this these systems are
considered features and driver aids for
the most part they're not in quite the
same class as things like airbags and
anti-lock brakes where they are really
guaranteed safety features that have a
certain high level of performance you
can expect they're very sort of
conditional know that going into it and
that you can't just hand your life over
to these and an easy reliance they are
assists they're not complete back steps
I'll also take a look at our smarter
drivers segment from not too long ago
episode 73 we did a whole piece on the
emerging popularity of forward collision
braking in particular becoming very
highly touted by the insurance and
safety industries they think it makes a
big difference
next one comes in from Le II who says if
turbos are so great we talk about them a
lot around here
why are they not standard on just about
every new car by now and what would it
take to install one also he says could
you please explain flex-fuel okay le so
turbos are an amazing technology you get
more power more efficiently out of
typically a smaller engine is how
they're often being used today the thing
with turbos though is adding them is not
trivial even for a car maker with all
their resources adding a turbocharger to
an existing engine design is going to
add some cost because the turbo itself
is a very complex highly machined
mechanism and it's got a lot of plumbing
that goes around it it also adds a
certain amount of complexity to the
design and to what you're trying to
shoehorn into the engine bay it's a lot
of additional gear that is external to
the engine itself and know that an
automaker cannot just stick a turbo on a
current engine and say good it's running
there's a lot of R&amp;amp;D and testing and
engineering and recertification to be
done before that goes into a production
line of cars and everything is done at
big scale in the auto biz so they don't
onesie twosie things or big projects so
that's one of the things around
turbochargers now there are add-on kits
out there a lot of them for late-model
cars you didn't mention what you drive
but let's assume it's something made in
the last few years you may very well
find an add-on turbo kit for it they
typically cost in the few thousand
dollars range and also make sure you've
got some good guarantees in there
because these are elaborate pieces of
gear that spin very high rpms and make
sure the kit you buy does promised to be
regulatory compliant in the state where
you're going to be installing it and
driving your car now in terms of flex
fuel that means a world of three things
that gasoline engine cars can run of
course there's gasoline that's the main
fuel there's a 15 which is 15 percent
ethanol which is corn alcohol basically
and the main flex fuel people think
about at the pump is 85 this is 85
percent ethanol typically corn alcohol
and 15 percent gasoline that's a very
different mix for a car to run on so
when you buy a flex-fuel car it does
several things to allow it to digest
that diet including a change in the
ignition timing because there is a far
higher octane to e85 than to gasoline
secondly you change the fuel flow
mapping because you get more fuel into
the engine
get the same amount of power when you're
running on e85 and thirdly you have to
make sure the materials in the engine
are suitable to be exposed to ethanol
alcohol which is a very different
chemical of course than gasoline those
are the main three things that
constitute a flex-fuel car the last one
comes in from Eddie Kay this week he
says I'm wondering if there are car
shows around the country that non-media
people can go to to see the newest cars
with the newest tech what are some good
ones that I would suggest well car shows
are very common all around about every
metropolitan area around the US but they
kind of fit into two categories there
are the big shows which are where you
see most of the new cars concept and new
technologies come out and of course we
attend those on your behalf I would
include the number one Detroit Auto Show
early in the year late year you have the
very impressive Los Angeles Auto Show
and you've also got in the spring New
York and Chicago which are also
significant large shows now beyond that
you've got a slew of local shows that
are typically put on by dealer
associations as opposed to being put on
by the car makers so much as a result
you typically don't see a lot of new car
unveils major new concepts or new
technologies announced there but they're
out there and it's a great way for you
to see the latest cars that have already
been announced and unveiled somewhere
else now aside from these great emails
we continue to get a slew of them from
you every day about this VW admissions
debacle so I thought I'd answer them
kind of in a big bundle with a top five
my top five things that I believe VW has
to address to dig out of this hole
number five find someone to run VW
America the guy who was lined up to be
the new boss in the US just bailed he
said his wife didn't want to move here
can you blame her she might run into
someone from the Sierra Club and
apparently VW had no Backup Exec lined
up I put this down at number five
because VW has to keep making progress
on number four through number one
whether they have a leader in the US or
not but companies tend to do better with
less chaos number four get to the bottom
of all this who knew when did they know
it and was there a C in their job title
those are all key when it comes to the
severity of fines and the depth of
firings that are coming now VW America's
current boss Michael horn told Congress
a couple of Engineers were responsible
for this whole cheating tech this
physics couple of software engineers who
put this info whatever reasons that
tells me either The Wizard of Oz is his
favorite movie or VW is the worst
overseen engineering company in the
world neither prospect seems encouraging
number three compensate stakeholders
everybody has their hand out many of
them rightly so start with VW owners who
now find themselves making monthly
payments on a question mark wrapped in a
stigma riding on four wheels it took
just hours for class-action lawsuits to
crop up all over then their stockholders
they saw 40% of their value wiped out in
30 days that's like a tech stock
interest in cars is killing the dealers
Kelly Blue Book reports VW Interest off
18 percent TrueCar says VW diesel
interest off over half Automotive News
says dealers aren't happy about either
number as you can imagine and the
Federal Trade Commission is out there on
behalf of all Americans saying that VW
lied deceptive ads with all those clean
diesel commercials analysts put a rough
price tag of forty billion dollars on
cleaning up this whole mess when
everyone's paid
number two get TDI back on the road
let's not forget VW diesels were hot
accounting for 24 percent of their US
sales in 2014 so they gotta bring them
back
now the Oh 9 to 15 cars have known
cheating software but the 16s also have
software the EPA believes is at least
suspect so all of them are in quarantine
in the port part the VW Plant South
Carolina a combination of new software
new fuel injection hardware under the
hood and possibly new urea injection
gear under the chassis look like the
complex messy path by which TDI's will
come back to market and will you even
like your car after that early test by
Consumer Reports found that power and
mpg suffered noticeably when they took
some cars and tricked them into running
clean number one fix the cars we already
owned this matters most because current
owners spent real money on what turned
out to be a lie that may not work as
well when it is fixed it may be worth
less when they want to sell it and it's
gonna make them uninterested in
recommending one in the car business
everything starts and ends with happy
customers the u.s. the Europeans in
California have given VW a variety of q4
2015 deadlines to at least get the fixes
design and then plan a recall and nobody
yet has ruled out a massive buyback if
the fix makes the car kind of crummy
it's gonna be a busy remainder of the
decade for what's shaping up to be
nonetheless the world's largest
automaker
thanks for watching really appreciate
you doing so and I hope you enjoyed this
episode
keep those emails coming - on cars at
cnet.com especially interested if you've
got some insights if you're an owner of
a Volkswagen TDI affected in this whole
admissions debacle if you've had any
interactions with Volkswagen or your
local dealer Bri is out there on the
front line and let us know what's going
on I'll see you next time we check the
tap
