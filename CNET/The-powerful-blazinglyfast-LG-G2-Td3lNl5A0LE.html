edge screen and yes it's got its buttons
on the back hello everybody it's Lynn la
here from Cena and today we're going to
take a closer look at LG's newest
flagship handset the g2 the g2 is LG's
most powerful smartphone yet it's
equipped with Qualcomm's ultra-fast
Snapdragon 800 quad-core CPU and with a
processing speed of 2.26 gigahertz rest
assured it's fast and smooth it sports
an expansive 5.2 inch LCD display that
has a 1080p resolution and 423 PPI
thanks to what LG calls dule routing
technology the screen runs edge to edge
with the 0.1 inch thick bezel the screen
is bright images are crisp and vibrant
and you can use the touchscreen with
gloves on one of the unique features of
the phone is the fact that its power and
volume keys are on the back LG claims
this position is more intuitive and
comfortable for the user personally I
found this location neither
life-changing nor that jarring it does
take some time to get used to and you
run the risk of smudging the camera lens
with your finger but eventually it's
generally easy to get the hang of like
other smartphone frontrunners available
now the g two ships with Android 4.2
point2 jellybean it'll come with your
expectant number of google apps but LG
also crammed a lot of new UI features
and motion controls for instance
knock-on allows you to wake the phone up
with a simple double tap there's guests
mode a privacy protection setting that
launches when a guest unlock your
handset with a different drawing pattern
than your own capture plus lets you take
screenshots of entire web pages and
slide aside enables you to pull up three
apps of your choosing by somewhat
awkwardly swiping three fingers across
the display in addition to a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera there's also a 13
megapixel camera as well it can record
1080p full HD video and comes with a few
features including image stabilization
and tracking zoom which lets you zoom in
on a particular object or person while
recording background video powering this
all is a 3 amp you our embedded battery
that gives you a reported talk time of
18 hours or standby time of 20
nine days the g2 also features two gigs
of RAM and 32 gigs of internal storage
unfortunately however there is no
expandable storage option the handset is
available across all four major US
carriers on ATT verizon and sprint it's
currently going for about two hundred
dollars on contract on t-mobile's
prepaid plan it will cost a total of six
hundred and four dollars again I'm Lynn
and you've been checking out the LG g2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
