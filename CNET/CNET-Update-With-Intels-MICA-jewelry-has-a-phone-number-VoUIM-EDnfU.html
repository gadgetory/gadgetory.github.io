fashion I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update an avalanche of
high-tech fitness tracking bracelets and
smart watches are hitting the market
this holiday most of the designs so far
have been on the sporty side perfect for
the hoodie toting techie but there are a
few wearable gadgets for the female
fashionista with Fashion Week kicking
off in New York intelli showing off a
new luxury smart bracelet called the
mica it's created in partnership with
the fashion company called opening
ceremony it's essentially jewelry with
its own phone number that means you need
a data plan it receives text messages
which are displayed on the curves
sapphire screen on the wrist and it also
will be able to show other notifications
you can charge it wirelessly or with a
USB cord the port is hidden inside the
clasp as for the fashion half its decked
out in snakeskin tiger's eye and
obsidian this is a luxury product so
don't be too shocked on the price intel
says it will cost under a thousand
dollars Intel is getting into wearables
because the market has huge growth
potential but why go into the luxury
market here's what until vice president
of new devices had to say it's because
we have to expand the market we believe
the consumers needs aesthetics and they
need various different usage models so
we think our jewelry like bracelet will
be an interesting step forward we're
also getting a look at a high-end robot
vacuum from Dyson called the 360 I
expected to cost more than that bracelet
it could be around twelve hundred
dollars there's a 360 degree camera up
top that scans where it needs to clean
next and there's an app so you can
remotely program it its first coming to
Japan next year aside from new gadgets
this is also a week of troubling tech
news Home Depot is investigating reports
of a data breach that could have
compromised customer credit cards Home
Depot says it will provide free credit
monitoring to anyone affected but that's
not all popular science reports that 17
feet cell phone towers have been found
across the u.s. and these phony towers
have the ability to spy on phone call
intercept messages and load a phone with
spyware and you wouldn't even know this
is happening this was discovered by the
engineers that created the crypto phone
500 that's a special encrypted android
phone normal cell phones automatically
connect to the closest cell tower and
these towers are labeled as being from a
specific carrier like Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
but when there's a cell tower without a
name the crypto phone alerts the owner
of a bogus tower it's known that
government agencies use dummy towers as
interceptors for espionage as of this
report it's unclear who is running these
towers but several were found on US
military bases that's your tech news
