sony alpha il ce7 otherwise known as the
a7 there's a lot to like about this
camera it's got a 24 megapixel
full-frame sensor which delivers
reasonably sharp images that have a
nicely broad dynamic range JPEGs are
pretty clean through iso 800 and if you
shoot raw you can push that hired though
depending upon the scene the JPEGs might
be okay as high as iso 12800 the video
looks good without any unexpected
artifacts it's got nice tonality even in
low-light the camera is also quite well
designed it's got a sturdy magnesium
alloy body a relatively large bright
contrast electronic viewfinder and a
bright tilting LCD the controls are
pretty customizable with all the
frequently needed settings at or near
the surface I do wish some of the
buttons were more pronounced and I
dislike the feel and location of the
movie record button but these are more
than made up for by controls like the
auto manual focus override toggle place
them into the SD card slot on the side
rather than in the battery compartment
the support for USB charging an exposure
compensation dial a grip sufficiently
large for shooting with heavy a mount
lenses and other amenities I don't
really have any complaints about the
feature set while I wish it had a
built-in flash that's frequently
excluded from full-frame models in
addition to the EVF and the tilting LCD
the a7 supports Wi-Fi with NFC along
with apps from Sony's proprietary
PlayMemories app store while it offers
better performance than it's more
expensive sibling the a7r and it's also
competitively fast as similar DSLRs it
does have a really slow startup which
may frustrate some folks and the burst
shooting performance doesn't match
competitors the battery life is also
kind of poor for a camera in this price
class if you want full frame photo
quality in a great shooting experience
in a compact model it's a good choice
just carry a spare battery and don't get
frustrated by the occasional
sluggishness i'm laura grinning from
cnet and this is the sony alpha il ce7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
