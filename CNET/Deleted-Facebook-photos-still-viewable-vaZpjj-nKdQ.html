Carey on cnet.com and it's time to get
loaded so you know that embarrassing
photo you deleted from your facebook
profile
yeah chances are it never actually was
deleted the website Ars Technica is
reporting that photos deleted from
facebook can still be accessed that is
if you have the direct link to the
original photo some photos that were
deleted over three years ago we're still
accessible Facebook admitted that
deleted photos stay alive for an
indefinite time and that it is currently
working on a way to make the process
quicker but this problem was first
reported a year ago and Facebook has yet
to have found a solution to this privacy
nightmare another Facebook news starting
next month Facebook could be adding
advertisements to its mobile site and
smartphone apps the Financial Times is
reporting that Facebook is working on
displaying featured stories in the news
feed for users accessing Facebook on a
mobile device and it could start as
early as March Facebook would like
company sponsor stories within a
newsfeed to highlight when a friend has
interacted with a brand just last week
Facebook revealing its offering to go
public that it doesn't make a
significant amount of money from the
growing number of mobile users changes
are coming for windows on all platforms
for starters say goodbye to that Start
button on the next Windows operating
system Microsoft is releasing a consumer
preview of Windows 8 and early images
show there is no Start button in the
bottom bar Microsoft is keeping the
bottom bar shortcut area to pin programs
which currently exist in Windows 7 but
although there is no Start button
sources report that hovering a mouse
into the lower left corner will produce
a navigation pop-up and there's change
to for Windows Phone 8 leaked details
indicate that Microsoft will let vendors
customize how they build a Windows Phone
so manufacturers can stand apart from
each other Microsoft used to insist on a
standard set of specs from all
manufacturers the new Windows Phone 8
operating system will also add support
for multi-core processors and near-field
communications for mobile payments the
details were published by website
PocketNow which also says Windows Phone
8 will launch at the end of this year
with a hundred thousand apps available
and Skype services may play a larger
role in the operator
system the PlayStation Network name will
no longer exist on Wednesday the
playstation network will be rebranded
and integrated into the Sony
Entertainment Network the move is to
bring all Sony content into one
platforms that have splitting it up
between different network names Sony
said there will be no interruption to
the game services during the transition
and if you caught the end of the
superbowl you know it was quite an
action-packed ending between the Giants
and the Patriots and it resulted in an
explosion of tweets in the last three
minutes there was an average of 10,000
tweets a second about the game those are
