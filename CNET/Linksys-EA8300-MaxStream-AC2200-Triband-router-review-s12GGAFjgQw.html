tri-band router is a mouthful it's also
a pretty good router with a whole lot of
bells and whistles
it has multi-user MIMO and beamforming
for better performance on multiple
devices Network prioritization to help
allocate which devices can use more
bandwidth to 5 gigahertz bands with band
steering to help your devices utilize
the best signal and a user-friendly
setup to keep everyone happy a key
shortcoming is it's AC 2200 class rating
yes I know ratings aren't reality but
400 megabits per second and the 2.4
gigahertz band and 867 megabits per
second on each 5 gigahertz band are well
below the top speeds available on many
tri-band routers the good news as with
all routers is that those theoretical
speeds are pretty much unreachable
anyway as for real-world speeds
I got remarkable consistency on the 2.4
gigahertz band the router performed at
110 megabits per second 7 feet away and
the same speeds two rooms and 50 feet
away you rarely see that kind of
consistency in a router the 5 gigahertz
band did drop off a ton as more distance
and obstacles were introduced which is
normal in that frequency but it showed a
top speed of over 650 megabits per
second in the same room that's really
good the ei 8300 also employs seamless
roaming so you can combine it with
another Mac stream access point to get
top speeds throughout your house without
losing your connection I think small to
medium-sized homes with few obstructions
will see the most benefit from the
router especially on the 5 gigahertz
band it's priced right at $199 mostly
due to its high-end features if you want
a low-profile solid router that is for
the most part future-proof the link says
Ã«i 8300 should work well for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
