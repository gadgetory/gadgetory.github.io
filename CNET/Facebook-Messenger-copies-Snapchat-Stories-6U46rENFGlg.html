the messenger chat app now has a feature
that is just like snapchat stories you
can throw words and doodles and stickers
on a video or photo and post it for all
of your friends to see for 24 hours and
then poof it disappears but instead of
stories a face book calls it messenger
day and it is rolling out globally now
to iOS and Android users but keep in
mind this is not on the main Facebook
app this is all within the separate
messenger app use it as a creative way
to tell folks on messenger how you're
feeling what adventures you're having or
if you want to share your date moments
with specific friends there are more
than 5,000 effects to add to videos and
photos and it being messenger it's easy
to chat to reply to someone's day post
and then start a combo it also works the
other way around if you send something
to one friend you're gonna get a prompt
to add that photo or video to your day
for more people to see of course this is
not the first app to copy snapchats fun
photo story concept Instagram has also
been doing this and whatsapp also added
the feature both companies which happen
to be owned by Facebook people want to
share their lives through photos and
make it fun with filters and effects
snapchat got it right and Facebook wants
to mimic that magic you know the hole
can't beat them join them philosophy but
this could really sting for snapchat
Facebook has more than 1.8 billion
active users
what's up has 1.2 billion Instagram has
more than 600 million and snapchat which
sparked this whole phenomenon well it's
tiny in comparison with 158 million
people maybe it won't matter who was
first when others are bigger I'm Bridget

tricks of using the new messenger Day
