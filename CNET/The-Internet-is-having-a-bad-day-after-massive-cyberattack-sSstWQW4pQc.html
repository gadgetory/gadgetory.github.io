major websites including Twitter Spotify
Reddit and iheartradio experienced
technical difficulties Friday with
service appearing to be down or
unresponsive the culprit was a massive
distributed denial-of-service attack on
a domain name system host that works
behind the scenes to keep websites
running smoothly the hosts din DNS
announced that it was hit by an
overwhelming amount of traffic from
multiple sources it's an attack method
usually employed to disable a website
but in this case the attack was on a
service that manages multiple websites
and the outages were mostly felt by
folks on the East Coast din DNS was able
to restore services at about nine-thirty
a.m. eastern time which was about two
and a half hours after the attack began
the host will not say which websites it
works with but suddenly when its
services were up and running so were
many websites that were previously down
earlier in the day so it's safe to say
these outages were related that's it for
