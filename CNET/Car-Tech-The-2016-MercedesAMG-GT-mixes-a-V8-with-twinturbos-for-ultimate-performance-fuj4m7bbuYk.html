in production but if you had your heart
set on a two-seater performance car for
Mercedes don't fret because we've got a
new car here this is the new AMG GT and
it's even more affordable than the SLS
if you consider a car starting at 125
thousand euro to be affordable the star
of the show is a new 4-liter v8 engine
with dual turbochargers I should mount
it inside the V Mercedes says this gives
me more performance in a traditional
turbocharger layup it's also got dry
sump lubrication that means there's no
oil pan hanging down below motor can be
mounted lower in the all-new aluminum
chassis that v8 is connected to a
7-speed dual-clutch transmission which
mounted in the back giving us a
53-percent rear bias weight distribution
which gives us great handling and also
great acceleration 0 to 60 in less than
4 seconds let's take a step inside they
can see their side as you'd expect we've
got lots of premium materials carbon
fiber everywhere brushed aluminium lots
of leather the buttons are laid out some
four buttons on either side to mimic the
v8 inside which is a nice a nice touch
we've also got the latest command
interface although it's not working in
this model we're expecting to be the
same as an s550 which reads looked at
the nice upgrade over the earlier
command models we've got paddle shifters
here for the dual-clutch gearbox of
course and ultimately a nice simple
interior Mercedes hasn't announced
whether or not this will have apples car
play but we have to imagine that it will
you and Mercedes making a big push
towards support for apple system but in
front the car is distinctly Mercedes
with this long low hood that covers up
the v8 that slung underneath I have to
say it looks pretty great in this matte
silver color which will be one of the
many options that Mercedes will be happy
to sell you when your specking out your
AMG GT again the price starts at 125
thousand euro here in Europe American
prices have not been announced just yet
but expect them to be similar maybe 110
thousand dollars enough again plenty of
options to choose from Racine's will
give you a lots of choices respecting
out yours i'm tim stevens at the paris
auto show and this is the mercedes-benz
AMG GT
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
