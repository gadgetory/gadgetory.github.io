average desktop this machine has two
Xeon processors to Quadro video cards
and can handle up to 14 terabytes of
storage and 512 gigs of ram how does HP
pack all that tech into a nearly tooless
case that's super quiet well let's find
out I'm Bill Detweiler and this is
cracking open designed for
mission-critical high-end computing
tasks the z8 xx workstation is one of
the most powerful computers you can fit
under your desk and it's remarkably
quiet and a cinch to work on but even
before I crack this beast open let's
look at the outside of the case which
has several really nice features first
are the handles along the top i'll
fully-loaded
z8 xx can top 50 pounds so these are
very helpful when moving the machine
another movement-related feature are the
skids along the bottom now these help
you slide the machine out from under
your desk when you need to access the
ports in the back now when it comes time
to open the case the side panels large
handle makes removing the panel a snap
inside the machine it's equally clear
this isn't your average PC like the z1
workstation which I cracked open earlier
this year the 820 has distinct cooling
zones one for the power supply a second
one for the motherboard and memory and a
third one for the i/o area where the
graphics cards and other expansion slots
are along with these distinct zones HP
also routed the internal cables along
the side and bottom of the case to
improve airflow most of the machines
components can be removed without tools
and HP shows you where to grab each part
with these handy green indicators i'll
start by removing the power supply which
is a massive eleven hundred and fifty
watt unit which has two internal fans
the i/o shroud comes off next revealing
our machines two nvidia quadro 4000
video cards and a ton of expansion slots
the motherboard and memory cooling
ascent
Lia's next this large plastic unit has
six separate fans one for each processor
and one for each of the machines four
memory banks the hard drive racks are
next our machine has a single hard drive
but the machine can support up to 14
terabytes of storage the optical drive
and upper drive racks glide out after
disconnecting the drive cables and
releasing this catch the video cards can
also be removed after detaching their
cables and depressing a small latch
above each one and lastly you can pop
out the two IOT's own cooling fans once
they've been disconnected from the
motherboard at this point the
motherboard processors RAM cables and a
few other components are still inside
the case although the memory chips come
out like regular dims you'll need a
screwdriver to remove any of the other
components but as these machine come
with a three-year parts and on-site
labor warranty if the processor fails HP
will send a technician out to replace it
now the most interesting feature on the
motherboard are the processor heat sinks
which look like miniature car radiators
on our model which is liquid cooled also
HP staggered the position of the
processors this is done to prevent heat
from the front CPU from being blown
across the rear one now my complaints
about the z8 20 or minor and few first
the hard drive rails are plastic they're
sturdy when attached to the drive but
you wouldn't want to be too rough with
them by themselves second I wish the
green handle markings inside the case
were marked with numbers it took me a
few minutes to figure out that I had to
remove the i/o shroud before removing
the motherboard cooling assembly overall
the Z 820 is a well-built machine that's
a pleasure to work on and it reminds me
what I hate about so many other pcs
especially all in ones that are nearly
impossible for owners and even in-house
IT staff to work on a pricing for the Z
820 starts at 22 99 us and goes up from
there to see more tear down photos and
read my full hardware analysis
go to TechRepublic calm forward-slash
cracking open I'm bill Detweiler thanks
