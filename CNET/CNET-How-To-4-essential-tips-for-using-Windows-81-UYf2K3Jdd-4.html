some the move to Windows 8.1 from an
earlier version can be overwhelming but
it doesn't have to be I'm Dan Graziano
and in today's how to I'm going to share
with you a few simple tips that you
should know when using Windows 8.1 one
of the things I hate the most is the
sign in screen even if you don't have a
password set you still have to see this
screen well I'm going to show you how to
bypass it open the charms menu which can
be accessed by clicking the lower right
hand corner of the screen or hitting the
windows and C button at the same time on
the keyboard select the search feature
type n ET plw I Z and select the first
result in the pop-up window that opens
uncheck the option users must enter our
username and password to use this
computer and click OK if you previously
had a password you will be required to
enter it to confirm the change the next
time you restart windows you will now go
straight to the Start screen and won't
be required to sign in next up default
apps microsoft sets Internet Explorer as
the default browser in Windows 8.1 to
change this and other apps go to the
charms menu and click on settings next
select change PC options click on
certain apps and choose defaults from
here you can change the default web
browser email client music player and
more but what happens if your computer
breaks or your hard drive fails you will
lose everything well not necessarily you
can actually create an entire backup of
your system to do this launch the
control panel from the desktop choose
system and security followed by file
history at the bottom of the screen you
will find the system image backup option
you can then use the system image you
created to restore all of your old data
in the event your hard drive or computer
stops working and last but not least
updates microsoft routinely issues
patches that include bug fixes and new
features for windows having the latest
version installed on your computer will
keep your system more secure and running
better to check to see if there are any
updates available for your system
in the settings click on update and
recovery and select check for updates
