researching how to capture and mine
asteroids NASA is innovating in ways
that just a few years ago were
unimaginable I visited Johnson Space
Center for a tour of their robotics lab
where engineers are designing robots to
be used in the next generation of space
travel meet Robonaut he has a head torso
to arms he's 300 pounds and a version of
him is currently on the space station
assisting astronaut versus a first for
NASA I'm gonna meet him right now so
what are the kinds of things that you're
hoping to have it be able to do in the
future
it's the ultimate goal is for it to be
outside the space station helping the
crew with things like worksite setup
what will make this possible is a
complex set of systems inside the robot
all the motors for the hand are actually
back here in the forearm and they
actually pull and push on content ins
and tight mystically to be able to move
each of the finger joint Wow so that's
how this motion is actually being
created so that works basically just
like the muscle systems above it's been
yeah it's very similar yeah and we've
got four sensors also on all those
tenants so they can detect how much
force were pulling on with the fingers
we could control the grip strength here
is Robonaut s-- hand with the skin off
it's pretty awesome if not a little
creepy if you've seen terminator what's
inside the the chest torso area sure so
robots brain is not in said is actually
right here in the chest so we've got a
computer cage in here that does all the
heavy duty processing so when will he be
programmed to feel loved it's on the
list
Robonaut can do a surprising number of
things it can shake hands it can use a
drill and it can even lift weights so I
hear that Robonaut is a champion
weightlifter it's pretty good can we
have them a one on one sure absolutely
lots versus humans for the fate of
humanity all right
I can do that much he likes slow control
that's the way to maximize your pump I
like your style
all right point point maid Ramona you
have this round would you care for a
game of chess that's amazing
I feel like a battle mech or Iron Man
Robonaut is just one way NASA is using
robotics to assist with necessary human
functions the other is with this
exoskeleton
it weighs 57 pounds and it uses robotics
to give you added movement collect data
and give you potentially superhuman
strength NASA wants astronauts to be
able to wear suits like this while in
space possibly giving them extra stamina
and strength I wish I could convey to
you exactly how I feel the words fail me
even though the motors aren't
operational I'm not getting the added
strength and benefit that these are
eventually going to give I feel like if
I jumped I would leap out of this
building right now it's an incredible
feeling yeah when the motors are powered
when they are turned on it
augmented our strength and it augments
their ability so right now there are
four degrees of freedom four active
degrees of freedom at the hips and the
knees so that you can feel that gear in
here and your other degrees of freedom
right what is all this stuff so what you
have here in the backpack is your main
brain stem computer okay so if you think
about it you have one main computer that
then does distributing computing
throughout each of the joints well you
could imagine it replacing the need for
forklifts or you know just doing sort of
mundane tasks where you could lift and
move things than normal humans could be
you know people talk about this is the
decade of the exoskeleton and it's just
gonna get lighter and smaller from here
Wow
so you're saying this is the decade of
the exoskeleton so by the end of this
decade
I'm gonna have one of these is what
you're promising me III think that is
very pop of course you can see where all
this research is headed first NASA then
someday who knows maybe we'll all be
wearing robotic suits can you say Iron
Man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
