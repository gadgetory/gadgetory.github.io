the feature-packed hero4 silver in
september 2014 the former is the
company's first true budget camera
the latter its first with a built-in
touchscreen and in June Along Came this
the hero+ LCD which combines the two
giving you a streamlined feature set
with the benefits of a touchscreen
I'm Josh Goldman we've seen it and like
the hero the hero plus is built into its
waterproof housing so the micro SD card
slot and the micro USB port are moved to
the back and it sheds the micro HDMI
video output of the silver more
importantly it means you can't pop in a
new battery for a fresh one or replace
the housing should you damage it
shooting options are a step up from the
hero as the plus can do 1080p at 60
frames per second which makes for
smoother action and can be slowed down
slightly for slow-motion clips you can
get about two hours of battery life at
that resolution but again after that
you'll need to charge or use an external
power source to keep shooting there are
some other minor feature bumps but it's
the screen that really makes the
difference here letting you change
settings shooting modes and most
importantly preview and review and even
cut out Clips right on the camera you do
get built-in Wireless too for connecting
to a mobile device for controlling
viewing and sharing the biggest rub is
the price because at $300 in the u.s.
250 pounds in the UK and 430 in
Australia you can get more capable
cameras from other makers but without
the touchscreen and the video quality
while very good is well shy of what the
hero4 silver can do for $100 more you
can read the full review on cnet.com but
basically it's an above-average camera
with a touchscreen with a premium price
I'm Josh Coleman and that's a quick look
at the GoPro Hero Plus LCD
