there's a cheaper easier way to give
your current Mac a serious performance
boost in my case I have a mid 2009
MacBook Pro that is so incredibly slow I
basically stopped using it so the
solution here is to replace my current
hard drive with an SSD or solid-state
drive SSDs are blazing fast compared to
hard drives plus they're surprisingly
easy to install so let me show you how
to do it you'll need an SSD in this case
I have a Samsung 840 Evo it's 500 gigs
so I'm also getting a nice storage
upgrade a SATA to USB adapter or dock in
this case I have a dock plus a
screwdriver with a regular Phillips head
and a Torx head one will be used to
dismantle the MacBook the other will be
used to remove the hard drive and
finally you'll need a program called
superduper it's free you can download it
online and we'll use it to clone our
hard drive so the first thing we want to
do is dock the SSD so I'll just plug it
into here goes right in
now we'll prep the drive by launching
Disk Utility then we'll select the drive
from the left sidebar should show up as
500 gigabyte Samsung so we'll select
that click erase I'll call it Sharon and
finally hit erase once it's done you'll
see the new Drive show up on the desktop
under the new name and now we're ready
to clone so I'll launch superduper will
copy the macintosh HD to sharon using
backup all files and finally we'll hit
copy now at this point take a break go
grab a bite to eat because this could
take anywhere from 20 minutes to a few
hours depending on how much data you
have on your current drive the process
is finally complete it took us about an
hour and a half and if we did everything
correctly once I put that SSD in my
computer it should
as usual so let's go ahead and do just
that on the back there are ten screws
for along here and a couple on each side
so I'll grab this Phillips head
screwdriver and start taking it apart
here we go
I'm afraid to see what's under there aha
lots of dust so I do have some
compressed air here this is a really
good opportunity to get rid of some of
that dust now it's time to remove the
current harddrive so I'll use the same
screwdriver to take out this bracket
that comes out and now the harddrive
should come out really easily be really
careful here though you do not want to
damage this ribbon right here if you do
that then you really will need to buy a
new computer remove this connector here
now before you put this aside we need to
remove four more screws but we'll use
the Torx head instead of the Phillips
okay you also want to remove this
sticker and put it on the SSD so you can
remove this easily if you ever need to
take it out again now we'll replace
those four screws and do everything in
Reverse oh okay now it's time for the
moment of truth will boot up the
computer now the first time you boot it
up it might take a little bit longer
than usual
but once it's ready it should be a lot
faster with the SSD in here Wow iTunes
and iPhoto launched super fast my
computer feels a lot more slick and I'm
so impressed it was such an easy way to
boost my computer's performance without
having to go to the store and buy a new
machine
