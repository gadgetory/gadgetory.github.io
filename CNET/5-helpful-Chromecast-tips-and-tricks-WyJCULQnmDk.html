stream your favorite movies TV shows and
music to your television and while it
may not seem feature-packed out of the
box : cast has a lot of hidden features
that are just beneath the surface here
are five tips and tricks you can try
with your chromecast believe it or not
you can use your chromecast to turn on
your TV that is if your TV supports CEC
while most manufacturers call CEC
something different it's a common
feature on most modern televisions just
enable this feature then make sure the
chromecast is plugged into a power
adapter and not a USB port on the TV
then whenever you try to cast something
and the TV is off chromecast will first
turn on the TV before starting to stream
when not in use as an added benefit
chromecast will display various images
on your television to help prevent image
burnin in the Google home at under
backdrop settings you can select how
fast these images update and also what
sources are displayed you can also
enable weather and news headlines as
well as your own photos from Google
photos Facebook and Flickr using a phone
to control what's playing on your
television isn't always convenient
however if your television remote has
play impulse controls you can use those
instead to control the chromecast
without having to reach for your phone
as a plus if you have Google home you
can actually use it to control your TV
using your voice just say ok Google stop
the TV after the initial setup of a
chromecast you don't really need to
tweak the settings or mess with the
hardware however if something goes awry
you may need to perform a factory data
reset that can be done in one of two
ways either press the button along the
edge of the chromecast and hold it for
approximately 25 seconds or in the
Google home F go to devices have the
action overflow button for that specific
device and select settings in the next
menu hit the action overflow button one
more time and select factory reset
finally you can play mobile games with
your chromecast to find compatible
titles open the Google home app and look
for games under the discover tab once
you install and open a game compatible
with chromecast tap the cast icon to
begin streaming it to your television
you can then use your phone as the
controller and for multiplayer games you
can use Android or iOS games together
long as the game is available on both
platforms more tips on chromecast and
