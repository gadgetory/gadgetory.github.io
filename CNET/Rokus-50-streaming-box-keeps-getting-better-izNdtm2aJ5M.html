and we're gonna take a look at the Roku
LT this is one of the top home theater
products on the market and it's
available for just $50 it's essentially
the same compact streaming video box
that Roku released last year but it's
gotten a few software and hardware
updates in the meantime on the hardware
side it's largely the same compact
purple box with built in Wi-Fi although
it doesn't have dual band Wi-Fi that's
available on the Roku streaming stick
the big change on the back is that the
LT now has full-size analog video
outputs rather than needing to use a
breakout cable like on last year's model
you'll also notice an HDMI output on the
back but there's no Ethernet or USB port
on this model so you'll need to step up
to one of Roku's more expensive boxes if
you want those features the included
remote is excellent and it's really
simple to use which that's a directional
pad some playback controls and a few
additional buttons it's also a great
size that fits nicely in your hand
rather than some of those super thin
credit card style remotes that are
included with some other boxes the
software and user interface is largely
the same although there have been some
improvements the Roku LT continues to
stream a huge selection of services
including Netflix Hulu Plus Amazon
Instant Video HBO Go Pandora RDO MLB TV
and Vudu was recently added the big
missing services at this point are
YouTube and Spotify so if you really
want those you are gonna have to look
elsewhere on the other hand Roku still
has over 600 other channels to choose
from so there's just a lot of content
that you can find on this box
Roku also recently added something
called Roku search which lets you find
content across Netflix Amazon Instant
Hulu Plus HBO Go and Vudu this is a
feature that isn't offered on many
competitors and it makes it much easier
to find content that you may not
remember what service it's actually on
another new feature is play on roku
which is basically Roku's answer to
airplay load up the roku app on your
smart phone select play on and it lets
you stream music and photos stored
your phone right to your TV it's not
quite as nice as airplay since it
doesn't work with third-party apps but
for many people it's going to be good
enough
the final question many may have about
the Roku LT is at 720p output especially
when most competing boxes have 1080p
output but honestly in my testing the
lower resolution just isn't noticeable
especially if you have a TV that's 50
inches or less so unless you're really
picky about image quality I wouldn't
consider the Roku 720p output much in
your buying decision so altogether the
Roku LT continues to be a killer
streaming video box that keeps getting
better with an incredible $50 price tag
if you're invested in the Apple
ecosystem you'll still want to seriously
consider the Apple TV but for everyone
else the Roku LT is an unbeatable value

this is the Roku LT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
