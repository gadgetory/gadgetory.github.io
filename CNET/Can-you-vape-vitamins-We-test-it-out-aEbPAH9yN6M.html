vitamins by nutria I'm a big fan of
future foods like Soylent so but
somebody pitched the idea of inhalable
nutrition I was like sure we got to try
that thing up now our samples came with
a little book there are three different
here we've got energy focused and relax
supposed to have those moods after you
try it out and this booklet says there's
no nicotine in new trailer devices and
also because it bypasses the digestive
system a minimal amount of the
nutritional supplement is needed so get
to your bloodstream faster let's round
up some test subjects and I see how this
thing works out in this very highly
unscientific test I'll go with energy
for now I'm use a pick-me-up the boxes
suck do you - too late I feel like
nothing healthy would come in a package
like this I'm really bad at swallowing
big pills so and I like the soothing
sensation of something okay caffeine
taurine amino acids so it's like an
inhalable Red Bull okay
oh it's kind of like a hookah there's no
scent to this home but I'm gonna be
really peppy
is that a challenge I want to say I feel
energy but I'm not sure I mean I feel
like to get a proper benchmark you got
to sit here for like five minutes or
something but I'm just gonna pile these
on so I'm gonna be like high as a kite
is this like like taking a espresso shot
or something but I can't look like a
total dork see now that I'm all hopped
up can I try the relaxed all right oh
it's blue and relaxing color I like that
it's got a little cartoon meditation on
it that's appropriate well I need to get
into the Zen zone my deadlines
approaching don't be nervous just suck
on your stick I feel relaxed
I don't know if it's too soon to tell
but I do feel relaxed this it might be
all placebo like everything here might
be placebo but I do feel something going
on and I like it but there's many other
things I could smoke to feel relaxed
definitely not no no I'm I'm not more
relaxed what does focus taste like I
mean is that really a vitamin if I can
help me focus more I'm a just me
preoccupied with this I don't know am I
supposed to like stare off into the
universe and my god it's full of stars
it seems so silly
I was just straight-up mint feels like
nothing is happening with this one I
could see this working like same at an
airport and have anxiety or something
and you know you can't just light up
there so you go you know something like
this I mean I never like taking my
vitamins as a kid I used to hide all
those little Flintstones chewables like
in the corner of my room I never I never
liked the taste of them so I guess this
is a better way to take your vitamins
then how much do these cost this is it's
a great idea I love the idea if you told
me that if I smoke this twice a day I
would get all the vitamins I need for
the day I would love it I guess you
could have combo packs right go get a
little crazy
smooth
it just tastes like bad robitussin like
robitussin that was left out for like 30
years no I would hope not because I
think I'm going to live forever now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
