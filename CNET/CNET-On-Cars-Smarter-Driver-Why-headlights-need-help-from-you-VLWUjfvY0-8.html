you're about to out drive your
headlights
you're probably driving in the speed or
what you can hit
is out there beyond what you can see you
can remedy it with better lights and
more use of them a recent study by the
Automobile Club of Southern California's
Automotive Research Center says
bottom-line better headlights should be
standard on a luxury tech option they
examine the real-world performance of
three basic families of headlights first
halogen headlights like what I've got
here on the 88 Ford and what maybe 80%
of cars on the road in the u.s. today
have as well then high-intensity
discharge headlights those are the ones
give you that kind of whitish blue
really intense beat and finally LED
headlights which to be honest are still
pretty exotic and rare they examine each
kind of headlight technology for its
reach that would be how well it can
illuminate something non reflective like
an animal or a typically dressed person
on a road without overhead street lights
which by the way to count for like forty
percent of the miles we drive each year
they say the results well first of all
halogen just doesn't cut it you can
overdrive them as low as 40 miles an
hour
high-intensity and LED low beams extend
illumination by about 25% beyond halogen
high intensity and LED high beams got
out to nearly 500 feet and that covers
you up to about 55 miles an hour and
both those advanced types put out less
light here in the US than the same ones
on cars sold in Europe to regulatory
things now the behavior piece is
interesting they also found that most of
us are kind of shy about using our high
beams we're afraid to blind the guy in
front of us that were too lazy to sit
there and flick on flick off all the
time
so we overdrive our low beams typically
but this is kind of a shame because your
high beams can buy you 28% or so more
reaction time that's really a big deal
so three takeaways first use your high
beams see if the next car you buy offers
Auto high beams to do all the flicking
for you second opt for high-intensity or
LED headlights they really do make a
difference in reach
and third check your car for cloudy
headlamp lenses they don't just reduce
your range they also scatter more glare
at the other guy
it pays to double check if your car has
the most modern lighting technology
especially you're buying a new one so if
you're using your high beams and not
getting lazy and ignoring them and
realize that no matter what mode you're
in you're very likely out driving your
lights more realities of modern driving
