with cnet and this is a look at the sony
cybershot DSC tx200 V barely more than a
half an inch thick the TX 200v features
an 18-megapixel exmor r backside
illuminated sensor an internal 5x zoom
lens and a 3.3 inch ultra high
resolution oled touchscreen it's also
waterproof to 16 feet as well as dust
proof and freezeproof to 14 degrees
Fahrenheit it also has built-in GPS and
a lot of snapshot shooting options and
it can capture 1080 60p HD movies all in
all a very well appointed ultra compact
however and this is a pretty big however
well it's photos are good it's movies
are good and it's generally a pretty
quick camera there's just one thing I
can't get past it's its price tag which
is five hundred dollars but for that
much money it really seems like it
should do something more I don't know
maybe like dispense bacon I don't know
not you'd want to use bacon around this
anyway because it picks up fingerprints
like crazy and there's also this door on
the bottom battery compartment just
seems a little in substantial for
keeping water out so yeah this is
probably one of the most powerful point
and shoots for its size you're going to
find but Sony's really making you pay
for it I'm Josh Goldman and that's the
sony cyber-shot tx200 be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
