welcome to the Apple Viper everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now the top story this week comes from
all things D and they report Apple will
hold its next invitation-only event on
tuesday october the 22nd with iPads the
new mac pro and OSN mavericks being the
focus now ipad leaks continue to pour
out including these high-res images from
Sonny Dickson with a new iPad 5 in its
space gray color as well we've heard
rumblings of an improved camera but
we're just a few weeks out from the
official announcement the new Mac Pro's
won't be a surprise anymore but we'll
find out how pricey they come in at an
OS 10 Mavericks will also be featured
but a report from nine to five Mac says
Apple has already begun development on
its successor that's internally being
called sera after a type of wine after
this screen shot was now now if you want
to hear more Apple product rumors a
report from cnet says according to NPD
DisplaySearch predictions Apple is
planning multiple screen size
improvements and enhancement in 2014
including get ready for this list
because these are their predictions two
models of the iPhone including an iphone
6 with a 4.7 inch display and a phablet
size 5.7 inch iphone okay they also
talked about a 12 point nine inch big
ipad and ipad mini 2 with the retina
display and finally they expect to see a
retina macbook air and i watch with a
1.3 inch screen and the Apple TV in two
flavors a 55 inch and 65 inch screen
side so we'll check back with this list
in a year and see how they did all right
one of the new features in the iphone 5s
has been its camera a National
Geographic photographer jim richardson
decided to use the 5s to photograph the
Scottish Highlands and leave his nikon
DSLR behind although he found it
difficult to get used to it first he
described the 5s as a very capable
camera with amazingly good color and
exposures and he was a fan of the
panorama an option for taking square
photos to get into Instagram but I
should probably stress that not everyone
will be able to take pictures that look
this good with their iphone 5s in fact
they'll probably look more like this
alright let's take a break some people
are happy with Iowa
7 some people aren't and it runs
horribly on an iphone 4 don't even do
that if you can avoid it but here's a
how to for helping you save battery life
a new version of iOS means a fresh new
look handy new settings and a boatload
of features that have good intentions
but really just suck up your phone's
battery life so if you noticed your
phone is draining faster since updating
to iOS 7 or you want to know how to get
more juice out of it here are some tips
background app refresh is a feature that
lets background apps stay active while
you multitask the problem is that by
default all your apps aren't able to
refresh in the background which is a
huge battery hog head on over to
settings general then background app
refresh here you can disable the feature
entirely or you can disable just the
ones you don't absolutely want to
refresh iOS 7's automatic updates aren't
generally a problem but the last thing
you want is 15 apps to start updating
when your battery is at twenty percent
so turn that feature off just go to the
iTunes and App Store settings and
disable this updates option now you can
update your apps whenever it's best for
you one of the biggest battery drains is
always location tracking usually that
applies to using mapping apps but hidden
in your settings menu are a whole bunch
of new settings that sneakily track your
location under privacy go to location
services then scroll all the way down
and choose system services some of these
settings are designed to improve your
experience for instance popular near me
tracks your location to give you a pre
commend ations based on where you are go
ahead and disable any features you don't
absolutely need including this frequent
location setting at the bottom spotlight
is super useful because it lets you
search for almost anything on your phone
and the way it works is by constantly
crawling your phone for new data and
indexing it that's a huge battery drain
back in settings go to general spotlight
search and uncheck the items you don't
absolutely need indexed with that and
all the other
adjustments you should see a nice boost
in your battery life thanks for that one
share now on to the quick bytes there's
a lot of people asking about when iTunes
radio is coming to their neck of the
woods may not be as early as you like
but according to Bloomberg apples
planning to expand the service to the UK
Canada Australia and New Zealand by
early 2014 Samsung's Galaxy gear is
airing their commercials for the new
SmartWatch but it definitely has the
same feel to ashes original iphone ad
campaign it's just too bad that the
attempt to be first to market didn't
work out when it's getting hammered by
reviewers across the board and this is
pretty cool Johnny I've teamed up with
friend Mark Newsom create a few
one-of-a-kind products for an upcoming
product red charity auction now a couple
of the items 18 karat solid rose gold
Apple earpods that would kind of match
the phone but check this one out it's a
one-of-a-kind laser machined aluminum
body leica m camera that just looks sick
now it took eighty five days to create
it went through 561 different models and
nearly 1,000 prototype parts so this is
all pretty sweet stuff alright guys keep
sending us your emails to the apple bita
cnet com or tweet me up brian Tong and
i'll get to your questions when i can
that's gonna do for this week's show i
know it's kind of a short one but will
bring more for you next week i'm brian
Tong thanks for watching and we'll catch
you next time for another bite of the
Apple
