taking a first look an official first
look at the Motorola Xoom this is an
android-based tablet with a 10.1 inch
screen 32 gigabytes of storage and a
price tag of 800 dollars off contract or
$600 with the two-year commitment from
Verizon it's around the same size as the
original iPad although it has more of a
wide screen dimension and the bezel
around the screen isn't as wide it's
definitely heavier than the iPad which
sounds like a small complaint but
tablets are something you spend a lot of
time holding on the bottom you have
connections for microUSB and micro-hdmi
though you'll need a dock if you want to
get video out from this thing on the top
you have a headphone out and the door
that covers up the microSD memory card
slot for additional storage and a 4G SIM
card slot for the 4G support that's
coming later this year there's volume
control on the left side and on the back
you get a 5 megapixel camera and flash
and a pair of stereo speakers you also
see the power buttons over here on the
back now it's a little weird to have the
speakers blasting out away from you but
it's nice that you don't actually run
the risk of covering them up with your
hands you also get a 2 megapixel camera
on the front that works with video chat
apps like Google Talk one of the biggest
differences between the zoom and all the
Android tablets we reviewed in 2010 is
the lack of tactile navigation buttons
on the homescreen this is a good thing
controls for back search and menu have
all moved on to the touch screen thanks
to the latest version of Android made
specifically for tablets Verizon and
Motorola are the first to have Android
3.0 and it's a big part of why this
tablet is so special you get all the
stuff that makes Android great there's
full support for Android Market official
Google Apps for Gmail Maps GPS
navigation and calendar a lot has
changed though the browser has this
tabbed interface that works more like a
desktop browser than a smartphone you
get this nice big keyboard notifications
and settings are down here on the bottom
and generally all the included apps have
been overhauled for the largest screen
of the tablet so now the big question is
this thing a real competitor to the iPad
from my perspective there's no doubt
it's fast it's pretty and you can see
that a lot of
I went into the execution it's not cheap
though and with so many tablet options
coming out this year I stay away from
contracts like the plague
rising to Motorola how the lock on
android 3.0 for now but there are many
eager contenders on the horizon so
that's the Motorola Xoom from Verizon
