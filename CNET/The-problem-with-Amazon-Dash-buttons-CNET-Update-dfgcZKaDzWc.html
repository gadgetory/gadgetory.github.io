everyone I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update
last week amazon began selling its new
concept for shopping at the touch of a
button the Amazon - buttons are little
plastic Wireless pods you can hang or
stick anywhere in the home and the idea
is that when you're running out of a
certain product you would press the
button to have Amazon automatically ship
more of that product to your door
only Prime members can get these buttons
and you have to pay for the privilege of
having a button to press each cost five
dollars and they are decorated with the
logo of a specific household brand there
are 18 different branded buttons and I
ordered six to try out tied glad
Cottonelle bounty Gillette and Kraft
macaroni and cheese because who doesn't
need a mac and cheese panic button well
as fun as it all sounds you may find
yourself disappointed with the
limitations each brand limits what type
of product you can order with the button
for example the one for Gillette only
lets you order men's razors there are 15
different types of shaving products you
can assign to that button but none are
for the Gillette Venus women's brand all
of this is set up from your Amazon
shopping app you sync the button to your
home Wi-Fi and then you're given a list
of choices of what you want the button
to order GLAAD gives you 20 choices of
garbage bags and there are 16 different
types of mac-and-cheese including
something called cheddar explosion and
one with ninja turtle shapes all good
things in a cheese crisis but before you
buy a button the main amazon website
will show you the options of what the
button can buy but you may come across a
glitch in the early days I picked a tied
product that wasn't in the main list of
options and Amazon said it is fixing
that glitch as far as choice amazon says
it is working to grow its selection and
continuing to listen to customer
feedback but if you're tempted to buy
with a button be sure you live in a
place where the postal carrier can leave
the box at your doorstep otherwise if
you're like me in an apartment you may
have to go to the post office to pick up
that large 24 pack box of Bounty paper
towels and that doesn't make sense when
I can go to the store right away to buy
it in person meanwhile
it's been some buzz online about Amazon
changing its policy with Prime and how
many people you can share it with
currently you can only share the perks
of Prime free two-day shipping with one
other adult and it better be an adult
you love and trust because that person
now can also use your credit and debit
cards that you have on file before cards
were not linked at all and you could add
for other adults to share your Prime
privileges the benefits cost $100 a year
that's it for this tech news update and
