for medical marijuana to ease the pain
from his multiple sclerosis now all he
needs to do is place an order on his
phone and it can arrive at his door in
less than an hour I like that they
showed me the expected delivery time and
so I can figure out okay I better finish
cooking dinner in them so I'll be ready
for when the delivery arrives a new wave
of apps started in the San Francisco Bay
Area hope to create a new market for
delivery services that some are calling
the uber for pot quill offers on-demand
delivery for customers with a medical
marijuana card meadow has deliveries
from different dispensaries and also
provides doctor consultations for those
needing a card well we try to be pretty
thorough in assessing the patient's past
medical history that indications the
reasons that they're looking for help
from the medication in California
medical marijuana is big business sales
hit over 1.1 billion dollars in 2014 we
work with about four dispensaries
currently in the in the San Francisco
area we started building them tools help
them manage their business to help
manage your logistics I'll manage the
patient compliance and documentation
upload with services like ease supported
by investors such as snoop dogg
technology that helps speed up pot
delivery is pushing the once taboo
market into the limelight but
regulations are strict for patients and
drivers it is up to one ounce on any
given day of flower a product that any
individual can purchase on a day-by-day
basis and nobody can purchase over there
regulated amount I didn't given time
many of the services require drivers to
have medical marijuana cards drivers
could be carrying several hundred
dollars worth of cannabis which may
create a security concern so discretion
is key the places that I've been lucky
enough to work
deliver to I've been cool people but I
am pretty tall that's a that's a nice
thing to have on your side then there's
the legal haze of payments marijuana is
illegal at the federal level so banks
won't get involved these businesses
mostly rely on cash or the
cryptocurrency bitcoin for now manasa is
making the most of the convenience in
