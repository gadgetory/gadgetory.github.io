together better than others knowing
which pair works the best can come in
handy if you've come to rely on Alexa
but you have a big place to cover here
are your options the $30 voice remote
goes well with the original 180 dollar
Amazon echo it also goes with the $90
Amazon dot the Amazon dot also pairs
directly with one hundred and thirty
dollar Amazon tap the two new members of
the Alexa family connect directly to
each other and complement each other
strengths and weaknesses well with
option number one you get the echos
native speakers which are the best of
the bunch and you expand its listening
range by a lot with this thing which
works really well we took these two two
stories apart still works great
option number two is also pretty
appealing especially if you want that
big listening range and want to save a
little money this combo works really
well if you really care about music
since you can plug the dot into your own
audio system and if you really don't
care about music this thing is basically
the echo with the speaker's chopped off
but you still get the Lexus capabilities
as a personal assistant and a smart home
controller and the final combo the dot
plus the tap the tap is the portable
battery-powered member of the Alexa trio
but it's not always listening you have
to push this button to talk so if you
want portability the taps the way to go
and you can still have that always
listening capability when you're back
home by pairing the tap to the dock and
you can connect the two via cable or via
bluetooth so pick your favorite combo
and I'll actually can easily transform
into a whole home system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
