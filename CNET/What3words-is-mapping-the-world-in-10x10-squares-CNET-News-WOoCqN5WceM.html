address made up of three words places
that have postal addresses and places
that don't Yellowstone national parks
Old Faithful geyser is at communal
frolic pizzeria a startup called what
three words is the company behind this
idea it's carved the surface of the
planet into 57 trillion 10-foot squares
and given each one a unique three word
label it's easier to remember and share
than complicated latitude/longitude
coordinates and it's more precise than
street addresses say I want an uber
driver to pick me up not in the front of
my office which is decreased mime crab
but at the loading dock which is epic
noses upgrading to use what three words
the company offers a free mobile app and
website they'll let you look up the
three word label for a location you want
to share or look up the location of a
three word label that somebody else gave
you what three words isn't built into
any big mapping services like Google
Maps but the company hopes it will be
someday what three words already is
built into Mongolia's official
post-office system one spot you might
see it soon is in your car dashboard
what three words locations are easier to
speak than street addresses and easier
for a car to understand maybe in the
future you'll be able to use what three
words to tell a delivery drone we're in
the backyard you want to drop a package
because in the 21st century street
addresses just aren't good enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
