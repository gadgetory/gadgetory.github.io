brian tong here and you know what 2017
has been a tough year we've had some
great moments but really what made it
great is all the comments encouraging
words of inspiration from you for the
record your singing voice has improved
it's enjoyable I'm a music teacher and
the air pods look good on you just
saying the song is so stupid but it's
stuck in my head what have you done to
me Brian Tong could he get any douchier
probably not I think Brian is a senior
editor or something like that so sorry
for CNET employees and stuff
yeah me too Melbourne mmm-hmm thank you
for being an openly gay man it has made
me proud and open to be a homosexual man
thank you Brian
I really love you I'm not but thanks for
the compliment sometimes I feel like
apple bite is total trash but then I
come to the conclusion that is actually
absolute genius if you wear your pants
from the men's section instead of
women's your phone will fit Tom seemed
really down in this video I hope his
personal life is going okay
love the placement of your cross with
the astronaut 2005 called and say they
won their cross necklace back Brian Tong
is sincerely the most irritating phone
reviewer on the planet
Brian Tong the goat he got that man out
of a ten year plus friendzone that's
truly legendary you still work for seen
it sometimes you are annoying Brian but
this time you are not love those anal
beads anal beads oh you mean these you
and your shitty hairstyle on that shitty
bum the street looks like a bird shot on
your head and left it there because you
look good twats
that's for my Brit I'm telling you I can
read the wait for it
wow you guys are just mean like cool I'm
just someone who's having fun doing my
job and your son loading all of your
frustrations I don't know what's wrong
with you guys so here's to a better 2018
you know for you for us and for me too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
