might draw you in with its large 8 cubic
foot capacity as well as tons of dryer
cycles and steam modes but when you
start to use it you'll find it's pretty
frustrating to operate unfortunately has
a confusing control panel that has lots
of clutter with buttons and lots of
things going on lots of diagrams lots of
text everywhere it's just very
complicated don't know exactly what
you're supposed to be doing and what
you're looking at even the lights around
the control knob are very hard to see
they're small and they tend to wash out
as well if you're looking off angle from
the appliance the performance of this
dryer though is pretty rock-solid it
does dry clothes relatively quickly and
it also has a pretty nifty sensor that
can detect the moisture level of the
clothes and adjust the cycle time in
real time if shared drying performance
is what you're after above all for the
price then this is the dryer for you if
you're looking for a dryer that offers
almost the same performance with a much
better design and easier to use
interface than the Electrolux perfect
steam 600 series is what you're looking
for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
