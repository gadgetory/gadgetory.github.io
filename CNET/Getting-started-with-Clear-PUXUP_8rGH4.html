scene at how to contributor and today
we're going to take a look at how to get
started with clear it's a new iOS task
manager app that's rocketed to number
one in the top paid apps in the App
Store and it has a neat-looking UI and
some intuitive yet at times not so
intuitive gestures to interact with the
app once you learn them they become
extremely intuitive and easy to use but
getting over that learning curve can be
a bit of a problem so let's take a look
at how to use clear I'm going to open
the app and I have some of the default
tasks that are created when you first
launch the app that kind of teach you
how to use the app still in place here
as well as some old tests that I've
checked off in the past so we'll go
ahead and show you how to create a new
task you can do that by pulling down
once you do and release you could type
in the name of the task and hit done now
if you want to create more than one as
you're typing you come up here instead
of hit and done you pull down again you
create another task and you can keep
doing that until you have as many tasks
as you need entered to mark a task done
you swipe from left to right to delete a
task you go from right to left if you
want to create a task in the middle of
two items you pinch that creates a new
task you can also pick up one and move
it around in the list reprioritize your
list now we have all these deleted or
I'm sorry completed tasks down here at
the bottom if we want to clear those out
of the list we pull up and let go doing
so clears everything out that we have
already completed now if you if you
begin to pull down and you pull past
creating a new task you'll actually
switch to the list and here you could
create multiple lists that hold
different tasks or different categories
of tasks so now we that's kind of ironic
now we have two lists here now if we
pulled out again and pass creating
another list it will switch to the menu
in the menu you can change themes which
we just unlock the tweetbot theme and
actually there's three total themes you
can unlock here within the app I already
have a post on how to unlock those
themes make sure to view that I'll link
to it in the post there's two other
themes that you can unlock pretty easily
without having to purchase another app
like you would have to here with twee
pop so we'll pinch back out of that you
have tips and tricks follow the team and
then settings you can turn off the sound
effects if those aren't your cup of tea
now as you notice when I'm exiting these
lists I'm actually pinching to close
them so you can either swipe all the way
down until you go back to them or you
can pinch to close them out so that's
how to get started with clear on the
iPhone it's available today in the App
Store make sure to keep watching over at
