mid-range consumer DSLR lineup doesn't
inspire much excitement that's really
not the point of the t6i it is what is
is a reliable option for people looking
for a functional camera capable of
handling pet photography kids soccer
games and vacation snapshots I'm Laurie
groom for CNET and this is the Canon EOS
Rebel T 6 I or for those of you who live
outside the US the 750d the cameras
articulated touch screen is still a
favorite of mine for shooting video it's
responsive and has an intelligent user
interface which includes the usual
capabilities such as touch focus that
streamline live view shooting the most
welcomed change is in the viewfinder
though Canon has finally replaced the
awful tiny autofocus points with larger
more traditional autofocus areas it
makes it you find her operation much
more comfortable also notable the camera
can now sustain a burst of more than 30
JPEGs at five frames per second and I
found the InFocus hit rate is good
enough for typical kids and pets
photographers the companies deprecated
its camera window and iOS remote apps in
favor of the single canon camera connect
which lets you perform remote shooting
with a reasonable set of manual controls
or transfer photos to your mobile device
it has some notable deficits including
no way to select all photos for transfer
or deletion it can't shoot video you can
find the t6i at about 750 dollars for
the basic 18 to 55 millimeter kit it's a
fine camera for the family photographer
who's not terribly picky about photo
quality and I think most people who buy
it will be happy with it for a more
nuanced opinion though you'll have to
read my review on seeing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
