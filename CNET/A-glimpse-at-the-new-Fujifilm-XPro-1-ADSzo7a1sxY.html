cnet here at CES 2012 and this is the
new fujifilm x-pro 1 it's Fujifilm's
entry into the mirrorless category and
it's been highly anticipated and there's
a lot of new technology in this camera
it's got a new sensor with a six by six
or array of different color filter
organization than you've seen in the
typical buyer it also has a new lens
mount the x mount which takes XF lenses
there's a lot of X's in this camera and
it has a great retro design than a lot
of users like in the X 100 and the x10
but this is a pretty big camera compared
to those it's even bigger than the x 100
but it's very nicely designed as far as
i could tell i did a head up some time
with this morning and it uses an updated
hybrid viewfinder it's not exactly like
the one in the x 100 which you know
highly regarded but they've made some
adaptations that they had to in order to
use the interchangeable lenses when it
ships they haven't quite priced it yet
they think it's going to be about
seventeen hundred dollars and the lenses
would probably go for 650 but as I said
that's subject to change and it will
initially ship with three different
prime lenses with more zoom lenses etc
planned for later in the year and next
year I'm Lori drunen and I'm looking
forward to testing the fujifilm x-pro 1
