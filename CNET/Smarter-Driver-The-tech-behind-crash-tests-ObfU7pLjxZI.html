commence in 4 seconds 3 2 1 1 Dec
the cameras used by the IIHS or of
course specialized to capture motion
capturing motion means capturing many
frames per second
now where your video camera may capture
30 or 60 frames a second these guys do
hundreds to thousands of frames a second
here are the on board digital cameras
that were going to be mounting on the
door inside the car they use the IDT n X
series compact cameras they also capture
up to 700 30 frames a second our 4
megapixel which is ample because it
matters more how many frames they
capture rather than how huge each one is
it's ruggedized so it can take the
impact of the crash
this one will be looking at the driver
dummy to see how he interacts with the
steering wheel the airbags and what's
happening during the rest I'm draining
all the fluids out of the vehicle
that'll make the message right after the
crash mounting a camera like this is key
the technicians installed the base as a
rigid part of the car's body I mean they
really install it and of course they can
use a bunch of fasteners because this
car is not going back on the market
those IDT cameras can take up to 200 G's
in a hit and I'm always amazed how
steady they are even at the moment of
impact the cameras outside the car are
even more impressive phantom flex
imagers they're capable of nearly 2,600
frames a second at 1080 resolution put
another way they have 32 gigabytes of
internal memory and can fill that in 5.1
seconds for each tests we have set a
predetermined positions for all of our
digital imagers we want to make sure
we're getting the exact same shot that
we got the last time I ran this test so
we can compare vehicle to vehicle
need to but also make sure that we're
consistent all the footage that we get
now all of this of course is massively
lit by a robotic light grid that ensures
even lighting and virtually no shadows
because that might obscure any small
detail of how the car's components
deform after the actual impact
high-resolution stills are also captured
using rather surprisingly a Hasselblad
medium format film camera body harnessed
to a phase-one digital back after the
test we move the car to the photo studio
where there's a large overhead light box
and a fully programmable light control
board as well as a seamless background
and a turntable that sits on air
Castor's that allows us to lift the car
up and spin it to any position that we
wish finally the center uses a DaVinci
Resolve edit controller and color
corrector to put the footage together
and dial in the accuracy of its offer
it pays to double check with the IIHS
learns from this interesting process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
