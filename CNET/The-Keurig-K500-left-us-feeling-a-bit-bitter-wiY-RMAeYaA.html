appliances and right here is the Keurig
k 500 now this is the new flagship
single serving coffee maker from Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters in the Keurig
brand which they own and this is part of
the new Keurig 2.0 generation and what's
new with Keurig 2.0 well the big
addition is these K carafe packs here
that are kind of like the Vue packs from
the other year but they're taller and
they're designed to dispense an entire
pots worth of coffee so you can fill
this guy up with coffee from your k-cup
brewer the K 500 works like Keurig
brewers of old it's not a radically
different design from what we've seen
before it looks a little bit like the
Vue v700 that we reviewed last year it's
got a nice color touchscreen that looks
good you can change the color of that
menu and you can also change the color
of the LED that shines up through the
water reservoir so it's gonna look nice
sitting on your kitchen counter and it's
not gonna take up quite as much space as
the last models we've seen though it is
still pretty bulky now all that basic
stuff out of the way the real story with
Keurig 2.0 is that it's designed to
protect the Keurig brand the k-cup
patent that made Keurig such a powerful
household name and Coffee expired back
in 2012 and since then there have been a
lot of copycat cups you see Kroger brand
or even big names like Panera that are
putting out K cups that aren't Keurig
licensed K cups and they get to keep
that licensing fee and pass at least
some of the savings on to you that means
that there's a big bite being taken out
of Karen's bottom line
so these Keurig 2.0 Brewers will
actually scan the top of your cake up to
make sure it's accurate cup let me show
you what that scanner is looking for the
new generation of K Cups have this light
colored band around the outside as well
as the Keurig logo right there on the
bottom if you look at this cake up this
is actually a cure approved k cup that
should work in this machine but it was
released before January of 2014
doesn't have that band on the outside
this one will not work in a Keurig 2.0
brewer and then of course the standard
kroger brand donut shop blend doesn't
have the Keurig logo doesn't have the
ring this won't work at all
the current k 500 goes on sale next
month for a price of a hundred and
ninety dollars that's not wholly
unreasonable that's about the same price
area that previous Keurig generations
have gone on sale for but there are
still less expensive machines out there
right now that will offer more
flexibility in terms of how you make
single-serving coffee
you editors choice winning bun my cafe
MCU the Cuisinart SS 700 these are nice
coffee makers that will brew k-cups or
cheap bargain branded cups or even fresh
grounds this can't do all of that it's a
step down in terms of your options so
unless you're okay with that and really
excited at the option of making an
entire pot I say skip it and go with
another model for seeing that I'm right
