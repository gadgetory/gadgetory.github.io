welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple I
know you guys could probably tell I have
a stuffy nose in a little bit of the
sniffles right what's up Jamie sup dude
what we can do a better job your dog
please give me a break all right guys
let's jump the stories with the rumors
that some of you want to believe I still
don't believe it yet it's the ipad mini
me now the new report from chinese site
my drivers calm says the seven point
eight five inch ipad will launch later
this year it will be the same thickness
as the ipad 2 and utilize Sharp's IGZO
technology to create a thinner and
brighter display that was rumored for
the ipad 3 but it wasn't ready in time
for mass production back then now the
report also says the ipad minis
endurance has been strengthened just
like me now it's remember to have eight
gigs of capacity with a price point
between 249 and 299 and would be
positioned to go head on with Google's
recently announced Nexus 7 with
jellybean the kindle fire and the nut
color we should also remind you these
rumors started immediately after the
very first ipad was announced in 2010
and are still going now last week we
also told you how a Retina Display
looked unlikely on the new imacs but a
new report from digit times one week
later changes that outlook they report
the new imac will debut around October
with a high chance of sporting a Retina
display their logic is that Apple is
looking to expand its retina display
across all product lines seriously they
actually wrote that my pet rock could
have told me the same thing what's up
Einstein now their sources also report
in addition to launching a new imac this
year they will completely refresh the
imac and Mac Pros with brand new models
next year so the takeaway here you can
still expect a new imac this year and
it's worth waiting for but no one really
knows if I ran the display is coming
with it now you also probably saw last
week Apple conveniently released their
own apple podcast app the day after we
suggested an alternative the
good thing you can now subscribe to
podcasts directly from the iOS app but
its top stations is a pretty useless
interface that makes finding new content
a chore and then clicking into the
catalogue to another panel to find
podcast is clunky now other than giving
me subscriptions it's a poorly designed
app they need to improve this a lot and
it definitely feels like a rush job to
me and guess what it's worthy i'm a bad
apple now i'm sticking with downcast and
many of you also suggested to check out
in stochastic you guys can take a look
at that one now there also may be a new
payout if you've ever made an eye
product in the past Apple finally
settled the iPad name dispute with probe
you in China forget this 60 million
dollars Apple had purchased the name
from probe you in 2009 under a shell
company but the use of the ipad
trademark in China was never officially
granted now with the settlement it's
theirs so after that a Chinese company
that makes toothpaste and cleaning
chemicals with the brand names Snow
Leopard decided that Mac os10 snow
leopard is a violation of their
trademark and they're asking for eighty
thousand dollars in damages so a
computer operating system and toilet
cleaners I thought they were the same to
all right guys for the quick bites Apple
has launched the new icloud.com beta
site for registered iOS and Mac
developers notes and reminders were
previously rumored and they've made it
to the all web interface for iCloud find
my iphone has been redesigned with a new
look and there looks to be new
notifications related to the calendar
application and find my iphone as well
apple's mobileme service ended on june
thirtieth in case you guys didn't know
but apple still allowing users to
download their precious gallery photos
and I disk files for a limited extended
period so is something you should
probably get on ASAP alright guys that's
going to do it for this we show email us
at the apple byte at cnet com and I do
answer some of the emails and my friends
Stuart yes you Stuart in New York I'm
talking to you boy take care of yourself
and your lovely wife host Athena alright
guys I'm Brian Tom thanks for watching
it will catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple
well no but my boy roll over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
