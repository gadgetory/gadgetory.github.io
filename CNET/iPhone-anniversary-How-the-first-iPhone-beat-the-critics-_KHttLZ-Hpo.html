iPhone going on sale here's our apples
very first smartphone defied the critics
and set the company on the road to
smartphone domination announced in
January 2007 by Apple co-founder Steve
Jobs the iPhone promised a miracle
touchscreen device that would change
technology forever today we know it
would go on to be a massive hit but at
the time fierce debates raged about the
devices potential what bothers me is
saying goodbye to my phone for a few
days yeah they'll cross ship me a loaner
for $29 but the whole idea of being
without my phone with my contacts and
data and photos and ride off on it that
gives me the willies they really need a
removable battery in this product and
finally steam winning in a new one that
ham indeed the very first iPhone was a
long way from the ultra sophisticated
smart phones of today the first
iteration lacked 3G it couldn't shoot
video
he had no removable battery and as
Microsoft Steve Ballmer helpfully
pointed out it was quite expensive $500
fully subsidized in the world and it
doesn't appeal to business customers
because it doesn't have a keyboard which
makes it not a very good email machine
in retrospect it seems crazy to bet
against the iPhone but to be honest
these were very reasonable reasons to
doubt the phone's potential but while
the iPhones critics worried about these
missing features the general public
reacted very differently
CNET's kent german reviewed the first
iPhone and remembers the atmosphere at
the launch they said it'd go on sale at
6 p.m. local time and so I went down to
the store in San Francisco I'd actually
pick up a review model at 6 p.m. and the
line was they had actually closed off
the street because there were so many
people this is the first time I'd ever
seen people line up around the block for
a phone and in cheer as they came out 74
days after it went on sale Apple
confirmed it had sold its first million
iPhones it was the iPhone 3G in 2008
that really set its mobile on a meteoric
course however with Apple selling 1
million iPhone 3GS in a single weekend
the iPhone 3G did as the name suggests
introduced 3G as well as GPS powers and
more features but it still held some
things back in fact reminiscing now both
early Mobile's established a real theme
for the iPhone if you want you features
you're gonna have to wait
I think the Apple is conditioned us to
think in a way that well they don't put
it in the first round because they want
to get it the way they wanted to work
the way that they really want to they
want control of everything they want to
perfect it from beginning to end and
they have a vision for it I think the
feature is so new and it's not gonna
fulfill it they're willing to wait and
Apple fans I think have come to expect
that you just accept it say well we'll
get it when if they're gonna get it
working right the iPhone has always made
us wait from multitasking to bigger
screens and much more but with over 700
million iPhones sold Apple's slow and
steady approach has clearly worked in
fact from uncertain beginnings it's
helped the iPhone rise to what may
eventually be remembered as Apple's
greatest achievement so it's another
happy birthday for this unassuming slab
of technology but what comes next let us
know your thoughts on the fate of the
iPhone and stay tuned to see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
