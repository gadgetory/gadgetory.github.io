identity crisis I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update Foursquare the
app that became popular five years ago
for location check ins will no longer
have check-ins the ability to broadcast
where you are to friends has been split
off into a different app it's called
swarm foursquare is also changing its
logo dropping the check mark and
bouncing ball from the game it's named
after and now is using a big flashy
superhero style f perhaps Foursquare
sees itself as the hero to help in your
quest to find a restaurant the app is
completely refocused as a search tool to
find nearby places and share reviews
just like Yelp and I must say foursquare
is a good search tool when you're on
your phone looking for a nearby place to
eat you can customize the app now to
show recommendations tailored to you
such as highlights of places with your
favorite types of food apps have to
evolve sometimes to stay relevant after
all you can broadcast your location on
just about any network these days this
update could help Foursquare become
better known as a search tool but by
vanquishing the check-ins to a separate
app and killing off the gamification
features of points and badges it's
essentially killing off what made the
appt famous in the first place time will
tell if this new swarm spin-off can
thrive on its own in other news some
photos have leaked of the rumored
Samsung Galaxy alpha smartphone which is
said to be a higher end model of the
galaxy s5 and it could be launched
within the next two months that would be
around the time of the iphone 6 these
photos were posted to a vietnamese tech
blog and like many leaked images they're
out of focus when will these sneaky spy
photographers just learn to shoot clear
photos we can learn more details by
early September during a Samsung event
at the IFA tech conference in Berlin and
if you've ever wondered what's the point
of having a smart light bulb you can
wonder no more the Philips hue connected
light system has a new trick it's able
to use an app to sync up with the audio
from a movie so the LED bulbs change
color based on what's happening in the
scene and of course the four
first demonstration of this ability will
be for the world premiere of syfy
channel's sharknado 2 the second one the
sci-fi sync second screen app will use
audio cues from the movie to send
commands to the bulbs to change color
depending on the scene nothing like red
light engulfing your room when the
chainsaws come out am i right this
moment of television history takes place
the night of wednesday July thirtieth
and you can learn more about the hue
connected bulb and all the other tricks
it can do from our review on cnet com
that's your tech news update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
