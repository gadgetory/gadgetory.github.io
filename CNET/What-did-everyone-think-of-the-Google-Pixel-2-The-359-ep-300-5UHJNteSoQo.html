special no we brought our own for
specific purpose we're gonna be talking

of it then we'll be talking about
Netflix a little bit about their
earnings as well as the upcoming or
price cuts upcoming is it already going
through or it's or if you aren't a
subscriber now you're gonna be paying
for the price cut I know we should have
brought your laptop right now and we'll
be talking about the ZTE axon M which is
a foldable phone the interest is very
building in it oh it's a cool phone dang
it I'm gonna I'm gonna speak up for it's
a cool phone it's not the prettiest
phone but it's a cool phone in my mind
alright whatever
as always if you have any questions
about these topics we'll also take any
questions about the crack Wi-Fi attack
Alfred is around to answer any questions
life in general life in general if you
need any advice on you know your career

any questions on these topics and career
advice for Alfred leave a comment
section
Brian we'll get to the pick out the best
we will get to them in three minutes to
59 second yeah hang out everybody we're
gonna record this four minute podcast
and then we'll be back and we want to
hear from you in the chat so just bear
with us while we get the important stuff
out of the way and then we're gonna
waste your time for 20 minutes so hang
out in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from
3:00 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger J I'm
Alfred Inge I'm Joanie Sussman and we're
here at top of the pixel to the reviews
are out and mostly positive right uh
excellent camera makes up for the fact
that there is no headphone jack which
Alfred no you're still bitter about yeah
I actually tried a pair of bluetooth
headphones over the weekend I was given
a loaner pair from David Carr Noi and
would you think they didn't turn on the
battery was dead there's there's a lot
of I did I charge them overnight and
then that held the charge when I had it
plugged in and that's the perennial
complain about the Bluetooth yeah it's
an extra thing you have to think about
and you're in the middle of a movie and
that's when it goes down it's front it's
extremely frustrating so I I still think
the lack of a headphone jack is a
deal-breaker
I tried seeing it from the other side I
bought I denied him by him
I got Bluetooth headphones I got
bluetooth headphones to need me to
charge them I did charge it I charged it
and it worked when I had it plugged into
the USB so it worked but it didn't hold
a charge all right why don't we talk
about the phone itself
look we were Lyn law and Jessica
Delacour do some tests on it the pixel 2
of the camera is excellent as I said it
is the highest rate from DxO mark higher
than the iPhone upcoming iPhone 8 and 10
and it does portrait mode kind of well
yes with one lens yeah I'm very
impressed by that so the way that they
were able to do it is using like the AI
for the camera instead so it's basically
saying we don't really need the best
hardware for a good photo as long as we
have like great software backing it
which is kind of in Google's mo well so
Stephen Shanklin actually did a sort of
deep dive on the camera and AI behind it
it's interesting how they perform this
trick is the the AI is smart enough to
recognize a human face and then the
background and it knows the blur the
background but they gave the example
like if it sees something it doesn't
recognize like example that gave was a
person kissing an alligator like it
would not know that the alligator was in
the foreground so it would blow out the
alligator because it didn't recognize it
I would also not recognize that well
humanize how could a person love an
alligator love all right next up we got
to talk about Netflix report earnings
that we're pretty good right yeah Joan
our necks are pretty good but they the
thing that was relevant from attorney
says it came on the heels of a price
increase so if you haven't if you're
already a member then your prices are
gonna be going up probably $1 or $2
unless you have the very cheapest plan
in the next couple months but to just
sort of distract everyone though from
the fact that they're raising prices the
CEO and head of content of Netflix
decided in the middle of their earnings
call to put on blinking stranger things
sweater well we're watching that now and
it's freaky he looks freaky actually
except this kind of evil grin going how
relatable and cool of this multi owner
it was it was very cringy super super
fellow of the stranger things it's
because Netflix is getting into March
they're selling merchandise related to
stranger things in anticipation of its
arrival on October and they need more
money at this point or they're spending
how much on content next year they're
gonna be spending 7 to 8 billion dollars
they'll begin with a bunny with a B on
making more shows more movies if you
were having trouble keeping up with
every new show that's coming on a
Netflix it's only gonna get worse all
right laughter lastly we wanted to talk
about this weird phone that's been
announced today the ZTE axon M M is for
a multi-user multi window multitasking
it is a foldable phone there are two
screens that there's a hinge there so
you can hold back it's a little bulky it
doesn't look great but it is kind of
cool and I think it does but it hints at
a future where we do see more foldable
phones it reminds me of the sidekick
yeah it was actually a believe the
Kyocera echo which came out six years
ago from Sprint that had this foldable
phone the same concept two screens very
clunky very slow and really works so
well this one does work pretty well
there's a mirror mode you can actually
extend it across both screens so it's
like a super large display but I don't
know
feels like a first-gen product I feel
like they should just make tablets like
that where instead of like having out as
a phone mm-hmm just have like tablets
that are foldable that's a great idea
you can have that super I should make
that somebody higher all right if you
like to think you saw our heard here
chicken sounds see net
Raju Chang I'm out for hang I'm Johnny
thanks for sitting Wow we got a off the
rails what are you talking about we're
pretty on the rails they're not the
first minute Alfred's crappy headphones
the pixel to that was related to that
Bluetooth because if I wanted if I
wanted a pixel to I'd like to literally
have to switch to Bluetooth headphones
one thing that they don't hold the
charge is one thing I forgot to mention
I wanted to say on the podcast was Lin
recommend that if you're looking to
upgrade to a pixel - and you don't mind
and you really don't mind the size the
pixel to excel is the better options got
their display sharper screen same camera
both phones but it's just a better yeah
better specs for it right on as to kick
off the conversation as I'm kind of
filtering through all of the questions
in the chat right now and there are
plenty to go through so bear with me for
a second I don't care about the Netflix
price hike I mean when they jump up a
buck like that's that's cost of living
that that kind of people I mean when you
think about in the sense that if it goes
up a dollar that's 12 dollars more a
year right and given just how much
content Netflix is churning out because
Netflix isn't paying for their content
with your dollars that you pay them it's
mostly taking out a bunch of debt so
it's able to charge you a very little
bit more to be giving you a whole lot
more television and yeah my my gripe
with it was that they were raising the
prices at the same time that all these
other networks were taking their shows
that I wouldn't see there's like crazy
off it so it's like they're removing all
these shows and they do lose Disney yeah
and they're spending all that money on
shows that like on all these original
series that I don't have like a
connection with at all yeah and that's I
mean you're unique there are folks who
have a connection to a lot of these
shows no I mean I watched like original
well like it's the ones that are like
already like critically-acclaimed where
it's like I watch like Bojack horseman
stranger things American vandal like all
these shows that you're you know are
like good Netflix originals but I feel
like for every good Netflix original
they spend like millions of dollars on
Adam Sandler's like wild wild west which
is actually like the most popular
content they make my point being like
what doesn't resonate for you resonates
for other people we do come from a
society where reality TV was king for
how many years it's the lowest common
denominator and that's how it's always
gonna be sorry you know it's it's gonna
be you know if they take off like Big
Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother
then I'm like I'm done with Netflix
because this Big Bang Theory I think
it's off yeah but if they take off How I
Met Your Mother
then you know yes okay
it's hard to keep track of what's on off
cuz they you know they rotate everything
I love the CBS shows that's great
alright moving on to actual questions
Leslie's not listening right now Alfred
let's start out with this comment on the
Aksum accent em phone yeah just from
Karen in the in the chat rising the
first questions it wasn't the first
question but I want hit this Lucas is
that a Nintendo you know sod like with
the screen off it kind of looked like a
DES yeah Bouldin totally did in the
audio too but it is two large displays I
believe it's their five inch displays
but yeah I mean it's very similar form
factor is there a chance that like one
screen could break and then the other
ones perfectly fine that is possible
there is a mirror mode so you can you
know you could have your one screen the
other ones kind of screwed up but I mean
they said they've got guro gorilla glass
on both sides so it's supposed to be non
pervious but harder to crack than normal
the layest gorilla glass and then
they've also designed a special case
that you can buy for it that that's
supposed to protect the glass I wonder
how much it would cost to like at the
screen replaced on that I don't know
a question I'd be really annoying it was
like oh my left screen is broken
oops I imagine that would be really
tough to this it's not like you can go
down a common ZTE authorized repair
those out there I mean to prepare that
happened with like the D s a lot to wear
like one screen would crack open this is
the screens are the outside they fold
out so it gives you a chance to crack it
twice yeah literally like putting a
target on both sides of your phone yeah
and I think though again the the
thinking is that you know the latest
growth glass is strong enough that I'll
withstand scratches and cracks
theoretically we'll see we'll see
staying on the same con topic here dr.
Faye says I want to be able to
aggressively slam that phone after a
call like we used to yeah you would be
able to do that again I think they are
offering like a special case that allows
you to at least have some protection on
both sides what if the case had another
screen on it
ooh like an inception of like a triple
screen thing it'll be like the science
project from like middle school where
yeah that's the that's the new that's
the new phone that this is a volcano
there that three screens baby yeah
thanks to everybody for all the well
wishes and happy 300 out of everyone
let's get back into the chat and let's
talk about well let's talk about Netflix
shall we let's do it
bring back Futurama Matthew - are the -
in the chat what's up - he's asking is
the price increase only for Netflix or
as DVD com going to be affected as well
Joan there shouldn't be any effect or if
you are one of those lingering
Netflix DVD subscribers there shouldn't
be any change okay but how do I get the
VHS is
we all know that there were no VHS was
when you were born oh yeah I was on I
was raised on Betamax cuts deep cuts all
right
staying on the Netflix train as I do
3000 things at once here Michael Brown
asks when do you think a Netflix film
will get an Academy Award and and
expanding on that when do we think we're
gonna see Netflix hit theaters so
Netflix first question that's the
question that Netflix executives are
asking themselves they it's their kind
of one thing that they have it's a
golden ring they haven't been able to
grasp is getting an Oscar and Amazon
beat them to it
by just like shelling out hand-over-fist
money to buy Manchester by the sodium
this last year that won a couple Oscars
but it's been elusive for for Netflix I
think partly because Hollywood's a
little bit annoyed at how much Netflix
doesn't play by their rules
but um they're annoyed at Netflix but
not Amazon though because Amazon does
play by their rules at Amazon well that
actually leaves segues well into the
question about theaters Amazon lets
movies that it pays for and makes play
in theaters for like a typical amount of
time and only then does it bring it on
to their streaming service Netflix
doesn't like to do that they like to
have it in theaters and a small number
of theaters at the very same time that
it's available to stream so for a
theater owner that's a really annoying
Drafthouse thing or something like yes
so what they do so what because in and
the only reason that netflix has movies
in a very small number of theaters it's
to qualify it all comes together is to
qualify for the Oscars you have to have
a movie in a theater in Los Angeles
County and a certain frame of time in
order to be qualified to yeah no kind of
sense that's the reason that Netflix
really does put anything theaters but
this this upcoming year they're gonna be
having um I think actually before the
end of the year they're gonna have this
movie bright oh that's kind of like
their biggest like chance yet at a sort
of blockbuster style movie and it'll be
interesting to see if they have it
and just that really tiny amount of
theaters or if they'll want to try to
have it streaming and in a lot of
theaters at the same time and that
that's not right yeah
I really hope Netflix is like the new
Leonardo DiCaprio where they show up
every year true story true story it's
good the crap out of my girlfriend when
he actually won because I usually am not
invested in the award show so I don't
really pay attention but she watches
them and they'll be on and like I'm not
opposed to them and which is usually
distracted doing something else and I
was like on the edge of my seat when he
was up for for the revenant right sorry
and I jumped out of my chair and just
what's wrong with you what is wrong with
you like that much of a Leo fan I mean
he's had such a cool career it should
have a second he's done some cool stuff
one of my favorite movies of all time is
catch me if you can everything about it
maybe him and Tom Hanks are like such a
good team well one for last year the
year before what was the role that no I
I felt like he should have won for like
something in like kings of New York New
York was awesome yeah it was a great
movie that's true yeah he did I mean he
was oh my god like really any pixel
questions I'm really surprised that are
like few pixel questions uh okay so
let's let's talk to Archie Blair he says
what do you think of the pixel accel
having the bezel the screen but the
pixel does not I mean it does still have
a bezel it's not like they don't they
advertise it as bezel lists I would say
it's not I watched you because you wear
a I would say the I mean it's if you're
looking for that kind of seamless edge
to edge design
you're not really going pixel to or
Excel you're going to the note where
you're buying an iPhone X sorry iPhone
10 you know I think it's a small change
working the design it doesn't it's not
that different from the smaller pixel to
the Excel was okay it's not as
bezel-less as some of the other business
phones not like the essential with the
little dot exactly the notch all right
here's one from Danelle says do you
think OMS will go back to a single
camera setup now that the portrait
effect can be accomplished in a single
camera pixel si in the future no and I
think the s8 was that was a bit of a
misstep but I think they were supposed
to go dual lens but you know they
obviously didn't have enough time that's
why I showed up in the note 8 I would
imagine the s9 will have dual Lance I
think that's become a de facto standard
for premium phones you know apples sort
of set that trend
Samsung has followed not everyone else
sorry yeah well I was gonna try to
mention this on the show but we didn't
have enough time but I was kind of
hoping that you know with you know
Google pushing out oh you don't need the
dual lens we have the software for it
yeah that lower end phones would start
being able to take better photos you
know I think there's gonna be I don't
know how willing Google is to share some
technology with everyone because it's
not I don't think it's court Android is
yeah and also it requires a fairly
powerful processor and all that stuff
and lower end phones have slower
processor so I don't know if it could
even work but I hope I don't think what
Google did was kind of unique to Google
and theirs and so I don't really see it
I don't see a lot of single lens cameras
trying this and yeah you see a lot more
dual lens cameras
couple of questions here before we call
it a day lost legacy do you expect
Samsung and the rumor 20/20 foldable
iPhone will have the same approach as
the X and M ah that's what you say yeah
that's really hard to say I mean I think
Samsung has already confirmed publicly
that they're gonna make a foldable phone
I really don't see what other way you
can fold it unless you do it like it
like a sandwich fold like it's a
triangle
that'd be terribly awful everybody like
the office tablet they're like trying
neighbors
Sabre pyramid right yeah no I I think
it's gonna be a little more elegant
because Samsung has got more resources
when it comes to display technology we
kind of saw hint of this last year or
earlier this year with Lenovo they
showed off a foldable phone with a glass
itself actually folded yeah which wasn't
that one of their laptops - uh no no no
I think it was like a wrist almost i
watch that kind of folded around and so
that's what I'm hoping to see like
stands on the bowl yeah almost like a
mobile like the screen itself will fold
and and and that's that's really tough
technically I imagine the phone whatever
foldable phones will see them that
coming here they're probably gonna be
thick like the X on em and like because
they're first generation products
they're gonna be big and bulky I think
this will be more attractive as a second
or third generation product but I like I
like where it's going because I want to
see more focal phones I think that's a
very logical way to evolve where the
phones are you know it's really great
when the rollable like phones come out
like when they just roll up in a scroll
just through people will still complain
that there's no headphone jack in this
piece of paper alright just a couple
more quick ones we have a lot of really
great questions about how the phone
performs about the pixel yeah how the
pixel performed yeah and like first
hands-on issue is how the screen light
like the actual screen viewing
capabilities etc we in this room do not
have our hands on it we're paying to you
to go to cnet.com and look at the
official review from who was at Lin and
I think when love didn't love you
Jessica did a follow-up story so they've
got the scoop on how it performs however
Jeffrey Browns got a rhetorical question
for us Roger you can probably floor this
one since you're the pixel user in the
room do you think Google pixel will ever
have wireless charging oh yeah I mean I
imagine it's gonna come next year next
year yeah I'm making my my claim my bold
prediction now I mean they should have
done it this year like at this point
with with Apple getting on that
bandwagon a lot of phones are I mean
that's sort of the cue for everyone to
kind of follow along and Samsung has had
it for a long time
mm-hmm this isn't new technology at all
and I imagine they were kind of kicking
themselves a bit I mean this new pixel
is water resistances
resistant which is a kind of year behind
everyone else and so I imagine wireless
charging store that next feature it's
becoming you know it's that standard
feature for for high-end phones and
it'll be normalized soon but you're
saying as early as next year I think so
Wow I hope so that's pretty brave
perhaps courageous if you will it's a
year away people will forget what I say
episode 300 Roger shame predicted that
the pics of book 3 will have wireless
charging yeah and it's easy to remember
the episode name because it's 300 and
what do we do if you're wrong in the
Chairman what know in the chat tweet at
us tell us what we have to do to punish
Roger if he's wrong about wireless
charging on pixel 3 I hope so Google's
watching this now it's like you know
what waiting for you-know-who to come
out of the blue and just be like punch
him in the face no we're not doing that
again
all right all right that's it that's
about it we should time to time to wrap
it up all right if you liked anything
you saw or heard here check us out on
