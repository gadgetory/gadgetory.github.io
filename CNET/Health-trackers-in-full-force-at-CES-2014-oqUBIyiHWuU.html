fitness tech and fitness bands and how
they've evolved at this show now we have
a lot of changes that are going on I've
got my wrist right now you know I've got
the nike fuelband SE Scott you're always
like a walking sideboard yeah I am
Bridget Carey is here with me we're
taking a look at this the nike fuelband
SE i've always got a couple of these the
fitbit force you've seen a lot of these
they've got pedometers now they're
increasingly adding heart rate monitors
to a few of them they track what you're
doing they track your lifestyle what
else can they do well a lot of these are
starting to incorporate some other new
technologies to add into the mix maybe
it's notifications like a pebble or a
SmartWatch maybe it's something a little
bigger like lifelogging maybe it's some
other new way to show the experience so
we've got a few new products here
sometimes screen some don't have screens
right interest yeah it's whatever you
want maybe you clip it off where in your
shoe maybe you wear it on your arm if
you clip it on your chest everybody is
exploring this and there are so many at
the show you've heard people putting
fitness there's fitness bands everywhere
is playing fitness tracking and every
single item it I'm sure to have
something that kind of tracks your your
your health I think people be
comfortable with the concept of wearing
something that involves tech so now
you're seeing LG Sony and others here's
one that Sony announced the other day
yeah this is a concept for the future
it's not a specific product per se it's
called core and core you know we've seen
a lot of products that pop out and it
attached it is cores as little yeah this
is released a rubber bracelet holding
the core the core is the white part
that's core and this is a smart band
that goes around it and the idea with
core is that yes it's tracking your
movement it's tracking potentially your
sleep but it's also tracking your
lifestyle so this is going into
lifelogging sony has this pretty pretty
elaborate app that they were
demonstrating that looks at you maybe
how many photos you take or whether
you're playing video games or movies so
it's like sort of a full a full body
lifestyle picture obviously not those
are on all fitness but the idea of you
get a picture of how much you're doing
keeping everything in balance may be
having fun maybe doing fitness I wonder
if this is gonna pair to play station at
some point and have some sort of
experience that would be kind of cool
yeah I mean like I mean gamification
kind of lends itself to fitness right
what do you mean we also see how they
feel you've never even I mean I know if
you've seen these are not bridgit be
tell me we think you know turf in it
does remind me of Fitbit because of the
rubber nature of the bracelet in the
fact that there's no screen on it but I
was checking if it's my thin wrists as
you know gotta gotta care about that you
know and it does you know so nice is
very light you know I i would probably
get one though in pink or something
because i like a little bit of flair I
like that little silver I like that
little metal I do I and it was easy to
clip sometimes with some of them you
have a hard time you know get them open
and close but it looks like it looks
like it'll take a beating to this is a
surprise I mean everything's a surprise
at CES but I mean this is particularly
you know that Sony announcement was a
surprise there's also the SmartWatch to
that Sony has so there there's a
full-fledged SmartWatch that Sony's
making so it's another item in the
ecosystem exploring something a little
different on this one yeah get a little
more this more tech in it now this is
the LG life band touch yeah so the LG
life band touch actually feels much more
akin to something like the Nike FuelBand
yeah because it's hard on it it's hard
not as flexible as likes and this does
have a display it's an oled display and
it's swipeable swipeable oh there we go
you go to various functions um it can
swap you know it can actually track I
know calories pedometers like has little
icons and numbers next to it so you can
scroll through like different facts like
knocking steps or how many i micht how
much calories you burned and this
actually just slides on your wrist as
the semi-flexible here that go ahead pop
it on now yeah really the idea with this
is that is actually again it's semi
smart so you know is there more than one
size cuz lot yes there are multiple
sizes because you can't resize that but
it will actually pair with your phone
and you'll be able to receive
notifications you'll also be able to do
two way communication which is something
that we haven't really seen in bands you
could actually there's a social gesture
with this is that if you're getting a
phone call and you don't want this set
the ring to go off you just put your
hands like that over the life band touch
and it actually I want to ignore your
call exactly so it communicates back
there are a few bits of two way we're
first take on visited video at sea thai
to sew some two-way android and iOS and
it is is a standalone and that's not it
it also pairs with heart rate monitors
no LG just gone ahead and made their own
heart rate monitor that fits in a pair
of earphones these are heart rate
monitor earphones where does it where is
it sensing your pulse on the on the
headphone like yes it's very subtle it
sounds like a totally wacko idea first I
know if you're running you don't want to
wear something all the time right well
it's actually smart because it attaches
here they look like regular meant to be
regular nice even try them on um high
end your earbuds and I'll take my other
ear piece the sensor is right there on
the top it's just a little yeah it knock
us fan and so it's comfortable it
doesn't fall out and it communicates via
bluetooth now these can be used as
regular bluetooth earphones or you can
do the heart rate monitor element and as
this little clip and then you use them
in association with the band interesting
idea you could also just put the heart
rate monitor in the band but that's
something that LG didn't seem want to
pursue right now but this also has an
altimeter your rifle yeah where to go I
got so many things I've hooked up to and
that's that's another idea LG has not
really entered the wearable space so
this is the beginning of a lifestyle
wearable move from that company pretty
big company and then we've got an
interesting entry an example of surprise
companies entering wearables this is
from razor through the gaming PC come
this is this is the razor Naboo now this
again has a look that's reminiscent of
something like a fuel band it actually
interestingly adopts the same idea of
the buckle contains a micro USB charge
port so you don't have to carry a dongle
with you and this also against
notifications promise of connecting with
iOS and Android track your fitness track
your sleep but it also has two screens
so you can't like try to be the best of
both worlds like its health monitoring
but it's also like all right I get a
text message that i missed something on
Twitter now this is I mean there's a
prototype so it's it's it's being
developed this is what the final version
should look like this is the working
prototype right now and here you go
press the buy here colors on the
prototype yeah you actually wear
on your wrist with the smaller screen on
the on the outside and you get a little
icon that lights up here that tells you
maybe an incoming call is happening or
tells you what mode you're in and then
if you don't want tell anyone but they
think imma call us you just look
underneath attached on here these I did
I can't do it with one hand but there's
the early buckle technology but
underneath it will actually tell you
who's calling and you can get the
information right there on it so if you
want some only do like a spider-man
thing and if you want to check your
exactly the time but actually show is a
fair number of lines of text it's not
just one line across it's almost like a
full you know getting towards a full
tweet and not just that but there's an
idea here for social handshake
technology says it a lot of these are
like alright got to find a new way to
talk with your body here i gotta turn a
call on right holding myself and know
what else do you do for you where wine
all right and i wear one and then hello
Bridget how do you do and I shake hands
with you then we're following each other
on Twitter all of a sudden or we've sent
a friend request to LinkedIn now yeah Oh
Beatrice they had to take conference
like this i mean we're shaking a lot of
hands and changing business yeah it's in
shaded i'll give you my business card
and get you Mitchell we all have to get
that person to buy a razor Naboo in
order to do that but these are launching
very soon there's a developer cost of
forty nine dollars and then there will
be an unspecified price me a little
higher we don't know yet what it is and
it's a totally new entry and there's be
some interaction with razor come there
the community communication system on
razor gaming maybe some sort of like
notification thing if your friend is
trying to ping you for a game you do you
think gaming at tied into these
wristbands and everything is going to be
like something that consumers will be
more interested in I think gamification
would be great or maybe making games out
of it you look at look sony playstation
they make place there cheers a fitness
band razor makes a fitness band we don't
see a lot of people making games other
than nintendo with we fit you know we
fit you where are those games that'd be
a great idea a piano Thank You FuelBand
tries is starting to try that you know
but yeah I BGC see where it goes well
that's the thing software and services
in the future and I think you're looking
at the next steps of slow
smarter bands that also act a bit like
smartwatches I'm Scott Stein and I'm
free to carry and that's a look at the
next generation of fitness tech here at
CES 2014 thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
