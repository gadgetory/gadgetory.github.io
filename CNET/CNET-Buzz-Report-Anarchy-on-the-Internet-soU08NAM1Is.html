report the show about the tech news that
everybody's talking about this week it's
slow slow internet that no one is in
charge of at all but first it's the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the Newton to aka the apple
tablet heaven help us I have been trying
to ignore this rumor mill but it is now
officially impossible this week ilounge
posted 10 tidbits about the device
saying it's eighty percent likely to
come to market if Steve Jobs gives it
the green light I lounge also said it
will be announced on or about January
nineteenth it will be like an oversized
iphone and it might even run the iphone
OS + apple recently hired back a guy who
worked on the original Newton tablet
tablet city babies except let's remember
that Steve Jobs killed the original
Newton he's the guy in charge of
deciding whether Newton to hear makes it
to market and he's pretty smart so he's
probably already figured out that no one
would buy it because no one ever buys
tablets unless it's the microsoft
courier simply use your courier pen to
write what you are looking for then copy
it tuck it and drag it to the exact
place you want it now that looks cool
and now for the news big developments
this week in the arena of who controls
the internet it's not the u.s. anymore
according to an agreement this week the
US Department of Commerce will no longer
have direct oversight over I can which
is the body that assigns and regulates
domain names I can will become an
independent body totally in control sort
of see there will be this accountability
panel that will kind of keep an eye on
things over there and the US will still
have a seat on that accountability panel
but then there will also be these like
independent review panels that will
oversee I can operations and those will
have people from all different countries
and varying agendas and then like no one
country or organization thrilling charts
exactly and I mean are you thinking what
I'm thinking hell in a handbasket
oh I'm just kidding it'll be fine it's
fine I mean internet will probably
mostly in Chinese but it's fine it's
gonna be fine just try not to forget we
invented it in other news this week
Microsoft released its free security
suite called security essentials now the
move caused makers of four pay security
software like Symantec and trend micro
to get downright nasty in response I
mean of course they're not happy about
Microsoft putting out free security
software that threatens their business
but man snotty a trend micro general
manager said you get what you pay for
and then semantics VP of Marketing said
that security essentials was a poor
product and wanted to know when was the
last time that Microsoft innovated Wow
it sounded like the comment section of
dig up in there but you know what guys
you can do all the high school style
sniping that you want but security
essentials is free and it's from
Microsoft and people are going to use it
Microsoft is the prom king live with it
and now for some entertainment news the
facebook movie will begin filming next
month in Boston it's called the social
network and it will reportedly be in
production on the Harvard campus for
about three weeks before moving back to
LA Aaron Sorkin of the West Wing wrote
the screenplay and it's being directed
by david fincher of Fight Club so I'm
hoping that there will be some really
fast walk and talks and then like some
major ass-kicking by a totally hot
imaginary Brad Pitt because otherwise
it's a movie about a dude who made a
website snoozer and finally bummer news
from the FCC according to them the
broadband internet speeds we're getting
our way slower than what we think we're
buying see the agency has been working
on its National Broadband Plan and
they've put out some initial findings
those findings say that actual broadband
speeds are often fifty to eighty percent
slower than ISPs advertised yeah it's
funny how no one ever gets in trouble
for that the findings also say it will
take billions of dollars of
infrastructure investment to build out
broadband networks that can handle all
the people who are going to want to do
high bandwidth activity in the coming
years but I
I don't think that that should be a
problem because after all I pay a lot to
get fifty to eighty percent slower
broadband than I expected to get like a
lot don't be telling me you don't have
any money to build me up my broadband
get to it is peace with my money and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone i'm molly wood and thank you
