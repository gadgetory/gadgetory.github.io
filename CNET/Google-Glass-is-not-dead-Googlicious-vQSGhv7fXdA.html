everything Google we can pack inside of
a show and I'm here to tell you despite
rumors of its demise glass is not dead
we've talked in the past about how an
updated Enterprise version of glasses
Beanfield tested and the glass for works
startup augment --ax has raised 17
million dollars in funding from five
leading healthcare systems to continue
to deploy wearable solutions for doctors
now this video showcases how doctors are
using glass right now to access forms
prescriptions medical history and more
while talking to the patients crowd
optic is also another glass for work
startup that provides video streaming
services for ambulance feeds for
hospitals live surgery video feeds and
they also work with sports clients like
the Denver Broncos it just reached its
10,000 video stream now even if it's not
for the consumer right now you're
finally seeing how glasses settled
themselves into specific use cases that
are extremely helpful we also talked
about Android be our last week and the
official Google i/o schedule has been
released with a couple interesting
sessions Google's vision for VR will be
hosted at their main stage and will
cover what they've built learned and
where they're going there's also a few
project tango related sessions with a
reported tango and cardboard mashup
potentially coming soon but some rumor
reports believe we'll see Google's gear
VR like headset of their own at i/o this
year as well Google continues to test
its self-driving cars it if you think
about it these cars have to basically be
perfect before we even see them on the
road which is no small feat but Chinese
search engine Baidu wants a piece of the
pie and announced their own self driving
car research and development center in
Sunnyvale California that's basically
Google's backyard now they recently
hired a Tesla autopilot software
engineer and Google better be making
sure their fences are a little higher
because you know Baidu is going to try
to peek over that fence once in a while
also Google looks like they're finally
committing to the Chrome OS with the
full Android app library after a recent
finding from a Reddit user found the
ability to enable Android apps to run on
your Chromebook in the settings now
users only had a handful of apps in the
past
but this could mean Chrome OS is opening
the floodgates and it's likely this is
something that gets more attention at
i/o and sony has announced that the
Android n Developer Preview is now
available for the Xperia z3 phone it
works for the D 6603
and sixty six five three variants Sony
is the first om to bring the dev preview
to its users and last year they also
allowed owners to test the marshmallow
concepts off more months before its
release and if you're still not seeing
podcast in the Play Music app yet try
just refreshing your account go to the
music settings hit refresh in the
accounts section and you should see the
podcast options now see easy peasy and
in the most important news that we
weren't able to cover in last week's
show the Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7 edge
are now available in a color they call
pink gold yeah sure it looks nothing
like Apple's rose gold in fact they say
it's inspired by skin tone but if they
really wanted to be ballsy Samsung
should have just called it skin all
right that's going to do it for this
week you can email us at Google issues
at Cena comm we're to me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for some more of that
