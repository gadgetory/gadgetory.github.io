heavy hitter in the custom PC seen and
that's origin PC introducing the Origin
PC Chronos micro-atx desktop machine
with a LAN Lee case an Origin stage 3
hardline liquid cooling
now behind the glass origen remarkably
cramped an EVGA micro x99 motherboard
with a fully liquid-cooled 8 core 59 60
X chip now this chip usually runs at 3
gigahertz but thanks to all this liquid
cooling we're able to safely overclock
it well past 4 gigahertz for some pretty
insane performance all the tube bending
inside here is custom and origin even
found room to display a water coolant
reservoir at the base of the case as
well so what about the machines graphics
card well mount it at the bottom of this
is not one but two NVIDIA Titan X cards
though because of the spacing here these
cards aren't able to be water cooled
like the processor is now the unit we
received also shipped with 16 gigabytes
of RAM a one terabyte SSD drive and a
four terabyte SSD HD drive for storage
real estate is a little tight inside the
case so there's really not a lot of room
for expansion if you wanted to say add
another hard drive I'm not totally in
love with the placement of the PCs power
supply as the cooling fan is pressed
right up against the glass also I found
this space between the back of the case
and access to the various USB and
DisplayPort connections to be difficult
and sort of out of reach so those few
negatives aside what can you expect to
pay for a rig like this
well the Chronos micro ATX desktop that
line starts at thirteen hundred and
twenty-five dollars but the souped-up
over-the-top version we received right
here would retail for wait for it eighty
one ninety nine now there's no doubt
about it you're definitely paying a
premium for this kind of pretty hardware
but you can definitely customize a more
than capable machine for thousands less
it's definitely an engineering feat and
for the enthusiast PC gamer that needs
something that no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
