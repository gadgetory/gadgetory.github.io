special of inside scoop as if you
couldn't tell from the stickers im sue
me Dawson with me is daniel Terdiman
senior writer for cnet also sporting a
sticker well done you voted so we're
going to talk today about Nate Silver
who has a blog fivethirtyeight blog
which is also featured on the New York
Times site tell us about nate silver and
what he does so Nate he's been doing
this since 2008 before he worked for the
New York Times what he does is he
essentially takes all the available
polling that's out there and he
aggregates it and comes uses a pretty
sophisticated you know algorithm to wait
the polls and figure out which ones are
kind of you know have have more
relevance or more accurate and then sort
of jams it all together and thanks
formula yeah and then what he does this
is so the most important part of what he
does is he runs a hundred thousand daily
simulations of the election based on all
his data and then spits out
probabilities of what's going to happen
okay and he takes polls from I would
imagine the the gamut from left to right
from liberal think tanks too
conservative outlets right right well
yeah he's like I said it takes any
available pulling but he he he's a SAS
Titian and he takes each pole and kind
of assigns it a weight based on its
recency based on that polling firms
historical accuracy you know and then
you know throws in things like you know
what the the demographics demographics
are in a particular state and so you
can't say that one poll is automatically
you know weighted the same as another
poll and he's kind of built the system
around figuring out the the sort of
variance isn't mad and he's proven in
the past to be pretty accurate okay so
he's got a good track record doesn't and
what does he predict for this election
well because we're all too impatient to
wait till the end of the day are an
election day last I checked he was
predicting ninety-one percent chance
that that President Obama would be
reelected with about 313 electoral votes
and you need 270 electoral votes to win
so but the the thing that's gotten him a
lot of attention is that you know
a couple of weeks ago when you remember
that after the first presidential debate
President Obama's poll poll numbers sort
of drop governor Romney's numbers start
to go up and a lot of the polling was
actually showing Governor Romney ahead
or you know very close and so the sort
of the the media narrative at that point
was this race is too close to call
there's no way to tell maybe even
Romney's ahead because Obama had been
ahead all the way along suddenly Romney
might have been ahead all through that
nate silver at five thirty eight was
saying no my numbers still show that
that obama's is safely ahead and the
reason is it boils down to the way that
our presidential elections work is it's
actually not a national election it's 50
state elections plus the District of
Columbia that's how the electoral
college works and he has shown that
Obama has been ahead in Ohio all along
and Ohio is the state that's going to
make the difference this year elbows
down to a high almost at Ohio and so
into a lesser degree Florida not Florida
is not sort of key this this year okay
yeah he has this thing called the
tipping point States it's a graph and
you know it shows which state is most
likely to be the the tipping point in
the election in ohio is like an order of
magnitude above any other state so does
that explain what you just said that
that then explains why we see all these
other polls that are saying you know
it's a dead heat it's forty seven
percent of forty-eight percent is so
closely tied and it's too close to call
right and the reason that those polls
are those narrative is happen is because
those people are focusing really on a
national polling only and are not
looking at the State polling ok does
this represent sort of a shift away from
traditional polls the attention that
nate silver is getting over the past
four years now that the last two
elections and away from you know the
gallup polls a pew research center poles
that sort of i think i think what it
does is it is it changes the the
narrative so you can't focus on any one
poll and it used to be that Gallup was
the standard write a new gallup you know
this candidates ahead and in the gallup
poll therefore that's probably what's
going to happen now I think what nate
silver and other people and it should be
noted he's not the only one who has a
sort of an aggregator model with what
they're trying to say is you can't focus
on any one poll because anyone pole can
be an outlier and so the sort of the the
theory there is if five polls say this
and one poll says this even if it's
gallop you can't necessarily trust it
you got it you kind of kind of look at
where the other ones are all grouping
together okay but I think at the same
time I think it's actually put more
attention on polling I think people pay
more attention to the idea of pulling
and I think it's kind of exciting it's a
horse race kind of thing yeah we're
definitely glued to their computers
refresh refresh absolutely Daniel
tournament thank you so much and if you
haven't done so already go get your
sticker for inside scoop I'm stupid ass
