welcome to the apple pie for the good
the bad and everything else you could
think of inside the world of Apple now
there's plenty of stories to talk about
plus the winners of our gelaskins
giveaway so let's get to it and no one
still really knows what apple will do to
respond to the galaxy s4 one of the most
feature-packed phones ever when it hits
the market in April or May but a new
patent awarded to the Cupertino kids
describes an augmented reality system
for connected devices that can overlay
info about the multiple objects it's
pointed at there are plenty of apps that
already do some of this and before you
start yelling Apple can't patent that
it's specific to being interactive and
you will also be able to create your own
annotations by writing or drawing them
on your device remember apples last
killer feature with Siri and if this is
the killer feature for the next iPhone
I'll be changing the name of the show to
the Samsung bite right alright guys in
ipad mini news CNET's own checks with
DisplaySearch and the supply channel
point to the ipad mini 2 with Retina
Display launching in the third or fourth
quarter of 2013 the display search
analyst says they're expecting a display
resolution of 2048 x 1536 that's four
times the pixels and double the
resolution but we shouldn't expect it in
the first half of this year which is
fine for those of you who were able to
control yourselves from buying the first
one unlike my brother so he could let
his son Jake use the regular iPad but
look how cute it's so precious now
there's still chatter about Apple having
two different phones this year and KGI
securities analysts continue to press
that the low-cost phone will still have
a 4-inch screen with a super thin
plastic casing mixed with fiberglass for
more nutrition and making it stronger
and thinner compared to other smartphone
plastic casings plus it's still rumored
to be coming in four to six different
colors Martin Hajek even created these
sweet renders of what a colored iPhone
might look like for iphone Club NL in
red
and aqua blue and they look pretty sweet
and you know everyone likes colors and
this is pretty much a slam dunk Belov oh
my goodness that was so nasty he was
like who's like as oh alright I got a
little carried away with that one now
Apple has added a new member to its team
and its former Adobe chief technology
officer kevin lynch you might not
remember him but Lynch was the face for
Adobe that insisted and continued to
defend flash four years against apple's
desire to prevent it from running on its
mobile devices now he'll be working
under Bob Mansfield so he'll probably
just blend into the background but you
might be asking the question would SJ
even hire someone that was so outspoken
against Apple well maybe you should ask
him yourself thanks to this pretty
ridiculous lifelike action toy of Steve
Jobs from the team at legend toys now it
has multiple points of articulation and
they even got it down to the details of
his stare mock turtleneck detailed blue
jeans and the laces look at the laces on
his new balance shoes now you can also
swap out his hand so you can recreate
that s J's point or make them do
something really cool like hold my handi
snacks before I dip them in cheese the
action figure retails for 200 dollars
and comes with the replica chair he used
at his ipad presentation but really he
could just be that friend who's always
by your side all right to the quick
bites another apple patent that's been
submitted reveals the evolution of the
iPad Smart Cover that would include
built-in inductive charging to allow the
iPad to continue to be charged on the go
by the Smart Cover now the smart cover
itself would need to be charged from an
external power supply but the patent
also shows that it could be charged by
resting near something like an imac to
wirelessly charge the cover on its own
now this doesn't mean it's happening but
this stuff is real interesting also in
some quick software updates the latest
Apple TV software has been updated a
five point two point one including
security and bug fixes but also
completely redesigns the hulu app with
better navigation and discovery also iOS
gets an update to six point one point
three which
fixes the passcode bypassing bug on
phones and makes improvements to maps in
Japan all right let's get to our
gelaskins winners we asked you the Apple
biters one thing you would change and a
lot of you said nothing at all which is
the right answer but you know I like to
have fun so our winners from Twitter
Caleb mal he said you need a co-host but
Caleb I don't remember taking that
picture no God will a says if I could
change the apple byte Brian would have
dreads and an iced out grill but I don't
drink sizzurp all right guys on email
mansur read rights I would love to see
noshit August featured every episode I
miss him already next question now
there's a lot of you and I mean a lot
that ass like Jacob rera 779 to did I
would have Brian do the show shirtless
see there's a reason why I write the
show and you guys don't and Alex I wrote
more Jamie less Brian thanks Alex I
appreciate the feedback all right
congrats to our winners for the
fifty-dollar gelaskins gift card and a
lot of you also asked me to change up my
hair so I'm leaning towards this style
