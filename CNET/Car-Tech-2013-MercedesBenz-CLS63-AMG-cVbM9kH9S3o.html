all isn't it and Mercedes apparently
agrees with this cls63 you've got AMG
power and good fuel economy
you've got saucy coupe lines and a door
for every passenger it's a statement and
an exercise in conspicuous consumption
let's drive this 2013 CLS 63 with the
AMG Performance Package and check the
tach
first of all of CLS even before it
becomes an AMG car is kind of an
exercise and very expensive Swiss Army
knife making everything is rammed into
one package all those attributes we just
talked about and they do a pretty good
job of it but from the outside you might
never guess this car is based on an e
class the very different look on the
exterior and the massing and the
proportions of it it's also gonna fool
you on the inside where you'll find
there is no such thing as a basic CLS 63
as you might imagine everything in here
is top drawer the materials are
phenomenal it's a little on the guilded
side for my tastes certainly compared to
the very businesslike cockpit of a BMW
or an Audi and as you can see you're
surrounded by a forest of controls let's
get into a few of them starting with
this command controller here this is
classic Mercedes stuff operating an
interface that we've seen fairly
consistently before there's a ribbon on
the top there's sort of what I would
call your content in the middle and then
there's another ribbon of settings or
options on the bottom that's the
Mercedes interface now if you go to this
globe icon in the far right that's where
the internet stuff lives check it out
we've got a web browser it's not much a1
it's a clunky thing to use because
obviously it's not touchscreen it's a
German car after all more useful of the
mercedes-benz apps and I use more with
quotes around it I'm not a big fan of
this app suite which is playing catch-up
right now its competitors have been
doing apps longer Mercedes needs another
Rev I think to really get this right the
first issue you can see right there man
this thing is slow to get a data
connection
once it does here's what you'll get
Google local search is the most useful
thing here on its face you've also got
Yelp Facebook news and this one's new my
mercedes-benz financial services you can
pay your car payment from here the local
search again long long pause to buffer
between these things man it'll kill you
and you can search near you or along the
router some other city imagine typing
that in at this tedious terminology now
once they get my Google local search
results there nicely ranked according to
some logic it's clearly not by distance
I don't even want to try
and find the menu to change that you do
have Google Street View and panoramio
stills from the community you'd like to
look at and this theme goes on through
these different apps the other one I
want to show you is Facebook first of
all right
why Facebook in the car and when the car
is moving you can't do much with it
which is fine with me except you can do
a couple things while driving for
example you can look at your events
people have invited you to check out the
details and RSVP to them but you can't
do anything with walls or news now once
you leave the interface on the head unit
which as I've shown you is kind of hit
and miss you get to some more hit and
miss down here with the drive line
controls I think it's excessive
complication the shifter starts off with
a park button but everything else is a
shifter detent I'm not being on those
two different kinds of behaviors to do
the same thing which is control the
drive line once you're in park and you
want to come out you do one little
detent and it up straight to neutral you
cannot go to reverse without then going
to detents the other way why is that and
then it's a couple more detents down to
drive so you never know if it's one or
two detents and for some reason you got
to skip reverse on your way out of park
made me nuts over here is your
personality knob for your powertrain C
is I call it comfort they call it
controlled performance or something
Sport Sport+
and manual only what this is going to do
is sharpen up throttle response rpm
holding speed of shifts by this
automated transmission a whole variety
of power delivery programs down here
would be normally considered a traction
control defeat but they actually define
it as a sport mode down here this
controls your adaptive suspension which
is not just shocks but also anti-sway
technology to keep this guy flat as well
as to firm up damper response three
modes on that and then you've got an AMG
button which you just simply press and
hold to memorize whatever you've done
with everything else it's basically like
a radio preset for the drivetrain and
suspension sure it's ideal if you're the
very serious aggressive driver who
really dials a car in specifically but
if you're doing that do you do it at a
forty 200-pound four-door sedan that
makes no sense
now once you open the extremely wide
opening hood on this cls63 at nice
mercedes service thing you find a big ol
motor under here the 63 tells you
nothing on the tail because up front we
have a 5.5 liter v8 with a turbo on each
bank we have that AMG performance
package you know it because you see a
carbon-fiber cover here that means we
have 560 horse 590 foot-pounds of torque
crazy numbers all of that gets just 4200
pound car up to sixty and four and a
half seconds or a few tenths less
because we got the performance package
goes out to a 7-speed rear-wheel drive
only now this is a 13 the 2014 car gets
big changes first of all the AMG
performance numbers becomes more or less
the base power numbers the transmission
goes to a 7-speed dual-clutch automated
manual and they're gonna get
all-wheel-drive in the mix so it's a
very different car for 2014 just FYI now
all of this weight speed and
displacement should edit with some
horrendous mpg figures but it doesn't
16:25 the epa rating on this guy i have
driven cars much slower that use a lot
more fuel that's pretty impressive
but now the real funs of this vehicle
what are Emanuele let's drop down a
couple years let's hit it
Wow this car has locomotive power I mean
just crazy power as you can imagine from
those numbers and that kind of engine
architecture however I never found this
car to really feel sharp powerful and
sharper two different things as cars
definitely the former but every shift in
every mode feels a little bit laggy to
me certainly even Sport Plus was a
surprise and that it's kind of a sleep
of the switch to my particular taste of
interval I found myself getting on the
paddles a lot but not because I wanted
to because I had to cuz the chef's
programming was letting me down there we
go another one where was caught
flat-footed it had to unbury itself from
like seventh at 55 miles an hour this
car is always trying to go along it like
1500 rpm to save fuel but the
programming just bothers me sometimes
so instead this is a great car for the
long trip boulevard cruising maybe a
roads got a little bit of sneaking to it
but if you want to take this car out and
toss it around on one of those more fun
smaller twisty roads it's not gonna make
you as happy to say a BMW 640i grand
coupe which has a much lighter on its
feet nature of course all that can be
forgotten when you drop it into third
just step on it
okay let's price our 2013 CLS 63 this
guy goes out of about ninety eight six
bass and that doesn't include the AMG
Performance Package that hotter engine
that's gonna add seventy three hundred
dollars part of that goes to that carbon
fibre cover we'll never know how much a
package of all the driver assist
technologies active blind spot Lane
Departure and adaptive cruise is a
little under three grand all in you've
bitten off about a hundred and eight
thousand dollars worth of I want to have
it all it is all here it's not the best
execution on a lot of the technology and
it's not the kind of driving experience
you may be looking for but if you want
power elegance practicality and prestige
there's a lot to see here
