can't and I won't that I don't have to
the following games are sure to heighten
your senses of fear shock and terror
you're about to enter another dimension
a dimension not only of sight and sound
but of mind your next stop the 5
scariest games to play this Halloween ok
I can't keep talking like that guy up
first is soma a game from the team that
made amnesia the dark descent for PC
back in 2010 soma is a first-person
exploration game where you've landed on
some kind of base and you have no idea
what's going on things just get gnarlier
from here so try not to play this one
okay so here's one I didn't think would
be scary at all just because it's one of
those black and white top down kinds of
games but knocked is a lot of fun and
surprisingly off-putting it's a survival
horror game with some RPG gameplay
peppered in the monsters in it move in
really creepy ways and the visual style
is just super strange I love it make
sure you check it out okay so a game
called layers of fear isn't exactly
being subtle but this game is a damn
trip in it you play an artist who has
lost their mind while trying to paint a
masterpiece you order a true portrait so
that's what I paid it you wander this
big empty house and that's when things
start to change all around you and you
slowly fall deep into madness give it a
try if you're looking for a creepy
scared wasteland 2 directors cut is a
huge graphical and gameplay update on
ps4 xbox one and MC and it really allows
this classic post-apocalyptic RPG to
shine you'll roam a morbid and dark
world where the outlook is bleak and
your choices are crucial you can handle
the weight of your actions and endure
their terrifying consequences give
wasteland 2 directors cut ago and
finally if you've got a ps4 do yourself
a favor and check out not just one of
the scariest games of the year but
possibly the ps4 sleeper hit of the
summer it's called until dawn the game
plays out like I can't be horror story
with teenagers being chased down one by
one in a cabin but you get to make
split-second decisions about where the
story goes so who will live and who will
die play until dawn with a group of
friends and find out just make sure you
turn out the light
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
