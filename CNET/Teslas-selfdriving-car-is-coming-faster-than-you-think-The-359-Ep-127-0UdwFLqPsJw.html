it's time for episode 127 of the 359
podcast with Roger Chang and Joanie's
soles Minh good morning everybody thank
you for joining us
morning happy Thursday I know weeks of
almost all over its I'm gonna make a
supercut of you going happy Thursday the
weeks almost over no 827 versions and I
would be amused by every version I amuse
myself careful my wife says the exact
same thing all right well yeah happy
Thursday it's it's great that you've got
another busy show
unfortunately when unfortunately we're
not gonna be talking about Google or
Samsung or Apple
fortunately refreshing yeah change a
pace give it time to talk we got a lot
of that out of the way yesterday yeah
leave that in the past yes for one day
she has watched a movie yeah my voice is
sore from screaming at the TV really I
just felt like more the same to me I
only got through two beers versus the
three to four beers that I have drunk
previous debates so that's probably a
good litmus test for it's called the how
energy rating my wife and I were
watching them on different YouTube
streamed and their way out of sync
they're coming like did you hear we said
of like what question she was pumping
all right and that's it on the promise
sorry about that we're not talking about
politics at all anymore instead we'll be
talking about Tesla pushing its
self-driving Hardware we're gonna talk
about then in new Nintendo switch that's
a new video game console and lastly
we'll talk about let go let go the
Chinese company that you probably never
heard of but maybe will in the next
couple weeks months we'll see as always
if you vent any questions about these
topics leave it in the comment section
Brian our producer will wrap the best
and we will answer them we'll try our
best to answer them
right let's let's do it alright let's
start this podcast in three two
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day no they're
crap you want to throw it I'm Roger
Chang and I'm Joanie Sussman the
self-driving cars are almost here
Tesla said yesterday that we'll make a
new suite of self-driving Hardware
standard for all new models starting in
2018 so that puts a company in a clear
path for a true autonomous vehicles so
John are you are you ready for our
self-driving driverless cars to come
pick you up and take you around I mean
who doesn't want a driverless car to
pick you up to drop you off at your
office men park itself that's what the
video they released the other day kind
of showed this this blissful future but
the thing that's holding it back is the
fact that a Tesla itself said that even
though the hardware is going to be in
all the cars it's producing from now on
here on out you won't be able to use it
right right right
who knows how long it could be unlocked
later on via some sort of software
update right because I have to do a lot
like millions of miles of road testing
and we're also everybody Ford Google
Tesla doesn't matter who everybody
that's making these cars is waiting for
regulatory yeah definitely and there are
still a lot of concern out there right
there was a incident earlier this year
in Florida the fatality that involved
auto pilot yes so there have been
concerns definitely definitely and so I
don't know like I'm definitely ready for
that just off from car I'm I hate
traveling traffic so and with the
fatality kind of goes to show so many
people are killed in vehicles yep every
single day and it's natural to be wary
of a new technology but the whole reason
that a lot of Google for example is
pursuing self-driving cars is because it
can be revolutionary to safety if yes
right yes taking out that you exactly at
every car on the road is a self-driving
car or uses you know AI or whatever our
time is driving it is definitely a lot
more safe and it's yeah that's the sort
of dream but I don't know we'll see see
now I'll be stuck on the Li e in traffic
grumbling and just being annoyed as a
biker I'll be glad that there won't be
road rage e drivers yelling at me true
if it would be better if those cars can
actually talk to your bike you can start
by going oh oh yeah car automatically
swerve away oh yeah
no we're getting doored that would be
amazing that would help change my bio
for Cena though there you go all right
next up is the Nintendo switch it is the
the new game console from from Nintendo
unveiled today and it's it looks
interesting I'm not really sure what to
make of it it looks like it's several
products in one it's a handheld device a
convertible tablet it's got these
detachable controllers and it and it's
also the fault console home console to
the Wii U so it's both portable and what
do you think
well I'm gaming isn't my forte but it
seems like it's a refreshing concept at
least did you just say that about it
it's different and new yeah and you know
when the original we came out that was
new that was very different and came a
huge hit the Wii U was also very
different with this tablet thing that
came with what the system that was not
so successful and it's a little weird to
me I'm looking at the concept video now
and it's it's strange I don't know if
I'd want another tablet in the house I
mean it's not it's not a full-fledged
tablet for sure it's definitely more of
a game controller but I don't know this
is Nintendo's away I guess of trying to
go mobile yeah yeah
alright lastly let go like oh Joan Derek
Harker and and I spent the last week
trying to figure out what makes this
company tick basically the Chinese
version of Apple Samsung Netflix
Tesla and caramel caramel picture all
bundled into one and they had this huge
splashy two-hour event to unveil a
couple of products the key things a huge
85 inch TV for five thousand dollars at
a premium phone for $400 and these are
pretty pretty eye-opening prices for
them I think or high-end devices
something are you interested they're not
the kind of devices that are gonna make
me switch from what I already have right
partly because I don't have as a US
consumer my familiar with let you go it
was purely through having to cover it as
a journalist I'm not I don't have the
affiliation with the brand enough to be
like oh yeah I know them I can trust
them I'll I'll drop five thousand
dollars on the website yeah yeah right
I mean that's I think the biggest
challenge with this company there
they're huge in China they're they're
big sort of entertainment companies well
streaming streaming video streaming
content they have they will be launching
streaming service here in the US to pair
with these devices but I don't know if
that's gonna be enough I'll say for more
about these stories check us out and
seen it I'm Roger Cheng I'm Joni
Salzmann financial sting you said this
is Nintendo's way of getting into mobile
and you realize that they've had the
game boy since 1980 it's like a full
fledge then today it sounds like Tiger
Electronics there is the game and watch
well it's I mean my arm is it's the full
console experience on mobile I what I'm
curious about with this new Nintendo
concept is are they going to discontinue
3ds 2ds support or will they okay maybe
use the wrong word but will they'll be
another strictly mobile yeah yeah system
a launch to pair with this or is just
like no Nintendo's like this here's the
thing here's your Nintendo that would be
bold if this were like the the one thing
that's our rule them all but yeah I
don't know the Diaz franchise there are
actual portable gaming franchises like
right there's an actor separate version
little portable game franchise ip's it's
way more successful than there are home
consoles so it's just kind of hard for
me to see them giving up on that it's
just such a cash cow for them yeah it's
just a thought that kind of popped into
my head as soon as I saw this this
morning so we have a question so what do
you think of that court in Germany this
had to stop using auto pilots oh yes
right there that they've ruled that that
Tesla can't use the term autopilot in
existing in the existing cars though and
why is that basically I think it's just
it over States the claim that it's
actually autopilot that it's driving by
itself that's that's the concern that
they're good yeah and I think that's
that's for the status that it's at right
now yes exactly like it's not really
autopilot I mean it's cool name for it
but it semantics yeah I mean I think it
over States the the capabilities of the
car
fair enough that's more of a marketing
case yeah yeah yeah yeah it's your magic
does not like buzzwords
they're more straight ladies are pretty
serious serious Bunch here's a funny
thought will SpaceX ship be self-driving
ah is a bold thought you know I feel
almost I wouldn't I wouldn't rule out
anything from him yeah no kidding
see looking for more are you guys gonna
try the Nintendo we were talking a
little bit about gaming before we come
in here I'd like to try it out for sure
I haven't I mean I'm saying the last
console Nintendo console I had was the
n64
well Pokemon go could have some sort of
element to switch I don't know
well kind of book one goes kind of died
out but it went no it's a different
developer maybe they could bring it
in-house and I'm that's actually a
pretty interesting application to it but
yeah I don't know Parvez I don't know
what the actual specs are for this a bit
like does it have GPS isn't has its own
location tracking or a or is it just a
portable gaming system like a DS right I
don't know that's a lot under one hood
though interesting to see where it's
going they got to give it to Nintendo
for for innovation though it is unique
yeah it's really unique in a landscape
that doesn't have a lot of unique yeah
we always talk about this issue or we're
always complaining about the fact that
there's a little innovation going on
there's there few companies trying
different things the one like a company
does try something different really god
it's too weird
what do self-driving cars do when they
can't connect to the server for
instructions what is the fail set crash
come on no that's the big question I
think that's why a lot of people are
fearful of this is like I mean the
cognitive 'ti has to be perfect that's
to be very low latency like that has to
be there can't be any lag between the
car talking to the network and vice
versa I mean I imagine the car itself
has to have a little smart to kind of
run on its own it doesn't even
necessarily need to connect to a server
all the time it'll have to use you know
the cameras its own internal processor
that's in the car everything's kind of
local as sort of failsafe they couldn't
it couldn't 100% connect and
the things that Tesla said that the new
hardware includes is a real souped up
processor like 40 times yeah right now
so feasibly what that means is that a
car can do fine just on its own
right got inside its own it's got a nice
so that they're bringing us there
they're announcing this or telling their
customers essentially their future
proofing themselves except for the
future proofing but people that already
like shelled over those oh yeah sorry
for those who have been feature model
are you proving themselves folks now or
just sort of like oh you'll never have a
real auto pilot no do you need a
driver's license to operate an autopilot
that's where I gets the regulatory
questions come into play yeah because is
like a ten year old kid get into a car
and drive it somewhere that's what
regulators have to decide yeah yeah
they're still a big debate about that so
if there's ever any question if that
system fails I think they'd have to vote
in favor of like no you still have to be
able to operate this machine be legally
registered exact Sheen they've all
makers have talked about the several
stages and that sort of that middle
stage where it can drive by itself but
there's uh there's control for you to
take over or whatever and you have to
sit in the absolutely but there's a good
leader stage that everyone talked about
words like you sit in the back and use
your shot you just hang out and the or
you just you sit in the front seat but
it's facing backwards and you're like
sleeping or something I wouldn't trust
that it'll happen just it's gonna take a
long a long time the Jetsons will get
here yeah The Jetsons didn't even have
autopilot do you think Tesla might start
their own ride-sharing company out of
this oh that's an interesting question
that's speaking of why eco I mean
they're so they've also pushed the
self-driving car and one of the models
that they talked about was a potential
ride-sharing deal they're also a
professor in Faraday future which is
also another self-driving electric car
company startup and they've definitely
talked about ride-sharing as a potential
I mean it makes sense right yeah not
everyone can afford a self-driving car
but they wouldn't partner that out to
lift or somebody
I mean uber is already doing it
okay lyft is working with Ford oh yeah
so if they were gonna partner with
somebody those are the two ones that you
would partner with and they're already
either doing their own thing or snatched
up but that's not to say that lift
wouldn't partner with Sonny Tesla wanted
a partner was left okay okay okay yes oh
yeah yeah it's it's sounding like we've
gotten to that point where we have so
many distracted drivers and instead of
like saying shut down your damn phones
stop playing candy crush when you're
driving we have a sale just gonna make
robot cars killing yourselves we're not
going to give up our phones it's kind of
pathetic though come on like I enjoy
that kind of brings up an interesting
concept with the self-driving car idea
like you don't we're not going to give
up our phones there's a lot of people
that don't want to give up they're just
hearing wheels oh yeah I mean day
mundane getting to work getting home
that's stuff that almost everybody's
like get it out of my life yeah there's
some car driving especially in America I
mean I love my old road trip so that's
one of the things I missed the most
after I mother Kitty's had to get rid of
my car that point you could rent a car
or true but I mean like a couple
weekends ago I had to go to a wedding so
I drove about a thousand miles all over
the state and it was just fantastic it
was cathartic it was therapeutic and I
don't want a robot taking that away from
me not that it's gonna be mandated I
don't foresee that but I like your car
has to have this feature in it and be
opt-in type situation but it's like I
would never in terms of consumer appeal
mm-hm for sure absolutely yeah yeah it's
interesting though here's another
security question does Tesla have
encryption on the car what happens when
people start hacking your car I'm sure
they're into the late I'm sure the
processor definitely has some level
encryption I mean that that was sort of
a headline went from last year I think
it was Jeep that got hacked but it was
not self-driving car but it was just a
smart car that got hacked I think
there's still a lot of work that needs
to be done with automakers thinking
about security and just embedding that
into the systems in ho' not just
self-driving and smart cars but yeah I
can't speak specifically with Tesla's
own terms of what their security
measures are
someone in the chats bringing up things
like you know ships and planes they have
large elements of yes self automation
but it's like there's there's not a lot
of traffic in the sky
it's different it's very different still
looking around for different you know
where you're driving right like if
you're on the freeway or fare out like
in the countryside driving autopilot
works perfect if you're in New York City
you're pretty much dead so yeah it's
just a lot of its context of where
you're driving to very true
and one more thing about the how is it
aleko Iko Iko yeah so I'm a little lost
on it myself I'm not seeing a lot about
the chat regarding it but so okay what
the hell is it so it just sounds like
own big conglomerate it's a gigantic
company in China it is a conglomerate in
the sense it's different than the
conglomerate because usually what that
means it's like one company gets really
big and they start buying up all these
other little things become a gigantic
like monstrosity or behemoth or whatever
you wanna call it isn't like oh no let
go started as basically like a Netflix
or YouTube and became a gigantic
entertainment online video platform and
from there it expanded into making films
so it's the third biggest film producer
in China just like Disney would be here
and that upcoming movie the Great Wall
Matt Damon I thought that was I'm from
I'll see myself out oh no we were
supposed to not talk about politics I
didn't say anything about politics about
a wall okay all right and then and then
from there they've moved into devices
and like cloud yeah but it's a weird
thing to bring over to an uninitiated US
audience because what you have is this
Chinese company they are unfamiliar with
and you're like wooly what is it just
your afterlife yeah tell me it sounds
like movies they make cars they make
bikes it sounds kind of redundant like
we already have all of this and that
- mark what they're trying to fight it's
a perception that you know Chinese
companies make cheap products which
they're not really helping themselves
cuz their products are cheap but they're
like nice I guess and but the thing is
they're like one of many Chinese
companies bringing out phones that are
affordable or TVs are affordable sure
and they don't have that you have to buy
them through their own site so then have
any actual distribution beyond the ylim
all love something hard leshawna yes so
that I mean that that's also the problem
like beyond the fact that no one's ever
heard of them that you came in going you
can go like a Best Buy and see if you
can get a Verizon store and check out
the phone it just you have to go to the
site and they're quite stressed yes a
unseen by this bias product that's like
five thousand dollar product all right I
think that's probably a good place to
leave it off all right we'll be back
tomorrow where we'll talk about no way
to cut off my joke sorry I just will be
be we'll be back tomorrow to talk about
people hacking into my self-driving car
and changing the radio station to all
smash mouths and the forthcoming era of
Robo road rage Wow
okay I'm sorry about that that was a
good joke yeah well thanks sorry - all
right if you liked anything you saw her
here check this out on CNET our podcast
is available on iTunes tuning stitcher
SoundCloud Feedburner and google play
music again good at that
yeah I had some practice 527 times
alright have a good week well I'll see
