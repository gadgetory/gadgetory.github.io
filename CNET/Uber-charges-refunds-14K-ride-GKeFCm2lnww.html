dollars for a 20-minute ride a Twitter
post from December 9th is making the
rounds in it Twitter user Emily Canard
posted a screenshot of a bill from uber
the ride lasted from 514 to 535 p.m. in
Toronto the cost of the ride was
eighteen thousand five hundred and
eighteen dollars and fifty cents which
translates to around fourteen thousand
four hundred US dollars the bill
belonged to a friend of Cunard the
friend try to dispute the charges but
apparently was not given a refund
immediately after the Twitter post went
online it received a bit of attention
being retweeted and liked over 200 times
each uber said there was an error and
we've provided a full refund we
sincerely apologize to this writer for
his experience we have safeguards in
place to help prevent something like
this from happening and we are working
to understand how this occurred in the
past
uber has taken flack for its surge
pricing the company charged four times
the price during a hostage situation in
Sydney Australia after some social media
backlash uber Sydney gave away rides for
free
so was this 18,000 Canadian dollar
charge about surge pricing uber says no
on December 11th uber told the National
Post a Canadian publication that the
overcharged was due to a driver error
and not a technical issue are you still
using uber or have you jumped to another
service like lyft let us know for more
