pretty face hero 5 black is the most
powerful easy-to-use GoPro ever it's
waterproof without a housing to 30 feet
and it's got a 2 inch touch display with
a totally redesigned user interface it
captures video up to 4k and pro quality
thank you 12 megapixel photos and when
you add video stabilization stereo audio
GPS and voice control you're getting a
ton of GoPro for 399 bucks
check it out
0-5 black is the camera that's so
convenient and easy to use you forget
that you're using it yet it doesn't give
up any of the performance durability or
versatility that GoPro famous for purify
black is where really everything comes
together we're giving people all the
tools in one package they're getting
waterproof they're getting ruggedness
they're getting image stabilization
voice control screen on the back they're
getting the full embodiment of what is
GoPro
a big part of making a GoPro easier to
use is eliminating all of the
unnecessary parts and you don't have to
think should I use the housing or not
it's it's waterproof and durable all on
its own
they don't have to fumble with the clear
water housing anymore it's just built
right in you can just take it out of the
box hit the water and go down to 10
meters snowboarding for any extra
protection the fact that you'll get such
amazing quality video and audio and
never have to worry about is one of the
most wonderful things about it but a lot
of times a GoPro is out of reach
voice control just opens up a whole new
world of possibility for using your
GoPro you just think it's say it and do
it here five black supports seven
languages English French Italian German
Spanish Chinese and Japanese the
touchscreen on pro/5 black makes it so
that anybody can pick up a GoPro and
figure out how to use it without being
told but you can literally preview the
shot scroll through your options and
it's live changing the effect for you so
no matter where you are within the menus
you were one step away from giving the
shot we don't want you to miss that
moment
the image stabilization on hero five
black helps you capture the world as you
see it but you don't see a bunch of
shake and jitter when you're skiing or
when you're chasing your kids around the
beach your eyes smooth everything out
and that's what image stabilization on
hero five black accomplishes it really
gives you that first layer of polish
that's gonna make things pretty Wow the
image stabilization is gonna bring a
much more professional feel to
everybody's videos it brings back that
smooth bike ride they were having at
sunset with their friends you know
instead of them let's shake they were
getting from the handlebars there's
actually three microphones on the camera
what it's able to do is cherry-pick the
best sound from each one and combine
that into a brand new track and it's
happening automatically it's happening
actively every time you record now you
don't have that muffled sound that comes
from being in a housing so what we've
achieved with purified black audio
that's as good as the image quality
that's as good as the video and the
photos that you capture and it's awesome
you plug your hero five black into
charge from there it automatically
starts uploading to your GoPro Plus
account and that means that anytime
later that you want to pull up that
content it's sitting there waiting for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
