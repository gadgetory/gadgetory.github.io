to give you a small glimpse at what
project spark can do across devices on a
variety of inputs rusty is going to
start off by creating a beautiful world
on a Windows 8 desktop with touch
controls and in less than five minutes
we'll build a game from scratch be a
smart glass on the recently announced
Xbox one project spark is an open-world
digital canvas that enables anyone to
build play and share whatever they can
imagine it's a powerful yet simple way
to create your own worlds stories and
games project spark will be available on
xbox one xbox 360 and windows 8 and
through the power of the cloud it lets
you seamlessly carry over your progress
and content from one platform to another
it's an ongoing service with frequent
updates and content additions across all
of our platforms play the way you want
on whichever platform you want now rusty
is just putting the finishing touches
here on our game setting we've chosen
desert oasis he's using our paintbrush
to put in some finite detail a little
greenery around the pond there let's put
a couple more finishing touches on this
rusty will play with the time of day and
let's do the position of the Sun that's
cool all right and then we'll finish off
with placing an enemy for our gameplay
scenario your choice you chose the
Goblin nice place him in there excellent
alright
so rusty is going to save what he just
made to the cloud and we'll pick up over
here in our living room without losing a
beat imagine the possibilities they're
unlocked by creating away from your
console and then playing your
masterpiece over on the big screen
seamlessly creating back and forth
devices that you're ready just waiting
for your next inspiration this is
digital age nirvana all right rusty so
we're loading this up on the Xbox one we
want to see our desert oasis and our low
gameplay moment with the Goblin here
Rusty's on controller right now there we
are looks good now being across all
devices opens up new methods of input
and allows us to innovate with games of
all types even though we're now playing
on an xbox one we can use SmartGlass and
remote rendering on any windows 8 device
to keep creating with amazing touch
controls so rusty let's change this
controller based action mechanic into
something maybe a little less
predictable for console gaming in
project spark we can add behaviors to
anything in the world or alter brains
that already exist on things and play
around with this goblin brain and make a
quick touch game for everyone so rusty
started by deleting the default brain
we're going to build one from scratch
the brain is broken up into a win and a
do side the visual language is simple
yet very powerful we're going to tell
the Goblin here to jump on the ground
after specified time to a height of what
are we gonna pick up five meters we
think burak then we want to put one
other child rule in and that will
execute after the effect which will
destroy whatever we've touched making
this our main mechanic all right looks
good all right now finally we'll use our
clone command to make more goblins here
we just can't have one Goblin jumping
around and with more time rusty could
set up timers scores sounds and so much
more rusty let's change a couple of
those goblins into something different
give it a little visual variety here in
the desert he's chosen
Yeti interesting choice so we'll put a
Yeti in there may be another one all
right looking good perfect and then
let's play with the position a little
bit so we get some height variety there
we go all right now rusty should be able
to swipe or touch these enemies and
trying to feed them all ah there they
are now in just a few minutes he was
able to create a touch game he started
on windows 8 and completed over on xbox
one with SmartGlass with project spark
and Microsoft services the power to
create across devices to delight with
multiple inputs and the freedom to do it
anywhere has never been easier for
developers and players we're taking
registration for our beta on Windows 8
at join project spark calm and you can
also come by and check us out later in
the gaming lounge to see the creativity
that project spark can unlock we'd like
to finish by showing you a short sample
of some of the cross platform games
people just like you have brought to
life using project spark thank you
