the auto industry that are affordable
anyway and this is one of them let's see
what the seventh generation feels like
and how it carries its legacy as we
drive the 2015 VW GTI this one's an FCE
trim with a manual by the way check the
tech first of all the golf is still a
golf one of the most reliable formulas
in the business is still basically the
same formula it's a little longer it's a
little wider than the last generation
but almost trivially the big giveaway
for the spotter is the hood the face of
the current Golf has got this lower
sloping down snout going along with that
our new headlights and taillights beyond
that the packaging is very familiar now
I may not like every VW car but I think
I like every VW cabin they just punch
above their price class in terms of kind
of a nice mature style solid materials
now we have the lesser of two head units
a 5.8 inch display radio a larger nav
unit eight inch in a package is
available but to be honest I don't think
it holds a lot of delights VW is just
not cool when it comes to doing great
head units even on this one look at a
crappy dot pitch of that display you've
got some nice well-thought-out helper
hard keys around it your media choices
are pretty good it's not a class leader
in terms of apps for example if you're
gonna play an app it's going to be just
the audio coming off your phone instead
what you got is a CD player over here
where you can't reach it in the glove
box SD card slot there as well because
you know everyone loves that
here's your multi device interface down
there and the binnacle I hate these
things you got a custom port that has to
go to a VW or Audi cable that then goes
to your device just get a USB and of
course we have bluetooth streaming
that's going to be your saving grace
along with your radio choices rear
camera is optional on these cars the
base cars do not have it bear that in
mind
ditto for Park distance sensor that's
another option package it's part of
sunroof keyless access those are also
part of option packages and your audio
can get bumped up and I mean bumped to
fender audio which to me just sounds
like more speakers with a massive
subwoofer you can easily use to
overdrive everything else
so keep it around the middle okay under
the hood one engine choice on a GTI
you've got a 2-liter sidesaddle inline
turbo for two gearboxes available though
six-speed manual thank you or a 6-speed
DSG it's their dual clutch transmission
front wheel drive 210 horsepower or 220
if you get a special performance package
that basically hots up the software in
both cases though 258 pound-feet of
torque 0 to 60 s and the low sixes for
this car now if you want all-wheel-drive
not available here interestingly you get
slightly better mileage with the manual
that isn't usually the case these days
25:34 if you have a clutch 25:33
if you get the DSG gearbox and this
engine wants premium by the way now
first of all you gotta get used to a
couple things for even you're going in
this car I'm not crazy about the clutch
it's one of those really light ones
never been a fan but that is a little
easier to commute in and you may like
that feel the power comes on in a spooly
fashion like this
nice little growl you get out of this
engine and get it idle it's dead silent
and silky smooth the driving ergonomics
are quite nice on these vehicle at least
I think so plenty of headroom by the way
even if you're tall and as I mentioned
earlier a nice sturdy build quality in
here there's an adaptive suspension
available for the GTI we don't have it
and I don't miss it I like the way this
car handles now the least you can get
into a GTI for is about twenty five six
that's going to be a two-door it's gonna
be a manual transmission car no rear
camera no nav no sunroof pretty
bare-bones but you're getting the DNA at
six hundred bucks for a four-door eleven
hundred dollars for the dual clutch
transmission the performance package
that gets you more horsepower
limited-slip and bigger brakes is 1495
driver assist is also pretty limited
park sensors and forward collision
warning for 700 I can take or leave it
adaptive suspension can't comment on it
because we don't have it but it's $800
and it requires that previous
performance package the key is the SE
trim level for sunroof keyless rear cam
automatic lights defender audio
unfortunately you're gonna lose the cool
plaid cloth Autobahn for 1700 is only on
four doors by the way it also brings you
power seat for the driver and automatic
temperature control your $26,000 GTI can
rather easily become a $35,000 GTI if
you do it all up CNET style still a
couple grand shy of the entry point for
a Golf R though so they maintain some
separation there and for most people
this is enough great everyday driver and
ready for spirited driving when you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
