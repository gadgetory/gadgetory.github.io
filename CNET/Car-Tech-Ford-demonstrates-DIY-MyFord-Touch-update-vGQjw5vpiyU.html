in a Ford Edge with Jimbo's Kowski
director technical director up ford ii
fellow and director take for certain an
advanced for electrical electronics
alright now what are we gonna do here
today in this car we're gonna do the
performance upgrade for my Ford touch
it's a set of software improvements
we've made based on feedback since the
launch of the vehicle feedback from
customers on on improvements it has some
additional features as well - there's
actually two pieces the USB and then the
SD card the SD card contains the latest
database from grace notes and also
navigation we've got map data update as
well - basically it's just as simple as
inserting the US which they can okay but
the USB in one of the USB ports in the
home console here and you'll see come up
installing okay and without even doing
anything it didn't media starts
installing mmm-hmm and about how long
does this take
it's about 20-30 minutes alright so this
update process is pretty much finished
here we have a installation completed ok
button here we're going to press that
and we're able to pull the USB out
last thing we're going to do is put in
the new navigation cart you can see the
differences in the layout here you see
the simplified corners some simplified
buttons as well too it's much cleaner
look actually and those that the font is
really nice and defined mm-hmm so the
entertainment screen you see we changed
the button buttons around a bit you see
the presets are now closer in the center
some of those exilair setups and so on
are now further to the right and you can
see the buttons on the left hand side to
select the sources are a bit simpler as
well - so we're on climate control
screen you'll see changes quite a bit we
had this animation that moved the driver
to the passenger front to rear it really
wasn't adding a whole lot and so we
eliminated that animation piece
everything is all on the same surface
now whether it's you know the
temperature control for the driver or
the temperature control for the
passenger and you map database and
you'll see
we're now in the 3d mode you'll see
you'll see a little bit differences in
the layout we try to simplify the corner
make it more obvious that there buttons
in the corner you see the 3d objects as
well here downtown San Francisco here
yeah it's filling in rendered buildings
around there and see the transamerica
pyramid over there what's important here
is that we've really outlined the the
buttons and made them very clear what's
a button and what's not a button what's
a button that's available versus a
button that's not sorry you're gonna
come to everybody's house and deliver
the USB and SD card
we're actually mailing them out to
customers okay and they will receive
this package in the mail they can choose
to do it just like we did it here today
or if they prefer to go back to a dealer
they can do that as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
