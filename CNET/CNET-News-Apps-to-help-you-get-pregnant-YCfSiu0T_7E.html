high five Katherine fordin has a lot to
cheer about these days she's now
pregnant with her second child after
nearly a year of trying it was just a
lot of waiting and hoping and using an
app every day she would use the free
oviya fertility app to log her cycle to
help identify her fertile days I felt
like it was not only a personal
experience but that I was a maybe a
little bit more in control of sort of
what was happening we're really trying
to help them use their data to predict
their exact fertile window tell them
when to have intercourse to increase
their chances of conception so that they
can get pregnant faster Gina novice are
from a v-line claims seventy thousand
women have reported getting pregnant
while using the oviya app every day she
opens up the app and she enters her data
and she sees an immediate score of how
fertile she is that day as well as a
projection of when she will be fertile
the more you use it the better at work
so the more data we have about you the
better we can predict your fertile days
with hundreds of these types of apps
available doctors say they can be good
for understanding your body but say the
technology has limitations sometimes
situations may be a little more
complicated than the smartphone apps can
really give information about i would
definitely caution one to think that
there's not some magic bullet here that
you know we've been able to do this
without smartphones for a while as for
fordin she says the app provided her
some comfort I don't know about getting
me pregnant but I think I can give it
some credit on giving me peace of mind
and making me feel a little bit more
ease throughout those last few really
frustrating months now just a few months
of waiting before she has her baby in
San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com
