the US car market these days what they
call the midsize sedan
Camry Fusion Accord that's also where
the Ultima plays the all-new alter but
does it play hard enough let's drive
this 2013 ultimate SL and check it now
as you can see this new Altima is really
new they've done a lot to get rid of the
kind of rental car do we look it used to
have but bear in mind we're driving an
SL top-end trim they won't all look this
good but it's not just up against the
imports you know but the recently
revived and very compelling Ford Fusion
and Chevy Malibu for example but we're
looking here at a very nicely finished
cabin with much better materials than in
the past Nissan was kind of behind on
that compared to the competitors to the
head unit this is not the top end you're
going to find we don't have navigation
here that is available I'll talk about
that in a minute but we do have though
now is this color display all the
sources you really care about are here
the dumb ones aren't so this works
really well USB for iPod and thumb drive
is down there AM and FM is over here
with satellite radio next to it no HD
radio in this car by the way and of
course your optical slot is here
auxilary can bring up an aux jack which
is right there dying to be snapped off
or your bluetooth streaming like I have
my phone connected and notice we have
some really nice meta tags coming in
everything fits on the screen well
they've used the Real Estate nicely this
is your controller that lets you roll
through selections or press ENTER it's a
simplified version of the controller you
see on the more elaborate head units so
we do have Bose sound on this guy it's
not terribly fancy there's no fancy DSP
in here it's just bass treble balance
better speakers better amps I see a
center channel up there for example it's
overall a very successful interface
except in one area the real gripe I have
is these guys have the worst case of sub
button itis look at this AM and FM or
one-button satellite radios another
button what we're going to do that why
don't you give am/fm and satellite a
button CD and aux go together but not
all the alternate sources because iPod
gets its own button this is silly just
give me a source button that's not going
to confuse anybody we've been dealing
with source knobs on stereo receivers
since the late 50
it's not a new concept and it's a much
better organizing principle than this
sub nonsense this is the only car maker
that does it now what I wish we had was
what they call the technology package
that would upgrade this to a seven inch
screen put navigation in there it's not
a connected unit per se but it does have
Google fed points of interest so your
Pio eyes stay fresh and also send to car
so you can send from your desktop a
destination that you want available when
you get there not bad that package also
brings in something interesting called
moving object detection you would have
cameras all around the car which we've
seen before on Nissan's the around view
but it would also be doing artificial
intelligence to detect if there is
anyone walking around the car you're
about to run into especially in parking
garages and things like that
now the other screen of this car is this
one between the gauges here finally a
beautiful helper LCD in an affordable
Nissan you can page through that to get
tire pressure mpg info some various
vehicle alerts your settings for the
screen and your lane departure and blind
spot indications rear camera of course
on a car with a screen very small this
is the only place where I find the
screens a little bit tight and the
camera tends to run a little dim as well
no trajectory just some basic distance
markings one choice only on the ultimate
no matter what model you get you're
going to get what they call their
xtronic CVT it's a continuously variable
transmission you have a drive and a
drive Sport position which will change
the behavior a bit and of course you
have paddles but interestingly look at
them they're mounted on the column this
is really unusual and I like it to place
shifter paddles here on the wheel and
fix them supposes that you're going to
always keep your hands there who the
hell does that
okay under the hood it's a Nissan follow
along with me 3.5 liter v6 this one sits
sidesaddle drives the front wheels only
270 horsepower 251 foot-pounds of torque
this car weighs about 3300 but it gets
up to 60 in a very nice 5.7 seconds with
this bigger engine there's also a two
and a half liter for a whole different
story and we're getting 22 31 EPA
estimates on this car and part of that
mpg which is pretty good comes from the
fact that this year's CVT has a wider
array of ratios it can consensus eyes if
you will allowing it to even better keep
this engine in the sweet spot now
another cool piece of cabin tech on this
Nissan barely lives in the cabinets
mostly out here see that tire pressure
warning says I've got a badly low Left
Front so what you do is you start
pumping up the tire and this car is
going to flash its hazards to
acknowledge that you're doing that then
when you get to the right pressure it's
going to beep once and that's when you
stop let's say you go over you keep
going you're chatting on your phone or
something it's going to now flash the
hazard lights faster and you're going to
get three beeps it gets really upset so
you start to let air out on the valve
down here until you get one beep again
and you know you're back where you
should be kind of foolproof kind of cool
now because we have the ultimate v6 we
have no lack of power no lack of
responsiveness the car has got a very
quiet cabin the engine makes a
persistent note you hear it all the time
I'm also not a real big fan of the ride
quality except on the smoothest roads
it's a firm suspension that's great but
it's annoyingly transmissive I'm getting
too many little little potholes that big
out over feel those I'll bet they do a
recalibrate next year to soften up the
ride
steering feels great it's not over
assistant and a really comfortable cabin
they've got a nice job keeping it
spacious there's no soldier room not a
lot of fall in here on this line on the
body to make you feel claustrophobic and
these seats really are some of the
nicest I've driven in the oil
okay pricing a 2013 Altima SL top stack
31 to 90 with destination rolled in
there's only one option you've got to
get to go seen that style and you will
do this because it's a scorching deal
that tech package it's only a thousand
ninety bucks to get you seven inch
navigation with Google POS and send to
car you're also going to end up with
lane departure warning blind spot
warning and the multiple cameras around
the car that you object detection it
sounds like a typo at that price but
it's a nice package on this car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
