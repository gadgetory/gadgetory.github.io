party and you already have Philips hue
bulbs there are a couple of ways to turn
them into a fun and spooky centerpiece
for your Halloween party so I have four
Philips hue bulbs already set up and I
can of course control them from the
official app but I also have a couple of
other apps that let me sync the bulbs
with any music or spooky sounds that I'm
playing the first option is called hue
Halloween and it's available for iOS and
Android I love it because it's really
simple to get things started launch the
app and then hit the button on your hue
bridge to get things synced then hit the
lightbulb button to choose which lights
you'll use with the app so I'll set the
mood in this case piano music creepy
already but let's throw in some sound
effects and you'll see that as I change
the effects the lights sync with
whatever's playing like this that one's
really creepy
bears up other moods that you can choose
from for background music I can put some
raindrops in the background hit it with
a zombie's sound this app is great
because of all the built-in options but
it does require you to man it now if you
want more control over the music and how
the lights react to it
check out hue disco it's available for
iOS and Android
to get started you'll launch the app and
then sync it with your hue just like hue
Halloween then go ahead and choose which
light bulbs you want to work with the
app again the more the merrier
or scarier in this case once you do that
head over to the disco tab and here you
can really fine-tune the controls so the
most important one is really microphone
sensitivity because if you're having a
really rowdy party you want to make sure
that the app can still pick up on the
music that you're playing so if you have
a lot of people over cranked up the
sensitivity the other thing to check out
is the transition control so you can
choose between smooth for a smoother
transition or snap which gives you more
of a strobe effect kind of like a club
feel
and if you can't decide just choose mix
and then go ahead and queue up your
music and hit start
so those are just a couple of fun ways
to use your smartphone to add a little
more flair to your Halloween party but
you can also use these same tips
year-round during any other events
