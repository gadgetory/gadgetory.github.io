welcome to the alpha x for everything
inside the world of Apple now you guys
are getting an early show because I'll
be getting my tan on in Hawaii with my
friends but there are plenty of stories
for you and the hottest one coming from
nine to five Mac says Apple is putting
on the finishing touches on the revamped
15-inch MacBook Pro their sources who
have handled some of the components say
it will feature an ultra-thin design
with a jaw-dropping Retina display and
it will be the first Mac to sport USB
3.0 now they say the only MacBook Pro
will not have a taper design like the
macbook air instead it will be an
ultra-thin version of the macbook pro it
will lose the internal optical drive and
the power button we move to the keyboard
like it is on the air 9to5 mac also
reports it will include two Thunderbolt
ports a USB port and an SD card slot on
one side and audio in and out 2 USB
ports and power on the other side they
claim there's no Ethernet port or
firewire as well now there's tons of
details in there and it gains more
credibility after benchmarks for the
unreleased 2012 macbook pro in imax
popped up on geek benches benchmark
tests the macbook pro is listed with a
2.7 gigahertz intel Ivy Corbridge core
i7 processor and the motherboard has
been identified as one of several
unreleased mat configurations now the
new iMac identified also brings an Ivy
Bridge core i7 processor but this one's
running at 3.4 gigahertz the other news
here still no mac pro now premature
benchmarks have shown up before the
release of Apple products in the past so
these are some decently reliable tidbits
of info now Apple's iCloud is still
working on becoming a robust cloud
service and a report by The Wall Street
Journal says the big a will upgrade
iCloud at WWDC this year and allow
multiple users to share photos with each
other and extend the syncing ability to
videos as well now it's not clear if it
will be opened up to the web or if it
will stay exclusive to apples photo
stream feature that you can only view on
Apple devices lame now we saw
screenshots last week of the icon
website testing out notifications and it
looks like notes and reminders will be
making it to an update after screen
shots were taken from the beta
the iCloud site there are also direct
references to the iOS 6 beta in the
coast rings for the site and we're
expecting Iowa 6 to take center stage at
WWDC and more iOS 6 views over the
weekend 9to5 mac also reported that
Apple will drop Google Maps completely
in favor of their own in-house Maps
application and that's huge they
described it as being very similar to
the current google maps but cleaner
faster and more reliable Apple has made
a few acquisitions for different map
services over the years including c3
technologies who specialized in 3d
photorealistic maps and if it really
looks this good I'll need to change my
chonies again now news that was blown
out of proportion the China Daily
reported that Foxconn chairman terry GAO
said Foxconn is making preparations for
apples incoming I TV high def television
although development or manufacturing
has yet to begin Foxconn then issued a
statement denying that Gao made any such
statements they also said he will no
longer be speaking publicly about
Foxconn production for the rest of his
life now if you were hoping the next
iPhone will make it by June or July or
even august or September try October
well according to the I'm or blog Apple
is yet to finalize the design of the
next-gen iphone their sources say they
have not decided if they will change the
screens aspect ratio although there will
be a new smaller dock connector
implemented a home button still exists
which is a challenge because it takes up
more space that could be used for the
screen and the rumoured liquid metal
casing is still up in the air see it
sounds like all those earlier rumors
were right we all know absolutely
nothing and remember how we told you
about the Steve Jobs movie with actor
Ashton Kutcher and you the Apple biters
sent in your suggestions well the
standard for journalistic integrity in
well respected TMZ blog published
pictures of Kutcher in full character
with a black mock turtleneck blue jeans
and New Balance sneakers but there's a
blunder see Starbucks didn't exist in
California back in the 80s that's right
leave it to the apple by to do the real
investigative journalism and finally
this is probably a little self-serving
but we wanted to show up one of our
youngest fans
and give a big shout out to my man
Emilio and here's why hey ready Emilio
what do you want to watch tonight um
apple pies man do you want to watch
Blue's Clues a five man okay watch you
turn it on that's right Blue's Clues you
got nothing on the Apple white man
nothing alright guys that's going to do
it for this week's show some your emails

watching i'm brian Tong I will catch you
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
