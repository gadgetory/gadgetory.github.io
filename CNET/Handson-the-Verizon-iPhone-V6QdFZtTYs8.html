ever elusive iphone running on verizon
cdma network it was announced today in
New York well it's exactly what we
thought which isn't necessarily a bad
thing there's been a lot of pent up
demand for an iphone on verizon and
that's exactly what we got today but
there are a few little disappointments
there's no gsm chip in it so that means
it's not a world phone and it's not LTE
so it's not on the superfast network but
that might mean that the battery life is
pretty good or at least the same as what
you can get on the iphone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T
network a couple of details about it
it's going to cost 199 dollars for the
16 gig model 299 for the 32 gig model it
will launch on februari 10th for
everyone if you're an existing verizon
customer however it will launch on
februari third for pre-orders so you'll
get yours before everyone else does one
of the cool things about the verizon
version of the iphone is that it allows
for tethering of up to five devices that
means you can use the iphone to send
data to your tablet or your laptop or
any other device you want to get on the
internet so if you go to the settings
menu you see that one of the first
setting options is personal hotspot so
you click this you turn it on and you
can connect to another device using
Wi-Fi Bluetooth or USB one possible
drawback of this phone is that the cdma
network doesn't allow for voice calls at
the same time as you're using the data
which could be a limitation the hardware
of this phone is very similar to the
AT&amp;amp;T version although there is this one
seam along the top which could be an
antenna seam which could prevent the
problems at the iphone 4 had with
dropped calls because the antenna was
along the bottom one other hardware
difference is there's no sim card slot
one thing we don't know is pricing a
plan so that hotspot tethering that
we're so excited about could cost more
we don't know and they won't say just
yet otherwise it looks just like an
iphone 4 it's just a new name and a new
network iphone 4
on verizon at long last for cnet news
