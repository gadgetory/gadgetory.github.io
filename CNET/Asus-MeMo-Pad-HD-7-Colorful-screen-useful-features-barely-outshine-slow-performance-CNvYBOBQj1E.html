memo pad hd7 the tablet offers a great
variety of useful features customization
options and baked in family friendly
apps but suffers from lackluster
performance the 7-inch tablet ships with
Android jellybean 4.2 point one but Asus
promises and over-the-air update for
android 4.2 point 2 by its early August
release it houses a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera a 5 megapixel rear
camera microSD expansion slot micro USB
port microphone pinhole and headphone
jack even though it's also made by a
sous its overall build isn't as
comfortable as the original Nexus 7 the
back panel which comes in a variety of
colors slightly protrudes in a way that
digs into your palms when holding it
with both hands however the memo pad HD
7 s 1280 by 800 pixel resolution screen
is just as sharp as the first Nexus 7
and outperforms it when it comes to
color reproduction the tablet has a wide
range of colors which results in more
nuance details visible and images and
videos in addition the tablet is
preloaded with AC splendid which allows
you to calibrate the screen to your
liking another included app that
optimizes the user experience is audio
wizard the feature allows you to enhance
specific types of audio but only works
when you're using your speakers it's
quite essential to getting the most out
of your multimedia experience and the
most notable setting is the movie mode
it increases the volume of the speakers
and lets you hear soundscape noises that
would otherwise be too subtle to notice
the audio wizard is easily accessible
from the floating menu which is
activated by pressing the button next to
the back button on the Android
navigation bar the floating menu and
floating apps are an easy way to
multitask and they help simulate a multi
window experience it's a small window
that pops up directly above the
navigation bar and consists of a variety
of apps that can function on top of
whatever is currently on the screen
instead of closing an app to open the
browser change audio settings or
calculate an equation
you can easily use floating apps to
perform those tasks without interrupting
what you're doing unless you're using
netflix most floating apps will stop
Netflix from streaming video although
youtube doesn't have this issue the
tablet also comes with the power saver
app that goes above and beyond most
baked in battery saving features to
ensure that you squeeze the most out of
a low battery the downside to the memo
pad HD 7 is its sluggish performance
navigating between apps frequently
results in lag switching orientations
slow and the screen responsiveness is
inconsistent the Asus memo pad HD 7 is
chock-full of features that optimize
your multimedia experience and it
screens wide range of color is
impressive for a small tablet at a
bargain price of 149 but it's
inexpensive build is evident with its
mediocre performance and plastic design
