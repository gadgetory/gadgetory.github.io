than you think
if you can live with just a handful of
channels hi I'm John Falcone from CNET
and this is the elgato ITV mobile it's a
little $99 antenna dongle that turns
iPads iPhones and iPod Touch models into
portable TVs setup is simple just plug
the ITV mobile into your iPad or iPhone
and you'll be prompted to download El
Gatos free viewing app once that's
installed you can be watching live TV
just a few seconds later there's a catch
though actually a few of them first off
the ITV mobile only works with
over-the-air TV stations and only a
subset of those channels at that that's
because instead of a standard digital TV
tuner the ITV mobile accesses a service
called Dyle mobile TV which has some but
not all of the local stations in several
markets around the u.s. you can check
the dial TV website to see what channels
are available in your area here in New
York City it currently includes NBC Fox
Cuba and Telemundo but no CBS ABC or PBS
and don't look for any cable or
satellite channels you won't find them
here
you also can't playback or record your
programming so you're limited to live
shows that said the ITV app does let you
pause and rewind what you're watching
the other issue with ITV Mobile is that
it uses the older 30-pin Apple port it
does actually work with Apple's
lightning adapter but the result is a
rather delicate two and a half inch
protuberance from your iPad or iPhone
the video quality is good but not great
we noticed lots of pixelation during
scenes with a lot of motion and the
hardware itself feels a bit delicate I
wouldn't be confident for this to
survive a fall it's not all bad though
the ITV software includes a built-in
on-screen program guide so you always
know what's on and unlike a sling box or
an online video service like
flicks or Hulu Plus the ITV mobile lets
you watch TV without requiring internet
access so you can even use this during a
blackout for instance and unlike some of
those online streaming services ITV
choirs no additional monthly charges
once you've got the hardware you're good
to go
personally I think $99 is too expensive
for the ITV mobile especially given the
limited channel selection but if you're
looking for a hassle-free live TV on
your iPad it certainly deserves
consideration I'm John Falcone for CNET
and this is the elgato ITV mobile thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
