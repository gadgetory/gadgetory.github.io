almost completely lost my voice but I
have some extra cough drops my tea with
honey and i'm gonna go have some fun
damn it
something about III this year felt like
the end of an era all that glitz and
glam and big-time graphics and costumes
and flashing lights it was all there but
it felt like underneath that might be a
slightly rotten core software game sales
down forty two percent over last year
console sales are down with no hope on
the horizon other than the confusing and
weirdly boring wii u i decided to take a
look at the future of gaming starting
with the biggest disrupter of all the
phone in your pocket yeah and hardcore
gamers we don't like to admit that we
play games on touchscreens but we're all
doing it we all have smartphones and we
might not think of it as gaming but when
we sat on the bus we're playing games
speaking of the phone in your pocket
here's Microsoft again promising to
integrate the xbox with phones tablets
and TVs using a concept called smart
glass Microsoft has promised this kind
of thing before although this time
they're actually kind of far along
this is going to update because it knows
what I'm doing on the on the console and
say oh how you're gonna watch the North
remembers now if i tap that now i start
getting into the experience so i have
controls here over here i could pause i
could fast forward if i tap this
interactive map i get this map of
Westeros as location change in the
episode I may not know where I'm at this
is actually going to update dynamically
as the show progresses and this
principle of Xbox SmartGlass knowing
what's going on on the TV and pushing
the information to you so you don't have
to do the work it's really part of the
value for a consumer okay I love me some
game of thrones but don't worry
SmartGlass also works with games here's
a concept using Xbox SmartGlass in Halo
4 you could use this second screen to
get more game information even accept
multiplayer requests see now halo is my
game so I am fired up about halo 4 thing
is though every time I see like a big
long trailer frail oh you know what I
really want to see a halo movie get on
eggs back to those $60 disks those got
to go to enter cloud gaming all your
games anywhere maybe even without a
console you know look we wanted so that
your next generation you know in the
next the next TV you buy the next tablet
you buy you're basically are able to to
take that a gaming experience wherever
you happen to be and we want to make it
as convenient as possible now we've got
close to 300 games on like you said
tablets and smartphones
PCs and Macs and our own TV device to
online game system but also really
excited to also be announcing a
relationship with LG to integrate the
online service into next generation LG
Google TVs the skeptics will say well
you know what about the latency what
about the lag try it clouded mobile or
one thing but I'm ready for augmented
and even virtual reality Sony almost
thrilled me with an augmented reality
book that turned out to require a real
one although we are getting closer who
knows what's going to come next is it
going to be glasses we're gonna be home
it is it going to be interactive windows
on the street I can imagine the same
with game consoles who knows how it's
going to evolve I think that technology
is moving so fast people are so creative
with it it's really going to be excited
I was kind of surprised to find that
while I'm ready for a gaming implant
some pro gamers are not in a hurry for
that future of gaming we have the kinect
now the kinect is awesome i love it i
love the wii as well but when it comes
to you know competitive gaming when it
comes to shooting games I don't want to
go around and go and do virtual reality
if I want that would go do in real life
as well as like playing basketball I'm
gonna go outside and maybe get a tan and
said you don't want to get to that point
where you're wearing the goggles and
you're totally immersed I don't want to
have like a jacket that I can feel like
the bullets hitting me and it hurts
reloading I sit on my butt and flavor do
you can't miss him so maybe T squared
isn't quite ready yet but my feeling at
e3 this year was that this industry
needs a revolution and it cannot be just
more amazingly realistic headshots and
blood spray well maybe it could be that
for a few more years but after that it's
time to actually get creative I will be
waiting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
