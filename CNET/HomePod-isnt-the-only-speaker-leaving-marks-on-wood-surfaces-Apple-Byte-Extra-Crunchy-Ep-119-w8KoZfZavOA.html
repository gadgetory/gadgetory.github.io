is Steven Beecher producer of the Apple
byte extra crunchy podcast as you can
see on this graphic behind me that Brian
Tong emailed me this morning right extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr. Brian
Tong what's up everybody welcome to the
show hey beach and tong in the house you
know how we do it it is episode 118 for
those of you who are watching when my
guess 119 119 oh my gosh and you're
right it is 119 I read the wrong numbers
all good one thank you for correcting me
where would I be without you Beach where
would I be it is 119 I in case you guys
and gals watch this actual podcast let
us know if something looks different
does my camera look better slightly it
looks way better man that's okay good
that that's the whole point because
people been complaining something like
fine I'll I'll dish out some of that
some of that cheddar and make it better
yeah some squirrel so again this is the
Apple byte extra crunchy this is our
complimentary piece to our weekly video
podcast we know there is so much going
on this week but again the number to be
a part of our show and you keep the
calls coming and we love it
just like a faint white circle it's a
very obvious deliberate white circle and
everyone's like I was like dude Apple
like even this like one week in we're
seeing this right so it's not it doesn't
even feel like a week man it's not even
a week it's been on what Tuesday or
Wednesday with this would this started
happening yeah like so okay fine let's
just talk about this really quickly so
they showed the pictures they said this
has got to be an issue Apple did give
comment to both websites they first told
pocket-lint that it's not unusual for a
speaker with the silicone base this is
the keyword the silicone base to leave a
mild mark when placed on certain oiled
or wax surfaces so suggesting that
there's this chemical reaction that
happens between silicon and some of
these different types of treated wood
which is exactly what is happening
um it's happening to multiple people I
have the home pod that I reviewed on a
wood surface but I mean I'll be honest
with you it's like on a target table so
it's probably not that it's probably not
a fancy table like yeah but some people
are gonna be you know some people have
really expensive nice wooden tables and
that would really piss my white we just
got a like a new dining-room table if
the the home pot did that to my wife's
new table I would probably be dead I
wouldn't be here I'd be good you know
she would freak out now you'd be in
trouble bro we wouldn't have this
podcast would be no longer he'd be like
he done he Tong it wouldn't be beach in
time to be talking you'd be mad sitting
in the corner with like a dark light on
face so they also commented to
wirecutter that the marks can improve
over several days after the speaker is
removed from the wood surface and if
they don't fade on their own apples
advice was to try cleaning the surface
with the manufacturer's suggested oiling
method so you're basically telling me to
refinish my wood tables that I probably
don't have the finish for I Ritz I read
something like use a damp cloth or
something like that or a dry cloth maybe
that wasn't from Apple
no you're right you're right that's your
actually your foreseen the future but
Apple did say that about cleaning the
actual outside of the home pod not the
bottom of it though but you're right so
they're like yeah use a dry cloth um
Apple even released this document called
cleaning and taking care of home pod and
um this is there's a great this is so
great like I know people are rolling
their eyes like I can't like seriously I
still when I heard this I couldn't
believe it but it is what it is
so there's a section in this article
that talks about taking care of the home
pod and it says learn where to put home
pod and what to avoid to keep home pod
safe again we are gonna kind of jump
ahead through this whole statement but
um they did mention that the marks can
be caused by oils diffusing between the
silicone base and the table surface if
the marks persist clean the surface with
the manufacturers recommended thing we
talked about that I love this is the
last line if you're concerned about this
we recommend placing your home pod on a
different surface but it's somewhere
else
you're putting it on the wrong place to
listen to it wrong like you're holding
it wrong I was like in gate putting in
the wrong place I also like that they're
referring it to as as home pod and not
the home pod you know it's kind of like
that iPhone it's it's it's not plural
it's not singular so that that was like
you know and this is right out of the
gates again this is a three hundred and
forty nine dollar smart speaker I'm
gonna be kind right now but this is I
also want to make this clear actually
the home pot isn't the only one that is
having this issue you know Apple gets a
lot of attention with it but an article
that was just posted out by Tom's guide
and other people are kind of rumbling
about this
I've also confirmed that the Sonos one
the son√≠s ones bass also can damage some
wood surfaces as well there's a little
picture of a home pod and a Sonos one
right next to each other you can see the
ring on the home pod you can kind of see
the the rounded square corners of
so no swine but this is this is a thing
that is affecting speakers when there's
a silicone base on it of any kind so
it's just something now to know I just
don't want to make it like oh my gosh
Apple you suck although I will say like
bruh you had six years to try it and put
this on like every sir they had six
years to try this you're telling me no
one and apple HQ with the really big
houses haven't tried to put it on like a
fancy wood surface oh you know they had
it you know they had an on some fancy
wood maybe they just didn't want to just
they just didn't want to say anything
maybe they were scared I don't know
either way we did I did come up with a
solution on Twitter yesterday I posted
immediately I am pretty sure there's
gonna be something like the Apple
coaster that comes out just a nice just
call it the Apple coaster get it over
with charge like 40 bucks for it to put
your home pod underneath it a company
called pad and quill decided to
instantly capitalize on this and they're
releasing a like leather coaster to
prevent the home pod from marking your
surface and that's gonna ruin the
leather man that's a well yeah the
leather piece of the sacrificial lamb
maybe what is it gonna be friendly
finished what table or what sometimes
putting a speaker on those like diffuser
pads makes them sound even better you
know so I mean maybe Apple come out with
something like that but that is a huge
bummer I mean yeah you're saying they
had six years to test this thing out
like they they've they've to work on
this for security okay fine I'll give
him even three years I'll give up three
years for like at least having a form
factor - I'll be kind - ahead two years
you know it's weird though this rubber
that they make speakers and like even
headphones out of it does like
deteriorate over time it just kind of
like starts degrading so it's strange
that these oils are coming out of the
speaker's already you know within a few
days and it's just a tearing and it's
just gonna like crumble on your desk
over a period of years and years like I
mean even these headphones like they
just kind of start falling apart you
could start ripping the pieces out you
know yeah so it's it's kind of a thing
with speakers in general I believe you
know but
it's not happen to my echo I'm sorry my
echo dot is not leaving the market yeah
they don't have silicone on the bottom
yeah it's just a fact right it's a
chemical reaction between that so that's
what happens hey a beach have you
actually heard the home pop that much I
have heard the home pod because we were
using during this infinite loop video
right now that's streaming yeah it
sounds fantastic it really does like
compared to the Google home compared to
the other things I've heard the sound is
superior it sound the bass the
everything it just sounds really good
it's a hundred percent agree with you um
like I think what what's weird is that a
lot of reviewers write like let's be I'm
not trying to rip on them because a lot
of them are my friends but you know they
get this product from Apple they don't
have to buy it and they pop it out and
when you first play it I mean it sounds
it sounds awesome like for its size
you're like holy crap I can't believe
something this size has this much boom
and just like this full feeling of sound
it's really nice and then what I did is
after you know I got past that I
actually put it side-by-side to a Google
home Mac's not a Google home cuz we know
look this this the Apple speaker is
pretty much gonna dominate the regular
Amazon echo the regular Google home so
you've got to put it also against things
that are kind of more around its price
point so I put it next to Google home
acts and then what I kind of found over
time is when I'm just listing the home
partment itself I'm like oh this is
awesome right and I listen a lot of deep
heavy bass stuff so it it's the mids are
sick and everything but then I popped
out the Google home Mac side by side and
I was playing like some classical music
so I'm kind of like more classic rock
even some pop stuff and what I found is
that the home pod sounds great but when
you put it next to something like the
Google home acts like the highs the
troubles like the vocals there's a lot
of detail that's lost in the home pod so
it's kind of only when you have it side
by side can you say oh it does sound a
little muddy or like I can't I can't
hear Adam Levine's voice as clearly as I
would like I can't believe I'm admitting
that I did it just actually was a random
track that happened to pop up on my it
just happened to pop up right duh but um
so people reviewed it audio files
they've done all these like different
types of testing and
no one doubts that the sound is really
great but I can't beat you of all people
know this right isn't sound also kind of
subjective to not only how your ear
hears things but also the genres of
music you listen to oh definitely I mean
bass is gonna sound different and hip
hop than it is in metal and other things
in classical music like um I would use
something that you've listened to like
all your life that you're just used to
what it sounds like you know like I
don't know maybe like dr. Dre would be a
good example for for using the home pod
to compare to other things yeah but yeah
I mean it definitely is your ear and you
know what you're used to hearing what
you want to hear you're kind of like
listening for what you want to hear you
know sure that's solely true so uh but
the home pod definitely had a fullness
that I was not expecting like the
fullness of the sound is really
startling you know I'm like oh my god it
does sound really great yeah 100% 100%
agree with that and so you know other
outlets like consumer reports they said
pretty much what I had found in what I
put in my video before their article
even dropped is right just not as much
detail with the highs or vocals and they
even outright said look the home pod
sounds good but they felt that the
Google Mac home acts and the Sonos one
sound better than the home pod but again
this is just one outlet saying that you
have other outlets saying other things
and I just don't like the fact that
people kind of get caught up like Oh
specifically with audio and sound
quality they hear one thing and they
believe it it's like you just gotta hear
this stuff for yourself you don't listen
to anyone about this crap I haven't
heard the Sonos or the Google max but I
do feel like like they really spent a
lot of time focusing on the low end
because that's what like gets people you
know like when you walk into like a
concert and you hear all that low-end
it's like oh like there's something
magic happening up there you know yeah I
feel like Apple definitely focused on
the low end and maybe they didn't focus
so much on the high end yeah III agree
with you and you know it's even in a way
it's kind of how look Apple has this
beats acquisition they've worked closely
together you even people know that if
historically purchased beats music
they're tuned to give you deeper bass
more boom and a full mid but the
guys are kind of lose that detail and I
think that kind of DNA from their beats
acquisition that is floated into their
headphones was also part of this as well
I mean you can again you can feel it's a
tiny speaker that give you some real
boom and you're like damn thank you you
know that consulted Dre man they but you
know they brought him hid in a room and
him and Jimmy Jimmy Iovine or like what
do you guys think of the low end you
know and he's like oh let me turn this
up a little let me turn this up so you
guys can check out you know the review
that I put out the thing is that we know
a lot of the things and I don't want to
go into detail right it doesn't support
bluetooth so Android phones or non
iPhones can't use it but there were a
few nuggets of things that I found that
I thought were interesting that people
weren't really talking about as much
when the verge put out their review they
talked about how if someone is using the
home pot it is linked to really a
specific user and one I Oh s account
yeah
it's someone could walk by it and say
like Oh read the latest message or let
me send a message like someone could
basically hijack a few of your things
with messages notes and reminders well
what I what we found is that sure that
might be the case but once I leave let's
say I take my phone away and I go down
to the grocery store people won't be
able to play around and add notes or
reminders or check my messages when I've
gone you have to actually be in range of
the whole pod yeah we were running into
that problem doing the this infinite
loop thing that we're doing I couldn't
trigger it you know like we had to get
Lexi there yeah we also had to have the
phone sitting next to them for the whole
period of time which is kind of pain in
the ass but you know it is what it is
it's I mean I guess it's a security
thing to a certain degree but I just
again I don't want to beat it beat it
beat it - cuz I think we beat it to that
before it even came out everything that
we had expect about the home pod was
pretty much true right it's limitations
it's a lack of smarts when it comes to a
voice assistant the other thing I
thought that was they didn't really they
weren't gonna promote it but I thought
something like adding speakerphone to
the home pod would have been so easy
like it does support it but you can't
talk to it and say hey call you can't
say hey Siri call blankety-blank
you actually have to call
from your phone physically and then use
airplay to send the sound from your
phone to the speaker whether you are
making a call or whether you're
receiving a call so that's you know that
was an easy low-hanging fruit like just
make it a cool speakerphone it can't
even do that and then the other thing
I'm not expecting it to work with
Android phones but I feel look if you
have if you made Apple music as a
service for Android users you've got to
make it easier for someone to use that
product like it's not that hard to do
whether it's fine if you don't believe
in Bluetooth fine but give other users a
way to use it so the fact of the matter
is that if you have Apple music and
you're an Android user you can actually
use the home pod but you need someone
with a phone to set it up for you it has
to run iOS 11 and then they can enter in
your Apple music credentials but that's
the only way an Android user could use a
home pod I know guess I know it's not
supposed to be for everyone but it
wasn't that hard to let them do that so
amongst all the other things again it's
a really limited product it's right now
for me it's definitely not worth 349 I
mean I put down my money for it because
that's how I look at it I review it
based on okay I've dropped this much
cash on it is it really worth it it's
definitely not like you could literally
buy an echo and probably a starter light
kit like a smart light kit with like two
or three light bulbs a starter kit but
the same price as the home pod okay
think about that like you want to get
involved in the smart home it's a better
smart home and you get light bulbs like
come on so yeah light bulb really cheap
where does the smart light bulbs they're
not cheap you got to be so diehard Apple
for this product it's it's so narrow of
a focus and it's so locked down so just
check out the review there's a lot of
nuggets in there but I think people that
have been listening to us already know
where we stand and I don't want to keep
on making them feel like we're negative
about it we're just telling you there's
even more things that make it even more
limited than what we thought so yeah it
just sounded right it sounds awesome
good good I mean if that was their goal
if that really that was their only goal
then they definitely did it all right
bro should we take a little breather to
show some love to our sponsor that keeps

You Jam jammin Jeff man so we talked
about a bunch of home pod stuff I mean
that's really the hot thing that's going
on this week even last week but we
wanted to transition over to some more
news obviously we're getting close to
March we're probably gonna see some
interesting stuff just because March
historically has been a time period
where Apple has announced new products
we'll see I mean maybe we'll see some
new iPads maybe we'll see an iPhone se -
there's it's not really clear maybe
we'll see the air power can we get a air
power by margin scooter air power please
maybe maybe alright but the latest
report this is kind of a follow-up to
what Bloomberg had talked about earlier
is how Apple is now changing their
development their fundamental
development strategy to root out bugs
and revamp the iPhone software now we
talked about either it was either last
week or a couple weeks ago how they're
gonna push back certain features folk
some core ones and move those secondary
features over the next year because
really they want to focus on fixing the
bugs like their annual soft grade this
software upgrade this year will feature
a new single set of apps that works
across iPhones iPads and IMAX so write a
universal apps as one of their targets
that's gonna be met this is according to
Bloomberg report there also is going to
be a digital help tool to show parents
how much time their children have been
staring at their screen and I know you
want this the most beach improvements to
an emojis oh yes that's what I've been
waiting for I've been waiting for that
whole my let's hold my light so they
also said some of the features that will
be kind of pushed on the back burner is
Apple's whole redesigned home screen
that they were talking about for their
iPhone iPad and carplay carplay I mean
people have called it so much about how
they're just like they've turned their
backs on carplay there it's like I don't
even care anymore that's just like
that's like a slap in the face to Apple
users like they have shown it no love
and also a revamped Photos app that can
yet suggest which images to view
depending on what you're looking at and
this has kind of been put down by Craig
federighi look I think in the past the
whole promise and what differentiated
Apple from other companies and when I
say back then I'm saying as far back as
maybe four years four or five years ago
but when you go further back what was
the reason or the allure of Apple it was
easy to use it was run free and it was
secure like those tended to be those
tenants like and specifically like bug
free virus free blah blah blah that was
one of the big things well you only get
like iOS 11 and just all the software
things that they've been dealing with
you can argue that over time
Android is Android but specifically
Google's stock Android is cleaner it's a
little more simplified yeah it has its
own issues but it didn't launch with
like basically five or six major bugs
consecutive week after week after week
in a weird way even Apple users that are
have been around for a while
have felt like because they're being
spread so thin this evolution of apples
turn like um apples more like Windows
now than it ever used to be and I'm not
saying they're Windows but they are
moving along that path where they are so
big and they're trying to get everything
out every year and it's not just four or
five product categories now it's ten or
twelve yeah and it's gonna take its toll
yeah I remember when I first started
working here we were talking about that
a lot like fragmentation of Android you
know and now it feels like that's
happening the Apple and everything
that's coming out is buggy and it has an
issue but yeah back in the day when
Apple came out it was like this is how
easy it is to use you have this mouse
and you click here and everything just
works there's no problem the whole thing
what you just said bro
it just works that's like a classic
phrase and now everyone kind of throws
it in their face because it's it doesn't
just work anymore you know it takes a
lot of setting up and like
troubleshooting now it's you know
especially like older I don't want to be
like ageist or anything but people who
are you're going to be right now people
who haven't grown up with it you know
they have a lot harder time setting it
up now so it's not like your grandma's
phone anymore you know what I mean
people are having trouble setting up the
home pod still honestly like it's
supposed to sync kind of like your air
pods right you hold it right next your
phone
the w1 chip is the communication kind of
bridge it pops up and supposed to be
easy to set up it's actually not easy to
set up like a lot of people having
problems even getting their home pod set
up so you know even something like that
it's it's a new it's a new age so you
know we'll see
I think this slow burn strategy if this
is really what they're committed to can
help them in the long run but look
they're still selling
tens of millions of phones per quarter
like they're still dominating so no
matter what we say and then in a funny
way we can talk about them we can make
fun of them we can like celebrate them
whatever we say right now still doesn't
matter it literally doesn't matter cuz
who's buying who's still buying their
phones their brand cachet is just so
powerful now it's like you're locked in
a new story that just dropped just a
belief today Apple is going to require
all new apps to natively support the
iPhone 10 display as of April of this
year so this was a note that was dropped
to developers by Apple that starting
from April 2018 if you have an app that
comes out it must support the rich own
tens Retina display that means right it
has to go all the way to the edges none
of these like weird proportions or
legacy stuff from earlier phones it has
to support that form factor as well as
others apples also not set a deadline
when the updates for current existing
apps must support iPhone 10 natively but
at least from April this year all new
apps being built against the iOS 11 SDK
will have to support that screen know
that um but here's the thing Beach if
there was one feature that you think
samsung was jealous of Apple like iOS
feature what you think would be
I have no idea the face unlock and I
don't know what if I told you an emojis
well would be jealous of that I don't
know if they're jealous per se but a
report from ET news claims that the new
Samsung Galaxy S 9 that is expected to
be announced on and revealed on February
the 25th we're gonna actually have our
own live coverage because guess what we
do stuff beyond just Apple in case you
didn't think that I mean come on you
already know that so it's a new 3d emoji
system that they are claiming is more
advanced than an emojis they don't have
a name out for it yet but is expected to
come on February 5th and Samsung will be
loaded with their own facial recognition
emoji platform
alright good for Samsung congratulate
you game ma'am congratulations Samsung
you did it dude what do you want - I
have a name for them but what you--what
would you want to call them beach for
the first Samsung's how what would you
want to call them man I don't even know
I have to think about that for a while
I have no idea what would you call I
think they're gonna call them samajis
cheese something tells me there gonna be
some oh jeez yeah cuz he is an emoji
like copy written by Apple or something
it's an emoji was stolen by Apple from a
developer from Japan who owned it for at
least three or four years do you
remember this story
um well I mean there's so much
something-something about it yeah
his developer had literally an app that
was like cute cartoon characters it was
a kind of a keyboard app that you could
type out different characters that were
a kind of emoji space but he called them
an emojis an Apple tried to act as a
shell company to buy the trademark of an
emoji from him without telling them
telling him that they were Apple that's
right right they're like posed they were
like cozy and like us they had a secret
name for this company a shell company
and then they decided to try and go
after him for that without acknowledging
that it was actually Apple that was
trying to go after him and it's like
he's like dude what the hell that's it's
they're sitting on 280 billion dollars
just pay the man and take the name an
emoji don't try and like
hustling like that that's just so that's
such crap man yeah that's crazy dude I
forgot about that story not to 280 Billy
I mean it just came to my head right
this stuff's like this is like there's
like a treasure chest of crap in here
now right 280 billion throw them throw
them couple million you know throw em
some box man it's like it's like it's
like Tim Cook is like flicking the dust
off his wrist yeah it's like emptying
that chant has changed drawer or
something all right in some iPhone news
we talked about how iPhone continues to
just be gangbusters no matter what we
say the Apple platform is alive and well
according to Linda sweet of strategy
analytics Apple has taken more than half
of the global smartphone revenues for
the fourth quarter of 2017 over half
basically the fourth quarter of 2017 is
Apple's q1 of 2018 which is really that
period from October November to December
the firm says the iPhone captured a
record 51% share of all smartphone
wholesale revenues worldwide noting that
Apple had racked up 61 billion in the
fourth quarter
also Apple's average selling price for
phone right it's getting close to $800
that's three times the industry average
Samsung's average price selling price
per phone is 254 dollars so that's why
they're dominating in revenue is because
one of their closest competitors really
their closest competitor their phone is
basically a third of the prices what
they're getting from an average selling
price perspective in again Samsung sells
all different kinds of phones from a
wide range from high to low low but uh
that's that's that's beast man that is
beast my friend and I were just talking
about this last night like that's like a
few hundred phones a week or a few
hundred thousand phones a week or
something like that I didn't I kind of
did the math but not know how many
iPhones they sell like per week or
something oh yeah it's got to be like in
the hundreds of thousands
I don't know I'm probably I could be
totally wrong but not that it will
affected not that affected too much but
this next story may be that his numbers
might dip like just like just like a
teeny teeny bit
that's because Verizon is no longer
planning to sell unlocked iPhones and
this is actually a big deal for a lot of
people and why is that okay so Verizon
was one of the few carriers that sold an
unlocked version of the phone you would
have to first like lock-ins like a
one-month data plan with them but you
could then once that one month was done
you could then take this phone to other
carriers you could put it on AT&amp;amp;T you
can put it on t-mobile you could put on
it was basically a global unlocked phone
right that's cool
so Verizon though is preventing that
from happening now they said they want
to get ahead of theft that's been
happening where people are stealing
their phones this is not just I phones
too this is unlocked phones period
people are but it's targeted more
towards iPhones people are stealing
their phones getting them unlocked and
used on other carriers or trying to sell
them overseas right they work so they're
trying to prevent this the thing about
this is they also say Verizon is
expecting to if you have the phone for a
certain amount of time they will offer
the ability to unlock the phone they
have not been specific on how long that
will be whether it's like six months
nine months a year but they're not gonna
completely lock them down it's just that
out of the box if you get a phone and
you try and do something shady with it
or if you try and be a you know a good
customer about it the phone is still
locked to Verizon that's crazy well like
unlocked phones are worth a lot more and
if you if you actually get your phone
unlocked after you've used it for a
while you're trying to sell it or
something
everyone from another country is gonna
want to try to buy it it's true that was
my experience I unlocked my iPhone five
and I put in I advertised it unlocked
and I got so many calls and emails from
people from other countries saying can
you ship it to Brazil or ship it here
you know and I was like sure you know
it's like so unlocked phones are
definitely a huge value and it's a
bummer that Verizon is just gonna lock
them down now did you uh do you happen
to get any emails from a Nigerian prince
no want to make sure I think that
they've caught that
actually my dad was telling me he's like
did you hear that they caught the
Nigerian prince it's like actually a
dude yes
yeah the emails camera guy again he got
busted finally after all these years I
don't know how much he made from it but
man my dad was saying every time like a
new company would go public or just you
know put their information and like when
you start a new company you have to
build a website and do all this stuff
and you have to like report in the
newspaper that the company is live
he said the Nigerian prince would just
look for that stuff and as soon as a new
company would come into existence he
would contact them and so like my dad
does a lot of like consulting for
business and stuff and that people
always just joke and he they would start
a new company and he'd be like have you
heard from the Nigerian prince yet and
sometimes it'd be like yes I have did
you just registered your company it's
funny so the this last kind of story
before we get into the calls you Apple
had their shareholders mean this is how
much like attention get to pay to Apple
right I think it's is it yearly
quarterly where they hold no searly they
hold a meeting on Apple campus and if
you are shareholder whoever amount you
have in the company you're able to
actually go in attend this and like ask
questions it's kind of like right you're
you have a public investment in the
company so he sometimes you hope that
there's nuggets that come out of this
there weren't too many our own CNET's
Shire tip Ken was there and some of the
notes that she had pulled right you may
give an overview what's going on with
the company they vote for the board
members and then they also ask you know
the asked him cook some questions so
some of the things that Tim Cook touched
upon and I'm not gonna go into the
questions but just some of the responses
so you guys can all hear this he says
that the iPhone 10 customer satisfaction
is at ninety nine percent I saw that I
don't know about I honestly I know
that's not true
it's nine percent it's not but depending
the thing is the customer satisfaction
surveys start from satisfied somewhat
satisfied totally satisfied satisfied
beyond belief satisfied beyond like
human recognition I mean it's it's that
whole scale so that was one of the
points that came out of it Apple also
had asked why
19 companies in 2017 this a lot 10 of
those are unknown or 10 of those are
known nine of them are unknown Apple
also holds almost a quarter of a billion
subscriptions now across all services so
this could be like anything from iTunes
Match to iCloud to Apple music almost a
quarter of a billion there
people asked like hey Tim because
there's criticism about you blah blah
blah do you guys have a successor in
place and he says that they actually
have internal candidates that are ready
to succeed Tim Cook some people might
want to see that sooner rather than
later
oh wow but they do have a succession
plan but they're not gonna tell us who
it is they just want that's an awkward
question to get at the shareholders
meeting is there someone who's available
to replace you Tim yeah we've been
working on that they also talked about
their retail stores saying their
physical stores are never gonna go away
they believe that the interactions with
people still be to anything and then
this is a fun was like one of the
shareholders right straight up like ask
Tim Cook if he could get a tour of Apple
campus like Apple Park behind the scenes
and Tim Cook basically said that they're
not going to open their main big
ring-shaped building for tours because
we have so much confidential stuff
around oh wow
she said keeping stuff confidential is
the bane of my existence now and it's
worked wonderfully well under your run
[Laughter]
back you should have never said we're
gonna double down on secrecy so bad the
place is a fortress now so you can't
even get in matter if you get it out
every everyone leaves them from Asia
they can't control that they've never
been able to control that yeah I'd be
I'd be curious to see where like when an
Apple employees goes through just to get
into the building and like you know are
they screened or what happens cavity
search I'm pretty sure daily I'm ready
for my daily cavity search oh yeah all
right let's do get to the calls let's do
it yes the phone calls let's show some
love the Apple by nation man
again if you guys gals want to be a part
of the show the number is
full review the Apple byte full review
I'll be out okay here we go here's cone
number one hey guys this is Bob calling
from Stanford Connecticut I just
finished watching this week's show
picked up my home pod yesterday and been
playing around with it having a little
bit of fun but do have one complaints
the right word question maybe is a
called Apple support just now because I
was hoping to use it in my bedroom and
have it play music while I'm falling
asleep at night be able to set a sleep
timer to shut it off it doesn't have a
sleep timer apparently and the tech on
the support line said that you can go
into the whole map and set up a routine
or whatever they call it to have it shut
off but it doesn't appear in the section
of the app that does that so since it's
an always-on product I kind of get it
that that doesn't that it doesn't work
that way so interestingly the main thing
that I was hoping to use it for isn't
going to work for me
but otherwise it sounds great it looks
cool and pretty happy with it otherwise
but if you know anything at all about
the the possibility of how to do a sleep
timer function or whether that might
possibly end up being a future software
update which would be great because that
would be a feature I think a lot of
people would use anyway take care guys
yeah man we didn't touch mine but I do
think it does look really good in person
especially in a home it just kind of it
looks modern but it doesn't look it look
I mean it does look like a toilet paper
roll but but a fancy one it's something
familiar and soft to touch but to his
point he did call back later and let us
know just for people that are wondering
is you can actually you can't do a sleep
timer directly through the home pod but
if you're playing music over airplay to
the home pod which you can do you can
actually set a sleep timer on your phone
and I don't know if any of you have
actually done this but if you actually
go into your your clock right the clock
app and you go all the way over here to
your little timer there where it's
orange you can actually here's the trick
down here on the bottom it says when
timer ends
and so what this when timer ends there's
an option where you can actually change
it to stop playing select that and then
just set the time and it'll stop playing
like that again
it shows how limited some basic stuff
like that is not on the home pod
I'm sure that's got to be one of those
things that they will put into the next
software update you if they don't it's a
crime like if they don't allow multiple
timers in this next update even though
they've never done it in the history of
Siri it's stupid so hopefully they bring
that but you can't do it using airplay
and then using the timer function on
your phone or iOS device not even phoned
like your iPad or your iPhone cool you
know one thing people haven't mentioned
is how heavy the home pot is was that
like when you're gonna pick it up your
first reaction it was it was it was
hefty but I'm not gonna pick it up all
the time I just once I put it down I put
it down it's funny that when every time
someone would hold it they were like
first thing oh my god oh my god yeah and
then it's like anyway okay next call
here we go yo Brian I just switched over
to the iPhone 10 from Android I love it
just really not like in theory the
Google assistant is so much better do
you think Apple will ever invest some of
its billions of dollars into creating a
better Siri
let's hope thanks for taking my call
bye bye yeah yeah I said look they the
thing is that they've known they've been
behind for years that's what that's what
it's probably the most frustrating thing
for me is that they haven't done
anything about it and they let everyone
take their lunch like Siri came out
first right yes they let everyone take
them lunch and now they are so it's not
even like a little behind guys it's a
lot it's a significant gap it's like if
you're I mean when I use Amazon echo and
Google home together see Amazon is all
hooked up with all the services and how
will the apps but the Google home
platform is smart
it has you know Amazon has the platform
out but you know who knows how it plays
out over time but the Google home has
the potential to be the platform just
purely because it's smarter but everyone
is locked in and lots of like I'm a
locked in and Alexa but I also have a
home because it's freaking smart so they
they need to get better but I just don't
see it's not their expertise it's not
their specialty how they can make such a
dramatic leap to even be
remotely close to either Amazon er or a
little home right now I just don't see
it but hey I'll let them prove me wrong
yeah Google assistants definitely might
go too right now when I have random
questions because it understands context
it understands a lot of things that's
right it's really interesting how much
it understands what you're trying to ask
you know I mean even stuff like I mean
yeah fine it will maybe actually I don't
I shouldn't even assume this it might
end up getting it but you can order
pizza you can order a car ride service
from these devices like Apple you can't
even put a calendar appointment on it
from a home pod right now you can't even
do a calendar appointment you could do
to the to-do list I think that's bad you
know reminder you can't add some of your
calendar okay that's pretty low hanging
fruit yeah all right let's keep moving
along we got a couple more calls here we
go hey guys it's David from Jersey on
the last show someone mentioned they
lost all their iCloud photos and the
iCloud backup and what I do for my
photos is I make sure that I back it up
to a different service other than the
Apple iCloud first because if you backup
all your photos to iCloud and you have
the photo optimization setting turned on
you're only going to get backups of the
lower resolution versions of your photos
so what I do is I back them all up to
Dropbox and also to Amazon Prime photo
prior to plugging my phone in and
connected to Wi-Fi for where it will
naturally do a backup automatically with
the iCloud photos just oh that's a good
little tip there so people get the full
resolution backups next what both the
couple by I dig that man yeah that's
smart that's the community looking out
for each other I love that thanks so
much for that call we appreciate stuff
like that it's funny though that he's
backing it up to other places before he
backs up to iCloud though well you got
it but you know it's to the point is
yeah you've got to you have to you know
even uh before we could do cloud storage
we would have I
have two hard drives that were redundant
on top of my actual hard drive so I have
all my files and stuff yeah I do the
same oh cool all right and now Amazon
Prime photos is pretty awesome too like
I have gigs on there it's pretty awesome
yeah but I got unlimited at least for X
amount of years on Google baby oh yeah
but does that resizes though is it
resizing Noah Flores back full res full
res man nice full resolution cool all
right
I think we have one more yeah one more
here we go bitch and talk Mike from New
York City was just listening to the
extra munch again crunchy and I have a
comment you guys were talking about
Apple not having a streaming service yet
still and actually I think they're
pursuing the right direction with the
Apple TV app the idea of having a la
carte services whether it's Hulu or
Netflix or HBO or whatever I want to
choose having that and a single sign-on
is really the direction I think that
this really needs to go rather than have
some service that they're just another
you know outlet out there that you can
choose from if they come up with a
single service option and all it cost
you know price plans where you can just
pretty much have single sign-on and get
whatever services you choose I think
that's the direction that I would want
to spend my money on as as opposed to
any service where they're kind of pre
dictating what you actually get before
for the money all these other guys are
cables clones so to speak so I think
Apple has the right idea they just have
to be able to close the deal with all
the programmers so let me know what you
think great show keep it up love you
guys peace out love you back bro you
know what I think you make a great point
and I think in a perfect world yeah they
could do it but the person's the people
that are really controlling this is the
cut the cable networks and the content
holders because right when you have a
cable package and he probably already
knows this obviously is that you have a
lot of networks that are like lost
leaders and so you get something like
even though they're not doing so hot
anymore ESPN right is one of those
networks that that's why people get
cable or that's why people use to get
cable and you have all these other
networks that ABC says okay well if
you're gonna get ESPN you're gonna also
take on these five or six other networks
alongside of it and until Apple is
willing to pay them enough for a single
network that also covers the cost for
people not picking up their other
networks that are normally bundled in a
cable plan that they've already kind of
have in place Apple's got a dish out
major boo cose in order for that to
happen and up to this point they've
shown that they can't do that right they
have shown that they can't even come up
with a regular deal I don't even mind if
that is the goal or that's the vision
for Apple to get to the point that
you're talking about I think it was was
it Mike in New York I hope I'm right
because I heard a bunch of names but if
I think that even if that was the goal
that they were trying to get to they
should have still done the cable
streaming service because people are
doing it and it's another revenue stream
that they just don't have anymore
because they decided to not cut a deal
with the cable networks and yeah they
have this grand vision but we've seen
how the TV networks and canta providers
aren't gonna play the same way with
Apple that maybe the music labels did
because of how much the music labels
needed Apple the time at the time you
can go to Roku you can go to Hulu you go
to chromecast you can go to Amazon fire
stick
they don't need Apple so yeah it's all
sheer oh man that's all right guys thank
you so much for calling in making the
show pop as usual that's gonna do it it
is Apple byte extra crunch remember call

will be no other white ringing issues
hopefully not but let's just hope let's
