today we are going to take a look at
Blair this is a neat looking device that
promises to stream a whole bunch of free
web video content from your laptop
tablet or smartphone for just ninety
nine dollars now the player has a pretty
cool look to it but a lot of the allure
wears off once you get it in your hands
there's no getting around that the
product just feels cheap in your hand
and the plastic casing actually split
apart when I pulled it out of the box
pop off the top cover and you'll see
players HDMI plug that's designed to
slide right into a spare port on your TV
so what's this cable for well HDMI
doesn't provide enough juice to power
player so there's a micro USB port on
the side that you can connect to a power
outlet using the included adapter or
your TV's USB port if it has one the
dangling cable does spoil a lot of
players just a stick design and the
other problem is that I had an awfully
tough time getting the cable that
actually fit in the port the plastic
casing and the port just don't line up
that well so getting the USB plug to fit
can be a real struggle getting player
setup to work with your wireless network
and devices is straightforward with
simple on-screen instructions once it's
set up you can start streaming player
has apps for iOS and Android devices
which offer pre-selected content but a
lot of it ends up being Clips rather
than full episodes the real appeal of
player is the chrome plugin that
supposedly lets you stream any web video
from your browser to player even better
after you select a video to play player
works independently of your computer so
you can turn off your laptop or use it
for something else now that's the pitch
but in practice I found it to be pretty
unreliable full episodes of Saturday
Night Live worked but late night with
jimmy fallon and conan didn't the
colbert would stream but only with an
annoying overlay over the video content
The Daily Show didn't have that overlay
but it did have closed captions and
there was no way to turn them off even
more frustrating is that there were a
lot of glitches during playback and I
never quite made it through an entire
show without at least one minor glitch
and most time the glitches were more
significant
there's also the issue of image quality
some stuff could look good like 1080p
streams from YouTube but most of the
times the video quality was pretty poor
with a lot of artifacts and framerate
issues there's also a lot of content
that player doesn't even attempt to
stream big-name services like Netflix
and HBO GO or off the table and it won't
play your personal music collection or
stream for music services like Pandora
so with all the glitches and limitations
player just isn't really recommendable
right now it's just too unreliable and
there's not enough good content that
works there are also a lot of great
competing boxes for a hundred dollars
like the Roku 3 and Apple TV both of
which offer a lot more functionality
including a fair amount of web video
content and if you're really looking to
stream web video to your TV your best
bet is still connecting a five dollar
hdmi cable from your laptop to your TV
it may not be the sleekest or most
convenient solution but it's cheap and a
lot more reliable i'm matthew miskovic
