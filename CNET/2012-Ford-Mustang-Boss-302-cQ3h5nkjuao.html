produced in 69 and 70 a vintage
ass-kicker meant to answer Chevy's then
bigger motors the world's moved on from
caring much about Chevy versus Ford
these days but the boss is back and
relevant let's drive a 2012 Boss 302
Mustang the new one
check the 10
the original boss was largely an engine
story with freer breathing heads bolted
on to a tougher block the new boss is
similar a better breathing engine that
doesn't dramatically increase the power
over a stock v8 as much as it changes
the character of and that perhaps makes
this the most interesting of the hot
factory Mustangs today into our spotters
guide for a boss 302 if the C stripe and
the big letters boss 302 don't give it
away there are other things you can look
for first of all up here we've got these
knocked out
former fog light positions it's an old
boss 302 thing from back in the 60s
you've got an hour body kit generally
around this car which really explains
the different front chin and air
splitter on it you got a big hood bulge
on this car which is hard to miss of
course a different set of wheels now if
you're not a big fan of these particular
wheels you've got other choices within
the 19 size which these are there's also
a set of 20s from Ford but I was
noticing here the clearance between this
guy and that Brembo calipers about that
much so might be a little dicey getting
aftermarket that have got the right
clearance and offset you've always got a
black or a white roof on a boss and a
couple of other differences are back
here under the butt check it out here's
one of two hurly-burly muffler and
exhaust tips here they sound great
but this is actually a quad exhaust car
you might also spot a boss by its
attitude they lower it 11 millimeters in
the front and a pointless one millimeter
in the rear so it ends up with kind of a
stacked posture now I gotta tell ya
Ford's made a ballsy move on this car
they've gone not just low tech but damn
near no tech look at this a 2012 Ford
without Sync
there's nothing look at this aux jack
that's it no USB voice button there
isn't one there's something cool about
that in this kind of vehicle I also like
the very understated cabin they've gone
with this kind of faux engine-turned
stuff sort of black anodized nice clean
burnished aluminum style surrounds on
the gauges the seats on this car you see
we have the Recaro seats you get special
seats no matter what you get on a boss
302 sport seats these guys are a mix of
Alcantara Mouse fur and cloth and you'll
find the same Mouse fur on the steering
wheel one gear shift only before we get
to the engine bay everything coming out
of there is going to go through a
six-speed with an incredibly tight and
short throw these gears laterally are so
close to each other it's like a
fingertip shift and of course the name
boss 302 comes from the fact that it is
a 302
that's 302 cubic inches which is to say
it's a 5 liter this is the classic Ford
displacement but it's got nothing to do
with the old 302s from when the lineage
comes here's the motor a very high
intake stack as you can see which
creates the need for a hood bulge and
we're on a Shelby we'd see the
supercharger tucked in there there's no
such thing this is a naturally aspirated
fuel-injected v8 getting you 444
horsepower 380 foot-pounds of torque
gets this 3600 pound Mustang to 60 in
about 4 seconds while delivering 1726 or
probably about 19 real-world now the way
they got more power out of this guy was
a variety of things including a
different intake they've ported the head
so the intake has very low turbulence
nice flow all forged
tating parts in the lower end of this
engine and they've also gone through and
tuned and tweaked a lot of other small
things more aggressive cam as well all
that gives you 38 more horsepower than a
GT with a v8 which is no slouch of a
motor but note this guy has a little
lower torque number that's how they bias
the performance curve and by the way the
numbers I'm giving you are on supreme on
91 octane gas you'll knock those down a
few horses and a few foot-pounds on the
cheap stuff of course in a car like this
you got a Monte Carlo bar here tying
your two shock towers together and then
underneath this rubber cap
here's a what is that five position
screw driver adjustable detent setting
for the response rate of your shocks
front there's also a pair of them in the
back okay so check this out here's our
main exhaust system here is a couple
resonators behind the ex crossover which
is right about there I think yeah but
then look at these guys these are side
pipes that come off right about at the
crossover and they bleed off a little
bit of exhaust and a lot of exhaust tone
Ford says it's mostly to bleed off some
sound to get an interesting mix where
most of the exhaust goes out to the rear
exiting system this is kind of like
track day stuff by the way Ford must
know us because they didn't send our
boss with the so called track key a
special red key that unlocks the most
aggressive calibrations for throttle
launch control fuel delivery in all
kinds of timings
now modern Mustangs have a lot of their
bad habits tamed out of them these days
I take this corner here and low gear
bring it around and nice yeah the power
is always right there cuz it's not so
peaky as when you've got a blower on the
engine that's something I like I'm gonna
take off the traction control here and
see how she gets out of shape
pretty good
very possible car look up to the fire
hydrant and you can bring it back from
the edge pretty readily I'm getting even
a little bit of mud
lawn here it's not filling us too far
out of whack more around here see if I
can't kiss that fire hydrant
no so far so good
okay and through it all you get that
nice exhaust note predictable linear
power what is good handling for this
kind of car
solid axle pony car that's got a lot of
good technology applied over the years
mostly what I love is this is a Mustang
to really drive all of you know when
you're in a Shelby you're not using much
the MT of that unless you're on a
tracker or really a drag stream this is
too much there but this car you can
exercise a fair amount of what it's got
going
keep things on a boil a little fun but
not scare yourself too badly
get us price the boss this guy's 41 one
delivered not a lot of stuff to play
with on the tech options to be honest or
really any options aside from a few
minor things I'll call your attention to
the following first of all you've got a
$1,975 option for 20-inch wheels the
other like um er you don't I would want
to preserve the ride quality of this car
actually and stick with 19 just just my
hunch the other thing to look at is the
Recaro package which is kind of an odd
one it's got a Torsen torque sensing
limited-slip rear end and the Recaro
seats kind of a weird combination of
features but that's 2,000 bucks as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
