com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up we focus on the
essential tool of the road warrior the
katana the samurai sword of technology I
speak of course of the cell phone first
Nicoli has the verizon wireless p + 300
less is more and on the front here you
can see nice bright large fonts on the
display sort of a lacklustre a color
here but that's fine because it is a
pretty basic phone as you can see
through the menu it's also pretty basic
very large fonts very easy to understand
so this would be a good phone for a
preteen or a teenager just because it's
so easy to use you know what this phone
does well it makes calls but getting a
little fancier kent german has the
motorola sliver l7c it's the first
sliver for cdma service that works with
sprint unfortunately the new version
buries the SD card first of all you have
to turn off the phone if you want to get
out your card or put one in just take
the back cover off take it off like that
get into the battery take that out and
there's the slot it's actually hard to
manipulate as well this comes off the
card the card will pop out but actually
this silver flap right here can pop all
the way off as well we had a little
trouble getting it back in so not a fan
of that at all you do however get all
the fun sprint nextel evdo stuff on this
phone so who needs storage next up
nicole's back with a music playing phone
the sanyo m1 on the front here is the
external screen its color so that's
really good for us you can use the
screen for in a photo color ID you can
see I'm currently playing tracks when
the music player is playing on the
bottom here is the music player controls
you can see the play pause fast forward
typical music player controls it lacks a
microSD card slot but it does have one
gigabyte of internal storage so that
kind of makes up for it finally Kent
takes a look at the new Samsung you 520
which features all tells new cell top
service press that button right there to
access it and actually consists of two
cells on each side of the screen you can
program to hold a lot of things
Sarah inbox and weather so what happens
is you have your message inbox just sits
right on top of the display you have a
weather for your city or a city or
traveling to and just puts the
information out there you can have news
you can have sports scores you can move
out rodeo scores it's kind of an odd one
but I'm sure some people will look at it
seriously a good friend of mine took
third place in calf roping last weekend
she'd love this phone that's it for this
edition of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt
check back next time for more gadgets to
keep you armed and dangerously
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
