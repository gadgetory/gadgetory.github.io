cnet.com and I'm here with another tiny
bluetooth speaker this one is called the
Devon blue tune solo it does come in a
few different colors I have the blue
model here does have a nice finish to it
as you can see this is a very small
speaker it's about half the size of a
can of redbull maybe slightly larger
than that but it does have a little bit
of weight to it raising right around 8
ounces so there's a little bit of
substance here and it does sound a
pretty good for its size a lot of these
bluetooth speakers don't sound great
they do have their limitations this one
like a lot of other ones distorts at
higher Bob particularly if you put a lot
of bass through it and it also has a
couple of nice extra features that help
it stand out a little bit it does have
both an audio input as well as an audio
output what that audio output allows you
to do is string a couple of these
speakers together if you wanted to but
it also allows the speaker to act as a
receiver on your home stereo unit so you
could connect this to your home stereo
and stream music wirelessly to it from
your phone or tablet
or any other Bluetooth enabled device
the other feature worth mentioning is
that this does have speakerphone
capabilities as an integrated mic so you
can't use this as a speakerphone you do
have to stand fairly close to the
speaker for it to work well however I
did like the speaker and despite its
sound limitations it does offer
relatively decent sound compared to
other tiny Bluetooth speakers it costs
around forty to fifty dollars there are
better speakers out there for hundred
but if you are looking for a very
compact bluetooth speaker this one is
certainly worth considering I'm David
Carr noise and that's the do boom blue
tuned solo wireless Bluetooth speaker
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
