to take a look at a $500 toaster
hi I'm a Jacob Mart for Cena today I'm
taking a look at the KitchenAid Pro Line
4 slice toaster
so again 500 dollars and this is a
toaster
that's absurd all it does is make toast
for that same amount of money you could
buy a new laptop you could make a down
payment on a used car you get an entire
oven range or craft a makeshift shelter
out of 6 tongue Hamilton Beach toasters
but nope one $500 toaster and that's
what it does it toasts and here's the
fun part this $500 buddy myth doesn't
toast any better than the $30.00
Hamilton Beach classic Prohm toaster
it's no faster it cooks no more evenly
in fact it consistently under-cooks your
toast if you've you burned toast as a
terrifying natural disaster this thing
might work for you but otherwise be
prepared to run it through a cycle or
two to get well done toast or even
medium done toast and forget about thick
slices or thick breads with those on
medium it didn't even deign to brown it
at all you're paying 500 bucks and
you're getting an underpowered machine
sure it looks like an airplane but it
toasts like a wuss though it does have
some nice features to go along with its
designer style once you put in the bread
it'll pleasantly ding and automatically
lower it for you saving you from that Oh
so laborious task of pressing down a
lever however I actually found that more
annoying than helpful in practice sure
it's cool to show off but I like to get
my bread centered and have my presets
pressed before I start the toasting
cycle well this guy I always had to
cancel it and get everything set again
and then push it back down its td's that
said because it senses the weight of the
bread if you don't come get your bread
right away after it finishes toasting
it'll sense that it's still in there and
after 45 seconds
lower it back down and keep it warming
for you honestly that's pretty great and
I kind of wish all toasters had the same
feature but that's about the only
clear-cut advantage you get from this
guy if you love toast as much as I do
maybe splurging a little bit makes sense
if so I recommend spending a hundred
dollars and getting either the
Frigidaire Professional or the Cuisinart
lever less I don't recommend spending
$500 not on this guy for more please be
sure to check out my full review and all
of our other toaster and appliance
reviews on cnet.com it's now safe to
move about the cabin for CNET
