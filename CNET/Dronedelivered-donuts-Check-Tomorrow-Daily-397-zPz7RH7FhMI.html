welcome to tomorrow daily the best peek
talk-show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva Jeff Kannada will be out
until Thursday's deep-dive show but for
now let's hit some headlines this is a
really interesting solution that adds an
almost realistic sense of touch to
objects in virtual reality youtuber
Scott Devine uploaded a video to his
channel a few days ago showing off an
interesting feedback solution for VR
apps a robotic arm this is a Baxter
robotic arm which we've talked about
before on the show in this demo the user
pushes wooden boxes off a little ledge
using his HTC vive controller what makes
it different is the Baxter arm is
holding out a wood panel and repositions
itself according to where the controller
is so that when the user pushes the box
they actually feel a slight resistance
that's the same texture they'd expect if
they were pushing an actual box in the
real world this is a super expensive way
to make a haptic feedback solution
though because this arm cost around
twenty five thousand dollars but it's
still really cool to see the way fans
have adjusted and experimented with the
VR experience awesome stuff sack fans
rejoice the future is now the very first
commercial drone delivery took place
here in the US a couple of weeks ago
tech startup flirty partnered with
convenience store chains 7-eleven to
deliver Donuts coffee candies and even a
chicken sandwich to a private home in
Reno Nevada putting aside the fact that
nobody ever eats a chicken sandwich they
found at 7-eleven this is pretty cool
the drone flew two containers to the
house autonomously lowered them to the
ground and then returned to its base
other drones have been delivering things
like medical supplies and emergency
rations but this looks like the first
time we've seen someone actually place
an order for a product and then receive
it via drone I am still worried though
about the person who might have been
bold enough to eat that chicken sandwich
because honestly that feels slightly
more dangerous than drone deliveries
that is it for our headlines though if
you guys want to talk about I feel like
we need to talk about oh they're both
really good stories but I think I'm
gonna go with the drone deliveries
because there's so many things going on
with drone deliveries that have been
happening recently and I think Jeff and
I should talk about it so if you guys
want to get in on that conversation you
can hit us up at a hashtag hey TD tell
us what you think tell us what you'd
want delivered via drone if it was a
snack what's your favorite snack food
that you would have delivered all the
time or what's the dangerous snack food
that you probably shouldn't eat I'm
gonna go with egg salad sandwich from a
truck stop just like in Futurama it's a
terrible idea uh but that is it and if
you want to use our hashtag we'll put it
in Thursday's show if you send us
something fun and interesting and it
amuses us because it makes us feel like
kings when we pick out your tweets that
is it for our headlines let's check out
our phone talker for the day this
amazing picture was snapped by Greg who
took this on his iPhone six-plus greg
writes hi Jeff and Ashley here are
Stella my 11 and a half year old
Staffordshire Bull Terrier and Sidney my
boa constrictor Stella loves going
everywhere with me and sometimes I take
Sidney out too you have my permission to
use my photos on the show it would be
great to see a British entry wink note
the car has the steering wheel on the
correct side ha ha ha
that's from Greg Greg you have some
pretty interesting pets first of all the
fact that your dog tolerates boa
constrictor hanging out is pretty cool
and also the fact that your boa
constrictor hangs out in your car white
drive round also pretty cool that is our
pet photography that's the theme of this
month's photography you got a couple
days left maybe we'll extend it maybe we
won't I don't know who knows what's
gonna happen we're gonna tell you
whatever the next theme is maybe we'll
keep going because you guys have sent
some really great pet pictures in but if
you want to get out on the action and
email a picture of your pets anyway to
tomorrow at cnet.com and you have to do
four things give us permission we got
two we had to get your permission to use
your picture on the show tell us your
name and how to pronounce it if there is
a remote chance of us and is pronouncing
it make sure you tell us a story about
your pet and preferably give us your
pet's name that's always helpful and
also tell us what device you took it on
because I love to know what phones
you're using as your phone tog refer
that is it for today's show we will be
back tomorrow
or I guess I will be and producer Logan
but Jeff is out and about working for
other people we're so sad we miss you
Jeff come home he's not working for
other people he'll be back on Thursday
so tomorrow I will be back with brand
new docket a weird science fact meeting
science fiction so until next time guys
