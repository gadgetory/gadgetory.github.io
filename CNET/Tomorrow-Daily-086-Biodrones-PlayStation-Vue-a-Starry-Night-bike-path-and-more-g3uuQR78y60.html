made of almost entirely biodegradable
materials Sony Playstation unveils their
new streaming service that's amazing I'm
excited and we take a look at a bike
path inspired by van Gogh's Starry Night
it glows tomorrow daily
greetings greetings citizens of the
internet and welcome to tomorrow daily
the best geek talk show in the known
universe kills working on his fight
moves I don't know what's going on i'm
your host Ashley scale that Jamie's
always kill anonymous yeah you got
whooped in mario kart last night this
morning producer Logan got too good at
mario kart and I lost one race for those
of you that have I lost more than one
race for those of you that haven't been
keeping up to date ashley is notorious
for her prowess I'm an Oreo card I'm a
very serious Mario Kart so it was a
great defeat a great fall for her today
so hopefully these stories will pick you
up make you feel better again yeah well
I he will be crushed producer Logan is
listening he will be crushed soon enough
ok I'm not know let's hit the headlines
I feel like delivering malice is much
better when you're smiling Yankee will
be around terrifying really ok so you're
really excited about this one so this is
really cool ok so there is a
biodegradable drone out there it's a bio
drone as that that's what they're
calling it so this drone is created by a
team in the NASA Ames Research Center
and the woman who led this team her name
is Lynn Rothschild this is the first
biological drone this is the material
it's made out of their growing it right
now this is the company ich ovate of
design and what they're doing in this
video is they're growing this kind of
custom a biodegradable material called
mycelium and it's a root like fungal
material ok kind of like mushrooms like
a fungus it's a fungal material so there
it is and they use eco vated design
actually uses this material for a couple
of other things like shipping wine like
packing wine and stuff they use it in
surfboard course because it's
biodegradable it's like really
interesting that they're kind of using
these things so they're I mean they're
really working on all kinds of what why
are they doing this well so one of the
things about using a drone is that it
lets say for example you wanted to
research an ecologically delicate place
so let's say you wanted to take it maybe
into like a part of the Amazon that is
very ecologically sensitive locate
jenna maybe your drone crashes well now
you have this pile of nuts and bolts
just leave it there that's just not
going to decompose it's just going to
sit there and it could become toxic to
it could imbalance the system and this
would in effect dissolve and become part
of part of the land you would see I
think she mentioned this woman Lynn
Rothschild mentioned that it would just
sort of look like melted sugar on the
ground like it would just look like a
little pile of goo now there are parts
of it like the propellers the rotors
controls and the battery not yet
biodegradable but they're hoping at some
point to be able to replace them by
biology and if we have a picture of it
at the actual drone like I don't know if
we if we actually pulled one but okay
cool yeah alrighty so in they said data
they said that you know obviously if you
wanted to put a camera at one of the
other uses that they had mentioned was a
little more nefarious than ecological is
spying of course you would send it in
enemy territory you if it crashed you
wouldn't want people to know that you
had been spying so it just dissolves
yeah usually when you're spying you're
not supposed to say that that's what
you're going to use it for well yeah I
know but I mean they're you know the
NASA Ames Research Center I don't think
is planning on you know going spying on
other people's space exploration
paralyzed I think they're all pretty and
because it's with each other the Space
Agency's of the world so so they're
they're pretty on the up and up but uh
you got to tell me about playstation
view because i read a little tiny bit
about it but this is very interesting
okay so Sony and PlayStation dropped
depending on the way you think of it
about it a little firecracker or a giant
atom bomb of a news news today in
PlayStation view this seems like a very
big difference yes this is the think it
was the first cable provider that isn't
like it's not going through a cable
service there it's basically their own
cable service now basically that means
through your PlayStation you're gonna be
able to pay a small fee a monthly small
fee mana house Sony likes not small
maybe not small but a small a monthly
fee in which you'll be able to have
certain channels okay instead of having
a cable service okay so then we're
seeing
on the TV so we're seeing some details
that we're all familiar k so here
there's going to be 75 channels at
launch CBS FOX NBC Universal discoveries
scripts and Viacom so I all those TV
corporation at Comedy Central so Animal
Planet oxygen sci fi Food Network how
many central stuff like that so comedy
central's good I did not see Food
Network yeah did you know that's why i
did not see a cartoon network ER like
adult swim or anything like that which
is a big / i also did not see AMC am
silly but again that's just like me ouch
this is just at launch so you don't need
a cable service provider okay Justin
internet just internet they're promising
no commitments which means that you
won't have to do it like a yearly
promised thing oh no car no I bet
they'll be like oh month month but it's
cheaper if you do it by cars just like
you know just like PlayStation Plus you
know it's cheaper if you just buy it in
a year pack yeah but Playstations trying
to just have everything all in one place
we won't know again the reason I say
it's either a firecracker and atom bomb
is how many people adapt this right here
is I could go like it could interfere
with the cable service providers who are
ancient great so ready to sign up I'm
gonna download it tonight Ackley so I
think you've really I'm gonna get I
can't oh because it's rolling out to
only a few cities it's gonna start
rolling out to New York Chicago
Philadelphia and then Los Angeles and
stuff like that it's going to be coming
to the ipad to lean on sony device
that's interesting it's pretty good it's
set to launch launch in q1 of 2015 so
it's pretty pretty soon so if you're
asking for something for christmas and
you want to skip the cable service
providers you can get a playstation 4
it's gonna be a ps4 ps3 okay so we have
location 30 i want to tell you about the
DVR because another exciting thing that
everybody likes my cable is i don't have
to just support on slide right yeah very
so it kind of has a built-in cloud DVR
interesting okay so if you want if
you're an on-demand person the videos of
the the shows will be on demand for
about three days so you don't have the
DVR but if you are a DVR person you can
set it to DVR and I'll save in the cloud
for 28 days wow so like you just record
something it would go to the cloud and
then there's like I think it was is it
unlimited storage i think it is uh yeah
yeah so far right now
yeah unlimited it says no without
storage online limitations so great I
mean this all sounds pretty good legal
all-in-one you know service provider
yeah it's month to month you don't have
to buy a cable box it's gonna depend on
price yes and availability of channels
yeah price and availability channels and
they don't another big key thing as they
do not have major like specialty ones
like HBO yes pho to show timer probably
not ESP vs shorts I'm sure they're gonna
do just like cable service providers and
make bundle it together but this is and
this is one of my favorite things to
talk about this is a step forward into
you know not like having everything
streaming everybody everything is nice
okay so here's the this is brings us to
the hashtag the day the question of the
day we want you guys use the hashtag TD
view vu ii because that's how you spell
it to you and we want you to tell us
what would it take for you to dump cable
entirely or whatever it is that you're
currently using and use view nothing
nothing is stopping me from doing that
it the price again we don't know the
price I think I think how much is the
happy baby channel selection and price
though so much you pay for cable uh I
think we'd be like well cuz we have a
big we've like a triple play with
verizon so we have fios and then we have
the TV which I thought I don't know I
think it's like maybe 80 bucks a month
yeah 80 bucks a month plus HB o oka 9d
right okay like ten dollars a month for
age I think they'll be able to I think
they'll be able to cut that cost a
little bit cuz you're already thanks for
the PlayStation I mean the thing is is I
think the big argument is everybody goes
well I don't watch ninety percent of the
cable channels that I have to subscribe
you to get like the four that I want
like I know that if we didn't want BBC
America we could go one step down which
would drop us like 40-something channels
but because we want to watch Doctor Who
yeah we have to subscribe to the like
extreme package I the reason I say not
like it i would totally do it is because
i'm already watching hulu on my
playstation 4 or my place is three and
i'm already watching netflix and the
nettles in a race on playstation is so
good yeah that's yeah I mean well an
Emmy an xbox one has already been making
a play at this sort of media but you
have to plug in your cable box
don't worry missing you this is this is
not only a dangerous for the cable
companies but also things like like
Apple TV and Roku and stuff like that
because if you could just have a
PlayStation that does all that stuff
exactly that's what I'm saying is like
this is potentially a big thing but if
nobody adopts it it's a firecracker
Canada just another thing that
PlayStation was just like we tried it
but I appreciate the efforts I mean I
really appreciate the effort I'm not
even a fanboy but it was a nice day I
mean I just wash right there are many
studios so just try guys give it the old
college so let us know what you think of
that animal and also what it would take
for you to get to crossover TW T TD view
there you go do you ride bikes yeah
bicycles yeah I love bikes so this is
like a like this is so cool okay i'm
gonna use this as a thumbnail for
today's show because it is so awesome
looking oh cool this is a something that
is not necessarily changing the world
dramatically bummer um but I pics the
world a little bit more amazing I think
so this is we've mentioned studio Russa
guard before in the show but they're
back in the news for this amazing bike
path there it is gorgeous um this bike
path is in the Netherlands it's called
the van Gogh Russa guard bicycle path
it's not very creative but the bike path
itself is very very creative okay it is
based on the starry night painting the
one that we're also very familiar with
we've ever seen this painting online I'm
sure you have I hear your can see people
touching it and writing on it and all
this stuff it's a one kilometre long
section of a route that goes through the
province where van Gogh was born and
raised so it's very near where he was
brought up there are surface patterns on
there you can see there's like the
spirals and these beautiful just sort of
designs in this bike path it is very
bright it is extremely bright so they're
coated with special paint and it grabs
daylight almost like you know something
that's goal in the dark or solar powered
right um but this is kind of a cool
thing there are also extra LEDs along
the sides of parts of the curves of the
bike path so they help illuminate them
when maybe it's overcast and there's not
enough energy to actually power these
like it'll add a little exercise so it
looks absolutely
amazing i mean it's super stunning I
it's something that I would want it's
it's so beautiful and this is a really
great kind of example of how technology
can make the world just a prettier place
like and I just really love this like
what a fantastic and whimsical way of
giving people a beautiful well-lit bike
path like it was when you pick a science
/ art story I like those stories yeah
it's really it's really inspiring and
just real cool yeah well it just reminds
us that like very beautiful it just
reminds everybody that science doesn't
need to necessarily have an end game it
doesn't need to have this like you know
life-changing earth-shattering function
it can just be beautiful and make
people's lives happier or better yeah
I'm in an aesthetic way I'm gonna get
real hippie with it I I think that it's
it's nice because it makes us kind of
believe in magic it again I really like
I don't know how to do that yeah but
science doesn't it didn't then it just
exists that I just have to be like wow
they created this magical path just with
magic like yeah but with with beautiful
wizard magic I love popular love it yeah
it's really cool cool so that's those
are our headlines for today we will be
back we're going to take a quick 30
second break when we come back we're and
do a back of their hackett a really good
one I'm that we actually got to check
out in person and then of course your
user feedback and our photog refer the
day so don't click way it's tomorrow
daily check out this r2 d2 bird oh yeah
welcome back hello welcome back to the
show Kailyn I've decided we are cautious
optimists yeah we want to believe that
things are gonna be really great like
PlayStation via we're optimistic about
it but cautious yeah the same time well
because you know it could hurt us but I
could really help us I could be really
cool yeah so every week we like to take
a look at some cool crowdfunding project
this one in particular we really enjoyed
because we actually got to check it out
in person so this is back at our Hackett
and of course we are continuing our
streak of things that we actually just
really like so yeah yeah we don't think
this is really neat out though it's
called screens TV continue with a TV
theme this in this episode this is
really neat so we got to check this out
it's on IndieGoGo right now this is what
the box looks like it's like a really
cool looking kind of futuristic set-top
box it's not that big you can see in the
bottom right of the screen there and it
is it allows you it's got five hdmi
inputs and it will allow you to view all
of those inputs all at the same time and
interact with them on your TV screen
what and adjust the size of each of the
screens yes so uh it's it's actually a
really clever user interface and it's
really easy to use you can see this
they're using it so they'll have like
sports and then they'll have you know oh
here's this football game on directv and
then you have you know like xbox 1 i'm
playing madden and then there's I want
to see all my fantasy football stuff in
my browser and then I want to see all
the tweets about the you know what's a
football team that people like the
Patriots and the southern you have all
the tweets in there Tom Brady like I
wanna see my Tom Brady tweets I want to
play Halo and Call of Duty at the same
time because I can't make up my mind
well I want to play I want to play call
of duty and harass people on Twitter all
at the same time like you can do that so
it's actually really cool so they and
and then there's the interface where you
can actually adjust all the different
screens and stuff so she'll like set it
up it's Oh YouTube and skype and all
these other things so that's uh that's
what screens TV is and then we actually
got to go i get to go check it out with
producer Logan there's me using it
and it was super easy to adjust
everything super easy to move stuff
around with the iPad in her face um it
was really I was very surprised of how
easy it was to use I thought it was
going to be a little bit more
counterintuitive I was like because of
its five different inputs and oh this
could get really messy and but I was I
was I was very impressed with how it
worked can I ask you a question yes
what's what sound or which you had to
pick the sound you can have sound on all
of them via headphones and our Wi-Fi so
it's like if you have he was saying I
think something along the lines of like
if you had like a headset working on
your xbox you can like designate which
input goes to it so you can actually
like delegate which one sound goes where
what's the maximum amount of processes
you can have it at the time they have
five inputs so you can have five screens
it maxes out at five okay all right well
he's no he said even daisy chain them
you'd be able at side theoretically
would be able to daisy chain them you
ever seen back to the future too yes do
you remember how it already had this
screen with multiple televisions that's
exactly that it was a lot like that came
and he goes watching a watching a little
TV yeah it's like a bit yeah that's like
15 shows what are your kids coming
together it was really cool so if you
want to get in on this they just started
their IndieGoGo today okay which is
congrats on your lunch and it's 399 for
early backers so if you want to get one
it's 399 bucks for the base model of
screens which is the box and it's four
gigs of on store onboard storage oh no
um which four gigs you know it's fine
but they also have upgradeable storage
like I believe it's a hundred bucks more
for I think either 32 or 64 today but it
goes all the way up to i think 128 gigs
what am I story you go way up you can
actually like I think they were saying
you could load like themes and stuff I
I'm really being terrible at this but
there were other processes that I'm sure
you could load into screen sorry they
also have html5 available for canvas
programming so like let's say for
example there was like a theme that was
like you know the Cleveland Browns like
put together I'm making all these gears
of all references
put together a package for screens where
you could choose a theme that would give
you your the game and then it would have
liked your fantasy football information
Twitter like all the stuff that follows
like Cleveland Browns or whatever and
then it would all be overlaid on this
like you know kind of not interactive
but serve like a themed framing that is
you could see a theme that is pretty
cool Sam is really neat i like I thought
it was really interesting and honestly
like there are a lot of people who kind
of like doesn't everybody have a house
where it's like the living room is still
the TV everyone wants to use like it's
like even when I was a kid we had a TV
in our bedroom but I always wanted to
use the living room TV because it always
seemed better so this would allow people
to use well I'm like a I'm like a
terrible i'm a terrible gamer i put up
like my i usually put up my video game
and then like watch a movie on an ipad
never really asked you before focus to
anything yeah no yeah they were showing
that was just like okay so you have like
you know it let's say you have three
things going on once you have like
Twitter happening and then maybe you're
playing a game and then you have a movie
going on or you know live TV here what's
actually really cool it's pretty cool i
liked it i thought was really neat and
and they're they're looking to ship in
december of next year so it's it's about
a year out the 0 delivery in the box so
get it for next Christmas but they were
saying if you get in early backer you
get access to like betas and like early
access to a lot of things that are going
on and they're really obviously keep you
in the loop on all the development and
stuff cool this was pretty neat I
thought it was cool anyway on that
screens TV so I say I say yes I say it's
great I'd back it yeah I would too I
like the idea of having multiple stuff
on the screen I have a problem yeah it's
adventure I need this type of thing we
have no attention span you guys oh um
okay well now that we are done talking
about backdoor Hackett let's talk about
you it's time for your user feedback
short attention span is short it's all
over the joint yeah so yesterday we
asked you guys to just just tweet nice
things to the ESA and to feel a and
Rosetta and use the hashtag TD Rosetta
and you guys really did I picked three
of my favorites Shannon wrote congrats
TD Rosetta and all who were involved and
then J Wallin said congrats a good work
and also tagged the ESA so good job and
then Rick actually told a Rick actually
told a joke he said what did rosetta say
to comet 67p you spin my head right
round yeah so I thought that was funny
that was good I really hope they can
figure out feeling like it for did you
hear the update so it's sitting on two
legs one of the legs is up oh and
they're not really sure if they can fire
the harpoon because it might actually
like launch the thing off the comet to
like anchor it into the ground yeah and
it's also going to run out of batteries
in two days if it doesn't get enough Sun
and they're saying where it is right now
is up against sort of a rock face like a
formation that is blocking most of its
Sun I think they said something that
gets like 30 minutes of sun every like
two hour 90 minutes of sun every 12
hours which is not enough to power the
battery so they're going to try to do
some of the functions and hope that it
kind of pops it into a place where I can
get a little more sunlight but they're
saying they might actually lose if they
might die the batteries could die you
guys got to work on battery technology
the batteries could die in the next two
days if they if they can't all those
calculations to get there just to have
the battery when shutting off of plan
Mars the I know and then it landed weird
and well and the battery's gonna die man
like so frustrating so but we'll see we
really will keep you posted but um yeah
I just I saw that this morning and I'm
like man I can't believe I mean it's
amazing that they even got it there in
the first place like incredible but man
how does that I'm sure that feels like
just it's a lit sting the guy that made
the harpoons is fired yeah like not well
I think I did the harpoons James so
remember that time that the harpoons
didn't fire well you are now actually
fun oh ah call yourself a harpoon cuz
you're
well but not fired yeah you know how
you're not like a harpoon you're fired
all right so it is done for our last
piece of user feedback our phones Agra
for the day we're gonna have to try that
joke again on Monday yeah we just
recycle our jokes anyways we do it see
you know what we're all about
eco-friendly jokes we recycle here jokes
