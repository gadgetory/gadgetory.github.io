top setting records for height and speed
and sending riders through a dizzying
series of loops and turns many of the
scream inducing drops and
stomach-turning twists are made possible
with electromagnetic technology called
linear synchronous motor or LSM instead
of climbing up a steep incline and using
gravity to gain speed LSM allows
rollercoasters to accelerate from a
standstill to high speeds within seconds
we have conventional lifts we can only
go so high with some of our launch
coasters we're doing 450 plus feet in
the air
versus 300 foot on conventional lift
coasters
the Superman ultimate flight ride at Six
Flags Discovery Kingdom uses LSM to
create a non inverted loop a rare
feature in park rides in your
refrigerator at home you have a motor
and it's a circular motor and all we've
done is we've taken that and we've laid
it out flat so that instead of power
moving in a circular motion it moves in
a linear motion
the coasters are powered by
supercomputers and electromagnets the
easiest way to explain it is if you
remember when you're a kid you took
magnets and you push them together and
they repelled each other
it's basically the same concept LSM not
only propels the Train to speeds over 60
miles per hour it's also used in the
braking system to slow it down
the US Navy is developing the same
technology for its next generation of
aircraft carriers after 50 years of
using steam catapults the Navy is
testing various jets with the
electromagnetic aircraft Launch System
and it's preparing to christen the first
carrier to use the technology even
tried-and-true wooden roller coasters
are getting modern makeovers this year
great America's gold striker was
designed with computers but constricted
by here's a foot drop
you're gonna go 55 miles an hour you can
see one of these banks here is an
85-degree Bank these are features that
are not common and wooden roller
coasters this ride may look
old-fashioned but the roller coaster
speed its safety even those screams
wouldn't be possible without technology
the ride control system tracks
everything that happens on the ride
watching all of the inputs all the
sensors we're watching air pressure
locations of trains sensing speeds
position of brakes so everything is
being monitored and controlled and
redundant fashion
so all writers have to worry about is
having fun in Vallejo California
