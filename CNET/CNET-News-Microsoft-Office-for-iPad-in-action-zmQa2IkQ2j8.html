for iPad today more specifically Word
Excel and PowerPoint available
immediately for download in the iPad app
store all there in the iPad with a
design that is both familiar to them as
an office user but also very natural for
an iPad user what we're looking at right
here is a Lenovo Windows laptop this is
the office experience of people are
familiar with fell in love I'm just
going to open a document on this you get
that beautiful office document it's
opening it off onedrive this is the free
cloud storage for everyone I've got this
great document right here and I can
scroll through it's beautiful it's got
all sorts of comments and immersive
content charts in this case I'm actually
going to insert an image this is a
document wrap about music so I'm gonna
insert an image and I'm an insert right
off the web I can do that I can insert
just from clipart or in this case Bing
so let me just do a quick search for an
image about music see if I find
something good yeah there's a image
right there where music that's pretty
straightforward so there it is now I got
it that's that's an experience people
are used to that's the experience
they've come to come to know with office
but if I've got to leave the office I've
got to run out of my house and I want to
pick up where I left off I can do that
now with word for iPad so in this case I
open word for iPad I've got a list of
the most recent documents that I've used
right there in onedrive and there's that
first document that I just was changing
over here on my Windows PC there it is
and I can see there's that image I just
inserted I maybe I don't like the way it
looks maybe I want to modify how the
text wraps around it maybe I want to
move it maybe when I get allure maybe I
want to drag it around and put it in a
different place in the document to where
I like and there we go
just like that I've managed to extend my
office experience the iPad with a rich
and immersive word for iPad experience
any limitations on the tablet format and
on ipad we really focused on building
and experience in the ground up that's
designed for the iPad so we focused on
the scenarios we think are most
practical most important for users we
did a bunch of testing to make sure we
address the things that are the most
common things people want to do on this
device and that extends to Word Excel
and PowerPoint and the fact let me show
you excel in this case you know the
first thing you'll notice is this is
Excel it's
take ibly office it looks and feels like
the Excel people who have come to know
I've got rich content charts and graphs
I can do things like change my charts
maybe I think this thing should be a pie
chart instead of a bar chart you can see
I'm seeing live previews of the
different ways this data might look I
might want to change the color scheme
maybe I don't like that color like this
color scheme now I can I can change the
style if I want to background it
differently really easy really
touch-friendly just write a touch first
experience build for the iPad but still
the Excel that people are used to and
one of the things that in excels case
that we did in particulars we actually
even gone so far as to build a custom
keyboard for Excel users it's super
natural to use I was going to ask about
that because so often when you're using
office products Microsoft Word or Excel
you're typing a lot and that can be a
little difficult difficult on that
typical iPad keyboard this is an example
of how we built this experience for the
iPad explicitly so this keyboard really
enables you to do some of the things
that on a Windows PC you do with a
keyboard and mouse like keystroke
commands are starting formulas so that
you can easily do sums and averages and
such so but built just for this
experience and you've got sort of the
number pad absolutely figuration over
here on the right no medications
absolutely okay and then PowerPoint is
is the same a very rich immersive
document experience all the beauty that
you've come to expect from PowerPoint
but touch fit friendly experiences like
being able to move my slides around just
by dragging them down within the
document and putting them where I want
to put them I can also add transitions
the the sexy transitions that people
have come to expect like things like
crumpling paper and and things like the
origami fold up and then I can of course
because this is PowerPoint powerpoints
about presentation it's about presenting
confidently so I can always go in and do
my presentation walk into a room start
my presentation get those great
transitions and animations swipe to move
forward you see that my transitions my
builds come through you can even swipe
backwards believe it or not and watch
that our gommi bird come back where it's
through the of through the room and in
order to present confidently you really
want to have extra tools like being able
to tap and hold and get a laser pointer
so that people can see where your focus
area is
perhaps you want to go in and and draw
some ink on the screen so you can say
hey what I'm talking about is this I'm
talking about this point right here
maybe I want to pick up a highlighter
and highlight the thing that I want to
focus on a really rich presentation
tools that let you just present super
confidently with PowerPoint all three
apps really build with touch in mind
from the ground up for iPad users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
