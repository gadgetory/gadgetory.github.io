screen with blinkfeed giving you a
constant stream of social updates and
news headlines that matter to you over
the past year we've continued to add
top-tier content and media providers
giving you even more choice with this
new version of blinkfeed we focus it on
making it even easier to find the
content that you're interested in the
new layout is spacious clean and
colorful so the articles are easier to
browse and read and with the new blink
you can create custom feeds on
absolutely any topic for example i
happen to be remodeling my home and I'm
constantly looking at modern
architecture for inspiration I can type
that in as a topic save it as a custom
feed and then I instantly get articles
and tweets about what interests me we
see a lot of potential to make blinkfeed
even more useful and intuitive so today
we're opening up blinkfeed to developers
so they can integrate their content in
ways that are really interesting to you
one of our first partners is foursquare
for example let's say it's coming up on
noon we happen to be in Manhattan
foursquare will publish lunch
recommendations right into your feed
we're also working with Fitbit to
display your activity milestones in the
feed in fact you'll be able to use your
HTC One m8 with it's always on sensor
hub as your Fitbit activity tracker all
your activity data goes straight into
Fitbit and then you'll see things like
your latest achievements show up in your
feed and these are just two initial
partners we've opened up blinkfeed to
everyone so developers can integrate
their content in new and interesting
ways that matter to you the software
developer kit is available today and we
look forward to seeing what our new
partners can do
let's talk a little bit about TV now
last year we turn to the HTC One into
the only remote control you need by
integrating an IR blaster and
introducing you to sense TV on the HTC
One m8 sense TVs all new visual layout
is more engaging and makes it easier to
find out what's on but we've made it
even more powerful with the inclusion of
real-time social feeds and live sports
statistics now when you're watching a
show you can just swipe to the right to
get to your the official Twitter and
Facebook pages along with popular
hashtags for sports fans since TV now
supports the 10 most popular sports in
the world from basketball to baseball
football to golf you get live scores and
stats TV channel information a full
remote control and an integrated social
experience all in one application moving
on to talk about audio HTC's signature
boom sound set the standard for mobile
audio with dual front stereo speakers
dedicated amps and custom DSP with the
HTC One m8 our lead in mobile audio is
only growing the new HTC One features a
finely tuned multiband amplifier it
improved dynamic range and reduces a
distortion we've also redesigned the
speaker chambers it results in audio
that is twenty-five percent louder and
has more depth this means you get
clearer sound with everything that
you're listening to we also put
tremendous effort into making it easy to
connect your phone to your home theater
or stereo now you can just swipe with
three fingers and anything that you're
doing on your phone whether that's
playing a song watching a YouTube video
or listening to internet radio it can
instantly be played through a wireless
speaker TV or stereo system
and these are just a few of the partners
that we've worked with to make sure this
is a seamless experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
