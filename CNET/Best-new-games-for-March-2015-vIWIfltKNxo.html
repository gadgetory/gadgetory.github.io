Bakalar here to bring you another
month's worth of upcoming games you
should have your eyes on all of these
titles scheduled to hit March of 2015
let's get it going first up on March
10th is the release of the next
generation version of DMC or devil may
cry 4 Xbox one and PlayStation 4 if you
didn't get a chance to play this one I
highly recommend giving it a go this
time around
next up it's an indie title from moon
studios Ori and the blind forest is a
self-described genre mix that the
developers call Metroidvania that's set
in the bar pretty high so you have to
see for yourself on March 11th when the
game hits xbox one and pc 3ds is getting
a brand new title first teased at last
year's e3 codenamed scheme is a
turn-based strategy game elements of
third person shooter it is available
March thirteenth vs and check that out
battlefield hardline will finally
release on March seventeenth after being
delayed a bunch last year if you recall
in addition to a campaign hardline will
feature various online modes for players
can assume the roles of criminals or
police Borderlands the handsome
collection will come out on March 24th
with xbox one and playstation 4 and
include the entire full versions of both
Borderlands 2 and the pre-sequel along
with all of the DLC and all the add-ons
that ever came out for each game you
somehow didn't play either of these last
generation this is the absolute best way
to jump right answer also on the 24th is
the PlayStation 4 exclusive blood-borne
from the developers of those dark souls
games from software I've played a little
bit of blood-borne already it's
definitely tough but maybe not as
infuriating as those insane Dark Souls
games plus you get to kill enemies that
kind of look like a terrifying version
of / so that now of course these aren't
the only games hitting in March so be
sure to follow me and reach out on
Twitter with your most anticipated game
of the month if you're lucky I might
even reply with a free game code to be
sure to connect that's it for me there
are some games that need to be played to
see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
