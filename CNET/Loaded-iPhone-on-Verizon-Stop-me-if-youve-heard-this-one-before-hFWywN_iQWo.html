hello announced Hulu Plus this is the
paid version of Hulu that will let you
watch entire seasons of shows instead of
just the last few episodes this will
cost 999 per month and you can watch it
on your computer or on one of Samsung's
internet-connected blu-ray players an
iPhone or an iPad over Wi-Fi or 3G and
soon the PlayStation 3 hulu says it will
be adding devices so I've got to think
that the Xbox and the Roku will be soon
enough this service is ad-supported so
you do have to watch commercials which
some people may not like considering
they're paying for this the service is
not live yet you have to sign up for an
invite at hulu.com / + stop me if you've
heard this one before new rumors are
circulating that the iphone is coming to
verizon early next year a source from
someone who claims to know something
reported this to bloomberg late tuesday
and that's all we've got virgin mobile
released what they're calling the first
prepaid mobile mifi unit this helps you
get 3g broadband on-the-go and plans
start at just ten dollars the mifi unit
itself costs $150 but you don't have to
sign a contract or go through a credit
check to activate it check out a full
look at it here on cnet cisco announced
a business tablet called the seus
they're calling this a productivity
device but it also does high-def video
streaming and real-time video and
multi-party conferencing it has a front
facing camera and runs Google's Android
operating system we don't have a price
on it yet but we do know that it's set
to launch in the first quarter of 2011
and finally if you have a sony laptop
listen up Sonia's warning that laptops
sold this year have a software bug that
causes them to overheat this applies to
nearly half a million laptops sony says
you can fix this by updating your
software or you can return the laptop so
that sony will do it for you that's your
news for now thank you for watching i'm
natali del conte latina
