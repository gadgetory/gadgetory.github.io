me is Seth Rosenblatt senior editor for
cnet thanks for joining us thank you for
having me on seth has been blogging
about the DNS changer virus and was it a
lot of hype because 1201 has come and
gone we haven't heard much about people
who are having problems but as you say
it's a catch-22 exactly it's one of
those things where if you're infected
you're now not on the internet and so
we're not going to know about you there
are phones people might call somebody
please by all means do not call me it's
a serious issue of course but I think at
this point the larger story is you know
people making sure that they have
antivirus protection on both windows and
mac and android and iOS and you know
staying safe on the internet so there
were not that many computers though that
we're even going to be possibly affected
right i mean the percentage of all
computer users was relatively small
absolutely the original number when the
FBI took down the the bad guys in
november 2011 was around 550,000 global
infections and we think the last number
i heard was around 330,000 infections
it's hard to tell at this point of
course because the network that was
keeping those people connected to the
Internet is now down even if you weren't
affected by DNS changer the fact that
similar malware could just shut down
your access to the Internet of course is
rather troubling so you know is this a
lessons their lesson to be learned here
I mean could this happen in the future
too and cause greater damage possibly
absolutely I think that this is one of
those situations where the the bad guys
never want to disconnect you from the
internet that that kind of messing with
people doesn't really happen that much
anymore what they really want from you
is your money and so what this virus
would do is it would redirect you to pay
two pages that would serve ads or pages
that would try to get you to submit your
personal information they want your cash
they don't want to disconnect you okay
and you say that the best protection is
to just make sure you're running
antivirus software absolutely is it that
simple though you don't have to do
anything beyond that no I mean you do
have to be careful about what sites you
go to because while security software
will protect you a lot of these attacks
these days are phishing attacks so
they're trying to get you to submit your
information because as I said they want
your money they're not interested in you
know command nearing your computer for
nefarious uses they just want you to
give them cash so obviously that's going
to send up some red flags for people and
hopefully they're not going to submit
anything absolutely and they're actually
very clever a lot of them now use these
these sites where it looks like you're
submitting your information for say a
contest or something and so you put in
your email address and you put in your
phone number and you know maybe even
your home address and before you know it
you're getting charged premium SMS spam
or all kinds of stuff and it so the
stuff looks legitimate and it's in fact
not legitimate at all ok any other
telltale signs though well one very good
trick is to look at your url bar on the
website that you're visiting and make
sure that it is the URL that it should
be if it if it doesn't say facebook com
or if it doesn't have your bank's proper
spelling for its name don't you know
don't do anything close the window
mm-hmm okay all right all right I have
to say though this ruin me a little bit
of the hype leading up to y2k not as
much but I know I I agree you know but
but it's one of those things where
fixing your computer from DNS changer
after they've shut down the network is
much much more difficult and it is when
it is connected so there was a deadline
and I think was important that everybody
go to the website the government website
that would check your computer and it
seems like a lot of people did that
because everyone's been commenting on
stories that we've published that
they're not infected okay well that's so
far as good news that no absolutely Seth
