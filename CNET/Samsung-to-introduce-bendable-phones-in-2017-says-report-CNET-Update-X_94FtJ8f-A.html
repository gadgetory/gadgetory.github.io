2017 a new report from Bloomberg says
yes there would be two models of
flexible phones with OLED screens we
might have an idea of what they could be
like thanks to a Samsung promo video
from 2014 one would fold in half like a
clamshell the other would be a device
with a 5-inch screen that can expand up
to eight inches for a tablet like
experience these phones would not be
flagship phones instead they are to be
experimental
however you know if consumers like the
Bendi feature Samsung will likely bring
it to the top of the line phones like
the Galaxy S series Samsung is not new
to curved screens the Galaxy Note edge
brought a flexible display to a real
product that edge feature eventually
made its way to the galaxy s6 edge
Samsung also demonstrated a ridiculous
105 inch television that can go from
flat to curved with a touch of a button
let's talk timing this latest report
says these pliable phones could see the
light of day as soon as February 2017
perhaps they'll make an appearance at
Mobile World Congress the biggest mobile
industry show there is should we believe
this report mostly yes an executive from
samsung Display stated that Samsung
would launch a flexible display for
smartphones that can be folded in half
that was back in 2014 there's no doubt
Samsung's working on this tech the
question is when Samsung can come up
with a compelling design to integrate
this technology that's it for this tech
