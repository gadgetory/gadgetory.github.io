with watch faces of course Apple has ten
of them built into the Apple watch and
they're all customizable and they're
probably the most beautiful thing that's
on this watch so I want to give a little
tour as to the ones that are the best
and the ones are the most interesting a
lot of apples watch faces take this
round dial approach this one's pretty
simple but they're all customizable so
you could actually change the way that
the dial looks the color elements and
what are called complications which is
the watch industry term for all those
little bits of information around here
like the date you can add them here from
a limited set that Apple allows you to
put in in certain predefined spots on
each watch face this one is kind of a
bare-bones informational dashboard that
looks a Morgan digital watch and gives
you lots of panes of information one of
the few non round watch faces on the
wash and this one is probably one of the
most beautiful it's a motion watch face
that brings up pictures of butterflies
or flowers or jellyfish which is my
favorite and they're fully animated
little mini videos of jellyfish
throbbing and moving right alongside the
time the most amazing one might be the
planetary watch face this one actually
shows your position and it shows day and
night conditions you can roll the crown
here and find out what the day and night
conditions are and any date and time in
the future or the past
it'll also show you what the moon is up
to what the lunar cycle is in case
you're curious and again scanning back
and forth through time and you can press
a button here that shows you all the
planetary alignments a solar cycle watch
face shows you when the Sun is setting
and rising and the average length of the
day depending on where you are and again
allows you to scroll back and forth to
see pretty little animations there's a
chronograph which works like a stopwatch
and allows you to also customize how the
dial is laid out and there's Mickey
Mouse Mickey Mouse was also on the iPod
Nano back in 2011 this one's more fully
animated maybe it's a sign of disney
watch faces to come now you can only use
apple's ten watch faces now with all the
extra customization settings you can add
more from third parties an apple doesn't
seem to be having any more coming
immediately hopefully there will be
because they may
we'll watch look incredibly unique and I
want more I'm Scott Stein with the watch
faces on a pariah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
