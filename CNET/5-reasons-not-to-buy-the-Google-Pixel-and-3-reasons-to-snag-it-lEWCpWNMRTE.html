five reasons not to buy the pixel and
three reasons to get it at number five
it's not water resistant okay Google
even Apple has adopted water proofing
Samsung and Sony have had it on their
Android phones for a long time the pixel
phones should have had waterproofing
dagnabbit at number four no wireless
charging the last two Nexus phones
didn't have wireless charging so why
should the pixel have wireless charging
I don't know maybe because the pixel is
supposed to be awesome at number three
no optical image stabilization Google
proudly stated that there was no
unsightly camera vault in the back of a
pixel phone who will also brag it's
camera is the best camera on any
smartphone out there but for some reason
Google did not include optical image
stabilization a feature that really
helped get great photos at number two no
expansion the pixels Android competitors
are the Samsung Galaxy s7 the note 7 and
maybe the LG g5 those phones all have
removable storage so you can put in a
microSD card so why not the pixel Amy
shut up
here's the top three reasons to buy the
Google pixel number three no Samsung
crud number two Google assistant is
built-in in the demos the new assistant
seems way smarter and the new pixel
launcher seems to be locked down to the
pixel phone for now the number one you
always get the latest version of Android
first by the phone and at number one the
price 649 dollars where phone is quite a
premium price for a phone and it's
missing some features that you can get
on other Android phones and unlock
galaxy s7 costs around six hundred and
seventy dollars the unlock s7 edge with
its 5.5 inch screen costs seven hundred
seventy dollars compare that to the $770
pixel XL and then there's a one plus
three which costs around four hundred
dollars whether you buy the Google pixel
is your decision
