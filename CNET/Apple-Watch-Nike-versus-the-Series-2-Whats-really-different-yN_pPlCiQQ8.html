all right let's give me a second here so
a lot of people are wondering really
what is different between the Nike Plus
edition of the Apple watch and just your
standard Apple watch series - and
there's really three things the first is
the actual Apple watch band on here
you'll see different stylings ranging in
colors from black to volt to kind of
this gray or a white in different
combinations that kind of gives it that
branding in that feel for the Nike Run
Club in the Nike Plus app and the second
thing about this is to watch faces that
are specific to the Nike Plus edition of
this watch you have this kind of feature
where you see the swoosh logo that's
linked to the Nike running Club app you
press on it directly from the watch face
it does support other complications as
well so you can still customize it but
it has direct integration and then the
third thing is a unique series feature
again specific to this version of the
watch if you want to start a run and you
have your phone nearby you can actually
tell the watch like start a five-mile
run start a 30-minute run and then you
leave your phone behind and you're off
to the races so let's just kind of show
this and see how it works start a four
mile run
and then you see the countdown beginning
work out and we're good to go
pausing workout resuming workout so who
is this watch really for first of all if
you love the Nike brand and you're
really part of that Nike run community
we talked about those three special
features that make you unique this is
the watch for you but again it's still
priced the same as a series to watch
whether you're a 38 millimeter watch
size of the 42 millimeter that's 369 and
399 again you can also still get the
Nike running Club app and use it on a
series to watch but you just won't get
those three benefits we talked about the
styling the watch faces and then that
exclusive Siri feature where you can
talk to the watch now one more thing you
guys and gals might want to be aware of
if you love listening to music and you
just want to use the Apple watch it's a
little trickier here the music isn't
directly integrated so what that means
you've got to open up the music app to
play music and then you've got to start
your run by opening up the running app
so that's what makes it a little tricky
but overall if you're someone who loves
the Nike ecosystem and you like the
Apple watch experience this might be the
one for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
