number of iterations over its lifetime
it started out as a simple boxy little
truck then it became one of Ford's first
hybrids and now we've got in front of us
the 2014 model now the 14 escape can
actually be had with a lot of tech but
this SV model we've got in front of us
is what I think in the sweet spot let's
take a look at it
now our SC model isn't equipped with the
top-of-the-line MyFord Touch system it's
actually got the basic deceptively
simple actually let me take that back
it's not very deceptively simple because
I mean well look at all these buttons
but don't worry you won't actually spend
a lot of time touching these buttons and
that's because this Ford Escape is
equipped with four think with app link
and what that means is that you'll do a
lot of your interactions with the
infotainment via voice you install the
app you turn on your car and you're done
it's just that simple you don't even
actually have to touch the phone in most
of the situations sync saying please say
a command mobile apps mobile apps please
say a command
Pandora Pandora please say a command
play The Hives radio
that would ask for but it's clucks
listen to the hives radio there we go so
Ford actually lists about 22 or more
apps between the platforms Android
Blackberry and iOS I've got a couple of
them installed on my phone a lot of them
kind of overlapped though if you've got
MOG for example or Rhapsody maybe you
don't want to install Spotify you've got
a lot of different choices here and when
you're talking about apps choice is good
interestingly the Bluetooth audio stream
doesn't seem to show album information
when connected to my Android phone
some of the other cars that I've tested
have the rest of the audio sources are
going to include your standard sort of
CD slot here USB port for connectivity
to iPod devices or your mass storage
you've got an auxilary input
you've got AM and FM radio and Sirius XM
satellite radio with a really neat trick
when you're listening to satellite radio
you can actually access this feature
called replay and what that allows you
to do is very briefly pause live radio
and then get out of your car you can
pause for about thirty minutes and when
you get back into your car and hit play
it'll pick up right where it left off
and then of course you can jump back to
direct play so if you're in your car
you're listening to a baseball game and
you've got to get out to fill up or pick
up something from the store you don't
have to worry about missing the play
further down the console you've actually
got your dashboard mounted shifter right
here for the six-speed Automatic
transmission you do have a sport mode at
the bottom of the shifter which is going
to actually change those shift points
and give you better access to the 170
thumb out horsepower that you have it
does feel a little bit better a little
bit more responsive for performance
driving if you want to put that in
quotes than the standard drive mode and
when you put it in reverse you'll see
that the 4.3 inch screen and the
dashboard also serves as a rear-view
camera if you've got the trunk open like
we do you get a nice exclamation point
letting you know maybe it's not the best
time to start moving
here's where things get a little bit
weird now all week I've been grabbing
right here what looks like the logical
place to open the lift gate and getting
nothing actually the grab points down
here there's a little button where you
open it up the old-fashioned way it's a
little bit confusing and I think it's
one of those things that's left over
from that stretched out vertical focus
design where they just slap that on
there willy-nilly
now the Ford Escape can actually be had
as an S model with a 2.5 litre duratec
engine that's a workaday engine it's a
naturally aspirated it's got quart
injection it's good for about a hundred
sixty-eight horsepower but our se model
is actually stepping down in this
placement stepping up in power this is a
hundred and seventy eight horsepower 1.6
liter EcoBoost engine that's good for
about 184 pound-feet of torque so you're
getting a little bit more efficiency 23
miles per gallon in the city 32 miles
per gallon on the highway and that's 1
mile per gallon more than the duratec by
every one of those metrics and the power
is actually a little bit more usable now
that power is gonna go through a
six-speed Automatic transmission with
select shift manual shift mode that's
the only option that you're gonna get on
the escape you do have the choice that
the SE model between front-wheel drive
and all-wheel drive this is a
front-wheel drive model so you get
better efficiency though wheel drive is
going to give you a little bit more
traction when the weather gets a little
slippery and a lot of automakers have
been doing a lot of talking about
downsizing engines and adding turbos to
get big displacement power with small
engine efficiency so we've got the 1.6
liter under the hood instead of a 2 or
2.5 like you'd expect and a vehicle of
this size Augmented of course by that
turbocharger and by George I think
they've got it but the power is good
particularly in the sport mode where the
transmission seems really happy to stay
in a lower gear and kind of give you
better access to those high revs the
power you
kind of at low speeds and around the
city kind of get that good planted Ford
Focus feel that European tune steering
and handling that Ford's been promising
us with this new generation of their C
platform vehicles but the problem is
that when you get up to highway speed it
just kind of feels like it's moving
around a lot the whole vehicle is just
kind of moving around a lot underneath
you
not the most planted vehicle that I've
driven this month now the 2014 escape
can actually be had at the base F model
422 7 and that's a pretty good car with
the duratec engine it's perfectly
serviceable and reasonable about a tech
you can also go see that style as Brian
Cooley likes to say and jump up to the
titanium model with the turbocharged
engine and lots of power you can go
crazy with the tech and make this thing
parallel-park itself and open the trunk
automatically but then you're gonna be
pushing the price close to $35,000 now
this se model which starts 225 550 it's
right there in the middle at eight
hundred and ninety five dollars for your
destination charge and I think you're
gonna find that less is more in this
