at baselworld in switzerland a show that
normally caters exclusively for the
launch of luxury traditional watches
this year however we have started to see
some smart technology creeping in so
let's take a look at the top products
now first up is the frederique constant
horological SmartWatch now this watch
focuses on handmade Swiss analog design
but it also tracks your activity and
your sleep sinks that data to Android or
iOS smartphones and it has a two year
battery mundane uses similar technology
inside its Helvetica one smart watch it
also tracks activity and your sleep it
has a sleek metal body and it has the
minimalist mundane analog watch face big
news from tag heuer this week though as
it's announced is partnered with google
and intel to launch the first luxury
Android wear SmartWatch now suddenly we
don't know anything about the watch
orange design but as an Android wear
device you can bet that the software
will be pretty much the same as what
you'll find on existing Android wear
smartwatches like the LG G watch are we
will find out a lot more about this
watch when it launches later this year
gucci has also announced a partnership
with Black Eyed Peas star will I am on a
smart band that will operate
independently of your phone thanks to
its 3G connectivity again we haven't
actually seen the product in its flesh
yet but we do know that it will have a
front facing camera it will be able to
track your activity your sleeve show
incoming notifications and do basically
everything else you'd expect from a
fully fledged SmartWatch we should
expect some more information about this
later this year and finally we have the
vector SmartWatch now the headline of
this guy is it apparently has a 30-day
battery life vector says it achieves
this by having quite simple software and
a monochrome display which is less
demanding a power it connects to your
smartphone to provide all of the
SmartWatch functions you'd expect like
notifications and incoming calls and
will go on sale in the summer this year
so there we have it perhaps not a big
commitment to technology from some of
the brands but it's an interesting start
from an industry that typically relies
on its traditional roots I'm Andrew
