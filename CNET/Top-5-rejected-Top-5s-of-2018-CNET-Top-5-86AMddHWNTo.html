fives of the year every week we try to
get you a top five that you'll find
interesting yes true not every topic
gets developed into a full episode here
are my favorites that didn't make it in
2018 at number five Apple rumors that
never die Apple always grabs people's
attention probably because the companies
come out with a number of amazing
products
this time the undying rumors would have
included the Apple television the Apple
car and iOS coming to Mac OS Apple
actually addressed the iOS Mac OS thing
saying it's not gonna happen
but then again Apple ported its iOS apps
directly to Mac OS so there's that a
number for a top five related to the
dark phoenix movie now this will likely
happen in 2019 it got shelved because
Fox moved the release date of the film
we've seen a version of Dark Phoenix in
x-men 3 The Last Stand but that was kind
of shoehorned in over the break I'll
reread the Dark Phoenix saga to see the
top 5 things we want to see in the movie
coming at number 3 was top apps for
NaNoWriMo NaNoWriMo stands for National
Novel Writing Month which occurs every
November I found a bunch of apps that I
thought could be useful the only problem
was how to test them do I have to write
five novels should I write five chapters
and rank the apps in that way and I
thought when was it gonna be able to
write this stuff and then I panicked so
maybe next year at number two kids TV
shows I've over analysed this felt like
it would be way too much of a vanity
project I've got an 8 year old son so
I've watched a lot of children's
television
I like shows having a logic so I'd ask
questions to my son like hey have we
ever seen the inside of a pokeball who
employs Team Rocket and why does Pikachu
get to be outside the ball I stopped
short of asking if this was some kind of
weird animal fighting ring number one
browsers that are not chrome I got very
far with the script and I think it's a
very worthwhile topic however throughout
the year I kept getting sidetracked into
all kinds of other things I just did not
get enough time to test out each browser
to give a fair ranking if you looking
for other browsers check out brave opera
and Firefox
yes Firefox it's gotten a lot better
over the past few years
thank you very much for watching top
five you guys are great and I hope you
have a very happy new year am i as act
iron I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
