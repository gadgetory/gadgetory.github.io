home to over a thousand vendors from all
over the world with tech products and
ideas they're looking at care and we're
going to take a look at some of them and
see we can find yes we develop a
solution that can record video from the
baby's point of view it's a small camera
that you can put on the baby here or
next to the baby in order to have video
what the baby sees so the baby wants the
baby is a grown-up can see again the
face of his mom or the faithfuls is that
when it was a baby so you can buy it
online on baby's calm it's available for
the end of January there's no problem
with the privacy it's no Wi-Fi no
Bluetooth so you have to connect the
device on your computer to download the
video it's not on the Internet at all hi
I'm max from also and this is keno our
first mobile Salar generator it gives
you power everywhere it deploys its
solar panels and follows the Sun like a
sunflower
so these glasses that I'm wearing they
look like a normal pair of glasses they
feel like an armed pair of glasses but
they have some sensors on the inside and
they're designed for elderly people that
they fall that triggers a sensor and the
sensor contacts this base unit and this
base unit will then contact the
emergency authorities to help you out so
the cool thing about these glasses is
they look like normal glasses right now
these are going to be coming on France
later this year and will be 200 euros so
not following not following hello I'm
Kerry I will introduce you the product
that we developed with my teammates
it's called moxie it's a device that
helps people follow sleep thanks to
mindfulness session it's getting
meditation so with this key we can
choose the theme of our session we have
seven different themes each theme has
eight different sessions two duration
eight or twenty minutes and two voices
male or female so to listen listening
these sessions help to decrease the
stress and anxiety and it generates
cards so it's how we can have a better
and deeper sleep if you want to travel
with the product we can take these
wooden parts out and thrust it like this
so it's reconvene ian's and really
useful we launched the product in
September 2018 and the cost is 99 USD
I am sure after know from he lied
company manufacturing airbag in France
to protect people using bicycles or
motorcycle horse riding and this is the
latest product that we made it's a
bicycle vest which inflates in case of
accidents or in case of fall very useful
because bicycle is really climbing with
ebikes and there will be more and more
accidents that we have to cover so this
bicycle product is called B save and the
price will be 650 US dollar sliders the
new way to quit smoking
what it does it learns smokers behavior
and it well it's highly personalized
plans it wait so what happens it stops
riding up after the learning week has
been complete it will tell you when it's
time to to smoke and it will gradually
reduce the number of cigarettes
allocated to you predict if you don't
feel connected to the app where you can
check your stats you can connect a
family or friends they're also smokers
and you can quit smoking altogether it's
available to pre-order right now on our
website
www-wait and it's this retail price is
$129 it should be aware of in the market
within four to six months
this is called the rocking vent it rocks
you asleep just like you'd rock a baby
to sleep the idea behind the bed came
from being on a cruise ship and the
founder of the company and his wife
knows they fell asleep better from the
motion of the bed but you could just
take this cruise ship experience and put
it in your home for $3500 and you can
buy it now if it's a full-size mattress
a queen-size mattress or a king I'm
getting a little tired so all right
I don't you ever have the problem having
a wet dog not a lot of fun but one way
to dry them off is with Pepe the pet
dryer this has a bed of air that blows
up and down to dry your pet off fast
you'd be about 25 minutes what's nice is
this doesn't scare the dog and sometimes
a dog will even go to sleep and all you
do is put the dog in here close the door
set the temperature and get it to go so
Pepe cost $660 in the US
unfortunately unavailable here quite yet
I hear you could put a cat in here too
I'm not gonna try that see you a little
while ruff ruff
hi so this is the barrister it's a
coffee brewing alarm clock so you wake
up to a fresh coffee in the morning it
also does loose leaf tea how it works is
you put water in here the steam pressure
pushes the water around into the coffee
you've got a little milk vessel here
which is cooled overnight and it
regulates it at around three to five
five degrees then you've also got a
little drawer here which has all your
coffee or your tea by your bedside this
is four hundred and forty-five dollars
and it's available online at WRC car
well that's it for my time here at
Eureka Park there's about 800 other
vendors they have not got to check out
but there's always next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
