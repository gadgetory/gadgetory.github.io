seth rosenblatt Seth thanks for being
with us thank you so there was an open
letter written by a bunch of tech
heavyweights that have banded together
and it's an open letter to Congress into
the President of the United States about
security and the the collective sort of
group is called reform government
surveillance yes tell us what this
letter is asking for I mean the title
kind of gives it away but right so to
summarize that there's a bunch of bullet
points in the letter but to summarize
these companies are asking the
government to be more fair you know
according to them in how it requests
data from these companies yeah so they
want a more oversight they want more
safeguards they want more transparency
and these are things that technically
they've had but because of various
rulings in the FISA and surveillance
courts over the years have been sort of
hamstrung and the government has found
ways to circumvent them and these
companies are upset and they're not
going to take it anymore yep so so why
now why are the companies asking for you
know limitations I reasonable
limitations on the government's powers
and abilities in terms of security sure
this all goes back to the Edward Snowden
document leaks right the documents that
he blew the whistle on have really
changed the game surveillance as
something that is not just talked about
people wearing tinfoil hats we've
actually found out it's far worse than
we could ever have imagined and you know
and that involves pretty serious things
like various governments from around the
world being involved in breaking
cryptographic standards and really doing
a pretty severe damage to how the
internet operates what do you think is
going to happen next I mean we were
chatting and you said this is sort of
like a warning shot right in regards yes
absolutely this is this is definitely
nothing more than a warning shot I in
and of itself there's no teeth but what
it does indicate is that
these companies that really you know
often they get along in some ways but
they're always sort of arguing with each
other and fighting with each other over
we should really mention which company
sorry trip idea we've got Apple Twitter
my facebook google of course got in
google linkedin and AOL so all the big
players all the big players are involved
they're all agreeing to this and that's
a big deal what we're probably going to
wind up seeing is nothing in the short
term okay but in the long term I
wouldn't be surprised if we saw far more
lobbying in relation to surveillance in
on Capitol Hill and this is also a sign
to these companies customers that they
are attempting to take steps to protect
you it's not something that I would
personally put a lot of faith in at the
moment okay and no response thus far
from the government however the letter
was just sort of just released yeah okay
as far as customers are concerned
there's nothing really that they can do
at this point right if they're using the
services of any of those companies or
the products that any of those companies
have put out there they're really just
the companies are just letting the
customers know hey we're doing this
absolutely i mean when the government
have figured out how to tap into the
internet backbone okay so only so much
that you can do and unfortunately you
know these these companies are the
biggest players and it's hard to find
services that are not these companies
and i think you bring up a good point
about privacy and these companies sort
of asking oh sure customers okay give up
price there's no small irony in the fact
that these are companies that for years
have really been pushing people to share
more if not actively anti privacy
companies and now they're they're taking
steps to ensure that if someone's going
to use your data it's going to be them
mm-hmm it's not the government not to
government okay well Seth we will trust
that you will keep us informed on this
issue thanks so much for inside scoop
I'm Sumi das thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
