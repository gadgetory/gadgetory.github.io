the dialed in podcast at CES we are
alive here we've got the whole cell
phone crew I'm Jessica's all court
senior editor at cnet joining by Brian
Bennett yes Brian Ben and I also review
phones for cnet com we've got kent
german inland law and what we're going
to do we're going to tell you about all
of the phones that we're seeing here so
basically you guys what have you been
seeing in terms of themes what's showing
well I think we're seeing a lot from
minor players or at least players that
we don't really know a lot about we
don't usually hear about it CS you know
but traditionally it's been motorola HTC
nokia nokia nokia a big thing last year
Samsung we have one from sony ericsson
well to their kind of the same phone and
then we saw a lot from alcatel and
huawei and CTE so a lot of smaller
players that were used to dealing with
in the United States they don't really
have a huge presence with a lot of real
of high-end smartphones but they did
make a presence here definitely what
else are we going to see in terms of the
designs in the upcoming year well I mean
I can say that I've seen a lot of phones
especially leading up to the show that
have flush screens and edge to edge
panels and also a lot of phones with
glass you know back plates which can be
a little dangerous especially the way I
treat my phones so it's interesting
because it's sony ericsson xperia z i
keep on a colony to end for some reason
you know it does have the glass on the
back which you know that came out on the
iphone and that got a lot of you know i
think people now complain but they said
you know it's really dangerous there's a
lot of people breaking it so it's
interesting they made that choice right
because it makes it look premium but
then if you put a case on top of it
you're kind of covering up the thing
that you wanted to see in the first one
case on it because it's just gonna glass
it's gonna break so i don't know what
there's nothing there but it's
definitely gonna fall and it's gonna
break absolutely a lot of other things
that we've seen our colors that's like
really surprising that we don't just see
black and white and with the ZTE grand s
it comes in a lot of finishes there's
like a matte and glossy finish but
there's also yellow red pink and
mint blue and Xperia charger blazer yeah
last night when I looked at the lenovo
k900 which is a new phone from Lenovo
announced yesterday that has a fast
intel processor they had a copper one
and actually you might think it's really
got Ian you know I got just too much
light but it was actually pretty cool i
liked it i don't know but it was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
