cnet.com and I'm here with the audio
technica ath ckp 500 sonic sport in ear
headphones yes this is a sports
headphone from a company you probably
don't associate with sports headphones
well has an all-plastic design that ath
ckp 500 seems sturdily built and is
certified as an IP x5 a waterproof
headphone that means that it can
withstand a good dousing with a
sustained spray for three minutes but it
can't hang out under water too long so
sorry no you can't take it swimming but
you can wash it off if you want and it's
certainly sweat resistant what I like
about it is its fit and sound quality
like with some competing sports
headphones you get a few different sets
of wings Audio Technica refers to them
as c-shape ear tips monster sports
earphones have a similar design but I
found these slightly more comfortable
along with the typical silicon ear tips
you also get three sets of ridged ear
tips that allow some sound to seep in
from the outside world this can be
important for runners and bikers who
want to be able to hear cars coming
without a tight seal you do lose a
little bass but that's something some
people can live with in exchange for a
bit of extra safety this is an
asymmetrical cord which means one side
is longer than the other the reason for
that is so that you can wear the core
behind your neck it's also worth noting
that the base cord is relatively short
and is designed for use with arm bands
but you can attach the 2 foot long
extension cable to add more length if
you keep your device in a pant pocket or
clipped on to your belt as far as extra
features go the one big omission is an
inline remote / microphone for making
cell phone calls also no carrying case
is included in terms of performance
these have a more audiophile sound
profile with clean well balanced sound
but not a huge amount of bass I like
their sound and so did scenic
contributor Steve Guttenberg but we both
prefer more natural sounding headphones
these guys aren't incredibly open
sounding but the
pleasant to listen to and work well with
a variety of music however if you're
into bigger bass is more aggressive
headphones you should probably check out
the monster merchants in-ear Sports
headphones I've tested a fair amount of
these types of headphones and these
ranked up there with my favorites
offering comfortable secure fit and very
good sound it's also nice that it's a
waterproof headphone at least the IP x5
variety of waterproof headphone and can
be rinsed off after use this model lists
for 7495 but you can pick it up for Less
online that makes it a decent value
especially if you can get it for less
than $60 I have no problem recommending
it for both sports juice and everyday
use I'm David Carr know and that's the
audio technica ath ck p500
