ever
can you believe Android is now 10 years
old well you should because it's true
over the years Android phones have
overtaken every other competitor to
become the number one mobile operating
system by market share worldwide let's
look back and see what has been so great
about Android in the past 10 years
number 5 is quick settings swipe from
the top of the screen and Android gave
you the option of toggling important
settings like Wi-Fi or mobile data long
pressing the setting brings you even
more choices could you imagine having to
call up the Settings app every time you
wanted to mess with Wi-Fi or airplane
mode that was a reality on certain non
Android phones for a very long time
coming in at number four is battery
saver it's really easy to wind up using
your phone for everything then you
realize you need your phone alive for
something really really important and
you have no charging Android added a
battery saver mode to the operating
system way back in the lollipop days and
it's incredibly useful thankfully
batteries have gotten bigger over the 10
years Android has been around with
battery saver you can get a lot of usage
from your phone number three is variety
because Android is free and open source
anyone can build their own version of
Android if they see fit Amazon fire
tablets run a customized version of
Android there are also a ton of
different sized and priced Android
phones without Android would be stuck
when it comes to options
number two is notification management
from the get-go Android notifications
have been well managed I remember seeing
the notification trade being pulled down
at the t-mobile g1 event years ago I
thought it was a great idea on top of
that notifications have improved over
the years by adding functionality you
can reply from notifications without
launching another app swipe down on an
email notification to get more
information you can even change settings
for notifications within the
notification before we get to number one
let's talk about the worst things about
Android over the years homogenous Asian
of handsets in the early days of Android
we saw some weird crazy things
remember when Android phones featured
Hardware keyboards two screens these
days so many phones have moved to the
notches
lab form factor apart from BlackBerry
tablets Android tablets are not
officially dead but this should be
Android tablet apps are generally awful
then again with Android phones getting
larger in a short amount of time a large
screen Android phone pretty much
eliminates the need for a tablet and the
most frustrating part about Android is
updates what the latest version of
Android when it comes out you've got
some very limited options arguably
Samsung makes the best Android phones
due to a number of reasons updates take
a long time to reach Samsung phones that
also means that developers may not be
able to take full advantage of Android
features for a while back to the bright
side and the number one best thing about
Android ever is customization for the
most part you can make your Android
phone behave however you want I think
Risto C on Twitter said it best quote
want a different keyboard sure change
the launcher you've got it different
assistant at like Cortana or Amazon done
like a honey badger Android don't care
well stated wrists OC also don't forget
Android lets you have widgets pretty
much anywhere you want your Android
phone is yours to mess with and that is
great they leave anything out let me
know am i as apt I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
