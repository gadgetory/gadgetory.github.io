super zooms and rugged bottles continue
to sell because they offer things you
can't get with the camera on one of
these so why not give people both which
is what Fujifilm does with this the
finepix s1 it's the world's first camera
with a 50x zoom lens and a weather
resistant body
I'm Josh Goldwyn with CNET and while the
s-1 isn't waterproof or shockproof you
can stand out in the rain or snow or on
the beach and not worry about damaging
the camera under normal use the camera
body is covered in a nice rubberized
texture giving you a little more secure
grip and it helps that it has the nice
big grip on front and a large lens
barrel to hold on to on the barrel you
get a zoom control and a reframing
button and the lens moves quickly so no
worries there its controls are all well
placed for good access to important
settings and you get things like an
accessory shoe for adding an external
flash the flip-out rotating LCD is nice
to have - as is the electronic
viewfinder shooting and autofocus
performance can be slow on long zoom
cameras but the s1 is nice and quick
which is important if you're trying to
shoot birds or anything else before it
leaves the frame photo quality is a bit
of a mixed bag though if you're looking
for great detail while pixel peeping
this isn't the camera for you for
getting nice shots in the daylight for 8
by 10 prints or slightly larger or
sharing online with minimal cropping it
does the trick and again since its
weather resistant you don't have to
worry about your conditions just about
what you want to shoot and when you're
done there's built-in Wi-Fi and while
the user experience could be better it
does let you get your shots to your
phone tablet or computer for faster
sharing you can read the full review on
CNET comm but it's a very good choice
for those who don't want to worry about
the weather when they go out shooting
I'm Josh golden and
the fujifilm finepix s1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
