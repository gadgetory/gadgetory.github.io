bigger than a car it's seen that top
five I'm Brian Cooley with the top tech
cars we've seen so far in 2010 grab your
pink slip and your checkbook and let's
get started
starting off at number five it's the
oddball of the Mercedes line the s400
hybrid this is a big ol s class with a
smallish v6 and of course an electric
motor the dealer will tell you it's got
v8 performance with v6 economy but he'll
be lying it's just a big car that
doesn't move smartly enough a full two
seconds slower than the v8 version
however it's the only s-class that
avoids getting hit with the gas guzzler
tax because it gets four mpg better fuel
economy I guess that's a win number four
is the Mini Cooper S this car has been a
longtime favorite with techies it
handles like a go-kart has all kinds of
tech options and it's the ideal picnic
car since the speedometer can double as
a serving plate on the other hand it
rides like a truck and I think the whole
retro styling wink is getting a little
played after nine years but you seem to
think otherwise it remains a scene that
car tech perennial at number three the
Infiniti fx35 now Infiniti has been tech
gonzo from the beginning they were way
out in front with things like a round
view camera technology lane departure
prevention blind spot detection even gas
pedals now that push back when you're
LED footing it but they don't always get
it right the fx35 offers a paltry eight
hundred megabytes of music storage on
its hard drive guys why bother
number two the Nissan GTR normally
weapons of this type require a special
export license and cost into the
millions of dollars but the GTR really
is more like a military piece than a car
and it makes no apologies it's fast as
hell and it has the coolest deep tech
display you'll ever see in a dashboard
the looks you either love or hate but
I'll tell you it's the only $80,000 car
I can really call a scream
bargain before we get to number one
let's take a look at the lamest tech car
we've reviewed so far in 2010 it's the
Nissan Xterra s yeah I know it hauls
stuff over stuff but the S trim version
doesn't play mp3 CDs or have an iPod
hookup or a USB port or offer GPS nap or
even an aux jack for crying out loud why
did they send this to us okay now our
number one hottest hi-tech rides so far
in 2010 it's the Audi s4 tremendous
cabin tech and interface 3d GPS that
actually looks great
a be a no audio rig Rorty performance
sticky handling 7-speed dual-clutch
gearbox great fuel economy an uncanny
smooth ride I gotta sit down no one do
we gave it an editor's choice anyway I'm
sorry if I just made you hate your car
that kind of goes with the territory
that's it for this edition of seen that
top 5 I'm Brian Cooley we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
