controversial diversity memo is speaking
out
he claims that Google is trying to smear
him and he's threatening legal action
against the company in an interview with
Bloomberg TV ex-employee James d'amour
defended the points he made in his 3,000
word manifesto that went viral and led
to him losing his job in it the 28 year
old made a case that the gender gap at
Google may not exist because of bias or
discrimination but rather it's
biological reasons that steer women away
from the tech field and positions of
leadership among his many points he said
that women were more prone to
neuroticism d'amore said the memo was
written a month ago but only now went
viral and it led to many of Google's top
executives publicly condemning the
points made no one high up ever came to
me and said no don't do this even though
there were many people that looked at it
it was only after it got viral that the
upper management started shaming me and
eventually firing me Google's CEO sundar
pichai issued a company-wide response
saying that Portia's the memo violated
Google's code of conduct by advancing
gender stereotypes he wrote quote to
suggest a group of our colleagues have
traits that make them less biologically
suited to that work is offensive and not
okay with Bloomberg d'amour accused
Google of illegal hiring practices that
favored women and minorities he also
told the New York Times that he will
likely be pursuing legal action
Google's pachai cut his family vacation
short in order to hold a company-wide
meeting on Thursday to address this
issue and the firing of d'amore who
worked with Google for more than three
years I'm Bridget Carey for more head to
Cena calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
