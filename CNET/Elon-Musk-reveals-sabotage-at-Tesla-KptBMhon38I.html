that's according to CEO Elon Musk who
sent an email to staff late on Sunday
night saying the company had discovered
an employee conducting extensive and
damaging sabotage to Tesla's operations
in the email published by CNBC musk says
the employee made changes to code in
Tesla's manufacturing operating system
under fake user names and gave highly
sensitive Tesla data to unknown third
parties must also warned employees to be
on the lookout for bad behavior saying
there are a long list of organizations
that want Tesla to die it comes at a
tough time for Tesla which just
announced plans to layoff nine percent
of its workforce to increase
profitability musk says the layoffs
point into the company's production
targets as it ramps up efforts to roll
out 5000 Model 3 vehicles a week but
were the layoffs behind the sabotage
well in the email musk avoided talk of
job cuts saying the employee was
disgruntled about a missed promotion the
company has declined to comment but the
rat in the ranks at Tesla could be a
sign that company culture is faltering
and with musk calling on employees to
report any suspicious behavior model 3
production targets could be the last of
Tesla's worries I'm clearly for Senate
and you can read about all things Tesla
on the Senate and Roadshow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
