and appliances and this is the Scout
home security system in many ways Scout
is similar to the simply safe or other
Alucard home security style option it
comes with a hub it has door and window
sensors it has other motion sensors and
it actually offers an HD video camera
and the beauty of it is that you can add
on any combination of accessories that
you want you do have to get the hub
that's 129 bucks but if you just want
one door panel or just the camera or all
of those things you can do that so I
have here a motion sensor a door panel
and an access sensor I installed this
series of sensors all throughout our
office and this thing has an exceptional
range it actually operates on a mesh
network so everything communicates with
everything else allowing for an extended
range up to a hundred feet and I found
that to be very accurate and every time
I tested one of these sensors it
responded the app would send me a push
notification and the alarm would go off
Scout also offers live monitoring
starting at $9 going up to 19 depending
on the level of features you want
I like that Scout makes this optional
simply safe does have a required monthly
fee starting at $15 so if you don't want
live monitoring you don't have an option
with this you do I also like that you
can set custom modes within the app so
if you want to do an away mode that will
send you a push notification and email
and sound the siren if any of these
sensors are triggered you can do that or
any combination of those things overall
I really like Scout I think it looks a
lot nicer than simply safe and it allows
for more customization I like that it
offers an HD camera I like that the
monthly fees are optional and that it
provides a lot of options for you to
secure your home thanks for watching
this review of scout be sure to check
