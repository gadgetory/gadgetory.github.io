lot more time practice and skill than
say making a fresh pot of joe for $200
though the cafe barista from mr. coffee
is built to automate much of that
process the mr. coffee cafe barista may
not have stunning European styling or
all-metal construction but with a black
plastic body sporting brushed metal
accents it'll fit right in among modern
kitchenware and counter tops buttons on
the front of the vice command the cafe
barista to make single or double shots
of espresso plus smaller large lattes
and cappuccinos provided you've loaded
the included Porta filter with fresh
coffee grounds added brewing water to
the tank and milk to the appliances
reservoir the device will whip up
espresso drinks to order all by itself
you also have to angle the milk wand
into your cup and select your desired
level of steam less steam for lattes and
more for cappuccinos the milk module is
removable too and even can be stored in
the fridge until you need it the cafe
barista though has trouble brewing at a
consistent temperature and makes
espresso that's a little on the weak
side if you use its standard settings
and suggested basket sizes the machine
also can't pull the more pleasant
flavors from lightly roasted beans and
gets clogged up by very fine grounds if
what you really need to satisfy your
coffee habit is a relatively affordable
way to make decent lattes and
cappuccinos with a little less hassle
then the mr. coffee barista is a solid
choice this is no super automatic
espresso machine however that does
everything for you when you press the
button for that you have to spend
thousands of dollars for more check out
