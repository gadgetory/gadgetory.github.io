and galaxy s6 edge these are the most
advanced pop smartphones in the world
let's begin by taking a look at the
design every detail on these devices was
carefully considered crafted to serve a
significant purpose for our consumers
both the s6 and the s6 edge come in
other shimmering colors with a mystical
quality we've all dropped and shattered
our points before Gorilla Glass 4 has
your back in fact it's the toughest in
the market the special metal that we use
is 50% stronger than the metal in other
high-end smartphones we reimagine the
user experience so it's more intuitive
and simpler to use as you can see we
used bright and simple colors to make
everything more clear and better
organized Green as a phone purple it's
video orange our contacts take a look at
the camera controls everything you need
is right at your fingertips
and tapping a single button gives you
all the commonly used options at a
glance but if you want more advanced
controls there's a separate professional
mode when you're feeling more creative
even though the s5 has an amazing
display the s6 has 77 percent more
pixels and there's nothing more
representative of our display innovation
than our galaxy s6 edge it has a Super
AMOLED screen
wrapped around both edges of the device
inviting you to a wonderful viewing
experience get this it only takes 10
minutes to get enough charge for up to
four hours of everyday use come on
that's right charging from zero to a
hundred it takes roughly half the time
of the iPhone six no one has invented
the never-ending battery but we've
invented one that charges faster than
any in the industry just like the
battery wireless charging is built right
in and as it's compatible with the two
main wireless charging standards both
WPC and PMA you know that you're covered
wireless charging has arrived we're also
excited to announce a new gear VR and it
works with both the s6 and s6 edge the
pixel density of the s6 display has been
increased by eleven percent versus the
no 4 giving you a richer visual
experience with crisper images as a
camera smartphones get the job done for
the most part but the key challenge is
creating a camera that excels in all
lighting conditions how about a brighter
F 1.9 lens real-time HDR and a special
low-light shot feature that combines
multiple photos to create the brightest
image for the front camera which boasts
5 megapixels we used in F 1.9 lens
instead of the s5s
F 2.4 lens that lets in 60% more light
and we increase the pixel size by 43%
meaning lower light noise and better
low-light photography and that real-time
HDR I mentioned another world's first
this is the difference you will see
right off the bat to deliver a
best-in-class mobile payment solution
Samsung has partnered with major payment
networks with our innovative technology
called MST Samsung solves the acceptance
problem it's groundbreaking because MST
allows you to use mobile payments II
when a merchant only supports magstripe
it's so simple to use you swipe up from
the bezel to activate Samsung pay
authenticate with your fingerprint and
then tap it to the card reader and
you're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
