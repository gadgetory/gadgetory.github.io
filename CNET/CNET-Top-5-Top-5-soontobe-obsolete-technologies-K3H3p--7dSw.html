to the next technology the next gadget
the next app we don't waste a lot of
time getting sentimental about last
year's tech or even that thing that was
crazy hot just a month ago but at some
point you have to turn around and marvel
it all the technology that our lives
used to revolve around that are now
obsolete and I guess you're wondering
about what gadgets we use today that our
kids will only read about in history
books
assuming they still have history books
I'm Donald Bell and in this top 5 I'll
be counting down the five technologies
we use now that will soon be obsolete
starting off at number five the home
printer now maybe this is just wishful
thinking because I seriously hate these
things you plug them in over USB and
spend the next 20 minutes chasing down
the driver you try to set them up over a
protected Wi-Fi network and it's like
diffusing a bomb as we move away from
conventional computers and towards a
life where there's an always connected
screen in our pockets all the time the
compulsion to print something out at
home will disappear and that flashing
lo8 indicator will just go unheeded
until you mercifully pull the plug
coming in at number four keyboards you
laugh now but take a look around today's
kids are growing up with iPads as their
first computers and not only are they
totally at home on a touchscreen but
features like predictive text and
autocorrect are as expected as caps lock
also as anyone notice how dictations
software has become really good in the
past few years and it's now part of both
Android and iOS now you'll have to pry
my crusty keyboard from my cold dead
hands
but it won't change the fact that the
computer keyboard as we know it is going
the way of the typewriter let you throw
the mouse in there with it at number
three hard drives at least hard disk
drives those spinning whirring hard
drives that are still found in the
majority of computers these days now you
can buy a one terabyte hard drive right
now for under $80 but who cares your
music collections out on Spotify your
photos are all on Flickr and your
documents are all on Google Drive for
everything else solid-state drives are
quickly becoming the norm they're fast
and there
so the hard-disk was taken out by a
ninja but at least it will be a
relatively painless death compared to
this next guy who I think is still in
denial at number two the pocket camera
now that it's almost impossible to buy a
cell phone that isn't a smartphone
everyone suddenly has a decent camera on
them at all times and they don't really
need another one now sure the lens may
not be as great and the storage may not
be much but it's always on you and you
can always use it to blast out an
Instagram of your lunch and the time it
takes you to pick up your fork what's
sad is that there's actually some
amazing compact cameras out there right
now but unless something happens to
suddenly kill off the smartphone the
pocket camera is going the way of the
dodo bird now before we get to the
number one soon to be obsolete
technology on this list let's take a
moment of silence for the gadgets that
have recently fallen into obscurity I
still miss my Zune all right and now the
number one technology we live with today
but will soon disappear sooner than you
think
optical discs DVDs CDs video games even
blu-rays not only are we streaming and
downloading most things these days but
the big media companies would be all too
happy to stop manufacturing a resellable
disc that they can't wrap their drm
around on the plus side these things
weren't such a great format to begin
with I mean how many movie nights have
been ruined by a hairline scratch caused
by just putting the DVD on a table it's
enough to make you yearn for the days of
VHS so there you go 5 technologies
you'll be telling your grandkids about
assume you can get them to tick off
their Google Goggles and pay attention
to your old boring stories for more than
5 minutes more ways to waste everyone's
time head over to top-5 cnet.com i'm
