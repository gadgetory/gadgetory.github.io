google Isha's but this week we should
just call this show samsung alysha's
because it's really the only thing i
want to talk about now there's no doubt
after Samsung unpacked event that you've
read all the specs and you've seen all
the new tricks the note 7 can do and
we're gonna dive into every single one
but the note 7 is the most impressive
mobile device of 2016 and nothing will
come close to it in the next year now
I've always called the note of feature
freak of nature and it lives up to that
name you know I also you this show
called the Apple byte and I'm a fan of
the ecosystem but ecosystem has to do
with personal preference and if you just
strip that away the Samsung Galaxy s7
phone was the best phone of the year
hands down and now Samsung isn't holding
back at all with the note 7 now what
other mobile device has a 5.7 inch quad
HD Super AMOLED screen with HDR tech
that's only on high-end 4k TVs right now
on top of that like the great keith
sweat once said nobody babe and now i'm
not the type of person who's going to
watch full-length movies on my phone but
putting a high dynamic range screen on a
mobile device pushes the tech forward it
forces companies to do the same thing
and it's going to look amazing an apple
yeah they were getting their first oled
screen sometime in 2017 now how about
the fact that it's the first phone a
feature Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 with
better resistance to cracking from drops
that's sick the note 7 is rated ip68
water and dust resistant that means it
can last roughly 30 minutes under 1.5
meters of water but guess what so is the
s-pen you can use the s-pen underwater
if you want to and I want to test that
in my Speedos
it also brings iris scanning to the
mainstream and it looks super fast sure
it's another biometric that we can use
for security passwords bank account
access and more but again others will
try to follow it like you-know-who now I
might sound like I'm gushing but this is
the most impressive smartphone mobile
device
phablet whatever you call it that will
be on the market this year and as a tech
fan it's worth celebrating and Samsung
knows what it's doing in fact they use
their keynote
to take specific shots at the Cupertino
Fruit Company like this but don't worry
we aren't going to move to a next
generation connector and leave you
behind every node seven will come with
an adapter that's compatible with
earlier Galaxy accessories at no
additional cost see that's true and this
one do you wanna know what else it comes
with an audio jack
dang see that's the part where they
should have just dropped the mic and
just walked off stage but sometimes you
get a little caught up and then you do
this
now you can carry more than seven
thought wait wait did he just say what I
think he said now you can carry more
than seven thought that's amazing this
would be the first phone ever to have
that feature that thought about that
though okay
then he ended up correcting himself and
said 7,000 songs what a bummer it could
have been another industry-first
now the note is the truth but get ready
to open your wallets and drop 849
dollars for it early pre-orders start
this week and some carriers will offer a
deal to also get a gear fit - or a 256
gig Samsung memory card until supplies
last now that's sweet now the phone will
be available to purchase at a majority
of retailers on August the 19th oh yeah
and the new gear VR headset has a wider
viewing angle better navigation better
face padding look sleeker in all black
and is compatible with the note 7
because it has a USB C port but it also
comes with a micro USB connector that's
compatible with older Samsung devices it
retails for $99 and it's also available
on the 19th so that's gonna do it for a
Samsung alicia's this week across the
board I was impressed and Samsung is
really just gonna keep riding their wave
of momentum into the next year so what
did you all think do you love it are you
thinking I'm like too high on Samsung
