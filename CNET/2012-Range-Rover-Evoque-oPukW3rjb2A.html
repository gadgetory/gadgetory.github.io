square broad-shouldered things so what's
that badge doing on this let's drive the
2012 Range Rover Evoque check the tech
evokes one of those cars that made it
off the concept show circuit in pre
intact form this is the old lrx
we've shown you this in car show videos
for a couple of years I think and it
arrives looking a lot like that
unattainable thing on the floor it's an
audacious move by Land Rover because
it's the lightest thing that they make
the most efficient thing they've ever
made I think and it comes not just in
the 4-door we have here but also in a
coupe you better like attention to drive
one of these because people on the
street will not leave you alone the
whole Range Rover Land Rover thing is a
mess just know that at 44k base the
Evoque is the sexiest thing the company
makes and the second cheapest between
the LR 2 and the LR 4 but it's a Range
Rover on those other two our Land Rovers
though they're all made by Land Rover
whose parent is Tata and sister is
Jaguar yeah
the first thing you notice when you get
in this guy is a lot of very nice
stylish really British modern luxury
super soft materials that are really
nicely done top bottom nice brushed
aluminum finisher that might actually be
aluminium which you almost never see in
cars under about 80 grand now our evoke
has got the top pack it's kind of the
CNET package if you want to roll that
way it's $4,000 they call it the Premium
Package and that's going to bring you a
lot of technology including hard drive
based GPS navigation that is not
standard on this car somewhat
controversial eight you do though get an
eight inch LCD touchscreen which is
frustratingly inset in the dash why do
that if I go to put a finger on some of
those buttons it's almost too deep for
me to get there without contorting and
kind of intentionally digging in there a
novel and very useful homescreen they've
given you media navigation and phone
status almost like a Microsoft Windows
Metro look you get a lot in a few amount
of tiles I like that here's a button
called mode that lets me toggle between
my four basic categories of media
sources a whole bunch of button pressing
it's a whole lot better if I just go to
audio
video and direct select what I want why
would I ever roll through mode it's just
a waste of button egde if I go enter a
destination I start typing something in
every time I type a letter it does a
screen flash to black why would you do
that it's so noisy and it slows down the
execution dumb now once you get past all
this stuff when your blood stops to boil
and merely simmers you've actually got a
pretty good audio rig here it's a
Meridian brand system I find the sound
is actually pretty good
the bass rig is 380 watts 10 speakers
plus a sub all the modern sources are
here including optical disk auxilary USB
for a thumb drive or ipod as well if you
want HD radio and satellite though it's
a separate add-on those two go together
for 750 and that $4,000 premium pack is
it also brought us GPS brings us hard
drive get this they say the capacity is
10 CDs or DVDs that's like saying the
capacity is 10 PS or 10 rutabagas
completely different and the Premium
Package also brings you five surround
cameras as well as DVD playback 825
watts and 16 speakers plus a sub now
here's our selector for the transmission
this is not enough to control the
interface a lot of folks might think
that looking at it standard positions
including sport which changes your
throttle and transmission behavior then
down here you've got your terrain
response settings with a kind of bizarre
use of icon graphics I'd like these to
be in English or whatever the market
language is because these don't mean a
lot to me
this one says car this one says car
driving in the snow with a lot of weeds
this one is apparently stuck in the mud
next to a Christmas tree farm and over
here is flat tire and next to a cactus
electric parking brake control that
tells me nothing about whether my
parking brake is on or off how did that
get by the feds there's an indicator up
there buried next to the word Range
Rover but why can't I look at the button
and say car is going to roll away or car
is not going to roll away this is
controversial above me here hit the big
button huge panoramic glass roof I mean
that thing goes from here down to the
Cape of Good Hope the problem is you're
going to need lots of hope if you want
to get any ventilation out of there
because it doesn't move now under the
hood it's like a Marten and low
this reunion landrover and ford back
together again because this is Ford's
2-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost motor
that means direct injection and turbo
charging to red-hot technologies to give
this guy 240 horse 251 foot-pounds of
torque this vehicle way is an amazingly
light for Land Rover 3,900 pounds but
gets up to 60 and 7.1 thanks to the nice
torque curve on this guy and delivers 18
28 mpg the greenest lightest thing this
company makes
now one thing a bunch of us on the CNET
team noticed is you can't drive this guy
real smoothly the power is real Sergey
it's basically got a two-position
accelerator on and off I hate that
that's not to say it doesn't have plenty
of power it does that's almost part of
the problem an engine like this when
it's peaky having really good numbers is
really peaking steering's nice and tight
and precise and the whole thing feels
lighter on its feet than just about
anything else Land Rover makes or has
made that's because of the low weight
and they got a lot of that done by using
a lot of aluminum and composites in body
panels and doors around the vehicle now
one thing that little engined cars can't
get around is they make a little engine
sound when you get into them and that
can take away from the feeling of luxury
status or quality when you buy a car
like this you don't buy this thing just
on its attributes you can get most of
this in some kind of Toyota probably and
this car probably should feel a little
richer than it does at this price and
brand point and also thanks to the
lightweight and some good suspension
engineering this vehicle handles really
well very car lock luckily it comes with
a backup camera and the optional five
cameras we saw because it's got the
visibility of a Countach out the back
which is to say just about nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
