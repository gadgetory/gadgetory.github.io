show you a cheap portable way to add
music or sound effects to just about
anything the concept here is so simple
that's really more of a public service
announcement than a how-to but as of
this year mp3 players have become so
damn cheap that you can really have fun
with them in a way you couldn't before a
2 gigabyte mp3 player these days can be
found for as little as twenty dollars
and the same is true for these little
compact speakers you slap them together
with some velcro and you have a
self-contained little sound system for
under fifty dollars that can be
concealed than just about anything you
could add the thriller soundtrack to
your kids Halloween candy basket or the
Star Wars Imperial March your hand
painted vintage ad at blow this up with
new age music and use it for meditation
or finally replace the supposedly
shooting sounds from your baby's
automatic swing help for fifty bucks you
can just tape this thing to your bike
and right around like a badass until it
dies may sound simple but the key here
is that the technology just wasn't that
cheap before and now you can really have
fun with it so there you go a dead
simple way to roll your own little
low-tech sound machine I hope it
inspires you to do something fun CNN com
and Alba
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
