fortress Z water and temperature sensor
selling online for about 50 bucks of
various retailers now most flood sensors
have two or three metal probes called
leads that extend from the body when
those leads make contact with water they
detect an increased conductivity and
they set off an alarm of some sort what
distinguishes flood sensors from each
other is their details the problem is
the fortress seawater and temperature
sensor doesn't really have many of those
details it's a z-wave sensor meaning
that with the z-wave gateway like smart
things or Piper it can communicate with
you using an app it also chirps when it
comes in contact with water but other
than that it really doesn't do much
although the device has temperature
sensing hardware the feature doesn't
work with smart things or Piper two of
the biggest z-wave gateways despite
having so few features though the
fortress c earns a couple of points for
its simplicity it's pretty easy to set
up and it's one of the easiest sensors
to directly associate with other z-wave
devices direct association is basically
a process that helps you establish
communication lines between two z-wave
devices that in turn decreases
dependency on a hub in an emergency
situation these pros are pretty small in
comparison with the cons of this product
though overall the fortress seawater and
temperature sensor really only kind of
works but I really can't recommend it
except to some DIY errs who want a
really simple process for direct
association be sure to check out more of
