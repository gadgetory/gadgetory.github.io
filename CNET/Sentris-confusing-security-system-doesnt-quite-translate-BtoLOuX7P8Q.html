actually a home security system it first
launched on Kickstarter and had a lot of
enthusiasm surrounding it mainly because
it looks really different than most
security devices that we tested out
it has a vaguely tablet shape it has a
built-in 720p camera and a bunch of
environmental sensors the thing that
really sets it apart is its design again
it looks different than most security
systems that I've tested it has an
actual interactive interface instead of
just a static camera that you can't
interface with this device also has a
related Android and iOS app so you can
access live streams remotely and even
set up third-party devices including
Belkin Wemo products Philips you and
nest thermostats well I appreciate the
innovative approach the century team
took with this product it loses
something in translation most people
don't want a static device they have to
interface with just when they're sitting
on their couch they want something that
they can take with them and even though
century does offer and Android an iOS
app as well this thing costs a lot it's
299 bucks so that's a lot to spend on
this sort of secondary interface that
you probably won't use I could however
see this product working out for someone
who wants a connected smart home style
device but doesn't actually like smart
phones or smart apps otherwise I would
suggest skipping this device entirely
and focusing instead on something like
AI controls piper classic and piper NV
cameras they're very similar they cost a
little bit less and they just perform
better overall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
