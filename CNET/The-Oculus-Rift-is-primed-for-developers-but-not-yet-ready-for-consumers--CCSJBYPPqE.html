ready for VR and maybe more importantly
is VR ready for you i'm eric franklin
here at GDC 2014 and today i'm taking a
first look at the very latest version of
the oculus rift vr headset this latest
version of the oculus rift has all the
improvements we saw at CES 2014 of the
Crystal Cove version that includes a low
persistent Oh LED display and 960 x 1080
resolution for each I the external
camera now has improved tracking it will
now track if you lean your your head
forward or if you tilt to the side
laterally also at GDC 2014 oculus debut
its own tracking camera my impressions
after playing the couch nights and eval
curry for a few minutes is it's pretty
immersive experience especially if
Valkyrie I think that couch nights is
kind of a unique take on you know just
kind of a beat them up or brawler but
you know you're in this kind of virtual
environment you're looking around but
you're controlling a character it's not
a first-person perspective you're kind
of a third-person perspective of this
character but you can see your average
car who's a person sitting down in you
know in a couch and a living room
somewhere so you can look down you can
see your legs you can see your feet and
stuff like that you can actually see
your hands holding an xbox controller
that's kind of cool but you know you're
controlling the character moving around
like this kind of living room
environment you know it's pretty basic
it's not a game it's a tech demo it's
just to show like what's what the oculus
rift is capable of it was pretty fun I
think I was more impressed with Eve
Valkyrie just because it relies more on
your head movement to kind of to play
the game you know in the couch nights
demo you can look around the room and
you can see where your character is
going to see what the other character is
going but an eval courage it's
definitely essential that you kind of
look up to spot fighter jets and stuff
like that or spaceships and you know to
lock on them and fire at them it felt
comfortable to to put on my head you
know
I actually tried these the prototype of
the Sony project Morpheus and I felt
like that was putting a lot of pressure
on my nose and this one doesn't put any
kind of pressure my nose which I'm very
thankful for it was comfortable its
lights it has now has a USB 3.4 Don it
has a power button on it so this is
available for developers right now is a
development kit you can buy it for 350
bucks right now it'll ship in july but
oculus maintains that this is this isn't
something that's ready for gamers yet
this is for developers is so you know if
you're gonna think about buying this you
know you probably you know don't expect
the most polish experience they're still
working on it is still a lot of stuff
they need to figure out this not ready
for release they don't know what the
final consumer price is going to be they
don't what the finer final consumer date
of release date is going to be so you
know if you think about buying it keep
that stuff in mind once again i'm eric
franklin and this has been a first look
at the oculus rift virtual reality
headset
