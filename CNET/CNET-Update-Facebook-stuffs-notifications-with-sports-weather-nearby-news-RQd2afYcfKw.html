really personal and really busy I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
right now facebook notifications tell
you when someone liked your post or when
a friend is having a birthday but
Facebook is cramming more alerts into
the notification bar for things it
thinks you may be interested in
including sports scores for the team's
you follow and reminders about TV shows
you like you'll also see weather alerts
followed by trending news in your area
and nearby restaurant and movies to see
if you have location on and you RSVP to
an event you may also see a card
reminding you of when to leave to get
there on time does this remind you of
anything because it's exactly like
Google now on facebook each of these
information chunks are a card that's the
same terminology that Google uses
facebook says it's slowly rolling this
out to iphone and android apps for
people in the US this of course is the
first time that Facebook is copying
features you find in a smartphone
Facebook is also working on a personal
assistant called M it would let you use
messenger to ask questions and it can
complete some tasks on your behalf like
book a restaurant or get a gift
delivered to someone Facebook announced
it was working on this back in August
but as for Apple's personal assistant
Siri well she's being a bit rude to
iPhone owners that don't subscribe to
Apple music she will not answer
questions about music or what's hot
right now in the charts unless you pay
ten dollars a month for Apple streaming
music service she won't even at least
give you web search results she could be
so sensitive but you know here's a phone
that's not easily hurt Mariah's new
motorola droid turbo to it was just
revealed Tuesday and Motorola says it
has a shatterproof display look at that
it's fine saved in shatter it also has a
battery that lasts two days and it can
get a 13 hour charge in just 15 minutes
verizon has been pushing out exclusive
droid phones since 2009 and only verizon
can call them droids because verizon
paid Lucasfilm for the rights to use the
star wars droid named for its
smartphones the turbo 2 starts
payments at $25 a month and switching
from droids to drones Walmart is asking
permission from the Federal Aviation
Administration to test drones for making
deliveries to customers and parking lots
into customer homes this follows in
amazon's footsteps which has been
talking about drone delivery dreams
since late 2013 amazon has done some
small tests and so has walmart but
Walmart is looking to do outdoor tests
down with DJ I brand drones but it needs
FAA permission Walmart is also looking
to use drones as a surveillance to four
buildings and parking lots that's it for
this tech news update and there's more
at cnet com from our studios in New York
