party I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update the battle between walmart
and amazon is heating up walmart is
fighting back against amazon's prime day
it's a sales holiday it made up for
wednesday to celebrate its 20th birthday
amazon's advertising July fifteenth as a
day with more sales than Black Friday
but only prime membership subscribers
can score the deals to counter this
Christmas in July Walmart is also making
Wednesday a big online sales day marking
down prices for more than 2,000 items
but for Walmart it's not just one day
the sales online will last 90 days and
this week Walmart also just lowered the
minimum you have to spend for free
shipping now it's $35 instead of fifty
dollars amazon wants to keep you hooked
on that computer all day long because
it'll throw out new deals every 10
minutes now if you want to take
advantage of all these online deals at
Walmart and Amazon be smart don't shop
on your main work computer use a side
tablet or your phone so your boss
doesn't have evidence that you've been
wasting your day away looking at
discount TVs and speaking of televisions
this one isn't exactly what you may call
a doorbuster deal but the oled power LG
EG 9600 series has the best picture
quality of any TV we've tested and it
just dropped in price the 65 inch screen
model went from 9 grand to now 7 grand
in the US you can check out the full
review on cnet but if you don't have an
ultra cool TV like that no worries the
cable giant comcast just came out with a
new way to watch TV without needing a TV
and for fifteen dollars a month comcast
is offering HBO with a handful of basic
broadcast channels to watch live over
the Internet but the catch is that you
also have to pay for an internet service
from comcast some sad news the video
game world is mourning the loss of
nintendo president satoru iwata he died
at age 55 after battling cancer for more
than a year owatta was a unique leader
for nintendo because his background was
in programming some of the very games
that shape the company during the 80s
and 90s he worked at a nintendo
affiliate making games like kirby's
dream land for the Game Boy and super
smash brothers for Nintendo 64 he also
worked on several Pokemon titles he was
named president of Nintendo in 2002 and
during his leadership he launched
nintendo DS the successor to the Gameboy
along with the massively successful we'd
game system he often made video news
announcements on a series called
Nintendo Direct which he hosted and
often had some fun with presenting the
news most recently he announced Nintendo
would begin making games for smartphones
and tablets taking over leadership in
the meantime our Senior Managing
Directors genio Takata and Shigeru
Miyamoto the creator of Mario and other
iconic games that's it for this tech
