at CES 2015 I'm rich brown executive
editor at cnet joining me this morning
are sedo belmont from Chamberlain group
I've got robbed Martin's from leg lock
maker and over here there's Kris Allen
from I devices so thank you all for
joining us here today I really
appreciate you coming out so we are here
today to talk about home kit which if
you're not familiar is Apple's sort of
brand new Smart Home interface coming to
iOS later this year they announced it at
WWDC back in June we saw sort of one
slide that listed all the partners that
are going to work with home kit and now
we're starting to see the first products
kind of emerged out of that announcement
so I wonder if you guys can just kind of
go down the row and talk about what
products you have here that are support
home kit and we'll take it from there
sosyal you want to go first sure my name
is Seto I'm thrilled to be joining you
working for Chamberlain we are they have
expertise in the garage door opener
space and today at CES we are announcing
our Wi-Fi garage door opener which will
be home kit compatible okay Rob sure my
name is Rob Martin's I'm slegs futurist
and director of connectivity platforms
we're very excited to be announcing the
schlage sense our latest new generation
ble lock that is slated to work with
home kit and a number of other platforms
actually i'm chris allen CEO and founder
of I devices we've primarily been known
as the grilling and cooking space
developer of the iGrow and the kitchen
thermometer today we've actually
launched iDevices switch it's a smart
plug that will work with home kit in
production now will be launched in April
we're really excited about the home kit
initiative and where it's going to take
the entire industry so excited to be you
so Chris you've got the props set up do
you want to kind of go through what you
have here and what it can do sure so in
essence you have a within home kit we
developed the plug this is a iDevices
switch so you can plug in any number of
different devices to the product we have
a lamp here obviously so you can turn on
and off your lamp both locally and
remotely
so if you utilize Surrey within your
home you can connect and a Surrey to
turn on and off a lamp when you do that
it will obviously do that functionality
we have timers that you can build into
various timers false presents we
integrated a night light into the front
of the device as well one of the biggest
things that we've noticed though in the
smart home market is the setup process
and that's really what differentiates we
feel that our product within home get in
the infrastructure that Apple built
we're able to really just plug and play
the product comes out of the box you
plug it into the plug you're into your
outlet i should say and you enter an
eight digit code and automatically in
the background to the consumer it logs
it in and registers it with your network
and you're off to the races you can do a
number of different functionality with
it we also embedded both Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi Bluetooth smart in here as well as
Wi-Fi so there's some additional
functionality that we get out of that
okay so siedel my queue has been out for
a little while right and you guys are
very open do you support correct me if
I'm wrong here smart things bleeder on
the wink network a whole bunch of
different smart home platforms and now
home kit I believe it's coming to Mike
you via firmware update later this here
so if you already own one of these
there's a retrofit device you'll be able
to add the home kit functionality later
on exactly what does home kit do what
does home could get you in the garage so
with home kit we have the ability to
monitor and control and open your garage
door opener from anywhere so if I think
about the use cases I don't know how
many times you cut leave your home you
go around the back and wonder did I
click forget to open or close my garage
door opener with this product with our
new Wi-Fi garage door opener and the
integration with home kit now I don't
need to worry any longer I know right
then and there and I have that peace of
mind that my garage door opener is
closed but you can do that with all
those other smart platforms as well
right so adding a home kit is it's a
logical extension it's apple right I
think a lot of people want to be want to
be working with apple exactly and it's
about making life's moments easier and
this full integration helps us do that
what's specifically about home kit it so
there's Siri functionality right man i
think that that voice activation element
is going to me that's what's maybe most
exciting about it you know I've only
starts
sort of started using Siri for text
messages if I'm on the road or something
but saying hey Siri open the front door
hey Sierra turned the lights to me that
makes a ton of sense and I think it will
make sense to consumers when they kind
of get how easy it can be to start using
a home smart home stuff in the way
they've kind of meant to be used yeah I
think that's a that's a great point I
mean when you look at the marketplace
and when you look at you know all those
different devices being having to go
into an application and individual
applications to do all these things is a
pretty laborious process you can
probably do it faster manually to go
over and turn on/off light switch so
having the Sri integration really allows
you to say you know really just push a
button and talk to it or if it's plugged
in and charging you know you simply say
hey Suri and it's going to go ahead and
start launch that product that's really
what got us excited about it and then
being part of this marketplace same same
for safer slay our big draw was the talk
to unlock functionalities fantastic but
everybody wants to access their lock in
their home in a different ways so we try
and provide as many options as possible
and we think this is a fantastic way to
do it you want to go key you want to go
keyless you want to talk to unlock you
know you want to put in a pin code you
know we have you know a rope bug just a
really robust a variety of ways you can
access the lock and I think that's what
people are looking for they want
flexibility they want control and but
they still want that security that you
know we all expect and that's one of the
things that we're really focused on and
you know excited to be working with I
devices and Chamberlain and we kind of
almost think of it as the adults have
arrived at the party you know do you do
you want to do on a software company you
know creating your lock or do you want a
lock manufacturer with 95 years of
experience creating that you know
connected experience and so we're we're
growing our partnerships and doing that
to continue to innovate but we feel like
this is a you know really exciting time
for that flexibility so you mentioned
securities of course I'm going to pounce
all over that in particular with locks
and I think it also with garage openers
I personally like that you guys are open
because i think it and and embraced many
different smart home platforms right i
mean it makes it easier if I'm a
consumer and I just want to kind of get
started with the smart home i can i can
buy a mic you where i can buy a schlage
lock see if I like it and then not
regret that purchase later on if
want to buy something else that talks to
different network you know it's kind of
it makes it just easier as a buyer um i
would also imagine that the more
networks you support the more complex
that security picture becomes how do you
guys who has responsibility for that is
that you guys do you rely on say smart
things an apple to take care of that
picture talk me through that a little
bit well I think from our perspective
the expectation for 95 years with the
schlage brand has been strong security
and now we'd like to drive that more
towards innovation you notice there have
been a lot of new additions and frankly
disruptive messages and new companies
coming into the fold we've obviously had
a connected products since 2009 we're a
little bit conservative based on that we
want to make sure that every last detail
every last thing that we can control as
has been put in place to ensure that
expectation that levels security whether
it's a key or whether it's the
electronic means so anybody that
suggests that anything is a hundred
percent foolproof is dishonest but what
you know our commitment is to our
consumer and I know it's the same for
Chamberlain is that we're going to put
you at the very top level from
authentication encryption all the
expectations are going to be met in
terms of industry standard so just to
echo exactly what you'd said a
Chamberlain our foundation is in safety
and security we've built that into our
garage door opener space and with
connected home we're extending that into
the connected home space there is no
we're not sacrificing that safety and
security now going to that electronic
means so does that mean you guys are
coming with your own encryption or your
doesn't mean you're working together
with the various sort of networking
protocols and the various smart home
platforms out there who's bringing the
actual security tech to your products
all I'll say is it's a team approach and
we we take it very seriously and it's
kyank or to what we do if that locks not
secure if that garage doors not secure
we're not doing our job ok
fair enough so we were talking about
open before Chris yep so Mike you are
chamberlain and schlage these guys are
they work on a number of smartphone
platforms you guys have zeroed in on
home kit there we have I understand the
the launch this year probably makes that
logical and branching out from the
thermometer state or the thermometer
space you've been working in it problem
extends to pick 12 but you've clearly
picked home kit I wonder if you can talk
about that and so are your thoughts on
working with the other platforms out
there yeah i mean we're always open to
working with other platforms you know
the truth of matter is that we were we
still are grilling and cooking
thermometer company we have that
business Apple approached us last year
to be part of home kit and kind of you
know build this product out and we
latched on to that you know for us the
home automation market prior to that was
very congested and there was a lot of
different platforms that you could go on
and was very confusing to the consumer
and we felt my personal feeling was that
it was being forced integration into the
OS so whether it's Android or iOS you
were forcing that integration rather
than having come from the top down so
when Apple offered the opportunity to
create the framework within the you know
the iOS that's going to you know address
some of the security issues bring in
some I'll say organization to some of
the chaos that was out there for the
consumer that's our biggest concern is
when we launch a product want the
consumer be able to pick it up off the
shelf and know a hundred percent that is
going to work with whatever phone or
tablet they have and that's some of the
confusion that we've even had in the
grilling space and the cooking
thermometer space where you know not
every Android device had bluetooth smart
out of the gate so we had to really be
very cautious when we launched into
Android with a Bluetooth smart
thermometer because the last thing you
want as a business owner is to have
somebody buy a product get home realize
it doesn't work return it and then write
a bad review about it that's the death
nail of any business so we're extremely
focused on the user experience and
that's been our focus all the way
through it you know especially on switch
it's out of the box this thing has to
work perfectly and be very easily
integrated and that's how we feel we're
going to get broad breadth adoption in
the marketplace you know it's great to
be first there's a there's also the
caveat that when you
first there's an education process has
to go on and you can't support everybody
make everybody happy I'm not here to be
the guy that makes every single person
in the marketplace happy but anybody who
buys our product and is using an iOS
device should know that it's going to
work perfectly and it's going to work
under percent of the time and we're
staying behind it all right um so looks
like that gonna ask just to my mind uh
are you guys going to stay home kit
exclusive then is that sort of like
where you're planning your flag no I
mean I obviously for launch we're home
get exclusive we will branch out as the
opportunity arises we do have a
relationship with Google in the android
market and we're more than happy to
continue to develop products under that
we are not we're smaller company where
you know by far the smallest of the
group here with 60 folks but our goal is
to create really great products and less
of them but make sure that they're the
absolute best product that we can
develop and so to that end we pick and
choose where we're going to go very
carefully so we because we don't have
the resources that some other companies
have to kind of go in many different
directions we're very laser-focused will
say no to that so that note I think you
know you see a lot of co-op edition and
other things but what we're also finding
at schlage is the the partnerships we're
finding are extremely beneficial and
we're pulling and pushing each other
into markets that we've never been in
before so I think that's one of the most
exciting things that we're starting
already to see it CES 2015 is there are
a number of relationships out there that
are even a little bit unexpected and
we're actively looking for those too I
think that the ability to be open I'm
not saying you want to be Switzerland I
mean we're grade one security lock we
have these expectations just like
Chamberlain does with my cue but when we
can find you know companies like I
devices that have a creative innovative
core that can help us move forward and
move us into different spaces we're
going to take a hard look at that and
echoing what these two gentlemen said we
are excited at chamberlain about this
partnership as well because similar to
you our focus is relevant intuitive
experiences right out of the box so
giving those users
solutions that make their life easier
and giving them solutions that they can
use every day yeah so I'll say I've
enjoyed covering smart home stuff
because it lets me interact with
companies I never would have normally so
Chamberlain and schlage right so I I
certainly wasn't writing about garage
door openers before but it's I'm really
excited about it now maybe I don't know
uh so at a certain point though both of
you guys as sort of a state long
established companies just in-home good
space must have decided we got to get
into the smart home game how did that
how did that process happen within each
year companies what was their one
trigger or was it sort of a slow build
well I can speak for schlage you know
Walter schlage the the original founder
of the brand actually has patents going
back into the early 1900s in terms of a
light in a in a in a lock so it's it's
in our DNA but again I think what we're
focused on is the consumer and giving
them what they're asking for and what
we're seeing is we're seeing that
consumer interest like you're saying and
some other things really ramp and I
think in our case because of we have
such an important place in the home and
it's a sacred place the the you know
entrance in egress of your home is a is
a critical thing and that that's not
something that can be taken lightly we
tend to be conservative we want to get
it right a hundred percent right all of
the time then make the introduction so I
think the perception maybe at times that
you know hey these these guys might not
be innovating at the same pace in
reality we are we just need to get it a
hundred percent right that expectation
is so high it's not just the device is
going to work ninety-nine percent of the
time it needs to work a hundred percent
of the time and I Chamberland we are
focused on and worried concerned about
solutions that focus on the coming and
goings of the home and making sure
consumers have the expertise or the
experience that they need in their
everyday life and that's what we're
doing at chamberlain and bringing that
into the connected on space these are
solutions that they are looking for and
so that's our focus there
so Chris you the first home kit product
the first are non thermometer product
you come out with is a plug and it so
kind of a commodity product right i mean
there there are a lot of other smart
plugs out there i think we even saw a
couple more home kit plugs announced
this week you guys are also in
relatively mature markets here i mean
there are a lot of locks out there there
I know Chamberlain there's a leader in
garage openers but there are a lot of
other companies out there how do you so
there's a lot of exciting tech behind
the smart home stuff but the base
products are often pretty commodify
zabal how do you fight that off how do
you stay how do you stay relevant as a
Chamberlain brand or as an iDevices
brand sure I mean in the beginning we
looked at the product space and you know
you're right there's other plugs that
are smart plugs that are going to come
in the home kit market and whether we're
exactly first or were one of the first
it is irrelevant to us the really I
think what the game changer is is that
we are an established company we're
company that you can trust we have
fantastic customer service we stand
behind the product you know those are
the game changers when you look at
really wrote keeping a product relevant
in the marketplace and winning out the
market share you know our distribution
is global we have a lot of distribution
throughout North America and so we're
not just an online company but when we
looked at this we originally said wow we
got you know we're doing a plug not
really exciting but the exciting part
for us as we really researched and
looked at it is it's easy installation
no wiring no pulling off a thermostat no
you know even no offense but note taking
apart your door there's nothing else
that you have to do is just plug and
play so that makes it a very easily
attainable product for it virtually any
consumer the second part we brought in a
price point at 49 99 that's really
aggressive and that's a capture a large
segment of the market and then what we
did is because we develop everything
internally and we everything is done
soup to nuts within iDevices four walls
we really focus on the app and the
application side is really what the user
experiences
today it's great to plug in a product or
you know put in a garage door opener or
chair milana a schlage lock but at the
end of the day the consumer is going to
interact with the device through an
application so our application is really
what we're hanging our hat on and the
development of that and the launch of
that that you'll see over the next
coming months is really what we think is
going to differentiate us from a lot of
the players in the space because we're
not just a software maker like he said
we're software and hardware maker that
was born in this space and has grown
through this space and again does it all
in-house so that that's the exciting
part for us you're going to see
artificial intelligence come into the
application you're going to see a real
host of different things that are going
to blossom that will kind of surprised
the consumer at least from my devices
another thing I would add to chris's
point is hardware's really hard this is
one of the things that we're seeing
coming through you know I won't name
names but you see a lot of people that
will make an announcement and they you
know come out with something and then it
doesn't appear for a long period of time
but uh we get hardware and we get these
things and I think when you look at the
you know the iDevices product and you
start to look at ours because we we get
the the hardware portions of that allows
us to start to stretch a little bit and
so we're really focused on the style and
design of the locks as well and what you
can expect from schlage moving forward
not only the electronics crew but on our
traditional locking is much more focused
on style design and all those things
that I think consumers are you know we
we we want to have something that the
consumer lusts after we want to satisfy
that need and so we want people to start
thinking about their door we're in their
home you know bright brass isn't
necessarily hook what you know the first
impression you want to get when you when
you walk in that home and so we're
seeing not only the the tech pole but
that style pole is well and we're
excited about that that's another thing
that energizes us a similar to these
gentlemen our consumers are very
important to us they are at the
foundation of the solutions we bring
about so a Chamberlain we have expertise
in the garage door opener space we have
we have products and solutions that are
built on safety security quality and
we want to assure our consumers that
we'd bring that into the connected home
space and that's what we're doing with
all the solutions we bring all right
well thank you all for joining me we
look forward to seeing your products and
reviewing them later this year hopefully
you get some get some stuff out to us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
