first filled the GE backed micro factory
here in Louisville Kentucky this is the
Paragon induction cooktop and what this
is is a single induction burner that
comes with a sous-vide attachment that
connects wirelessly over bluetooth so
what you'd be able to do with this thing
is use it as a normal induction burner
but also cook sous vide now if you're
unfamiliar with sous-vide it's a French
term that means under vacuum you put
vacuum sealed ingredients like me
vegetables fish whatever you want really
and then you'll put those ingredients
into a water bath that's held at a very
precise temperature very steady and that
cooks things really nice and even now
because of the induction and the way it
evenly heats the pot this cooker doesn't
need to circulate the water so first
build claims so it doesn't need to stick
a fan down in and also the heating
element on the bottom doesn't need to
submerge an entire heating coil the way
ANOVA and nama COO and other stick based
sous-vide cookers will that means that
it can use other things than water it
doesn't have to be water only you can
fill this with oil and do very precise
sous-vide frying with this thing it'll
also connect with your phone over
Bluetooth you can select a recipe and
say you want to make a steak and cook it
to a perfect medium-rare you just select
the steak you're making and hit
medium-rare and it'll start cooking at
those settings automatically now the
interesting thing here is that the
Paragon induction cooktop will be coming
to IndieGoGo on February third by a
crowdfunding campaign first of all is
going to be doing this to sort of
measure the market reaction to the
product and see how demand is and see
how people feel about it and they're
gonna be kind of priming the pump with a
very nice discount on day one at a price
of one hundred and twenty nine dollars
for that first day of the campaign only
this will be one of the most affordable
sous-vide cookers that we've seen and
also a very affordable induction burner
so if you wanted an induction cooktop it
can't afford one like myself this is
kind of a cool way to get one on your
countertop and try it out after that
first day the price will go up to 249
with a couple of other early bird
discount thrown in there as well so
we're gonna be watching that campaign to
see how it does here at first build with
the Paragon induction cooktop I've seen
that's right Chris thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
