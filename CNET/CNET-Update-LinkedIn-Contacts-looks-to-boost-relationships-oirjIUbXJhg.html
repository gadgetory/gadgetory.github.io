networking skills or just draw some
doodles I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update linkedin has launched a
new app called contacts and it helps
keep track of the people you know what
they're up to and the last things you
spoke about it's as if your contacts app
also helped remind you of what's new
with the person and what you both have
in common contacts right now is in
limited release for the desktop and as
an iphone app and it pulls in multiple
dress books email accounts and Calendar
apps into one database of course if you
really want to be a power networker I
bet you'll make new contacts by buying a
cup of coffee for Apple CEO Tim Cook
it'll just cost you a few hundred
thousand dollars Cook is auctioning off
the chance to have an hour-long meeting
with him over coffee and the money goes
to the robert f kennedy center for
justice and human rights right now the
highest bidder is giving a hundred and
eighty thousand dollars that's one price
teacup joke every year in June the video
game industry descends upon Los Angeles
to attend the e3 conference to get the
first look at upcoming games and
consoles well don't expect to hear much
from Nintendo the company said they will
not be having a major showcase like they
usually do because well the wii u
already launched and they'll instead
just be doing smaller presentations on
the upcoming wii u games but there will
still be plenty to talk about at the
show with the new xbox and playstation

see some green dots next to your friends

these green dots next two names in the
news feed to remind you that you should
be messaging your friends because they
are online right now Facebook calls them

going to have to turn off but if you are
the chatting type on facebook and you
also happen to be the fitness type check

Apple devices the Apple its users

facebook with tagged photos and info
about your location and now you can
compete against friends with your
fitness goals Yahoo is trying to lure
you back to the site with free clips of
Saturday Night Live yahoo users will be
able to access a 38-year archive of
clips and performances
it's as irresistible as a land shark
with a candygram that was an obscure
reference to an old SNL skit if you
couldn't get enough of the pictionary
rip off draw something well I actually
think we did get enough of it because
most of us stopped playing it well
you're in for a treat because Zynga has
launched draw something 2 the sequel to
the drawing guessing game now players
