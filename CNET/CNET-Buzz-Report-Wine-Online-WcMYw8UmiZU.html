buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about this week
a special report on something that's got
buzzed and gives buzz wine on the
internet
young hipster types are drinking more
wine these days according to the wine
market Council wine consumption among
the Millennials was up forty six percent
in 2008 which makes sense because a huge
chunk of them probably turned 21 in 2008
but still they're starting young and
consumption among Gen Xers was up 23
percent overall wine consumption up
sixteen percent beer was down seven
percent and spirits were down 15 so wine
it's a thing and if there's a thing out
there and young people are doing it you
can bet the Internet is involved and it
is from wine social networks and there
are many to multiple wine-related online
shows to wine iphone apps wine online is
where it's at in fact Gary Vaynerchuk of
wine library TV has people buying wine
via Twitter with his wine library daily
feet oh and he got a book deal a big one
wine is more accessible more available
more hip and more dot-com e than ever
before so I thought what better way to
dive on into the world of wine online
then to strapon my booth and shoes and
head over to a little party called wine
two point oh
so i'm here with smoke wall and who's
the chairman of 120 and i really have
one major question what is two point O
about wine what is two point O about
wine a trick question so once all right
so if your point is that for about 5,000
years humans have been drinking wine
what's two point O about it is today we
have all these different tools and ways
to connect and learn about wine on the
web its social networks and we have
thousands of new wineries that didn't
exist five years ago so the combination
of the new technology and the new
wineries great the 20 aspect so now what
do you think is the most promising
technology in terms of you know building
wine awareness that kind of thing I
think really just the the social
networking right now the social media
that's out there is giving the small
wine producers the ability to do
anything and connect with anyone
anywhere the scale of that type of
marketing is better than anything that
they could pay for
so I'm a guest of host here of cnet
smoke Wallin with point2 foam and we're
going to do this blind tasting so I
thought we would oh I'm going to hook up
the camera woman I'm sorry so here we go
what are you pouring Laura I have the
best Bloody Mary mixes in the world and
everyone tonight is agreed with me they
don't know where to go but but Laura
it's a wine tasting
so you have a Bloody Mary there that's
awesome it's very good
so at what point did it make sense to
you to let someone else take over your
show I think it was about the fifth or
sixth glass of wine actually it's my hop
in there yeah
oh yeah I think I still have a headache
from that party I love wine on the
internet and that's the bus report for
this week everyone I'm Molly wooden
thanks for watching this is smoke with
wine 20 and I've taken over cnet TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
