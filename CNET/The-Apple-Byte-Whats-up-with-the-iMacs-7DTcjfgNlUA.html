the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple let's get to
the show and the number one question
many of you have been asking what's up
with the imax now we're expecting them
before the back-to-school season with
all the new Ivy Bridge processors and a
new report from how to arena says their
supply chain sources say they'll be
refreshed in the June July timeframe
which really isn't a surprise but it's
the first outlet to make such a claim
now a rule of the rumor mill is to give
yourself two months so it falls
somewhere in there now a recent digit
times report also claims that g-tech
optoelectronics is working with Apple on
anti reflective glass for the next gen
IMAX we saw the sunflower inspired IMAX
with a matte screen Apple's made it a
build-to-order option for macbook pros
and it's a welcome request for many
users now more news abbott ron is a
company with an app called air display
that allows you to use your ipad as a
second monitor it's really cool stuff
but their new update has revealed Mac OS
10 s high DPI support that stayed hidden
because they currently do not have
high-resolution retina displays for
desktops that support it now it's
supported through the app using the new
iPad as a monitor but it also is a
nugget that hints we might see a high
DPI retina like display for max in the
future with built-in OS 10 support
already existing and what about those
mac pros are we going to see them again
now i predicted this year would be the
last but after talking to a couple close
sources of mind they've really made me
believe we will not see Mac Pro's this
year and moving forward now it could be
completely wrong in alone up to it if I
am but all indications from my side tell
me the Mac Pro is dead now what's the
latest with the Apple TV well don't call
it that if you're jefferies analyst
Peter me sec who's been totally wrong in
the past but still gets paid to do his
job he's calling the product get ready
for it the I panel because it's far more
than a TV he says it's a display a
gaming center media hub a computer a
home automator even and he sure
knows about these features for a product
that doesn't even exist now he says it
will retail for 1250 and it will go on
sale by the end of 2012 all right you
guys have heard of a popular game called
draw something that's really taking over
your life but drawing with your finger
isn't all that it's cracked up to be so
let's check out this how to tip from
Donnell bell for creating your own
stylist touch screens offer an awesome
and simple way to navigate and interact
their tablet or smartphone except when
they don't when it comes to detailed
control something like drawing or
writing it can be really useful to have
a pen but not just any pen will work
since it's not a matter of pressure but
an issue of electric conduction you can
buy a compatible stylist for as little
as five dollars but what if you need
something right now well in this scene
at how to I'm going to show you how to
make a touchscreen pen that's
essentially free assuming that your boss
will look the other way if you raid the
supply closet so here's what you'll need
you'll need a pen a paper clip and a
sponge now make sure that the pen is one
of those that you can pull apart you
also need 3 tools pliers scissors and a
drill first step pull the pen apart and
remove the ink cartridge keep it around
though you'll need it later next slice a
little rectangular wedge off of the
sponge you're going to be squeezing a
chunk of this through the barrel of the
pen so make sure it's small enough to
get in but thick enough to stay put any
sponge should do as long as it has a
little moisture in it and you can always
test it out by using it directly on your
screen next step drill a hole into the
pen barrel the hole needs to be big
enough for the paperclip to get through
now shove the sponge through the barrel
so that pokes out of the tip then put
the pen back together and finally
flatten out that paper clip and poke one
end of it into the hole that you made
just so that is jabbing the sponge and
then wrap the rest around the barrel so
long as your hand is in contact with the
metal it'll carry an electric charge
through the sponge and to the screen now
won't work of the sponge is completely
dried out though but a few drops of
water should get you back in business so
there you go a DIY capacitive style so
you can use with any tablet or
smartphone it's not pretty but the price
is right it's easy to customize
and you can make one in just a few
minutes see look guys with my own
stylist I'm able to make amazing
drawings like this all right thanks
Donald now back to the stories news
broke that over 600,000 max were hit by
a flashback trojan taking advantage of
an old java vulnerability so just in
case you use a mac it doesn't mean
you're totally safe and over half of
those infected were in cupertino and
twenty percent of them are in Canada
Apple is finally responded with their
own Java patch but they were slower to
respond because the big a likes to
release their own patches it's available
now so get on it now on some cool
patents from Apple a new application
found by Apple Insider shows off what's
described as active electronic media
packaging now it would be an active
packaging system that supplies power and
data to devices wirelessly with an RF
power transmitter and allows them to
show and display content while in the
package pretty crazy stuff there also
everyone wants to know what's going on
behind the scenes of Cupertino and
according to an antec Apple has been
working on an internal project to bring
a physical game controller to market to
complement the new ipad now other
companies have made products that
address this but a wireless and seamless
Apple implementation could be pretty
sweet especially with the improved
gaming performance the iPad delivers but
right now it's a dream and if you're
dreaming about 7-inch iPads daring
fireballs John Gruber says that a seven
point eight five inch iPad does indeed
exist in Apple's labs running at the
same 1024 x 768 resolution as previous
iPads so who knows if they'll release it
but if enough of you ask for 7 inches
you might get it I don't know Brian for
10 inches alright that's going to do it
for this we show send us your emails to
the apple byte at cnet com i'm brian
Tong thanks for watching and we'll catch
you guys next time for another bite of
the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
