interested in a budget laptop that also
happens to be big and has a touchscreen
and doesn't cost too much money then
maybe you'll be interested in this the
asus vive book s500 CA which is $6.99
and less depending on where you buy it
what's nice about this laptop is its
reasonably attractive it's pretty well
packed with specs and again it has that
nice capacitive touch screen but you are
giving up a few things in this package
one it's got not that big a difference
in specs from what you'd get on an
ultrabook some sort of thin 13 inch
laptop and this is thinner but it's
really not ultra portable this is 4.8
pounds and this thing is big in a
15-inch laptop you kind of expect maybe
a DVD drive or Nvidia or AMD graphics
something like that there isn't any of
that there's a Core i5 processor 6 gigs
of RAM 500 gig hard drive it's a hybrid
hard drive those aren't bad specs but
you do see them on thinner laptops to
the screen on this is 1366 by 768 on a
15.6 inch screen that's low res for this
screen size it's fine if you want to do
any basic application work or even
watching videos looks pretty good for
pictures for photos for text you can see
the pixels you can definitely do better
it's not bad and 3 the battery life on
this not so great four and a half hours
which is not horrible it's not fantastic
it's certainly not fantastic so it's
enough to get you through a good chunk
of the day but if you have to be asking
those questions and when you need to
plug it in well their laptops that last
longer also the fact that there's no
backlit keyboard here do I sound a
little ambivalent about this laptop sure
because this probably isn't the laptop
that I'd want to buy but there are
people who do like the idea of just a
sheerly large screen resolution
notwithstanding you saw those things
being sold a while ago laptops and the
budget end that are big boned and don't
really have specs that are that exciting
but hey you got a big laptop the
speakers on this do sound much
than average so if you like good sound
there is that and if you want to get
something in the $600 range again that
has touch you can't always get something
in that price consider this but know
there may be better solutions on the
horizon
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
