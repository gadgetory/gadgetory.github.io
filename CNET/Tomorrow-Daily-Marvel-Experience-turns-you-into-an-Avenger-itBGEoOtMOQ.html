enough to be checking out the Marvel

which you get to be a part of shield and
you get to be a part of just hanging out
with all the Marvel characters there's
really cool technology as well as those
characters interacting there's a are
there's connect they're using all kinds
different technology to give people this
sort of really interactive and high-tech
experience which is exactly what you
would expect from marble how did you go
about choosing what you were gonna put
in each dome you know there's so many
different types of media there's so many
different ways to to present the content
we wanted to keep ratcheting it up a
level with each new dome so you start
with a screen you go to a dome
projection you get to this main dome
with a dozen unique interactive elements
and then there's a 360 degree
holographic dome coming up that you
haven't seen yet kale there's a motion
ride there's a there's a Hulk moment
that I'm not going to spoil for you and
a bunch of other things that are a lot
of firsts here at the Marvel experience
interactive video experience where you
stand for the neck and then
some in your favorite adventure by just
doing something like this
I brought an Ironman

good job when you first get started

this is probably the coolest thing we're
gonna see all day and then they just
keep going it was quite an experience
