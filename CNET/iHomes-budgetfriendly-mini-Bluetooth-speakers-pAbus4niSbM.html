for cnet.com and I'm here with the ihome
IDM 8 portable bluetooth speaker this
one looks a little bit like the top of a
microphone it's got a bulbous design you
can be placed anywhere in your house and
it does deliver pretty loud sound for
what it is it's not terribly clear but
you can stream from your smartphone or
your tablet to this device from about 30
feet away there are volume controls on
the speaker itself but you probably just
want to set that to a fairly high volume
then control the volume from your
smartphone or tablet there really isn't
that much else to this speaker it does
have a rechargeable battery in it you
charge it be a USB and that USB cable
has a 3.5 millimeter jack on it so you
can plug into a non bluetooth-enabled
device and get sound into this speaker
apart from that it doesn't deliver
really great sound but for a lot of
people it'll certainly be ample it's
decent for its size and this is only
about sixty dollars retail so it's a
pretty decent deal I do like the step-up
model the IDM 11 that model has a
built-in microphone so it has
speakerphone capabilities and it sounds
slightly better this one however is a
little bit easier transport because it's
round while the IDM 11 is square if you
don't like this one in black it does
come in red though I do prefer the black
version but that's really all there is
to it that's a quick look at the ihome
ID m8 portable bluetooth speaker i'm
david carr nguoi thanks for watching
