I have google glass recorded and Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
google really wants you to love the idea
of wearing a computer on your face by
that I'm talking about the google glass
prototype that has been talked about for
a long time now to court you into
craving one google keeps making promo
videos for it even though it's still not
an actual product you can buy and it
probably won't be something you could
buy until 2014 the latest video gives us
a hint at how you might use it you'd say
ok glass to turn on the voice commands
followed by another command to record
video or take a photo the video has a
bunch of creative ideas for wearing a
camera to show point of view action
it's something people do now with a
GoPro but this glass is of course much
lighter and easier to wear the video
also shows that the glass can launch a
live video chat hang out but who's to
say that it will appear is clear to our
eyes as it does in that video this is
just a concept and frankly doesn't mean
a thing to me until we can see how it
works for ourselves it's just more hype
google began selling a few prototype
models to developers for fifteen hundred
dollars and those developers will get
them sometime this year but if you want
to judge it for yourself google has a
writing contest where you can win a
chance to wear a prototype if you
explain why you should be on the
creative testing team but yes still got
to pay fifteen hundred dollars and pick
it up in person the evolution of Yahoo
continues as the site unveiled a new
homepage design that borrows on the
concept of the social media feed yahoo
now shows an endless list of news
articles to scroll through and it's
customizable based on your interest and
what your friends are sharing if you
think the new blackberry 10 predictive
keyboard features are cool then you
should check out the new version of the
swiftkey app for android swiftkey learns
how a user types it predicts what you're
most likely to write next it's all with
the goal of making you faster and more
efficient at typing and in the swiftkey
for upgrade users can now hold their
figure on the keyboard and drag it to
different letters it's kind of like
swype but they call it swiftkey flow and
you can mix it with regular touch typing
you also don't have to lift your finger
to write a whole sentence by including
the spacebar swiftkey gets more accurate
the longer it's used and if you give it
access to your email and social media
profiles it can better learn the way you
write if you're bilingual like my
friends who type in Spanglish it can mix
up to three languages in total it
supports 60 languages it's in the Google
Play Store now on sale for two dollars
and it's normally four dollars that's
your tech news update you can find more
