that the Samsung Galaxy Note seven has a
tendency to spontaneously catch fire but
it's only after months of investigating
that Samsung is opening up about why the
recall phone was overheating and it
turns out it all comes down to poorly
made batteries specifically there were
two separate battery defects one in the
original batch of note 7s and another in
the replacement units to understand what
exactly went wrong you have to
understand what's inside a lithium-ion
battery it may look like just a thin
square but inside it resembles something
like this snack-cake thin layers of
positive and negative electrodes are
folded up like a jelly roll with a super
thin separator keeping the positive and
negative layers from touching if for any
reason the folds aren't all just right
and the layers get squished or if it
touch boom you got a short-circuit and a
phone on fire according to Samsung the
original batteries were a bit squished
in the upper right corner and the tip of
the negative layer curved over
additionally one of the ends was sitting
in the wrong spot of the fold the second
set of replacement batteries suffered a
different problem these came from
another supplier and in the rush to pump
out replacement batteries quickly the
manufacturer was sloppy and the
separator was punctured
leaving the layers touching in some
cases there was even some insulation
missing inside to solve the mystery of
the exploding phones Samsung created a
special facility to test more than
200,000 phones and more than 30,000
batteries Samsung also worked with three
independent testing agencies but now
Samsung faces a bigger mystery will
customers trust the brand again here's
the take from CNN executive editor roger
chang who spoke with samsung executives
so i think they're taking the right
first step in being as transparent as
possible they're really going into
detail over sharing on exactly what
happened to both the first and second
batch of note sevens i think there's so
long road ahead of them when it comes to
building back that credibility with
consumers to catch future mistakes
samsung said it is implementing
additional safety checks for batteries
such as beefing up the stress tests and
x-ray exams
and charging and discharging the
batteries on a large scale the upcoming
Galaxy s8 and note eight will also go
through these tests that's right Samsung
is continuing the Note brand with a new
one believing that there are enough
loyal fans who will give the phone
another chance for Sienna I'm Bridget
