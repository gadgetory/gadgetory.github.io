it's crazy it's expensive it's painfully
complicated but if you invest the time
and effort it's also extraordinarily fun
I'm talking about the HP omen X compact
desktop which we're using for the most
extreme form of virtual reality that's
strapping a full gaming PC to your back
attaching a headset and exploring the
amazing worlds available in VR without
being tethered to a computer sitting on
a desk this entire rig which includes
the computer the desktop dock and a
backpack with batteries is $3,000 you've
also gotta add your own VR headset and
those are now three hundred to six
hundred dollars if you have the
floorspace to take advantage of it this
is a very different experience than
traditional PC VR where you're always
moving around gingerly afraid of getting
tangled up in the cables or even pulling
the desktop or laptop off the desk yes
you're lugging a 10-pound backpack
around and the batteries only last an
hour or so but the padded straps help it
from feeling too heavy this is so much
lighter than the laptop I slept in this
morning which is a gaming laptop the
weight is kind of distributed on my hips
so doesn't bother me it's kind of like a
hiking backpack of sorts it actually
feels pretty light although I will say
maybe it's because I'm not super
experienced in VR that I still am
hesitant to walk around and there's an
extra set of batteries that you can keep
on the charging dock and hot-swap as
needed it's really great in both
exploration games like the Talos
principle as well as action games like
Goran we used HP's own mixed reality
headset but it also works with the HTC
vive there's even a workaround to play
steamvr games on the HB headset although
it's not a hundred percent reliable yet
the biggest issue we ran into is that
the entire setup is just so complex and
so early in its life cycle that is often
some level of troubleshooting involved
to get everything working right and even
just going from the doc desktop mode to
backpack
requires an extra set of hands the
better keep your friends around because
you're basically gonna need one to act
as your VR caddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
