Note 7 had overheating problems the
battery may have been packed in the
phone too tightly Samsung has yet to say
what it thinks the reason is for the
exploding phone fiasco that caused the
company to recall all notes seven phones
but a manufacturing engineering company
named instrumental found something
interesting when they took apart the
phone the battery had no physical room
for error with multiple potential risk
factors that could result in a fire if
anything went wrong for one a phone
battery needs to separate the positive
and negative layers the engineers
believe the separators may have been too
thin let's not forget people sit on
their phones and that puts strain on the
frame the researchers said that kind of
pressure would be enough to break a
polymer separator causing the positive
and negative to touch and then BAM pants
on fire you got yourself an exploding
phone also when batteries are charged
they swell a little engineers usually
give about ten percent extra space to a
battery but there was hardly any extra
space for the note 7 so you can theorize
that in an attempt to push the
boundaries to make things thinner with
better battery life maybe Samsung was
too aggressive in trying to be
innovative in the report the researchers
wrote Samsung took a deliberate step
toward danger and their existing test
infrastructure and design validation
process failed them they shipped a
dangerous product for more tech news and
advice on phones to buy that don't blow
