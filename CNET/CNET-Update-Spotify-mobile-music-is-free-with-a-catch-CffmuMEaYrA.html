free on your phone I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update Spotify the
mobile app has been set free no longer
do you have to pay $10 a month to stream
music on the Spotify apps for iOS and
Android you can listen for free with ads
the tablet version works just like the
desktop version it lets you handpick
specific tracks you want to listen to on
demand but there's a catch with the free
smartphone app you have to listen to
your songs as a random shuffle
you can't pick what you want to listen
to Spotify also announced that Led
Zeppelin's catalogue will be exclusive
to the service you know Spotify is in
need of a whole lot of love it still
lags behind Pandora and subscribers even
though it's available in more countries
than Pandora Dell is joining the Google
Chromebook Club with the Dell Chromebook
11 which is not to be confused with HP
Chromebook 11 that came out a few months
ago both of which have 11 inch screens
and run the Google Chrome operating
system Dell is focused on selling its
model to schools more than 5,000 schools
now have Chromebooks in the classroom
they're designed for doing most work
online and with Chrome apps that makes
it a good secondary computer for
families this Dell Chromebook will be
priced under $300 H piece Chromebook
costs 280 dollars but it was pulled off
shelves in November which was a month
after its launch due to a problem with
overheating charger cords you may
remember earlier this year in March
Facebook showed off a redesigned
newsfeed where everything was huge on
the screen including photos status
updates even advertisements and you
could switch between viewing different
types of posts like you could just view
recent updates or just photos well it
turns out most of the 1.2 billion users
still have the old layout and it may
stay that way Facebook has been
monitoring the small fraction of users
that have the new design and apparently
Facebook didn't like what they saw
according to a report from All Things D
a source says Facebook is going back to
the drawing board if you're not the
Christmas cards
a person but you still want to send
holiday greetings to your friends you
could do so with the help of Google and
Santa log on to google.com slash Santa
tracker to help Santa send a personal
voicemail to your friends which can be
shared via Google+ or on email the
messages can be silly or sweet and Santa
will even say your name that is unless
your name is Bridget apparently he
doesn't know how to pronounce every name
so I had a pic-a-nic name I think I'll
leave Santa a book of names next to his
milk and cookies this year that year
