was a big deal they cost hundreds if not
thousands of dollars and promised the
best image quality you would ever see
now people bought cats spending just a
hundred bucks or one and are waiting for
the next big thing 4k as we count down
to the release of 4k blu-ray at the end
of 2015 we're in this weird holding
pattern that leads to blu-ray players
like the BD PS 5500 and 109 dollars this
still counts as a budget player and it
offers a lot of cool new features the
best is PlayStation now connect a
PlayStation 4 controller and you have
access to Sony's game streaming service
while it costs extra to rent games it
makes his play a pretty good option for
a den or holiday house yes 55 is pretty
bare-bones otherwise with a nondescript
design and only an eject button and
power on the front no play button or
display to be seen you will need the
remote control for this one but one of
my favorite parts of the play is its
redesigned interface instead of the old
XMB and it's really long list of apps
you now have access to everything you
need from one page it's much easier to
use picture quality is as excellent as
you'd expect and even better than the
sony models from last year and the
ability to transcode audio from DTS to
Dolby is of a great help to people who
own sound bars well it's now technically
the company's flagship the S 5500 is not
the best player Sony could possibly make
the one feature it misses out on is dual
core processing which in this
predominantly streaming world cuts the
wait time on Netflix for example to mere
seconds without it this performs
similarly to other blu-ray players at
the price but can't hold a candle to a
Roku player while this machine will
likely have competition from Samsung
this year at $109 u.s. it's a really
good deal this is ty Pendlebury for
