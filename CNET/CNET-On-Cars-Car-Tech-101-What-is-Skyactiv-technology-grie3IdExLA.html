and compresses the air fuel mixture to a
much higher degree than you normally see
in a production gas engine car up to 14
to 1 ratio which gas engines don't
normally approach that's actually
verging on diesel levels of compression
what's the big deal well you get a lot
more out of that bang when you do that
so you make better use of the fuel and
you get more power on the other hand
there's a huge downside high compression
engines want to predetonate or spark
knock in other words combust before the
spark plug even goes off that causes all
kinds of problems with power durability
and efficiency of fuel use so what do
you do first of all they've created a
very interesting exhaust architecture
where these long exhaust runners carry
the hot gases away and blend them
farther from the engine that's good
because one cylinder firing out hot gas
doesn't burp it into an adjacent
cylinder which a lot of other designs
will do secondly they're using a Hemi
head design you may have seen our video
on what Hemi engines are all about it's
a hemispherical dome in the head and a
hemispherical piston that goes up there
to fill it really compress everything
they're doing that but they also have a
little well carve down in the top of the
piston which allows them to contain some
of the detonation before it takes over
the whole cylinder and finally they're
using direct injection which a lot of
carmakers are doing but that has a lot
of benefits here it gives you very
precise fuel metering so the gas isn't
there until it really needs to be and
can't blow up early and because it's
injected right into the cylinder the
gasoline is cooler because it didn't
have to run down a hot intake runner and
a hot intake port on its way to the
cylinder that also helps prevent
detonation until the spark wants it to
happen
bottom line mazda claims a 15%
improvement in both fuel efficiency and
torque using SKYACTIV but remember
the typical gas engine only rings about
30% efficiency from a gallon of fuel
wasting the remainder has dissipated
heat so 15% better than that isn't
exactly game-changing but it helps also
the sky active cars that are sold in the
US will have their compression ratio
dropped to a still lofty thirteen to one
a concession being made so we can feed
them regular gas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
