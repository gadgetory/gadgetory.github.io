and welcome to road warrior will we take
a look at the hottest gadgets for life
on the go
coming up we've got a way for Google
Calendar to text message you a sneak
peek at Microsoft Word 2007 and a
literally hot ultra-mobile PC but let's
start with the rough and tough Olympus
Stylus 720 SW we'll greenwald shows you
how it keeps working great
even in up to 10 feet of water it is
special gaskets ins various doors made
of rubber so that when you drop this in
water it keeps water out it also has an
internally zooming 3x optical zoom lens
so no matter how far you zoom in the
lens mechanism stays inside the camera
body the body itself is a sturdy metal
it's built to take a fair amount of
beating you shouldn't go smashing it
with a hammer but this will take the
occasional drop and the occasional silk
it's also a 7 megapixel camera so your
pictures will look great when you throw
it in the ocean if you're on the go you
need your calendar everywhere and if you
have Google Calendar you can have
reminders sent right to your phone
Veronica Belmont shows you how one of
the handiest parts about the Edit event
details is that you can set reminders
for when your events are occurring that
way you can get it by email or pop-up or
by text message I think text message
makes the most sense because if I'm on
the go I'm not going to be sitting by my
computer so to do that you just enter in
your phone number and then what carrier
you use and of course Google Calendar is
available anywhere you have access to
the World Wide Web
next up another one of those origami
devices Microsoft was so hyped up about
this one is the tablet kiosk AOV 7110
Michelle Thatcher was a little
disappointed by it also notable for
what's supposed to be a portable media
device is the fact that there's only one
tiny speaker in this lower right-hand
corner and the sound is actually pretty
tinny it's it's just not a good speaker
for watching movies and just using it
over the last few days I've noticed that
it actually
it's really warm which for a handheld
device is kind of a deal-breaker
on the other hand could make a nice hand
warmer during the winter finally Elsa
Wenzel gives you a sneak peek at the
forthcoming Microsoft Word 2007 it's
kind of psychic you'll notice that the
major changes include a ribbon on top of
the page that organizes your features
into clustered tabs this ribbon is
dynamic so it's designed to anticipate
your next move and surface the features
that apply to your task at hand you can
find more video of office 2007 features
as well as sneak peeks of Windows Vista
right here at cnet.com well that's it
for this edition of road warrior I'm Tom
Merritt check back next time for more
gadgets to keep you armed and dangerous
