passcode simple four-digit passcode or
more complex one if you want this is
something you do dozens of times a day
to unlock and get access to your phone
unfortunately some people find that's
too cumbersome and they don't set it up
in fact in our research about half of
smartphone customers do not set up a
passcode on the device and they really
really should that's why the team has
worked so hard on a brand new technology
to make this easy and fun to do and it's
called touch ID touch ID uses a key you
have with you everywhere you go your
finger or more specifically your
fingerprint which is unique to each of
us it reads your fingerprint at an
incredibly detailed level that's because
of a brand new sensor called the touch
ID sensor it's a touch capacitive sensor
it's super thin 170 microns thin
that's just thicker than a human hair
yet it's very high resolution 500 pixels
per inch it scans through the outer
layers of your epidermis right to the
inner live layers to get a better image
of your actual fingerprint it can teach
it about more than one finger if you
want maybe use it right-handed and
left-handed and no matter what what
orientation used to train it you can
turn your finger and don't have to worry
about it because and read it any
orientation but probably one of the most
brilliant things the team did was where
they put this new sensor right into the
home button that we use all day long
this is really smart the home button
still has a tactile switch just like
before so it works the way you're used
to but it also now includes the touch ID
sensor around it is the stainless-steel
detection ring so the sensor knows when
to read your fingerprint just by the
fact that your fingers on the button you
don't even have to click it on top of
its protected the sapphire lens it's
hard it also provides a better image
down on the touch ID sensor
now touch ID has been built deeply into
iOS 7 the team has made it really fun
and easy for you to teach your iPhone 5s
about your fingerprint and once you do
you can simply touch the home button to
unlock your phone and it's something
that's a joy to do all day every day and
levon always and since its built in the
team's also figured out how to use it to
make iTunes purchases which of course
has a different passcode but you can
just use your same finger to
authenticate music applications books TV
shows and movies all with just a touch
of your finger it wouldn't be a killer
apple technology without a great video
to tell us all about it
iPhone 5s is almost refined iPhone to
date it is meticulously designed
engineered and crafted but it's the
remarkable innovation inside the iPhone
5s that sets a new precedent it's not
just rampant technology for technology's
sake every single component every
process has been considered and measured
to make sure that it's truly useful and
that it actually enhances the users
experience this care this consideration
extends to how we protect all of the
important information that you actually
carry with you on your iPhone it's what
led us to create touch ID your
fingerprint is one of the best passwords
in the world it's always with you and no
two are exactly alike so it made perfect
sense to create a simple seamless way to
use it as a password with just a touch
of your home button the touch ID sensor
quickly read your fingerprint and
automatically unlocks your phone
you can even use it to authorize
purchases through our stores for music
movies TV shows apps and books setting
up touch ID to recognize your
fingerprint is easy and every time you
use it it gets better at meeting you
print it can read multiple fingerprints
and read them in any orientation the
technology within touch ID is some of
the most advanced hardware and software
we put in any device the button itself
is made from sapphire crystal one of the
clearest hardest materials available
this protects the sensor and acts as a
lens to precisely focus it on your
finger the steel ring surrounding the
button detects your finger and tells
touch ID to start reading your printing
the sensor uses advanced capacitive
touch to take in essence a
high-resolution image of a fingerprint
from the sub Pepa dermal layers of your
skin it then intelligently analyzes this
information with a remarkable degree of
detail and precision it categorizes your
print by one of three basic types arch
loop or world
it Maps individual details in the ridges
that are smalls in the human eye can see
and even inspects minor variations in
Ridge Direction caused by pores and edge
structures touch ID uses all this to
provide the most accurate match in a
very high level of security all
fingerprint information is encrypted and
stored inside the secure Enclave in our
new a7 chip here it is locked away from
everything else accessible only by the
touch ID sensor it's never available to
the software and it's never stored on
Apple servers or back to the iCloud
touch ID defines the next step of how
you use your iPhone making something as
important as security so effortless so
simple
we believe that technology is at its
very best at its most empowering when it
simply disappears so that is touch ID
the third of our four thinking
technologies in the iPhone 5s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
