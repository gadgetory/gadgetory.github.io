I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update the first Wii U game
consoles win on sales Sunday following a
midnight launch event at the nintendo
world store in New York City fans lined
up for days braving the cold weather to
be among the first to get the new game
system which has a touch pad controller
it's been six years since we've seen a
new game console and anyone getting a
wii u this holiday will need some
patients before playing you see there's
a required five gigabytes system update
that can take over an hour or two to
download but don't touch it or turn it
off once you start the update you may
have the urge to restart it because it
takes so long but you have to let it run
if you lose power or internet connection
mid download it could kill the system
and you have to exchange it for a new
one at least that's what some users are
reporting on Twitter out of the box the
way you can play games but you need the
system update to use the new features
like the miiverse social network the
eShop to download games transferring
data from your old original wii games
access to netflix and hulu plus as well
as the internet browser more TV features
will be available as another update
coming in December in other news AT&amp;amp;T
has doubled its 4G LTE coverage area
this year 18 tues faster network speeds
are now offered in 103 markets in the US
but Verizon covers 440 markets it had a
long head start before the other
carriers Christmas is canceled if you
use Google's people app this contact
manager app which is available for users
with the new android 4.2 jelly bean
operating system is missing the month of
december let's hope google isn't a
Grinch and fixes that bug soon our
review is in for the samsung galaxy
camera the camera with a giant HD screen
on the back with an android operating
system built in so you can share your
photos and movies on the go with the
same apps you would find on a phone it's
photo quality is no better than an
average point-and-shoot and the battery
isn't great but at five hundred dollars
without a dataplan you might find this a
tough sell but you will be getting
better photos than on a smartphone with
the perk of being able to share it
immediately
social TV apps for checking into a show
have been growing in popularity and one
of the most popular ones get glue has
been acquired by viggle for about 53
million dollars in cash and stock these
apps are part of the second screen trend
where you talk about a show on your
tablet or phone while watching TV vical
will keep get glue alive and oversee
both apps a unique Park of Viggle though
is that users can earn gift cards for
using the app that's your tech news
update you can find links to all of
these stories on the blog sina com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
