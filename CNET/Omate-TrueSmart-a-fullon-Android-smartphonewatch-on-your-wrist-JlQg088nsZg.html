make a phone call from your wrist I know
there are a lot of wrist watches that
claim that but I mean seriously a phone
call from a phone on your wrist a
wristwatch phone that takes SIM cards
Micro SIM cards 2g and 3G oh did I also
say this runs Android 4.2.2
it's got four gigs or eight gigs of
storage it has Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS it's
water-resistant it has an IPS display
yeah oh and a 720p video camera built
into the bottom I'm talking about the
ohm a true smart and this is on my wrist
right now there's a Kickstarter campaign
watch that has been slowly trickled out
and is being trickled out to people who
have been campaign contribution tribute
errs to it but what the prices is not
exactly clear but this is a watch that
is very real and we have one here at
CNET and I'm checking it out and let me
tell you I've never seen a watch this
fully featured before I don't know if
you need or watch this fully featured in
fact I'm pretty sure you don't but it
definitely stands as a testament to how
a full-featured truly independent
SmartWatch can exist right now it has
its own little charger doesn't have any
plug in USB to ensure that it has water
resistance and you control everything
through this touch display but you can
run Google Play on it for instance which
does not work on this model but they
claim you will be able to connect to it
I was able to sideload apps that were
sent to me via Gmail I was able to
install applications like Spotify I was
able to run Twitter on here and send
tweets including photos from this watch
and of course make phone calls
although the phone call quality wasn't
always that great this does have
Bluetooth 4.0 so you can connect the
headset why would you want to do this
that's a very good question
you probably don't want to but imagine a
future where you have a standalone
device like this pair to other wearables
that you've got on you maybe Google
glass maybe pivothead which is a
wearable camera that's trying to work in
connectivity to this because this is a
full Android SmartWatch it can act as a
hub that may sound complete
crazy but maybe crazy is what's needed
now and wearables I don't know what had
ever used this for but the fact that I
was able to pair a Microsoft Bluetooth
keyboard to it and start typing tweets
on my watch made me feel ridiculously
geeky and also pretty damn cool at the
same time I have to admit the hardest
part about using a watch like this is a
screen this small I felt like I was
committing microsurgery taking a look at
some of the small font sizes and trying
to swap swipe around and do things on
this now some apps may take advantage of
this size and start building
applications that feel a little more
tuned to this screen we'll have to see
it's a Kickstarter project so you never
know where it's gonna go
but it's up and it's running we'll have
to see how the battery life performs and
this certainly bodes interestingly for
where the weird world of wearable tech
is gonna be heading in 2014
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
omate true smart completely smart
standalone SmartWatch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
