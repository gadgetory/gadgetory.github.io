a Fiat 500 a name it's a totally
different vehicle in every other
respects it's wider it's bigger and
heavier it's taller there's more
interior space there's nothing small
about this 500 L but it still got the
heart of a tiny car under the hood let's
pull over and I'll show you what I mean
now under the hood you'll find one of
the few things that the 500 L shares
with the standard Fiat 500 and that is
its 1.4 liter multi air turbo engine now
that 1.4 liter engine is the same engine
that you'll find under the hood of the
Fiat 500 turbo and the 500 Abarth here
we're looking at about 160 horsepower
and 184 pound-feet of torque which is
not half bad for it a vehicle that
weighs at about 3,200 pounds now that
weight puts it a little bit heavier than
for example the Mazda cx-5 but it's got
a little bit more power as well so we're
expecting better acceleration from this
vehicle maybe not as good handling power
is either gonna go through a manual
transmission or in this case a 6-speed
DCT transmission that's a dual clutch
automated manual so you're gonna get
manual efficiency with automatic
convenience the EPA reckons that in this
configuration the 500l is good for 24
miles per gallon city 33 on the highway
and a combined average of about 27 miles
per gallon that's not bad for a big old
vehicle like this let's hop into that
and see exactly how spacious it is
now when you hop in the driver's seat of
the Fiat 500l you realize that well
there's a lot of space in here and
there's also a lot of visibility one of
the best features of this vehicle is
that you get a lot of greenhouse glass
big wide windshield these sort of
between the a pillar windows and this
huge $1100 power sunroof all of that's
gonna work together to create a bright
and airy feeling and that's kind of the
whole point of this vehicle you got a
lot of space for people and your junk
now we're talking about cabin tech you
kind of know that out of the box is
gonna be a pretty sparsely equipped
vehicle when on fiat website they're
talking about how great the power locks
are fortunately we do have cabin tech
that's been upgraded with the $1700
UConnect infotainment system now this is
straight out of the Chrysler parts bin
it's something that the Fiat Chrysler
partnership kind of brings to this brand
our navigation is going to be powered by
Garmin even though you won't see a
Garmin logo anywhere on the infotainment
system but the way that the maps look
and the way the menu structure is
organized is straight out of Garmin
portable navigation device as far as
audio sources we've got USB connectivity
we've got an SD card slot an auxilary
input right down here at the bottom of
the dashboard you've also got radio and
satellite radio with available audio
sources one thing that you will not find
in this vehicle is a CD or DVD player
slot fee and Chrysler have completely
digital pickle drives though if you've
got physical discs lying around you're
gonna want to rip those to a USB Drive
or something before you hit the road
audio is gonna come through in this case
an optional beat audio system that's the
same beats by dre that you see on
everyone's headphones the system's also
been optimized to work with digital
audio so those of you who are worried
about losing that CD drive can know that
the stereo system has been optimized for
compressed digital audio also part of
that UConnect system is going to be
bluetooth connectivity if we pop in here
we can see that we're paired with our
phone that's gonna also include audio
streaming from a paired device and if
you get a text message you can actually
view the message on the system right
here and if you're driving you'll get a
pop-up that ask if you want to listen to
it
take the speech and then reply with a
can response courtney parem word to the
wise don't rent a car in the hood now
it's got a small cars engine and small
car power 160 horsepower in a vehicle
this big isn't really a ton to have a
lot of fun with the big vehicle also has
a lot more weight and mass to kind of
move around but from where I'm sitting
in the cabin a lot of the 500l size is
just empty space that you can fill with
people and things the suspensions gonna
be a McPherson front situation up front
and a torsion bar suspension in the rear
with Coney shocks that's the name brand
it's kind of interesting to see that in
a vehicle without any sort of
performance cred but the Fiat 500l
doesn't really feel like a performance
car as you go around corners there's a
lot of body roll because the mass is
really high and I'm pretty sure that all
this glass up top isn't doing anything
to help that
okay let's price this 2014 Fiat 500l the
500l is gonna start at nineteen thousand
one hundred ninety five dollars at the
entry point
but this trekking model has a couple of
additional creature comforts and styling
upgrades it's gonna bring the price up
to about $22,000
however as tested we're at twenty six
thousand eight hundred and forty five
dollars and that's because we've got a
couple of options that you're gonna want
to consider when choosing your 500l the
first is this $1100 power sunroof and
let me tell you if you're looking at the
500l and you don't get this sunroof why
are you even bothering it's one of the
best features on this car we've also got
the Beats Audio system that's a $700
option on this trekking model and that's
going to give you really bass heavy
audio if you're into that sort of thing
and for early adopters fee it's gonna
toss in its premiere package that
normally runs you one thousand seven
hundred and forty five bucks now that
package is going to include the
touchscreen UConnect navigation system
the rear view camera and Park Distance
system it's included here at no
additional charge but even if you don't
get it for the freebie it's definitely
worth the money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
