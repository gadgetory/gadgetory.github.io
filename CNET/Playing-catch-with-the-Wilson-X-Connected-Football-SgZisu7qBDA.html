even smart sneakers and now smart
footballs this is the Wilson X connected
football and it can measure your throw
speed your distance spin rate spiral
efficiency and whether your buddy
catches you or not you would never know
that this is a smart football that's
because it looks and throws just like a
normal football and despite having
built-in sensors it's the same size and
weight of an NFL ball now unlike some
other smart sports gear we've seen this
football never has to be charged before
it starts recording you have to hold it
vertically for two seconds and then turn
it upside down to enable the sensor this
helps preserve battery life which will
last about 200-thousand throws or up to
500 hours of connected usage the ball
comes with a wrist leave for your
smartphone which gives you quick and
easy access to plays and stats mid game
but the sleeve only comes in one size
and unfortunately it doesn't fit bigger
phones like the iPhone 6s plus or Nexus
6p the Wilson app has five game modes to
choose from there's a basic warm-up a
precision mode and elimination challenge
and a final drive and gameday mini games
after each throw you can look down on
your wrist and see stats on how far or
how fast you threw the ball you can also
see how you stack up against other
people on the wolves and X leaderboard
overall I had a lot of fun testing the
ball and I think it's a good buy for a
young quarterback who wants to improve
their game or people like you and me who
just want to have some fun and see our
stats but there is a downside and that's
the price the ball costs $200 which is
$100 premium over Wilson's and available
