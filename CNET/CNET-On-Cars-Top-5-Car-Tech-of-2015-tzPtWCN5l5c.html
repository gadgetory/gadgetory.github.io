regret the minute I do it because there
are so many important technologies
breaking out in cars in the year ahead
that choosing just five as an errand
only a fool would do Here I am
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five car
technologies to watch takeoff in 2015
here's my hunch number five
fuel cell cars now these are not gonna
be big volume by any stretch but they
will be big headlines Toyota just put
their Mirai fuel cell car into limited
production and Honda is gonna be hyping
up the intro of its new one in 2016
consumers are no longer blown away by
the idea of a battery electric car
interesting owning one seems to have hit
a natural and rather low plateau at
least until we get a battery
breakthrough that replaces the hours
with minutes in the meantime hydrogen
fuel cell offers a tantalizing look at
the future
number four integrated connectivity I
mean 3G or 4G built into the car it's
gonna be a big story in 2015 some car
makers will do it kind of a lame way and
use it primarily to create a hot spot in
the vehicle as GM largely does and it is
gonna do in big volume but others will
tie it more directly into the car's
dashboard services and apps the way-out
II and Hyundai are doing it makes a car
more like your phone who's not gonna be
into that number three dash cams now I
could be wrong and this may remain
famously our Russian thing but the
interest I've heard from you in the past
year in dash cams along with the fact
that we finally have some big names
entering the game along with the fact
that our roads only seem to be more and
more of a lawless hell every year adds
up to more than a hunch number-2 driver
assists
things like blind spot lane departure
and forward collision tech are nothing
new but next year we'll see two big
trends around them to help save you from
your own lousy driving one affordable
cars will get these technologies much
more commonly because keeping safety
tech on just the high-end cars it's kind
of a bad message from car makers and
we'll see them swing to being mostly
active technologies not so much passive
warnings that's part of the march toward
autonomous cars before I get you to
number one
safer airbags may be a big innovation
next year this Takata airbag
recall is a fiasco that is still
blossoming as we end 2014 but auto leave
of sweden recently won awards for a new
kind of airbag inflator that uses
hydrogen instead of what is basically a
little rocket motor like other airbags
do you see problems with humidity and
that kind of inflator or what caused
many of these Takata airbags to blow so
wildly and create a recall they can't
even make enough parts to repair our
number1 tech to watch next year has to
be apps still fairly rare in 2014 but
look at Volvo which is going to start
installing a suite of them in every car
starting with their mid 2015 onward by
the end of next year it'll seem like an
auto mission to find a new vehicle that
doesn't have some built in services like
Pandora Yelp or live search for
destination also 2015 is the year that
many car makers now say they will
actually put apple carplay and android
auto into production making up for all
those blown promises of doing it in 2014
luckily Pioneer and Alpine beat them to
it in the aftermarket more top 5 lists
to wait the car lover go to see net on
cars calm click on top-5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
