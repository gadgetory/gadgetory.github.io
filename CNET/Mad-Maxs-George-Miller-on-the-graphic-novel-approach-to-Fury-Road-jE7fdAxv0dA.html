chase but there's method to the madness
in Australia for the graphic festival at
Sydney's Opera House director George
Miller spoke to CNET about how a graphic
novel approach brought depth to the
destruction george miller thank you for
speaking with CNN thank you
it seems with this film you kind of
threw out the idea of scripting in the
early stages and instead chose to do
three and a half thousand storyboards to
create the idea of the film kind of in a
graphic novel style does this mean it
heart you're just a really big comic
book nerd I was always a comic book kid
I mean when I grew up in the country in
Queensland
I never require listen comics you
couldn't take them to school your
parents thought you somehow something
was wrong with you if you really comics
rather than reading books and so I
always loved comics and this movie
itself the original idea was for it to
be an extended chase and in many ways a
silent movie with sound we're trying to
tell as much story as possible purely
with vision so the obvious way to
approach it was to do storyboards and I
worked with three storyboard artists and
the King one and designer was Brendan
McCarthy and he was a graphic novelist
and a very very fine artist and we
worked ultimately Nicola therus who's a
dramaturgy an actor came it came along
and we dug down deep into the subjects
but essentially its first iteration was
an extended storyboard which is the
perfect way to get information across on
an action movie because people can see
see exactly what's happening at any
moment and it's just a blueprint it's
it's not the final thing okay so if you
if you're painting a comic like
spider-man you might not have any
limitations were there any limitations
when you're creating these from that
kind of graphic novel style base when
you have to put it onto film was there
anything you couldn't do
well we couldn't defy the laws of
physics this is not a superhero moving
there flying man no spaceships or
anything like that so it basically told
us how to make the movie we had to do we
went old-school there were real vehicles
and
real people and real crashes in a real
desert and that the essential image the
first image that we captured was always
real
there was no CG there but everything
else was a augmented by CG and then we
were able to use the technology that we
normally couldn't in the past and erase
it in CG so it had elaborate rigs on
actors and stunt people so when there
were the vehicles were hurtling through
the desert people could be kept safe
that was Tom Hardy upside down between
the big wheels of the big Waring you
kind of mechanized mechanized the human
characters in it and the machines have a
life of their own how do you create a
human story under such a thriller
high-octane explosive it could have just
been a bullets and guns and explosions
film but it's clearly not what involved
in the story helped to build that up
well you try to create as much iceberg
under the tip a coma for instance even
though he appears only briefly
throughout the movie I know who his
mother was
I know how he survived the apocalypse I
know how a man who's blind and mute and
really can only play the guitar how he
actually survived and got to be where he
was is the equivalent of the drummer the
bugler the bagpipe player you know the
music of war but it had to be upgraded
to account for all the noise that
happens with all the vehicles so that
happen with everything and not only with
you know like Max's mask which is a
garden hoe or taking that guitar it's
it's a hospital bed pan at the base of
the basement every vehicle every every
steering wheel was kind of in a sensor
or most a religious artifact and we had
to understand it's basically found
objects repurposed the one thing I will
say about a movie like this it's
basically visual music so the vision has
primacy you try to tell the story almost
like a silent movie with sound
and that's why we said about it and
that's that's a point of difference in
the movie the trick was to see whether
or not that all that subtext could be
read by the audience it's something that
moves so fast from storyboard to cinema
on the fury road george miller will
appear at the sydney opera house on
october 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
