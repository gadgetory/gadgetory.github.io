there your crown just lost its luster
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Foursquare has a new spinoff app
it makes it easy to find friends nearby
see what they're up to and send a quick
message to make plans
it's called swarm and you may find this
to be useful if you're a social
butterfly or looking for popular things
to do near you the big focus around
swarm is to share your location with
friends even if you're not using the app
it can share the general neighborhood
that you're in but if you want privacy
you can turn that off
swarm also helps you get together with
friends with a new feature called
planning you can announce plans to hang
out and see if anyone else wants to join
you the rules of being crowned mayor
have also changed you no longer are
competing against the whole Foursquare
community to become mayor of a place by
checking in the most now you just have
to beat out your friends for that title
and that certainly makes it less
impressive the Maine Foursquare app is
said to get a redesign later this year
to put more of a focus on ways to
discover places rather than swarms focus
on people
Foursquare could have just put all these
new swarm features in its existing app
but app makers are starting this new
trend of dividing up their services as a
new way to grow we've seen Facebook try
to chisel out parts of itself into
smaller more focused apps and now
Foursquare it's doing the same but in
any form it wants to be your travel
companion app just like Trip it and
OpenTable all three of which are now on
Google glass the glass version of
Foursquare is supposed to let you check
in with a voice command and find a place
nearby that matches where you are but
you're probably more likely to just take
out your smartphone to customize your
check-in the same goes for open table
I'm not sure how it's any faster to make
a reservation at a restaurant through
the glass window instead of your
smartphone
TripIt shows a quick outline of your
day's itinerary which may be helpful if
your hands are full and you just want to
quickly glance up at what time the
flight is leaving there are other ways
glass is probably more helpful for
travelers take the word lens translation
app and chose translated text of
anything at
cameras pointing at so you could just
look around at nearby signs and see what
they mean in the screen above your eye
now if only the battery would last
through one day of sight seen one area
we don't hear much about is games for
glass well the world one day get a glass
version of flappy bird for now you'll
just have to settle for a multiplayer
version the creator of flappy bird told
CNBC that he's bringing this terrible
game phenomenon back in a new
multiplayer form and it could be out in
August
