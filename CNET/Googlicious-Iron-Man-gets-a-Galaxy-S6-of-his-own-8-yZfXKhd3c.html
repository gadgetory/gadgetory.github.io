Google issues for everything Google that
we can pack inside of a show so let's
get to the stories and we start with
Android lollipop adoption that's finally
starting to gain some momentum nearing
10% of androids user base now it's not
nearly as significant as other platforms
but it made a big jump from 5% at the
same time last month 29.7% now one of
the obstacles holding it back the super
slow rollout more devices are finally
getting the update with the Nexus 7 from
2012 and 2013 and the Nexus 10 but the
current Nexus 9 flagship tablet still
nothing all right a Sam mobile report
says an upcoming 5.1.1 update for the
galaxy s6 and s6 edge will bring new
features to their camera app the report
says the new update will add support for
the full Google camera API on lollipop
including features like shooting in RAW
and the option to control the shutter
speed which the s6 line is currently
lacking now the HTC One m9 and LG g4
both have those features they also
report the galaxy note 5 is still
expected to launch in the second half of
the year codenamed noble internally at
Samsung it's expected the next flagship
Note will also bring these features and
possibly add even more now if you're a
Marvel fan and a Samsung fan you might
want to wait just a little bit before
you get your next phone after report
from the Korea Times says the Korean
giant will release Ironman versions of
the s6 and s6 edge in partnership with
Marvel now check this out they look
pretty sweet the idea is to help promote
age of Ultron which really needs it
since it just scored the second-highest
opening ever for u.s. box offices the
first one the first Avengers movie now
there are already marveled themed
wallpapers home screen icons and
ringtones that you all could get right
now as well and sam.bubble also reports
that samsung will be announcing the
Galaxy Tab s2 8.0 and nine point seven
inch screen versions in june there will
be for various with the two screen sizes
we mentioned and a Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi LTE
version they are expected to use metal
in the frame this time around and
feature the latest 64-bit Exynos
processor with a 2048 by 1536 resolution
google recently announced that new
custom voice actions are now rolling out
and will allow you to say special
commands with okay Google that can
launch specific apps like NPR or you can
ask it to show you attractions near you
using the TripAdvisor app it's really
their way of using their killer voice
recognition and plugging in
functionality with third-party apps for
a better experience meerkat has made its
way onto Android now they are still
saying it's in beta so don't expect it
to work perfectly but it has been able
to beat Twitter's periscope to the
Android platform and I know a lot of you
are tired of the whole may the fourth be
with you thing it's over we're done with
that but if you're still a fan that
can't get enough of your Star Wars fix
try using the Google app which can out
answer questions about Star Wars
characters and it will pull information
straight from the Star Wars databank
online you gotta try it
because it's pretty slick alright that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
always email us at Google issues at
CENTCOM or tweet me at Brian Tong and
I'll respond when I can thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time for
some more of that Google Isha's Google
