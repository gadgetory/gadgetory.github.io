others are less skilled but advances in
wearable technology may offer hope for
the hopeless like me this sleeve is
embedded with sensors that can boost
your basketball game we can actually
model how the ball is gonna you know the
trajectory of the ball as it leaves your
hand the wearable device was developed
by vibrato technologies a spinoff from
Carnegie Mellon University the goal is
for you to shoot more consistently and
have good form to do that the sleeve
uses three sensor modules one on the
bicep a second on the forearm a third on
the back of the hand little small sensor
nodes each sensor node has a 3-axis
gyroscope 3-axis accelerometer and a
3-axis compass and so that can very
accurately detect where it is in space
using that data a speaker built into the
sleeve provides immediate feedback a
buzz signals poor form but after a good
shot there's a victory tone a companion
app drills into the data further telling
you the exact angle of your wrist the
height of your arm and more we're gonna
do is say the one thing you need to do
is work on gain that wrist through or
the one thing you need to do is keep it
elbow in we want to give you the one
concrete thing that'll make you a better
performance vibrato says all athletes
whether kids are pros stamped benefit
it's already tapped youth basketball
coach Derek Thompson to test the
technology his take the sleeve is a slam
dunk and experiences is off the chart I
have muscle memory now of course
basketball also requires solid if not
fancy footwork so vibrato future plans
include a leg sleeve as well as a full
body suit that would work for other
sports the sleeve is expected to cost
around $200 and start selling in late
2014 I'll just put my hoop dreams on
hold when in San Francisco I'm Sumi das
