snarling Jaguar makes it's the 2012 jag
xkr-s let's go take a very speedy drive
and check the tech
now spotting an xkr-s is easy one it's
the best-looking Jaguar in over a decade
I'm normally not a big fan of taking
cars designed for grown-ups and sticking
body kits on them but somehow this one
works if you miss all of that just come
back here and notice the carbon fiber
wing
first thing you got to get past is the
weird sort of schizophrenia inside this
cabin it's not entirely technical like a
brawny track car nor is it luxurious
like a Jaguar should be it's a weird
hodgepodge and god I hate 2-tone seats
especially when they're faux racing
seats that's just a weird mixed metaphor
okay let's go to the main event this
head units is all stock here and I'm
just about ready to declare it the worst
interface in any car north of $30,000 a
few examples it's got needless animation
why do things fly in and out that adds
nothing except delay to the experience
secondly speaking of delay if you go and
turn let's say the volume knob over here
that'll adjust the volume and then a day
later this goofy animation shows up on
top of what you're already doing and
generally speaking they don't use enough
real estate too much is wasted on kind
of letterbox bars here and there and
those menus flying in and out your audio
sources are am/fm no HD radio satellite
radio or CD slot here bluetooth
hands-free calling of standard bluetooth
streaming is not available that's kind
of a key leave out whatever you're
listening to comes out of a one choice
only 525 watt Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins audio
system this is the drive selector that
they use on Jags these days it's this
rotating knob here's a button here for
their competitive or dynamic modes you
can get yourself in trouble and kill
yourself the dynamic mode does the usual
stuff it sharpens throttle response
raises shift points backs off stability
control a whole bunch and really let's
that blown engine speak to the street
more clearly
arian beats the heart of a predator this
is the five liter supercharged
direct-injected v8 that pushes this
thing in crazy numbers of horsepower and
torque 550 horse 502 foot-pounds of
torque it's this fully two-ton coupe up
to 60 in about 4.2 seconds while
delivering 15 22 mpg is good enough to
avoid a gas guzzler tax this Jags
AJ 133 motor gets its extra power from a
revised exhaust system and attended fuel
mapping changes along with the use of
Eaton's latest twin vortex supercharger
it's the same one used in the corvette
zr1 and cadillac cts-v both of which
left us stuck to the seat back
now all the tackiness of this cabin and
hatefulness of that head unit fades away
very quickly in just a few steps push
the start button turn that knob to s for
sport mode hit the dynamic driving mode
right there and just for kicks let's
take off the traction control shall we
all right like curry on a Friday night
and strawberry blondes overwhelming
power seems to be a very British thing
when they do a high-performance car it's
so much power you don't even think about
summoning it it's just sort of always
there it's an interesting comparison to
the 2012 Carrera s we have it right now
which has tremendous power and is 0 to
60 and about the same time but the power
comes on in a more requested way whereas
here it never fades away that car's got
a 3.8 liter naturally aspirated engine
this one's got a 5 liter blown motor
both cars get to 60 in about 4 seconds
and they both cost around the same in
very rough numbers so what's the big
difference
wait this Jags got around 700 pounds
more on the hook than the little portion
however this jag is imminently livable
in its own way first of all it's got an
automatic transmission six feet as I
mentioned compared to a lot of cars in
this class have a 7-speed DCT for
example both are really good at high
performance the DCT is better on the
track because neither you go there a lot
but this 6-speed automatic when it's
done right like this is a better
everyday transmission to live with it's
happier around town it's happier when
you're driving to work and poking along
or just doing more normal driving it
doesn't make any weird clunks or bonks
when it's down around low speed DC tees
are still kind of rough in that way and
I think it's a huge testimony to the
engineering on this motor as well as
what he has done on this new generation
TV S blower and that there is so
immediate a power delivery of what
appears to be the fat spot of the torque
curve all the time
it all goes to that whole idea of
effortless overwhelming power that's the
Sigma Chi again this car
okay twice into Jiang xkr-s is real easy
for ting one is not this is $132,000 car
with precious few options at least in
terms of tech you can replace this
engine cover with one made of carbon
fiber for two thousand dollars and be a
real tool or you can spend $4,000 to get
what they call the bright kit which puts
back all the chrome they took off to
make it look like this
