of crave that we got for you we're here
at the san mateo fairgrounds for the
maker fair 2008 where it's everything do
it yourself so let's check it out now
this is a statue that has been welded
and it's pretty impressive but honestly
I can do much better let's show em how
it's done oh man that's really bad okay
I'll try this one more time I couldn't
see I mean I maybe should not quit my
day job huh you know it takes practice
well done oh dude honestly I was totally
off my egg I don't know what's going on
shoulder sore I gotta shake this one on
let's go walk around now behind me we
have two massive machines the subjugate
er as the manipulate tricks where they
tear apart members of the audience and
the next show supposed to be at 4pm I
think I'm not gonna stay around for this
one over to make refer there's so many
different diverse products it look aah
the top one
all right I'm here join with Lindsay
Lawler the trader of the electric
giraffe what was the inspiration behind
this thing well we got this little toy
model from Japan and we looked at that
and said well can we make that bigger
can you show us maybe a few of the ways
that people can interact with the
giraffe itself one of the things that's
happening right now is we've just added
these USB cameras into his eyeball so
he's actually seeing in broadcasting
right now out on the net what he can see
and then up here we've got little touch
sensors and you touch him and he knows
when you're touching him with these
little piezoelectric sensors now what do
you feed the giraffe a little green
lettuce with numbers on it this is this
is what he needs I also eat the same
thing if you'd like to feed me that I'm
totally down with that I like that we're
here at the special effects section of
the mega fair and behind me we have
things like electronics there's also
animatronics and even movie makeup I
mean I don't see what's so special about
everything you know holy could you tell
us about what this brainwave machine
actually does simply put it induces
meditative States in the brain all right
well can I get a try these things sure
this is like a ray of times 10 not that
I've been a rape and now it's time for
the tech that I crave the most the
machine that makes funnel cakes so we
bounced around the make-up air saw a
whole bunch of cool stuff and also we
didn't forget all you crave lovers for
those of you sending us in your
one-liners for the keyboard pants keep
doing it will announce our favorite
