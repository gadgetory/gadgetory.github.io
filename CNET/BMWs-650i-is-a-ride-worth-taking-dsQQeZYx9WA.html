bonus and go buy one of these
that's right BMW 6-series in this case
the 650i with the twin-turbo motor but I
wouldn't have touched one with a
ten-foot paycheck until they fix the
styling and to my eyes they did that so
let's get in and check the tech now the
6 Series has always been a nice place to
sit and be a rich guy but I think even
more so now they've recast the cabin and
this is a signature BMW thing now this
fixed very generous display that is
mounted as if it was a pop-up but it's
not and very high in fact the midline of
that display is actually higher than the
midline of your main gauges and that
screen is going to display a lot of base
tech as you can imagine in a car of this
tier navigation is standard of course
Bluetooth hands-free is standard even
though BMW tends to nickel and dime you
on certain tech one of the technologies
I like the best though is in that nickel
and dime category make sure you get the
BMW apps option for a cheap 250 bucks
allowing you to have Facebook Twitter
streaming radio it's really cool it's
iPhone only it goes in this dock see our
BMW 328i video we just did for a
complete tour of the connected stuff
going on here and their apps integration
without optioning you get am/fm HD radio
optical CD slot right here no DVD
playback as well as an aux jack now to
go beyond that basic setup of inputs and
get better sound you option premium
sound it's about 1800 bucks
it gets you logic 7 amplification and
speakers 7.1 is the arrangement and you
also then get USB plus iPod here in the
console as well as satellite radio with
a year of activation and if you want to
go even further than that logic 7 audio
upgrade go for that thing on the top but
looks like some kind of a little gun
port about to shoot yeah that's part of
the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio upgrade 3700
bucks all by itself part of an overall
speaker array they say gives everyone in
the car no matter where you're sitting
equal sound dispersal now this cars also
loaded up with a lot of driving
assistance you're seeing a blind spot
detection system and the lane departure
warning you can defeat those obviously
this car is going to let you know if
someone's in your blind spot indicator
right there in the mirror or it's going
to vibrate the wheel if you're drifting
okay now the real crowd-pleaser is I
saved the best for last this is an
optional technology here that puts a
camera package to work if I press it now
while I'm sitting here still I get kind
of a fisheye cam it's two cameras but
they're looking completely out left and
right from the front of the vehicle then
of course I've got the standard backup
cam when I go in Reverse and check this
out I can also get an around view cam
that shows sort of a God view of the car
the rear camera lives under a needlessly
clever motorized trunk badge I bet that
will be cheap to fix when it jams
now normally luxo status cars like this
or automatic transmission all the way
but this one bases with a six-speed
manual even with that big Harry v8
that's unusual
you can option this 8-speed sport
automatic with the paddles here on the
wheel for no extra cost
650i on the backhand means a 4.4 liter
v8 on the front end with direct
injection and dual twin-scroll turbo
that does four hundred horse and 450
foot-pounds of torque to get this
two-ton coupe up to sixty in a tick
under five seconds while delivering
decent mpg of 15 23 or 22 if you get the
automatic keeping the burden on this
powertrain low as possible our aluminum
hood and doors with plastic fenders and
trunk lid and aluminum subframes front
and rear that four thousand pound curb
weight is actually something of a
victory the kind of power this car
delivers is not violent you could tune
it that way if BMW chose to with those
kind of numbers you certainly could but
instead it comes on as this inexorable
force that fits the character of the car
really well I think they've got this
8-speed automatic really well program
where I'm not sure I'd ever go for a
manual on this car I think this is gonna
make you very happy now the way these
drive modes work I describe them like
this comfort Plus is soft cushy ride at
least by BMW standard it isn't very soft
and cushy at all comfort is normal
sports is what you would expect it'll
tighten up the chassis transmission and
accelerator behavior and Sport Plus
takes it one more level it turns off
track control and has all the sports
settings this cars really enjoy to drive
because it has so much power which tends
to erase weight which it does have a
fair amount of but most importantly
perhaps is BMW has almost entirely
dialed turbo lag out of this engine you
never find it at least not discernable
on top of the automatic there's a
certain amount of vagary in an automatic
gearbox and you can't detect any turbo
lag least I can't
beyond that bit of filtering the driver
assistance package also includes self
parking now BMW carefully couch's this
feature in language that makes it clear
they do believe purchasers of the
ultimate driving machine do know how to
drive and park
okay 650i is not a cheap car of course
eighty-four grand base with delivery
here's what I'm not gonna auction to it
to keep it well below a hundred cuz that
comes up pretty fast on this car I'm
gonna skip the driver assistance package
I don't need the lane departure the
blind spot to head-up display all that
stuff skip it I'm also gonna blow off
the bangle Olufsen sound at $3,700 I
don't pay that for sound anywhere let
alone the car I will spend 250 on the
BMW app support so it's just premium
sound for 1700 and apps for 250 bucks
that's a must do if you're watching a
video on this website
