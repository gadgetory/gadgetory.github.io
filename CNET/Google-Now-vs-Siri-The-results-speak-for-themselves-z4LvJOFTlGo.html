reaching more devices we know it's got
its eye set on Siri Apple and Google are
investing a lot in voice commands and
want it to be one of the go-to features
on your phone today I'm pitting Google
now against Siri to find out which one
is the fastest most accurate and offers
the richest experience I'm using the
Samsung Galaxy s4 and the iPhone 5 I've
also muted both of these phones so that
these girls aren't talking to each other
while we run these tests so let's start
by asking some simple questions ones
that both of these apps should be able
to handle no problem what's the weather
like in Houston not bad what time is it
in Tokyo Google was faster where is the
nearest Italian restaurant Google was
way faster all right did the Giants win
last night Siri is a lot prettier but
they both gave me good results how many
cups are in a quart
Google was way faster and part of that
is thanks to these cards that are coming
from the knowledge graph Siri for the
record uses Wolfram Alpha
now those questions required now in Siri
to pool data but let's see what happens
when we ask a few harder questions that
ask them to do things that really
integrate with the phone send a text
message to Chris Parker are we still on
for tonight
question mark okay Google was a little
bit faster but do note that it will
require me to tap that and then send the
message here I can just send it right
away
set a timer for 30 minutes
okay so both of them were pretty quick
but the advantage on Siri is that the
timer starts right away
remind me to water the plants at 4
o'clock pretty good launch Pandora so
Pandora launches right away on the
iPhone but takes a few seconds on thus
for let's try to play a song play your
love by Nicki Minaj
so series starts playing the song
immediately and Google tries to show me
some search results so I can play it
somewhere like YouTube even though I
know I have that song on my ass for
let's try another go to facebook-dot-com
so series giving me search results for
facebook.com and Google now actually
took me straight to the website which is
super useful now let's try checking
email check email Siri gave them my
inbox and Google gave me search results
for check email which is completely
useless
so now let's crank up the heat and ask
some questions that will really put
these guys to the test show me photos of
the Eiffel Tower
okay Siri shows me where the Eiffel
Tower is and I actually got Google photo
search results here in Google now how
far away is Los Angeles so series shows
me where Los Angeles is on the map and
if I tap it I can figure it out but
Google now actually showed me how far
away it is five hours and 48 minutes
make a reservation at Wayfarer tavern at
7:00 p.m. so since Syria has open table
integration I can actually make a
reservation straight from the app Google
now on the other hand shows me a maps
card for wafer Tavern and I probably
need to call the restaurant and make the
reservation myself let's try another how
tall is Barack Obama so I got much
faster results on Google now and let me
show you something else I know now can
do that Siri can't where was he born so
as you can see Google now is referring
to my previous question and showing me
where Barack Obama was born now if I try
the same thing on Siri this is what
happens where was he born Siri has no
idea who I'm talking about because she
doesn't have that conversational element
let's try another question how do I say
hello in Japanese
nice both of them give me translations
and now I know how to say konichiwa
let's try another schedule an
appointment with Bonnie Gannon at 5
o'clock p.m. okay so the iPhone wants me
to select the right email I'll do that
cool schedule the appointment but
actually it looks like it didn't select
Bonnie as a participant of the event the
way Siri did so there's a strike against
Google now but I'll save the appointment
anyway now I want to try something else
cancel my 5:00 o'clock p.m. appointment
cool
so Siri is helpful I can actually cancel
it right from here I'll say yes but
Google now gives me search results for
canceling an appointment now after this
quick test it's obvious that Siri and
now each have their own strengths for
finding information quickly and
efficiently Google now easily beat Siri
but for productivity and getting things
done Siri is a winner
obviously you can't get Siri on your
Android phone but if you do want to try
Google now on your iPhone you can get it
through the Google Search app Siri and
Google now are being updated and
improved all the time so definitely
expect some of these results to change
it's only a matter of time before we'll
have them Duke it out once again for
