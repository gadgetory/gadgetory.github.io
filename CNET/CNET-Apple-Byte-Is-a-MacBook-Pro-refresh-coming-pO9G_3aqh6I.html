song here and welcome to all the good
and bad inside the world of Apple plus
we have a macbook air giveaway at the
end of our show we're sticking around
for now I'm a little beat up with all
the iphone 5 talk that's dip and a heavy
coating of rumor sawsan I know you are
too so let's make a promise if I say I
phone after this point in the next two
minutes Jim the cameraman will
discipline me okay all right deal now on
to the show with new toys in a new
report from Apple Insider that claims
Apple is preparing a refresh of its
macbook pro line for this year ahead of
the holiday shopping season according to
their sources the late 2011 refresh will
bring marginal speed bumps but no new
design or major changes until next
generation core i series processors are
expected to be ready in the second
quarter of 2012 that's over six months
away and the last update was at the end
of februari what's the chance I see this
happening very strong now more product
news the big a is expected to start
shipping a new version of the airport
express 802 11 and base stations
resellers have discontinued the current
line and amazon has a two to five weeks
shipping date the hardware should remain
relatively the same but we're not sure
if it will get the same dramatically
improved signal boost that the recently
released airport extreme and time
capsule received and in news that it's
about time according to 9to5 mac apple
and sprint have completed work on a
version of the ipad 2 that's compatible
with their network there's no
confirmation if it will be only 3g or
compatible with their 4g network which
seems a little like a reach the news
comes after a bloomberg report last week
that said sprint will offer the apple
smartphone with the number 4 in
mid-october with an unlimited data plan
as part of a deal to bring the cinco on
board in the future sprint says they can
handle the data burden but let's get
real unlimited data is only going to
last so long you're right what's that
you get your body over here it's my
iphone 4 damn it
alright let's take a break guys if
you're bored of the games you have I'll
show you the next wave of iOS games do
you think he where the bull frogs jump
from bank to bank in hey guys welcome to
tap that app i'm brian Tong and this is
sure we cover the hottest apps in the
mobile space now you're probably bored
with some of those same old iOS games
because angry birds and bejeweled gets
played out but i'm bringing you three
new games that are 99 cents and a breath
of fresh air to keep your thumbs
cramping now first up is spy mouse and
guess what you are a mouse that's a spy
the goal is to collect the cheese wedges
without being spotted by those nasty
cats and then get out of the room draw a
path with your finger where you want to
go and see if you have what it takes to
be the Big Cheese get it now you also
face boss battles and mouse traps in
this fun puzzle and timing game that's
well worth its 99-cent price tag now
some games are just one hit wonders but
the team from half brick that broadest
fruit ninja has done it again with
jetpack joyride touch the screen will
fly up and down and collect as many
coins as you can while avoiding zappers
pick up enhancements in the game and
survive as long as you can then use the
coins you collect to purchase jetpacks
vehicle upgrades and more and if you
suck at the game just purchase coins
directly in that with your own money but
right now this is my new favorite game
hands down and finally let's get a game
for the grown-ups two words zombie
gunship you'll hunt zombies from the sky
by protecting a bunker and civilians and
shooting the zombies with an infrared
military style display from a gunship
see I'm supposed to kill all those
zombies the shadow looking guys in I
don't know if I can do it hold me you
also earn coins to purchase weapon
upgrades or special extras like a bomb
drop but this is another badass 99 cent

back to you show now the Tokyo Game Show
just finished up in Tokyo and intend to
release some updates to their
underperforming 3ds also Sony tatted
their launch of their PS Vita in Japan
in December but one piece of news that
caught my attention nintendo president
satoru iwata confirm the japanese news
organizations that they will not develop
iOS games and said this is absolutely
not under consideration which is smart
you know turn your back on an install
base of over 200 million iOS devices and
let's see the competing hardware you
have Oh yikes and add on analog stick
attachment that's the definition of
fugly and that's a bad apple Nintendo

classics on iOS would be smart and it's
about time you guys we've done all right

virtualization product is available for
the promo price of 4999 better graphics

compatibility are part of the 90 new
features also joining apple stance on
the dwindling significance of flash the
developer preview of Windows 8 from
Microsoft includes its Metro UI for
tablet and touch products microsoft
announced that the Metro version of its
web browser will not support plugins and
will be a full html5 experience which
means not flash and another kick to
Adobe's special parts and if you're a
mac skype user who felt left out and
couldn't communicate with your facebook
