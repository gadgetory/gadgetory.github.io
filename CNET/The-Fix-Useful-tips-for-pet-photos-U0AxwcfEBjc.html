furry children but I'm like a real kid
pets humbly want to sit down and stay
put for a while we take their picture so
how do you get a great pet photo with
the DSLR I'm going to show you some
universal taste first off make sure you
dial in all your camera's settings
before you take the shot you're gonna
need to act quick to get some good
photos and dogs and cats not gonna want
to sit still for you while you're
filling around your ISO much less have
time to focus on your shot and this is
the frustration two pet photography
right here this is life takes a lot of
patience in time how about you sit down
that's cold dirt there you go so here
are some tips for settings you're going
to want to make ahead of time for
example let's say I want to take a nice
close-up portrait of their face I want
the eyes being really sharp focus and I
like the background to be nice and soft
to do that I'm going to put my camera
into aperture priority mode and then I'm
gonna open that aperture all the way up
in this case it's a f-stop of a 1.8
I also recommend turning off your Flash
because not only is it going to possibly
spook your pets but it's also going to
give them red eye another setting I
recommend changing is your auto focus
setting you should keep auto focus on
for the sake of speed but instead of it
being an intelligent focus or
multi-point focus that might zero in on
their snout you want to have a single
point focus so you can really point at
their eyes and get that tight focus on
the eyes it's key I'm looking at those
eyes really trying to use the auto focus
to get in on the eyes finally I
recommend putting your camera into a
burst mode or a continuous shooting mode
instead of a single shot a great pet
photo is like a needle in a haystack of
a hundred photos you're gonna take so
just go for quantity take a bunch of
shots
well that's a good one the tongue is
hanging out there sloppy tongue i think
i got some great ones here yes yes it's
a tasty ear I shouldn't put that peanut
butter behind my ear this morning all
right the rest really just comes down to
patients and experimentation you try a
few different environments they're
looking sad you can take them out on a
walk or try to engage them in something
they like to do hopefully with any luck
by the end of the day you have a few
different shots with Frank
