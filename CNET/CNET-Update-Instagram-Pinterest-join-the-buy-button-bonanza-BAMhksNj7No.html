shopping I'm Bridget Carey this is your
CNET update coming soon to a social
network near you a click to buy button
this trend is sweeping across the
biggest social networks last year
Facebook and Twitter introduced by
buttons Google's adding buy buttons and
search results and it's rolling out a
way for you to go shopping inside of a
youtube video advertisement while it's
plain now Instagram and Pinterest are
the latest to adopt this revenue
generating strategy instagram which is
owned by facebook is under pressure to
make money and it's going to be
expanding advertising to more companies
so you could see an ad for a local store
ads will have a shop now button and
target you on factors such as age and
gender as for pinterest buy buttons are
not a big shocker the whole site
revolves around sharing cool things to
purchase the network announced that
later this month buy eight buttons will
start popping up to let you purchase
something without leaving the site it's
launching with two million products and
working with big name retailers like
Macy's and Nordstrom so yes it seems
everyone wants to be Amazon but Amazon
continues to raise the bar the king of
online commerce now is offering free
shipping on small items like makeup or
charger cords things that weigh less
than eight ounces the small and light
shipping program delivers items in three
to eight business days you don't need to
be a subscriber to prime to get the perk
it's for everyone but if you do pay a
hundred dollars a year for prime
Amazon's now including same-day
deliveries to the service with no extra
charge but it's just for 14 metro areas
across the US and you need to spend more
than $35 to qualify now let's switch
gears to a new type of wearable gadget
for kids
Disney has created a motion sensing toy
armband that blends physical playtime
with the digital world it's called the
play nation and starting with Marvel's
Avengers you can become Iron Man by
strapping on this gear called the
repulsor to your arm and you get briefed
on what to do by Jarvis from a
smartphone or tablet app but you have to
turn off the app to start the actual
play
there are these base stations and
figurines that you interact with
shooting and blocking shots with
different hand motions all the while
you're encouraged to keep moving and
jumping sort of like the concept of
laser tag but now you're in a Marvel
Universe where the toys fight back the
starter pack will be a hundred and
twenty dollars when it goes on sale in
October and coming next year our play
nations for Star Wars to become a Jedi
and then after that you can gain Elsa's
ice queen powers with a frozen theme set
everyone wants to be Elsa but you know
Anna was the real hero people am i right
I know let it go that's all for this
tech news update but there's always more
at sea Netcom from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
