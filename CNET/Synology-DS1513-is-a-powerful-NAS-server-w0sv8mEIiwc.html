computers at home I want to back things
up where we can get a bunch of external
hard drives like this one right here are
for a nasa server which connect to a
network and provide storage to multiple
devices at a time when it comes to now
server though you can expect a lot more
than just storage and the prime example
of that is what I have today that this
station 15:13 plus from Synology the
server come with fire dry Bay and that
means can offer up to 20 terabytes of
storage space when you grid five for a
terabyte hard drive now the five bay is
very significant because you can put
this hard drive in a special
configuration cone rate to offer
protection again one or even two hard
drive failure at the same time you can
also replace a hard drive even when the
server is still running so let's try
here we go you can see it's very easy to
pull a hard driver note how I can change
the drive without any tool at all also
note that I just chained a two tape I
Drive to a 3-2 byte drive and that's
right that's another cool thing about
this server it allows you to use hard
drive of different capacity together now
if you worry that the hardware can be
pulled out too easily don't because each
of the driver come with a lock that it
can use to securely keep them in one
place and if you choose to lock them
make sure you do not lose this key on
the back the server comes with four USB
2.0 port and two USB 3.0 ports and two
eSATA port to add even more story to it
even more you can actually use printers
Wi-Fi dongle or even TV tuner with these
USB port now I fear there are two big
smart fans smart because they work well
together if one is removed or stopped
working the other will pick up the speed
to compensate and finally take a look at
this the server has not one not two not
even three but four Gigabit Ethernet
ports and now let's move to the cooler
part of the server is web interface
which work just like a native operating
system there you go all familiar with a
start button
start menu and the taskbar you can also
open multiple windows and run multiple
tasks at the same time within the web
page now the server come with a packet
Center which is very similar to a App
Store here you can add remove and update
packages that add more feature to the
server now my favorite are of course
those who have something to do with
entertainment such as the devastation
video station for a station of the
popular plex media server this package
allowed for our streaming content store
on a server as well as from online
services you can stream to local devices
as well as remote mobile devices so
let's try it with the iPad right here
here you go as you can see there's a lot
of online service to choose from and you
can add remove them from within the apps
you can also easily play back an episode
of South Park which is my favorite show
or obscene that TV which is your
favorite let's pick a random seed video
and see how it goes here we go very
smooth no lag what who these guys come
on see that seriously his English really
sucks is good-looking though and give
him that the server has a lot to offer
as you can see and in my testing is very
fast enough to justify the current price
of some eight hundred and seventy
dollars with no storage included to
learn more about the server check out
the full video SEO calm and to find out
more about just how amazing my English
is well keep playing this video a loop
or you can follow me on Twitter Facebook
or Google+ either way is very good for
you and that's because I'm down low and
this has been the first look at the
distinction diaz 1713 plus from
psychology
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
