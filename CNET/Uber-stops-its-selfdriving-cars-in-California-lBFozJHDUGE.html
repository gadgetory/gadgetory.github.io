California uber is an interesting
company it seems to think that it's
easier to ask for forgiveness than
permission well it ran into an issue in
California uber began picking up
passengers using self-driving cars in
San Francisco earlier this month these
cars had a person in the driver's seat
to take over as necessary there's also
another person in the passenger seat to
take and analyze data the california
department of motor vehicles immediately
took issue with Hoover's tests because
the company did not have an autonomous
vehicle testing primitive 20 other
companies including Google GM and Tesla
received permits from the DMV or their
self-driving cars uber claimed it did
not need a permit because its cars still
required a person to operate them the
DMV threatened legal action if / did not
stop its self-driving vehicles well the
California DMV revoked the registrations
of uber self-driving cars and this
caused uber to stop its self-driving
tests in San Francisco this is not the
end of over self-driving cars in
California the company says it will try
to redeployed self-driving cars in the
state the California DMV has invited
over to get a permit so you can legally
test its self-driving cars for more
