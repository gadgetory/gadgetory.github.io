the Galaxy S 10 in London I even still
have my Samsung event bracelet on Nats
how fresh this is now if you want to
know all about the phone it's screen
size its resolution how powerful it is
all of that stuff check out cnet.com but
here I want to talk about the phones
five cameras that's right five of them
so we'll start on the back the s9 plus
last year had two cameras on the back
with the s10 plus that's joined by a
third in the form of a 16 megapixel
super wide angle lens so that means that
you get the normal view you get the
zoomed in telephoto view that we had on
the last phone but now there's a very
very wide angle which captures a huge
amount in a single scene something we've
seen already in phones from LG and
Huawei and I actually really really like
it it's dead easy on the Samsung phone
to switch between with different views
using the little button on screen and
it's a great tool if you want to capture
a huge landscape or a cityscape a
standard 12 megapixel camera keeps that
dual aperture function that we saw again
on last year's phone now this have a
wider aperture mode which hopefully lets
in more light giving you better shots
when the Sun Goes Down but if you need
even more help in low light than
Samsung's a I powered shot suggestions
may be of use so it analyzes the scene
in front of you to give you the best
settings possible whether that's a
picture of a person of a pet so much
food or a nighttime scene again this is
something we have seen on various other
phones but the s10 plus takes it a
little bit further by actually guiding
you on how to take better photos in
those different scenes in one of the
examples I saw at our demo day when
taking a photo of a person the phone
recognizes that there's a person in the
scene and brought up these yellow
guidelines to help me
frame the shot in what the phone thinks
is the best way to take that picture you
can probably expect guidelines to pop up
if you're taking a horizontal shot to
make sure that your horizon is nice and
straight and I'm personally hoping that
there's one that will remind me to take
a photo before I take a big bite of that
lovely cupcake but when the light drops
even more the a I will use a mode called
bright night now this uses various bits
of software trickery to help get a
really bright crisp shot at night
without any of that nasty image noise or
blur from your shaky hand and speaking
of blur the phone not only shoots video
in 4k and uses HDR 10 for punchier
colors but it also uses optical image
stabilization to make sure that your
footage is really nice and smooth but
what about the front-facing cameras for
those selfie obsessives among youth just
like me well there's now two cameras on
the front of the s10 plus there's the
standard 12 megapixel camera and that's
joined by another 8 megapixel lens which
gives depth information now that
hopefully should result in much better
looking depth of field for those nice
creative selfies and of course it's also
the front-facing cameras that will let
you use Samsung's AR emoji and various
stickers although whether they've been
made any better by the addition of that
second lens remains to be seen overall I
do have high hopes of photography on
Samsung's new flagship phone thats super
wide angle lens I think could open up
some nice creative opportunities but of
course it will all come down to actual
image quality and we won't know what
that's like until we give this phone our
full review treatment in the meantime
though do let us know your thoughts on
the cameras on the galaxy s 10 and
indeed your thoughts about the phone
altogether
how's Samsung done enough to take the
challenge back to Apple and Huawei make
sure to put your thoughts in the
