now this is the new fancy washroom AC
Wi-Fi router designed for a network of
mostly wireless clients such as laptop
tablet or smartphone now the routers
selling point is this screen right here
it makes using it very simple in fact
the setup process can be done via a few
tap and then you are done you can always
check on your network to the number here
for example it is your network health
score basically 60% and up means your
network is in good shape but anything
above that is kind of mystery because I
cannot discern the difference between a
few percentage points for example right
now I say 97% why not 98 we've been so
bad even 95 and why not 100 really and
if you notice it's keep changing all the
time and I'm just sitting here you can
also tap on screen here to view more
information about your network or
displayed the Wi-Fi password etc but it
cannot change anything for that you need
to use the mobile apps called story now
that opens up a completely new ballgame
first you will need to register an
account with story and that means you
can match your home network even when
you're out and about but in return your
router will connect to story at all time
and that makes me kind of nervous
the router has a microphone and also a
speaker right now they don't do anything
but in the future though you might be
able to use it for voice command when
it's added via firmware update and
speaking of future the rarity is also
supposed to support home automation
Wi-Fi standards such as ZigBee but that
is also not it activated now in testing
as a router the story did really well
with fast Wi-Fi speed very stable Wi-Fi
signal it worked for three days in a row
without disconnecting once but the range
was not the best I've seen maxing out
100 feet away it's not too bad either
and that brings us to the biggest
problem of this rail here the price at
$350 it was the most expensive runner on
the market now is it worth it it's up to
you if you like this
you like the triangle design and
especially the ease of you well it can
make a great router if you live in a
small home it's not for me them because
my network health is always at least 100
percent I'm still attached so I need
something that can indicate 110 percent
or more and that's because I'm down low
