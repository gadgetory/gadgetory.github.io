Linksys ei 8500 Mac stream AC 2600
mu-mimo gigabit router now this one's
very very special because mu my mouse
stand for multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output
now though my mo is regular because most
rather support that but the MU notion is
totally new let me explain so with the
same Wi-Fi standard there are different
speed tiers
slow fast faster in regular MIMO the
router suite oh and every client the
same by offering them the top capacity
for example this EA cig 900 here has a
top Wi-Fi speed on the five-year-old
frequency band of 1300 megabit per
second but my iPhone 6 has a top speed
of chess 433 megabit per second when the
to connect 867 megabit per second is
wasted it's like when I go to Starbuck
to get a small cup of coffee with the
only thing they have there is the venti
the 20 answer that is now in mu my mode
the router actually approaches all
clients with multiple transmission of
multiple Wi-Fi tiers so when they
connect the connection is at the speed
needed by each client on top of that
thing to the increase amount of
transmission multiple client can access
a Wi-Fi signal faster and more
efficiently this is like when the coffee
soft has multiple barista is serving
multiple cup size van T Grande toll and
you can even print euro plastic cup as
you can see mu my mo is a better and
more efficient way to distribute Wi-Fi
signal especially when you have a
multiple clients each need something of
its own and these links is here is the
first ever seen that support that now in
order for mu mode to work well it needs
to be supported by both the router and
the clients but even with Lexi client it
helped to in my testing I was able to
make all of the clients of different
Wi-Fi tier 2
Nick and their desire speed at the same
time that's one good thing the second
good thing is that this router he has
quite fast Wi-Fi speed with a sustain
will will speed up more than 430 megabit
per second it also show off very long
range and stable Wi-Fi signals tank that
this big and detachable antennas now
this one is very powerful device is
powered by a dual-core one point 4 K
gold processors 128 megabytes of flash
memory and 512 megabyte of system memory
it comes with four Gigabit LAN port here
and one gigabit one or Internet port it
has one USB 3.0 port and another port
that works either as a 2.0 USB or ysera
and this is where it is the most
impressive when coupled with an external
hard drive it registered the fastest
network storage performance I've seen
with more than 90 megabyte per second
for writing and more than hundred five
megabyte per second for reading via a
gigabit connection so the question is
can you get it well maybe but only if
you are loaded because it's very
expensive at two hundred and eighty
dollars and remember is only worth it if
you have multiple clients of multiple
Wi-Fi tears at home if I'm on this one
and check out my full review se Netcom
basically it's a great router at a even
greater cost so maybe you should ask
your friend to give it to you as a
present and if you are charming enough
maybe you get a second one too which I
do all the time and I totally take that
for granted now and that's because I'm
downloading this has been the first look
at the e I 8500 mu-mimo
