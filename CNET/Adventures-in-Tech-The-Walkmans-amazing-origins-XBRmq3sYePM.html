leaps forward some amazing new tech that
opens up a world of possibilities but
the Sony's Walkman
all the pieces were already there this
is a story south Tony put them together
in inventing the world-famous Walkman
Sony became the first company to
recognize the power of portable personal
music but by the time that recognition
occurred the first Walkman was already
on sale meet the Sony TCM 100 voice
recorder also known as the press man
this unassuming device was aimed at
reporters and its primary function was
to record audio onto a cassette tape
course once sound was recorded you could
also listen to that tape back in his
book made in Japan Sony's then chairman
Akio Morita described seeing his
colleague using a sony voice recorder to
listen to music using a pair of chunky
headphones it dawns on them that by
removing the key feature of their
product they could create something much
more exciting an ingenious moment of
discovery that we've been unable to
replicate
Sony's engineers stripped the press man
down ditching the recording circuit and
speaker and replacing them with a stereo
amplifier an extra headphone port was
added so two people could listen at once
and the press man's record button became
the hotline a button activated
microphone for speaking to your
listening partner finally Sony crafted a
set of extremely light miniature
headphones and the first walkman was
ready according to Marta there was doubt
within Sony as to whether the walkman
gamble would pay off but when it hit
Japan in the summer of 1979 the TPS l2
proves a massive success sony sold its
entire stock of 30,000 units in two
months boosting the gadgets popularity
by hiring young couples to walk around
Tokyo listening to the Walkman and
presumably looking dead trendy a nice
idea that I suspect would work less well
in cold unfriendly London
oh this cool the phony one oh yeah sure
sorry walkman eventually became the
products global name but it was
originally called the sound about in the
US and in the UK it was the stowaway
which makes it sound like it's going to
hide in a grog barrel and eat all your
ships biscuits the TP SL 2 was built by
removing features from an existing
product but with his second walkman Tony
got a flexes designed muscles the WM 2
was much smaller thanks to some
reorganized components and control
buttons positioned on the front of the
device the dual volume controls from the
first walkman were ditched as was the
hotline button but as a bonus you did
get this dorky belt clip the WM 2 became
the most popular cassette playing
Walkman ever cementing Sony is the king
of mobile music and paving the way for
many weird and wonderful workmen to come
during the Walkmans lifespan Sony bought
us toughened waterproof models
solar-powered players and a royal
version offered as a gift to Princess
Diana eventually the walkman got it's
recording powers back as well as radio
capability despite an onslaught of rival
devices Sony remained the king of
portable tunes
ten years later walkman sales hit 50
million in 1992 they hit 100 million
with dozens and dozens of different
models available the Walkman spawned the
disc man then mini discs and mp3s
before it was eventually crushed by
apples iPod the Walkman changed the way
we enjoy music but Sony's akio morita
later said he didn't believe any amount
of market research could have predicted
the Walkman success you could call it a
lucky break but maybe the lesson here is
the fresh exciting tech can come from
anywhere even something that's already
been invented
what are your Walkman memories let me
know and check back next time for
another adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
