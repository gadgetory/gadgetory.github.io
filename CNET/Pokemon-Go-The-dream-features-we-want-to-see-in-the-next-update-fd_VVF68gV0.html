features they'd want to see in the
future hirson said he hopes he can have
trainer battles shahbaz if I said his
name right his or her name right asked
if we will ever be able to change our
teams is there a feature a dream feature
you want going forward that we don't
have currently in this mobile game I
mean it's not a feat that's kind of a
feature so what I really really really
want your pok√©mon go is I want a
carpool mode I want to mode you turn it
on and you say I'm in the passenger seat
of the car or I'm in the driver's seat
of a car playing this game I'm handling
my friend ain't talking mine the point
is if you hand your phone to a friend
and you get star dust or something like
that for being a responsible person and
not play so this is something where you
press the button and it basically
disables all the features of Pokemon go
just keeps your phone on you hand it to
a friend and you get some stardust for
being the designated driver in the car
and not playing the damn game because
the game right now you can play it while
driving it is extremely dangerous and
there's nothing to stop it I mean in a
previous game niantic made ingress there
was like a speed limit where if you went
past a certain speed you know you you it
would disable some of the games features
but right now I can be going 80 down the
highway and if I see a Pikachu in the
other Lane I can tap on it and I can try
to catch and it's kind of crazy that it
lets me do that it just doesn't count
your steps right your it doesn't count
your steps States you do over certain
speeds if you do things that aren't that
there's all kinds of folks on reddit
trying to figure out exactly how I
counting steps works but we do know that
over certain speeds it doesn't work but
also even with ingress even with the
speed limit people would be okay well I
can't drive over 50 miles an hour I
guess I'll Drive at 15 miles an hour
around this place and and catch my in a
pokemon or hack my portals and ingress
and it's just dangerous and they don't
need it doesn't need to be dangerous
just incentivize playing responsibly
incentivize not playing well as the
driver of car that's a good one don't
drink and drive don't text and drive do
not Pokemon go and drive
that's correct you're not Pokemon go and
drive Kaylin what's your dream feature
uh I don't know I really thought that
much about it good question um I don't
know I guess I just miss the tracking so
anything that brings me some semblance
of that back would be spectacular I
guess for me the reason why I enjoyed
using those things was because you know
I'm not such I don't know I'm a casual
player so it wasn't like I was being
like oh look there's a nest of XYZ over
there but like guys I really want
Pikachu if I could like find a thing to
show there he was I want him I want
certain ones i wish i knew the creatures
that i can only find in different areas
since like I was at san diego comic-con
recently and there was all kinds of fire
pokemon i could never find in New York
up here you guys are the land of Zubat I
have seen more Zubat in San Francisco
than I've seen in anywhere else so far
even in New York which is plenty of
zubat there too but there's probably
something maybe there's a seal that I
could find more often here or if you're
in LA go to the La Brea Tar Pits they
have exactly the Pokemon you would
expect to find there we pull up this
other one to it what is it I couldn't
see it oh I'll show it to you in just a
sec too so i just take a look at this
Grimer mmm this is exactly what you
would expect to find exactly what you'd
expect to find one that everyone's like
where is it how do i find it ditto ditto
oh god nobody knows nobody's caught a
ditto i don't think uh is he part of the
151 or whatever Tainos part of the one
and did the guy who said he caught all
them have a ditto no no when he said all
he meant hundred forty-six help there's
no artisan except adult race no ditto no
muir Mewtwo yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
