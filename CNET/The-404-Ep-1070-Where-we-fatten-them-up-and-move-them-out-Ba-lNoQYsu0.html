8 2012 you're listening to the 404 on
cnet com for some reason i'm introducing
today i'm richard peterson I Mariano yet
I'm Justin you and I'm Joseph Kaminski
man this is the show where we fatten
them up and move them out peer pressure
works is great most i've talked to a we
only took an hour of practice before the
show now that was awesome thank you for
introducing the show have you do that
moral that's back that's good so it's
the last day of this thing that minority
run or in a sad thinking about changing
the locks so that Jeff can call Alan
average Sachs has changed the doc has to
do we've been having a good time this
week right over there kind of bummed to
see you guys not well no I mean you guys
will be here stronger no you got to come
back more often he's come back Oh cry
big guy well end the show with a big
group hug um but today show title we
should explain that this is actually a
quote from Jerry Seinfeld he had a
little interview in what was it grub
street rock on maybe can switch to this
he's talking about Mayor Bloomberg's
proposed ban on sugary drinks / 16
ounces in New York right so basically
this would affect any establishment that
requires a letter grade so that includes
mr. that would exclude restaurants and
grocery stores but it would include
Street carts in New York bodegas hot dog
stands etc right so anything over 16
ounces which you would typically find in
like a vending machine right so like a
normal bottle of coke is 16 ounces
nothing over that would it be sold if
this law passes under Bloomberg's rule
you read it did you guys read about this
like they're getting a lot of creamer in
the back if you know it's just annoying
because all they want to do is just tax
because you
just just going two by two yeah you
gotta buy two bottles that's all I'm
gonna do it you're not going to stop
people I mean what clothes all the
7-elevens eliminate the big gulp ah see
that's the big thing that people are
wondering whether or not 711s will be
affected by this because they're
proposing opening over 200 7 11
locations in South Manhattan alone so
like well I mean yeah I've seen a couple
open up in my neighborhood yeah so I'm
like and I'm like wow 7-eleven slurpee
time yeah bluetongue any cool dude
slurpees to uh do they have slurs over
16 ounces yeah yeah oh yeah that's a
sugary drink I don't know unless you're
diabetic I think you might be stoked
about this but I don't know yeah you're
right there you could just uh are you
even paying attention right that's what
are you doing okay have you heard you
realize we're recording a pocket haha
look at me man see you I'll just look at
me okay yeah cuz I seems like it'd me
hey you know what I'm gonna go to the
show notes I'm gonna stay on the show
notes yeah talking about service here
they're not gonna interact with the chat
room cuz Justin's not allowing me to be
me yeah I'm trying to talk to you right
now man never mind chatter other people
you can talk to my question is how would
they enforce this law though right like
would they have cops like going around
like busting people for two liter sodas
know how serious are they about it is it
jit I think it's a tax thing yeah you
know I agree they're just rying to get
more money yes I make more money but you
know people are gonna do they're just
gonna go somewhere like down south
whether where they sell them biggins
bring them up here and sell it yes it
does it doesn't eliminate it it's like
you're thinking that we should start
like a bootleg soda business and start
carrying like two liters in our I mean
all right I'm guilty of it like I forgot
the name they have like this huge BBQ in
Brooklyn like once a year I'm talking
about like you can't even you can't even
need your cell phone because there's so
many people in the network is so
straighten out there like maybe a couple
thousand people right and they have like
I don't have any buddies from able that
those those quarter water bottles I was
like little clear bottles like the cats
and dudes are going around selling like
nutcrackers and like you know like
drinks like because I like playing
bottles and they look like fruit punches
and they way they look like fruit
punches a nutcracker is like 151
Chambord Jack dang it's like a lot of
liquors in it but it's in like one of
those quarter water bottles
and it looks like fruit punch and then
they sell them out there and that's what
to do with sodas those selling in
thermoses or something you're not going
to stop he's like I have like I play
ball with a couple guys they come down
that they probably go to Costco get a
case of gatorade and they sent down the
courts two dollars a bottle all you're
doing is you're taking business away
because you're gonna people like that
just going out something it on the side
themselves well you could still buy like
two liters in the grocery store clean
yet oh yeah yeah you can still buy them
in the grocery store and that in the
people we just buying fountain drinks
you can't right right and they're
probably lower the price of the two
leaders because of the set of sales yeah
or maybe raise them actually because
people like I want the big bottle he
will probably drink more cuz I'll just
buy a two liter yeah hit up costco and
stock up yeah it just seems like kind of
a maternal thing on Bloomberg's part
right like do these people really need
someone to just like ban sugary drinks
entirely or can they just do it
themselves just not drink as much just
get like I don't know it can see the
thing is they blame the obesity problem
on larger portions larger this no blame
it on lazy people yeah I mean when I
first of all we weren't even this
conscious of what we ate with children
is like whatever your mom put on the
plate you ate it um I know for a fact
for myself I would have to sit at the
table for like a good hour because she'd
be like they're people starving in
Africa eat all your food I've mastered
the technique of spreading my rice
around the plate to make a look I've
eaten some slip some handfuls down to
the dog and into that can I be excused
yeah you know i'm i'm a little heavy now
but I'm also an old man but but I don't
see being a problem for kids these days
with these larger portions just the fact
they don't exercise a lot of them game
they stay indoors they have their iPads
in front of them there PS PS or whatever
it's not it's not just a soda it really
is it my son he's never had soda my
neighborhood was out her son had a
sprite and she's like this Jordan want
some of the spread was like he's never
had soda yeah he won't I mean I've given
him sell sir water he said has he seen
me drinks else well that's another thing
I try to drink what I want him to drink
he sees me drinking he drinks it like he
mostly sees me drink water and he likes
war so I you know I don't think we don't
need someone else telling us yeah yeah
Oh what we should do what she we
shouldn't do next thing you know you
know
can't go to the bathroom during work
hours what I mean where are we going
from here I'd be screwed I would it go
up nobody's like every know but it's
like everything everything is
progressively moving to a control scheme
you like um you take the medical field I
mean I'm not saying they're curious for
things are not curious but medical field
is like they give you the medication to
keep you alive you keep buying the
medication and now you look at like I'm
game subscriptions everything is
following that we'll just have them pay
monthly you know xbox live you pay for
now PS Plus you pay for yeah if you want
that and it just to the point where like
your paycheck goes in your account and
it's debited everywhere it's gone it's
like you have no freedom you never
physically touch your money anymore now
you're telling me I can't drink my soda
because of 911 their cameras everywhere
and people feel safer with them when
last night in new york city and i was up
at dinosaur BBQ right from the Manhattan
School of Music three people were shot
in a BMW and I was like where all these
cops coming from when I walk my friend
almost like wow that's crazy I mean just
the more that things happen like that
the more people they get scared the more
they control them and I personally feel
I grew up in a time where I walk to
school by myself and there are gangs in
my neighborhood you can look up 84th
street in the 70s it was like one of the
worst blocks in Manhattan and I'm fine
it's nowhere near as bad as it was now
so why so much governing yeah yeah I
agree Wow sorry to get some suit yeah a
serious man how you tied 16 out sodas
just into a gang shootings but
everything is because she's gonna follow
your trainer but no because it's like
they they make people feel they're not
smart enough to think grab something
himself but they don't know aren't
though right like a lot of people will
buy like the larger size if it's only
thirty cents but that's but it would
super size it we wouldn't have a
government yeah if it weren't if that if
you couldn't manipulate people the way
they do yeah that's the thing but there
has to be a line yeah you know they're
there are people that you know believe
I'll put him in office cuz he looks good
he wears a nice suit the way he holds
his son or looks at his wife whatever we
know people don't really you know
investigate they don't really
investigate the reasons why they do what
they do these go the people they vibe
with but it still doesn't mean there
aren't few people out there that don't
want to follow that I
agree you want it you want to get your
soda whatever fine I want I don't drink
soda but I still don't want them to do
that next thing you know they'll be
telling me I can't get a 32 ounce
Gatorade when I go play ball oh you
can't it's a sugary drink that's what
they're saying but that's the thing i
need my electrolyte that's what this all
comes down to um it's all right let's
let's move on I'm sorry everyone I do
know it's okay a real man um all right
let's talk about something I think
you'll be interested in Joey and it's
not nasty it's not Nancy I'm sure you'll
find a creative way to make it so but no
uh last week we sort of talked about
like practical applications of active
noise canceling technology we were
talking about like this restaurant in
berkeley that was using noise cancelling
to filter back into the restaurant so
that other patrons will be able to be
disturbed and now the next place that
active noise-cancelling tech is coming
is computers right so there's this uh
let me bring this up on the screen here
there's this company called knock Shuba
have you heard of it's like computer
cooling systems yeah it's not like all
in one I like CPU fans and like liquid
cooling but now they're talking about um
you know like a fanless set up with
active noise-cancelling to actually cut
down on those volume levels especially
for people that are you know irritated
by overclocking like that fan it gets
pretty loud yeah so what's going to do
it's it actually integrates signal
processing technology and then there's a
separate speaker inside the fan that
sort of projects that noise canceling
back into it which apparently quiet
quiet sit down quite a bit it's like the
next evolution for tinkerers I think and
having tested a lot of desktops in
advance I thought you'd have a well I
know it's funny because it's this
technology seems great but it's coming
at a time where we see more and more
all-in-ones yeah you know so I mean I i
like i like the towers because they're
easy to you know they're expandability
is great for them but more and more
people are just like they're going with
the neatness the the simplicity of and
also the aesthetics so it's like all it
might be a little little late yeah i
mean because you know everybody's that
if you have a desktop most people have
like imax or like the sony all in ones
or the Lenovo all-in-one and
said it might be a little too late right
and then you know of course the tablet
so I don't know yeah do you think the
days of people customizing their desktop
computers is kind of coming to a close
because I remember when I was really
young like people would buy separate
parts on like New Ager whatever it may
be and then build your own cuz it was
always cheaper to do that but now with
budget computers getting down to like
three 350 for a pretty good system and
not to mention the fact that laptops so
much more affordable now laptops are
actually the price the desktops were
maybe like three or four years ago you
can get a decent laptop for like 5 600
bucks right where that was you can only
get a desktop back then if you if you
thought of a laptop back in the day was
like a thousand dollars two thousand
dollars but now it's so inexpensive it's
and then you bring tablets into the
equation mm-hmm I personally think you
gonna see kind of like a merger between
the laptop tablet where you know it'll
be more in there probably all just fade
there like a tablet base right rip the
tablet off the keyboard and walk around
the house type of a nomination system
know you've seen some pretty crazy
liquid cooling desktops right I'm ver
one time I walked into the lab and you
had this he like he goes a yellow case
with like all these different tubes of
like water running and never like a
refrigerator in there it looked like
bein yeah if anyone who doesn't owe Bane
is he's a DC character he fights bat
mini yeah steroids mmm he's actually
gonna be in the new batman dark knight
rises right what system was that do you
remember which are not talking about is
right next to the door um I don't think
it was what was a falcon the Falcons are
normally silver I think was the orange
one think it might be referring to like
the the acer predator maybe yeah I be
the predator kind of it that the face
slides up or the arm I did get the FX
and well dang i get so minion yeah you
test a lot of stuff and we should one
day take a tour of your lab whole thing
is is nowadays they all want the high
end systems back with the swiftness man
is like they were they like I guess they
have to go somewhere else to get review
they want them back I'd love to keep
them on the bench yeah so I don't know
how these cooling systems work is
actually water that runs to those
private yeah something of its liquid
cooled and it's cooled by the fan it
goes right through the CPU yeah it shows
it actually have if you want to see an
assembly I have a liquid cool assembly
in a box not not in so Lana system you
want to come out
check it out cool I should I should have
brought it in sorry guys is it a
continuous stream of water or is it
drawing from like a reservoir know
there's a reservoir it just it's a
circular cycle same thing like I'm like
would you like she with a radiator with
a car right okay so that's somewhere you
have to switch out the water every once
in a while you know you don't when you
went open to anything over you want to
open it up over the pc just let it go um
can you put other liquids in there you'd
be like oh my god by Dr Pepper know what
will put dr. pepper and it'll gum it all
probably eat through the tube all right
let's talk about one more story uh
before we hit the brake uh what you
thinkin Joanna you read them you want
talk about Nikes or you want to talk
about saying your facebook like you know
what let's let's let's do the facebook
likes cuz Nikes may go for a while yeah
that's good cuz I'm pretty sure we all
got a little sneaker I know you got a
sneer advantage yeah definitely I mean I
don't buy him anymore but I'm still like
looking I do for my son as I my little
Stevie your fetishes through him cuz
it's like half court of the price 50
bucks Jordan trims man so you're not
willing to pay ninety thousand dollars
for Perry air yeezys no okay yeah how do
I would even pay 1500 to hundred ugly uh
alright so let's talk about this story
instead okay 90,000 for Kim for what I
knew you'd somehow find a way did you
get that in there too um alright so
let's talk about Facebook Likes so we've
not spoken about this before but you
know getting impressions and interacting
with your Facebook fans can be pretty
lucrative for a company or for
individuals you know like most recently
now you can start up paying for exposure
on your status updates right so if you
pay like ninety cents or something you
can make it to the top of a promoted
facebook status likes section on your
wall so that the next big thing is
apparently uh this website called my FB
fans com I'll bring this up here this
website basically is a bootleg like
social media traffic increase ER
they guarantee that uh you know we've
heard of buying Twitter followers before
but this is for all of your social media
networks so right here you can see that
you can get facebook fans first you know
a page that you have twitter followers
youtube views on its own included liat
linkedin connections vimeo views and
google+ once you think that's what
Ackerman did to get itself facebook well
where do those fans come from like are
they fake hey you by fan yes or
followers yeah so this is great i did a
little bit of research into this and
whereas other companies uh retire like
bots to sort of like your stuff this
company guarantees that actual humans
will engage on your website because they
have an army of users that they pay to
do it too so it's kind of like a pyramid
scheme so basically you like this
they'll like you yeah exactly so it's
kind of like a mutual appreciation type
deal and they're offering 200 likes for
a limited promotion 200 likes for 1299
or your money back guaranteed in a week
or less so if you really really want a
lame lame like paying for friends yeah
exactly and it's like okay so these guys
200 people like your page are they gonna
pay attention still like it like
everything you promote they're not gonna
like really be into it they just like
your pages cuz they got a delighted you
know it'll be that one thing too though
I think the whole at your right like the
whole idea of engagement is that you
want that like continued relationship
with them and so that stuff you post in
a week will also get traffic yeah I mean
if they can guarantee that these are
people that I'll probably be really
interested in what you do then that'd be
kind of cool but this just seems like
okay you got extra numbers on your page
right and I would be dubious if I looked
at a YouTube video and a head like a
hundred thousand views but 0 comments oh
yeah 0 likes or dislikes yeah yeah it's
kind of like a whole ecosystem thing you
can't just have views mm-hmm I have the
whole thing but you guys wouldn't pay
can you think of any situation where you
would pay for a like it's kind of sad I
think I think the only play said it
might it will not the likes that aspect
but I think the only place would
actually pay off is the the linkedin if
you were like if your head on if you're
looking for a job like oh this dude has
a lot of connections now that'd probably
be cool but other than that but what
kind of connections are
that's truly connected to a bunch of
blank profiles or no you're connected to
the guy that does the bum Wi-Fi whatever
happened with that doesn t that ever
took off coboy man is terrible like this
the smell is stronger than the signal
they're talking about at South by
Southwest South by Southwest they were
paying homeless people my phone Wi-Fi
hotspot signals yeah my apologies any
homeless person that has a Wi-Fi on the
streaming this right now but email Joe
we got some nerve to show up at your
house I let's uh let's take a quick
break right now we have a pretty good
video if you guys are fans of dogs and
then when we come back we got a couple
voicemails just to wrap up the weeks and
an announcement to make about monday so
stick around we'll be right back
Oh
the outside problem getting in spent
little just move out cuz normally get
like if you gotta seen it all right hot
come on Richard you know everything is
fine I don't know to say he's a big
welcome back to the show this is the 404
you can do it i'd appreciate your
sarcastic tone what's what's the twitter
what's a twitter account um that's at
the 44 yeah that's right also follow our
instagram the 404 what about the face
for photos on there yeah but what about
facebook what is it just look up oral
for i'm sure everything sure it's not
doing 404 backwards I don't know
London's 40 for that or 404 backwards oh
that's funny cuz it's it's both the same
thing yeah what is the phone number that
people can call for a voicemail you

think you're really gonna like this
first one it's from Chicago from Liz we
got our first female voice mail of the
week which is really great and she's not
mad at anybody she is pretty happy with
us so that's what I wanted to pledge
sort of offset some of the comments
we've got in the emails so he or she is
Chicago from Liz hi Justin this is my
do-over from calling earlier because I
forget to give my name and so forth so
I'll like to start over again okay here

really cool thank you very much Liz
Chicago from Luke hago from Liz that's

likes Jeff he doesn't like Haiti yeah
40 acknowledged in in ariel's and
Richards defense they would speak more
but richest men the cameras and he's a
perfectionist as is Arielle yeah so all

with Miss more tired new jobs and
butlers and any boards and you know and
I'm and Arielle just started working

we're shipping him back out again the
WWDC yeah the wait what are the rumors
like a for Apple there's gonna be maybe
some new MacBook Pros minus the optical
drive is the optical drives maybe some
new laptops right yeah probably yeah
probably like a revamp to the air ya
know I phone though right they're still
saying October for the new I i I'm not
just what it is it is I try not to think
about it as its weight I just want a
bigger screen I'm waiting I'm holding
out I don't know if I want the evo the
iphone let's do four inches are better I
can't
I can't that little screen forget about
it yeah who cares about a Retina Display
I can't see ya you think the macbook
pros will change design at all cuz it's
been a few years well I fishing I think
the I think the whole elimination of the
optical drive they're gonna they're
gonna become a lot more sleeker they're
gonna try to make them a little more
thinner where it has it they're gonna be
thinner that's why they're removing it
as long as they just don't move any more
USB ports oh I know how they keep
getting rid of I know it's good a lot of
people in the office of transitioning
over to MacBook Air Scott in ackerman
and everybody has to get the bluetooth
keyboards and mice because since they
don't have the Ethernet port you have to
use a USB dongle for the ethernet port
look at a network here and then that
leaves you like what one USB port on
that is that because they're trying to
push Thunderbolt well no it just because
they make them so thin it there the
whole purpose is to make them portable
but the thing is for an office use we
connected a network in here so one USB
port because it doesn't have an ethernet
dongle right it's strictly Wi-Fi so you
got easy USB port for that on can't use
a USB mouse cousin you be using the
other port USB keyboard so you use the
blue to the magic mouse right so there's
like it just not ideal for an office
setting but great for when you're out
and about yeah yeah sure um alright well
enough speculating you'll hear more
about it on Monday from Brian and Donald
so be sure to check that out and gonna
wrap it up for it I'm Andy Bell do we
talk about the ugly shoes no we didn't
talk about other issues you want to talk
about this and I thought that was a
reason why we waited 50 years yeah so
here they are and all their disgusting
glory it kind of looked like Simpson's
shoes right with like but bring the
bikes on the back and yeah are you are
y'all are you like a big sneaker I used
to be a big sneaker but I stopped
because it just became a very expensive
habit and kids wait in line for these
and spend tons of money and these are
disgusting to me yeah why does it cost
them much Walt they're designed by Kanye
oh yeah a reason why that and the fact
that they're an early release the
they're only gonna make like three to
five thousand of them and they're not
going to be released till later on so
this is for the person who has to have
it first but rumor has it this probably
this person probably just been on it but
they probably can't afford this paycheck
without mortgaging the house
yeah um yeah I was the same ice to get a
lot of sneakers in but I find my it's
just repetitive I don't really like many
of the new sneakers that are out I just
find myself buying the re-release like
like my favorite dr. Jordans I like the
the Tuesday 3 is 24 is the nine twelves
the penalties are all right yeah you
know i love the release of the hurrah
cheese because they're really
comfortable i'm not wearing them right
now we're in a better air force ones but
i'm more so by for my son down like i
say you get a little bit in the nines in
black and white it was so I knew like my
whole mindset for sneakers changed the
day I was at a sneaker store and i was
getting i was gonna buy some black and
red black and red 12 yeah and i had them
bring out a pair for me and I had to
bring out a pair for my son and then i
looked up and i saw this really cool
north face coat it looks so cute as I
put my sneakers back and I bought him
the code that's bad that I knew that's
what I knew it was it was it was it was
my stupid I even started playing ball in
all my Jordans like I literally played
in my nines tuesday and i never played
in them Oh Mike it's done for me okay
when you get addicted to buying sneakers
you start buying shoes that you probably
you never even wear no I I literally i'm
hanging out now see some el techo she'll
have those i forgot i totally forgot
because I I have them in the boxes
stacked and that gets so lazy that I
just wear the ones that are out over and
over and over and over and then the ones
that are in the box and like I have
something I'm like they look these souls
of brand new they did you ever buy to
put one on ice and then where the other
one i I've done that with different
color before given me I do have
different colors like I bought the
all-black 12s with the little carolina
blue and then I brought the arm the
white the white and black ones yeah it
was those have good resale value I love
the twelves man i love the twelves to
talk about the jordan number 12 yeah but
and i had a couple box that's too like
the ones at the 14s yeah and the nines
yeah how the packs yeah and I've the
nines in black and white in the nines in
all black with tangerine I got that six
is when they reissued them just be
remember when I was really young I
wanted them when they first came out but
my mom wouldn't buy me a pair too
expensive so now that you know like I
can afford them myself even if they are
150 bucks like I think that's the same
story for a lot of sneakers yeah like it
when I was a kid I couldn't get him when
I finally got a job and getting for them
i just started by now yeah that was a
funny guy looked at the box and I was
like what I was like why is the Box had
always come with rich is falling the
riches wearing which is wearing a hey
sue says he's wearing sandals III when I
first came was like why is it the box
that have like one nice pair and one
ugly pair yeah and then obviously I
figured it out later and somebody told
me later on that they accumulated 23
equals the 14 and I make 23 but I think
they put the worst colors in there make
them all black with the black suing
together or put all whites together
don't put the black with the white and
I'm like not okay for me everything past
14 is just ugly yeah you know and so
you're matching the 20s weren't bad
don't you remember they were the ones
with the design on it that and the
velcro around the the sneaker the kind
of didn't have any ankle support okay
but i like them in black we could you
bring up the 48 oh yeah did bring my
black the blacks are cool see I knew I
do air jordans so Michael Jordan was is
like basketball he was 23 right cool but
I like all the cool new ones kind of
resemble an older one yeah people go
crazy for the Space Jam ones they can
raise for this panel I am dude they're
patent leather man I can't even imagine
play bowling patent leather if I figured
you have patent leather only should be
in a band those originally came out when
I went to high school prom and everybody
wore those up and you had your tux I
didn't know why I didn't do it the white
with the black on the bottom like those
ones the white the white black yeah yeah
everybody wear those I mean I'm glad I
didn't but back then I wanted to get
your polos on yeah I probably I did I
really did yeah it's so tacky to me now
wearing sneakers with a tuxedo the
workload um yeah no I agree I mean
sometimes I it's I feel awkward
sometimes if i wear my can go and i wear
sneakers I'm like I think the Kang goes
like one look in the sneakers another
look
I'm confusing people using myself you
know I kinda miss is like taking care of
my sneakers too yeah I would take out
like that toothbrush right and they get
like your white pain and you like scrub
it out you're like iron your shoelaces
and stuff I remember back in the day
when girls used to wear those white
canvas Skippy's they would take the
erasers off the board and Pat them

them the white little technical people
