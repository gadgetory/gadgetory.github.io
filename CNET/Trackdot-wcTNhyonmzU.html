CES 2013 and we have a cool gadget here
that can save you a lot of headache have
you ever had lost luggage when you're
flying from globe attract this is the
track dot luggage they just stick this
guy in your luggage and I'll let you
know where it is but it goes a little
bit more than that what's neat about it
is that it runs on two double A
batteries so right there you don't worry
about chargers and you're on vacation
how many chargers do you bring them to
double-a batteries will last you 28 days
and when it is in your luggage and it's
going faster than 100 miles an hour say
when the airplanes taking off this will
shut down when it slows down again it
comes back on and let you know where it
is so if you're going to New York and it
did come back with you in New York well
it will connect to your phone you're
going to learn your phone but you know
hey it's in Chicago well instead of
sitting around the carousel going where
is my luggage now you can go right to
the guy and say listen my luggage is
here I have an exact address for it and
if you could bring it back to me and
even has bluetooth on this device that
connects to your cell phone so when it's
coming down the carousel and let you
know that's getting closer and closer to
you instead of having you rubberneck
over people and going is it here yet is
it here yet well now you'll know if it's
here or you'll know if someone else went
took it with them it comes with two
double A batteries so you need to have a
charger and it comes with a luggage tag
so it's easy to spot your luggage too
and people know that hey my luggage has
an orange tag on it you get all of this
for 4999 it will be available within
three months so the first quarter of the
year but you're going to be a
subscription service once a year for
1299 Christina I'm Bridget Carey here at
CES 2013 here with the track dot by
globe attract</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
