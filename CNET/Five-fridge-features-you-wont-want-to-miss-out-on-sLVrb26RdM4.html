all sorts of features designed to get
you to buy in and it's not always easy
to separate the gimmicks from the good
stuff fortunately that's where we come
in here at CNET appliances let's take a
look at five fridge features that we
love first up
smudge resistance few things are more
irritating than saving up for a
stainless steel fridge only to find it
covered in your kids fingerprints day in
and day out that's why we're a fan of
fridges that offer a line of defense the
black stainless steel models from LG and
Samsung will both get the job done but
if those are too expensive for your
tastes consider the slate finish lineup
of GE fridges or the smudge proof
stainless steel models from Frigidaire
number two kick-ass water dispensers I'm
talking about GE fridges here they're
the leader when it comes to good water
dispensers they've got auto fill fridges
that'll automatically fill up your glass
pitcher or pot or dispense the exact
amount of water that you need Samsung's
in the mix - its chef collection fridge
will dispense out sparkling water on
demand number three adjustable
temperature zones more and more we're
seeing high and even mid range
refrigerators offer compartments and
drawers with multiple temperature
presets that's a really handy way to
store things like meat and fish or beer
and wine at the specific temperature
you're intended to store them at number
four flexible storage I'm talking about
moveable shelves that slide in slide out
or fold up out of the way to make room
for tall items down below it's an
increasingly common set of features in a
growing number of fridges you can find
it even in top and bottom freezer models
at this point just make sure you shop
around and get your hands on them first
some of them glide smoothly some of them
don't finally smart fridges it's still a
very young and small subgroup of
refrigerators but we are seeing more and
more models that offer app connected
smarts the Samsung family hub
refrigerator is definitely the most
notable option right now it's very
expensive but it does have a huge 21 and
a half inch touchscreen and ingredient
tracking fridge cams and a lot of cool
features you won't find anywhere else
ge is also in the mix with a cafe series
model that has coffee making smarts by
way of that Keurig k-cup attachment so
you can whip up coffee in the morning
from your phone and whirlpools in the
mix with the model that promises to work
with the Nest Learning Thermostat that's
coming later this year we want to see
more you can find reviews of all of
these fridges and more at CNET
komm slash appliances check it out and
stay tuned for a rundown of the five
fridge features we think you should skip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
