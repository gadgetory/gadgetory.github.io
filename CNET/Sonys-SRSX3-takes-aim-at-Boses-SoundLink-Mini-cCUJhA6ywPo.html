smaller models in Sony's 2014 lineup of
portable Bluetooth speakers they very
likeable wireless speaker for its
compact size and $150 price point hi I'm
David Carnot and welcome to another CNET
video review of a portable bluetooth
speaker I'm a fan of the step-up srs x5
which retails for about $50 more and I
like this one a lot - it seems designed
to compete with the Bose Soundlink mini
and delivers big sound for a small size
a basic place as loud as the Bose and
sounds arguably as good or better though
can distort a little at higher volumes
in hand it feels sturdy and has some
heft to it weighing in at around 1.75
pounds with 210 watt 1.3 inch drivers
and dual passive base radiators as you
can see its design is straightforward
and elegant and the speaker itself has a
nice smooth to the touch finish it comes
in a few different colors including
black red and the white you see here as
far as extra features go you get
speakerphone capabilities along with NFC
tap to pair technology for smartphones
that support it there's an audio input
and battery life is rated at around 7
hours which is good but not great the
speaker charges via micro USB which is
better than having a charge with a
separate AC adapter the speaker has a
couple of different sound modes one of
which is designed to widen the
soundstage a bit because speakers like
this with their drivers so close
together offer minimal stereo separation
aside from the design what I like about
the speaker and the step-up x5 is that
they sound relatively natural for
Bluetooth speakers the sound is
relatively clean with good detail in the
treble and clear mid-range the bass
doesn't go quite as deep as the Bose
mini but it does seem a bit tighter
while the bass isn't huge this little
guy managed to have some kick to it and
it does well in smaller rooms and makes
for an excellent little background music
generator the sound does have its
limitations and as I said you can get
some distortion when you crank the
volume aside from that caveat this is
one of the stronger mini Bluetooth
speakers I've tested both in terms of
sound and design and so worthy contender
to the Bose
like many particularly since it cost $50
less I'm David karna wife
