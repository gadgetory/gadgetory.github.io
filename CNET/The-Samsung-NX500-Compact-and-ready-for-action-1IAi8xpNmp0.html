than most competitors giving that it
lacks a viewfinder the samsung nx500
offers a lot of useful features
excellent video quality and action
friendly performance that makes it a
nice choice for families and travelers
I'm Lori grinnin senior editor for CNET
and this is the samsung nx500
the camera is an attractive retro
two-tone it's solid feeling and has a
big enough grip for a comfortable
single-handed shooting as long as the
lens is relatively lightweight I have no
real complaints about the design I do
wish it had a zoom switch on the camera
to control power zoom lenses as some of
its competitors do I don't really like
the feel of the zoom ring on the lens or
the position of the zoom buttons it
doesn't have a built-in flash but
Samsung bundles a hot chick flash the
back display is nicely designed it can
tilt down for overhead shots tilt up for
waist level shots and flip up for
selfies samsung's auto self chop mode
kicks in when you flip it up which
activates the self timer and invokes the
company's Beauty shot that blurs your
skin so that you look like you don't
have any pores one of the NX 500s
notable features is Samsung's auto shot
mode in this mode the camera has several
optimized settings for capturing peak
action a baseball swing shot a jump in
the air shot and a shot that triggers
the shutter when the subject passes a
specific line that you've indicated in
the camera in addition to full-featured
remote shooting options it has a novel
Bluetooth shutter which gives you a
basic shutter in contrast to the full
manual controls that operates quickly
after the initial pairing it's only on
Android of course unsurprisingly the
photo and video quality definitely
surpasses its smaller sensor competitor
the olympus EPL 7 the 4k video is
excellent sharp and reasonably high
contrast for a camera in its price class
the photos look quite good and it's
rendering of colors white balance and
tonal range are very nice I'd say it's
probably one of the better entertainer
lens models under $1000 for photo
quality overall I drank the NX 500s
performance is very good but not
spectacular it takes about 1.6 long
seconds to power on focus and shoot
partly because the lens has
to extend the rest of its times are very
good and it's continuous shooting speed
is excellent at 9.1 frames per second
with autofocus enabled and with a decent
number of InFocus shots as long as you
don't pine for a viewfinder which I
admit I do the samsung nx500 probably
has everything you need in a compact
family and traveling camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
