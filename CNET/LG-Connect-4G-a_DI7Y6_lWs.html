editor at cnet com here to show you guys
the LG Connect 4g for metropcs the LG
Connect 4g is one of metropcs is few 4g
lte-enabled smartphones it's the
carrier's first handset to feature a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor now
unfortunately it does not run on the
latest Android platform ice cream
sandwich instead it runs on android 2.3
gingerbread so hopefully it will be
upgradable sometime in the future it has
a 4-inch nova LCD display which comes
with a corning gorilla glass screen
protector so it's tough and more durable
the screens resolution is 480 x 8 40
pixels and what i really like about the
screen is that it's really bright it has
700 nits of brightness so watching
streaming videos both indoors and
outdoors in direct sunlight is a lot
more enjoyable one thing i noticed was
that some of the graphics weren't very
smooth the pixel density on this phone
is about 242 pixels per inch and when I
played a typical game like fruit ninja I
could see that the images were a little
grainy and pixelated around the edges
now the headphone jack is pretty
standard on every phone but the LG
connect 4g also has the dolby mobile
feature which is supposed to boost your
headphones sound quality and overall
music listening experience on the back
of the LG Connect 4g there is a 5
megapixel camera with an LED flash
there's also a front-facing 0.3
megapixel vga camera that's great for
vanity shots and video messaging overall
I was pretty impressed with this phone
the feel of it is great I have small
hands and I didn't think the phone was
bulky at all it's pretty slim without
feeling too fragile and can fit in my
pocket easily one aesthetic thing that
it did not like and others may not like
this too is the backing the backing has
this plastic you feel to it which kind
of makes it feel cheap but again this is
a personal thing you might not mind it
as much as I do also during my general
usage of the phone I felt the battery
life wasn't really spectacular obviously
this all depends on every individual
persons use but I felt for me it during
pretty quickly after a few hours the LG
connect 4g is one of metropcs is higher
end phones
and it has stronger hardware features
when you compare it to their other fund
that's coming out the Samsung Galaxy
attain this phone is slated for release
next month in February there's no word
on the pricing yet but we do know that
for about 60 bucks you could get
unlimited multimedia streaming access
plus unlimited talk text and 4G LTE web
browsing again this is linh law from
cnet bringing you the LG Connect for
jeans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
