so-called flexible display screens so
the company's first use OLED technology
that allows the TV to achieve superior
picture quality compared to current
plasma and LED TVs this is your very
first look at Corning willow glass this
is actually a bendable glass that we
will see in application soon for those
of you keeping score of the curved phone
market the arch on the G flex is
different from the bend in samsung's
galaxy round which has the left and
right sides curving inward perhaps the
defining point around flexible screens
right now is who gets to flex them
currently it's just a manufacturer for
example look at the samsung galaxy round
phone or the LG curved OLED screen TV
those are flexible screens but they're
flexed in the manufacturing process to
create a fixed curved final product all
of which brings us to the really big
point which is what is the point of a
flexible screen right now it is looking
fairly like a solution hunting for a
problem but there are several prospects
first of which is durability if you've
ever broken your phone or tablet it's
probably because the rigidity of its
screen disagreed with that of a sidewalk
if your mobile device had a screen with
some give it might not break nearly as
often the next prospect is for mobility
the idea the screen can be used to curve
around a part of your body where a
device is worn you don't really want to
take a slab like screen and strap it to
your wrist in the SmartWatch era or four
glasses that could be better contoured
to your face same thing going on inside
of car interiors look around and about
the only thing left that is not some
kind of an organic ovoid in the dash is
that flat screen it could be nice if it
was more mapped to the cars shapes and
finally visibility this is going on
right now and I mean it in the marketing
sense any product today small or large
that has a curved screen is really
standing out in either the retail aisle
or on the web based review page but that
isn't necessarily a functional attribute
for you the end user now I'm not sure if
we're ever going to be carrying a lot of
screens you can roll up and fold and
have them stay intact the next big thing
status of flexible displays remains
one up in the air but it's a fascinating
one to watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
