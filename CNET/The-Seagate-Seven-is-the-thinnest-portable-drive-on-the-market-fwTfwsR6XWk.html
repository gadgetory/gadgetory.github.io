seven turbo drive 7 because is only
seven millimeter thick that is very thin
because most standard laptop hard drive
like this one here actually a nine point
five meter thick this is by far the
skinniest portable drive on the market
it also possibly the toughest because a
drive feature all steel casing with a
very rugged and make the drive look like
internal drive itself when one side come
with a micro USB 3.0 port to connect a
computer for both power and data
connections the drive work with any
standard USB cable like this one here
also included and take a look here it
has a very cool status line right here
that pulls it slightly when there are
data activities now after box the driver
is pre formatted in a fat filesystem and
that means it work with both windows and
my computer right away without any
restrictions the draw is preloaded with
Seagate dashboard backup software now
this software very helpful because help
you backup local files online files and
also mobile devices now the local backup
part is only available for windows
because well if you use a Mac you can
use Tamm machine with this Drive now am
i testing the seven here performed very
well despite how small it is registering
the sustained real-world copy speed of
more than one hundred megabyte per
second with USB 3.0 and that's one cast
that is the drive here has only 500
gigabyte of storage space making it $100
price is kind of expensive because they
get actually two terabyte drive for that
price but then that drive will not be
this rugged v thin or this cool and for
more on this drive check out my full
review at cnet.com and by the way it
destroys super thin profile provoked
that Ojin used to ban it the way you do
the iphone 6 well good luck not gonna
happen
even I can't do it and that's a huge
deal because I'm don't go and this has
been the first look at the Seagate seven
