again to get it on it's a prize fight
punch out between Samsung's Galaxy s8
and Apple's iPhone 7 and don't complain
about this not being fair it's what's
out on the market right now so let's get
it on round one is design
the Galaxy s8 the most beautiful phone
design we've ever seen right now that's
a yes it's all screen with it's easy to
hold narrow body and curved glass that
brings the screen to the edges and
screams do me baby super amoled five
point eight inches with a 570 pixel per
inch density son the fingerprint sensor
on the back isn't the best placement
next to the camera lens it's not that
bad and you'll get used to it but I'm
not going to ignore it well Wow
this design is spectacular and it also
still includes a headphone jack now we
know the iPhone 7 is the older phone of
the two right now but it's basically a
redo of the 6s with a solid-state touch
ID home button without the headphone
jack
it's 4.7 inch LCD display with a 326 PPI
is good but in the tech world you got to
do better than that it didn't stop
people from buying it but when you're
talking design you can't deny the galaxy
s 8 it's the new guy and it should be
the best Samsung takes round one next
round of features you want to just take
a guess at who brings more to the party
let's go down most of the s8 list here a
quad-core Snapdragon 835 four gigs of
ram bluetooth 5.0 for connecting to
bluetooth headsets
I'm not harping on it but there's still
a headphone jack gigabit LTE support
coming later this year two carriers and
USB C it has a fingerprint sensor with
Samsung pay iris scanning for face
unlocking and it still has wireless
charging now Bixby is inactive and
coming later to the US but let's be
honest the best voice recognition comes
from Google and it's integration of the
Google assistant and Google now oh yeah
it's IP 68 water and dust resistant and
can last up to 30 minutes under 3 feet
of water micro SD card support also adds
up to 256 gigs a more storage plus is
compatible with the Samsung gear VR the
gear 360 camera and their Samsung Dex
accessory Samsung's TouchWiz is the
cleanest version of their OS to date
that stays in the background and it may
not woo any iOS users but Team Samsung
knows it's the best OS they've ever had
now I'm not being lazy because you don't
want me to go down a list of a phone
that's a year old but let's be real the
biggest thing keeping people with the
iPhone right now
is its ecosystem and its ease-of-use
it's really good and its power can't be
underestimated oh yeah there's also this
upcoming iPhone 8 but when you stack it
up to every feature the galaxy s 8 has
it's not even close
Samsung takes around two in a landslide
round three is camera our phones are our
cameras and you know what that matters
now both phones bring 12 megapixel
cameras the s8 brings an f1 7 aperture
while the iPhone 7 has an f-18 aperture
the results overall are great but there
are really definitely some differences
Samsung always tends to over saturate
their pictures which can look great on
screen but can come off as a little
unnatural compared to the iPhones now
features like a true optical zoom to get
in close and the portrait mode are on
the iPhone 7 plus and both of those
modes outshine their s8 counterparts if
you're going for the best camera each
has to offer
now the iPhone 7 has neither of these
but it's the s8 that shines when you're
talking about the macro mode on
something like these fish or more shots
from the S eights burst mode even the
snappiness and ease of getting low-light
photos with the s8 is better and the
wider angle of the selfie camera tops
the iPhone as well
overall the s8 s camera is the one
you'll probably want to roll with unless
you got to have that iPhone portrait
mode Samsung takes round three and the
final round is performance
it's a testament to what Apple is done
with hardware and software but the
iPhone 7 can still hold more than its
own against the Galaxy s8 in Geekbench
benchmarks the iPhone 7 single core
performance core was dominant with a 35
27 versus the Galaxy S 8's 1916
now multi-core performance was pretty
close with the s8 coming in at a sixty
eleven and the iPhone 7 at 59
seventy-six but in real-world tests
multiple videos that showcase opening up
a series of apps show the iPhone is the
faster of the two it doesn't mean the s8
is slow at all but Apple has better app
management now when it comes to battery
life we squeeze out about 16 hours of
juice from the s8 and just under 11
hours for the iPhone 7 and then there's
the iPhone 7s antenna issue for cell
data there's a clear difference with
their signal quality if you have an
iPhone with an Intel modem versus the
superior Qualcomm modem and you know
what I experienced it firsthand
now this round is closer than you think
but guess what the Galaxy s8 still takes
round four so let's add up all the
rounds and yes we're still waiting for
the next iPhone but Samsung takes all
four rounds and is your prize fight
winner the looming question is will
Apple bring enough to this year's iPhone
to top the s8 it's always going to come
down to the ecosystem and the platform
you prefer but right now the Samsung
Galaxy s8 is the best phone in 2017 and
Apple has a lot of work to do
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you all next time for
another prizefight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
