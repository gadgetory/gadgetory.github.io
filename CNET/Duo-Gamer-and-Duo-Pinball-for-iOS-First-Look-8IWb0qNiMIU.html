about when iPad accessories go horribly
wrong that's right for all the sleekness
that is an iPad there are a lot of big
bulky accessories they just don't need
and unfortunately Discovery Bay games
has two of them the duo gamer and the
duo pinball what do you need these for
well one place pinball one is a game
controller one of them only works with
one app the other one only works with
five games that one costs $80 one cost
$60 this is a lot of money to pay and
frankly it's just not worth it but let's
go down with each one of them and talk
about why it's not worth it
the duo gamer is at first something I
thought I was gonna be really excited
about it's a game controller for the
iPad now I've really been waiting for
one of these how could it possibly go
wrong well first of all it's $80 that's
$20 more than you'd pay for an Xbox 360
controller or a PlayStation 3 controller
and Discovery Bay games controller does
not feel very good this feels kind of
like something you'd find it maybe a
third-party knockoff worse than that
feels very Hollow and stiff but it does
have dual analog pads sounds great right
well what can you use this with you can
only use it with a select collection of
Gameloft games what well Discovery Bay
claims that this may be the way that
accessories have to work with apps in
the App Store nevertheless you want
something like this to be universal you
want this thing to work with as many
games as possible it does work with the
iPhone and I actually connected an
iPhone 5 and played asphalt 7 on it
that's fun but ridiculous I mean this
thing is so much larger than an iPhone
it's oh it looks like an iphone could
actually fit inside and it runs off of
two double-a batteries that come
included pairs simply via bluetooth
comes with this little stand
but for $80 I mean you don't need this
and that brings us to the duo pinball
now I love pinball and I love pinball
apps
I love pinball apps on the iPad why
wouldn't I like to do a pinball well it
only works with one app or one
collection of apps pinball collection HD
by game problem it's a great collection
of pinball games it's 11 games in there
but there are
pinball apps on the App Store and also
pinball is already a pretty small subset
of gaming and to have it be one app
amongst many apps really limits what
this is going to be used for and it does
work reasonably well but there is a bit
of a delay because of bluetooth so it's
not quite as lightning quick as you'd
expect and here's the thing if you're
gonna play pinball games on an iPad you
can tap on the screen with your fingers
it's really not that hard
above all the games out there that are
hindered by by going to a touchscreen
pinball is definitely not one of them
now as a novelty gift maybe is a $10 $15
item that came with a bunch of pinball
games like classic games like Midway
Bally games I could see this being
something that might be fun to get
somebody but for $60 and not being
compatible with some of the great titles
out there like pinball arcade and the
fact that it feels kind of weird strange
construction that you don't want this
and nobody really wants this peripheral
oh what could have been do Oh gamer duo
pinball what if these things were
compatible with more games when you
consider $80 and $60 equals 140 dollars
is $60 less than the entry-level price
of an iPhone 5 well what are you
spending money on these things for I'm
Scott Stein and that's a look at some of
the accessories I wouldn't buy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
