from comic-con 2012 welcome to the apple
pie yeah what ridiculous what Jamie look
this is hot i have my arc reactor here
oh you hear that my blaster this is wait
are you serious yes you all right guys
you heard the boss just give me a second
there we go all right guys and gals it's
all the good and bad inside the world of
Apple and there's a bundle of the iphone
5 rumors so let's get you up to speed
with those first now everyone is talking
about the potential chance of a slimmer
iphone and the wall street journal is
confirming an earlier april rumor that
apple's next-gen phone will use in cell
technology to make the screen thinner
now the technology integrates touch
screen sensors into the LCD removing the
separate touchscreen layer that makes
the whole screen thinner by half a
millimeter and also improves the image
quality at the same time the journal
also claims production of the screens
has already started by LCD makers sharp
LG and japan display incorporated now a
thinner screen could make the whole
device even thinner believe it or not
where Apple could even use that extra
space for a larger battery yeah I'm
saying gave me more battery now some
reports claim the iphone is already in
production but a boy genius report says
the device is in the third engineering
verification test phase it's at least
three months out and has not entered the
design verification test phase yet see
you guys try saying that fast three
times design verification test phase I'm
parapente face of ifs your face now the
report also claims they've confirmed
several hardware details including not
surprisingly integrated 4G LTE
connectivity a bump up to 1 gigs of ram
and NFC tech as well and if you still
don't believe the parts floating around
the internet and image of the purported
front faceplate for the white next-gen
iphone was leaked out earlier this week
that again features the facetime camera
center at the top instead of
the side of the speaker and Chinese case
makers from TVC mall are moving forward
with their case designs before a phone
is even an ounce now I got to love my
people and this design features a taller
phone with a smaller dock connector
opening and a headphone jack port on the
bottom of the phone like we've seen from
leaked photos and specs but it still
doesn't mean this is the real deal now
speaking of real how about some actual
stories that are really happening and
not just pure speculation at this point
apple recently won a patent for a
removable iphone case that cuts down on
background noise calling it a wind
screen design it's designed to reduce
wind noise air blasts and other noises
perfect for my Apple buyers in chitown
wud up and it's also clever idea but
we'll see if Apple does anything with
this in the future now I've primarily
avoided all the back-and-forth with all
these patent lawsuits between Apple and
Samsung and other companies on this show
but I won't today after a UK judge ruled
Apple must display on its UK website for
six months and also in British
newspapers and magazines a published
advertisement acknowledging that Samsung
did not copy the design of the iPad with
the galaxy tab 10.1 now the UK Court had
ruled earlier that the galaxy 10.1 was
simply not as cool as the iPad now take
a look at this exclusive the Apple bite
was lucky enough to get our hands on
Apple's proposed ad campaign that makes
it very clear to the naked eye that
Samsung did not copy them now there's
also an iPad design Samsung would never
have copied during jony ive's deposition
he referenced an early iPad prototype
that was produced sometime between 2002
and 2004 network world was unable to
track down the images of that iPad
prototype even though it almost looked
as thick as an iBook back then it took
many of those design cues into a thinner
version of the current iPad we have
today alright guys onto the quick bites
and the third beta of iOS 6 was released
to developers and there are a few
nuggets of info to pull from it the
biggest is that iphone 3gs users were
shown a little unexpected love as Apple
has now added the VIP list feature in
email and photostream sharing for 3gs
users you'll also have the ability to
adjust the navigation voice volume level
in maps
that we all wish we could do to our
significant others at times and auto
brightness increases gradually instead
of instantly plus I message on the iPad
now accepts phone numbers and there's
other small improvements as well and we
wanted to update you on Apple dropping
out of EP well it looks like they've
heard the backlash from consumers and
governments who would no longer be able
to purchase their computers the key word
being purchase they have her listed the
previously deregistered products just
days after leaving it and the macbook
pro retina still remains the only
ineligible product at the moment alright
guys now a lot of you have also been
asking me about my macbook air jordan
that i posted on twitter you know that
one it's sexy well I talked to my good
buddies at decals for macbooks calm and
they are hooking up the apple byte
nation with a twenty percent off code
that's good until August the 16th so you
have everything from Star Wars The
Simpsons to Banksy and cool other
patterns and designs you'll find it here
and yes you can have a macbook air
jordan of your own to just enter the
code see you at 20 when you check out
see I'm looking out for all of you
alright friends that's going to do it
for this week send us your emails to the
apple byte at cnet com i'm brian Tong
and we'll see you next week for another
bite of the Apple oh man look at this
thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
