stage here at e3 2018 I'm Ashley ask Ewa
you may not know me if you watch a lot
of GameSpot
I'm over on Sina and I hope the show
called stream economy and I thought it
would be really fun to bring some of my
friends here to the show and talk about
their favorite games and maybe their
least favorite games that they've seen
during the show and during all the press
conferences so hello and welcome I'm
ashley Esqueda and let's introduce our
lovely guests to my immediate left here
I have Wil Wheaton oh oh favorite people
in the whole world one of my second
favorite people in the whole world thank
you and of course my third favorite
person in the world Patrick Ryan hey
guys who is who is we're really feeling
our Brittany's yeah yeah Britni Mike's
yeah where we actually are Sauron you
know I love her anyway I don't care we
are using these are our real voices
we're not we're not lip syncing all
right well let's jump right into it so
one of the concepts of stream economy is
your time is money and so we want to
make sure that you know what you should
be investing your your time and your
energy your feelings and so I'm stead of
money cuz who cares about that so let's
talk about the show and some of your
favorites we'll start out with that I
know all of you have some specific games
that you want to talk about so let's
start with Ron what do you want to talk
about okay okay well I didn't expect
that I would like fallout 76 I didn't
think I wanted to fallout that's online
with people but it looks really fun it
looks almost Monster Hunter ish in a way
yeah and then also I get to build my own
settlements in the end and bomb my
friends take with you I'm really I was
also very skeptical because they're like
oh it's it's online and there's gonna be
other people and those are the other
kind of NPCs right we're all kind of our
own
folks and I was like oh I don't want to
play fallout online but then when they
said it would only be dozens of people
on a server as opposed to hundreds or
thousands of people on a server all
spawn camping the same quest right I
feel better about that and now I've
decided I'd like to live my life in the
wastelands as a traveling band with
three other people so the trailer the
trailer is so great it made me listen to
the bluegrass roots playlist on Spotify
and I love the Fallout universe so much
that I if that might actually get me out
of my multiplayer games must die cocoon
are you gonna join my band I'll join
your band yeah I don't know if I have 12
friends right here I think we got 76
you know I think so I'm of the same
mindset as I don't love a lot of people
in my gaming experience you know unless
they're there for a reason I don't want
to be competing for the same you know
like bort us cuz six other people but
you know I like the fact that it's the
apocalypse and maybe we'll run into
somebody maybe we won't and not
necessarily gonna be there you know the
way destiny was where they're always
there so you know yeah I'll get it on
the band I do like that they kind of
retcon to the entire Fallout franchise
by saying well this is why the wasteland
the Weiss society has not been built
back up and all of those previous fall
outs because you guys have all just been
nuking each other this I didn't like the
idea that humanity learned nothing from
the great war because when that
eventually happens of course we'll learn
nothing for nothing you also really like
control right yeah I'm excited about
control I love remedy I love the work
that they do quantum break was one of my
favorite games the last couple of years
it was a really fun game I thought it
was really fun very underrated I thought
the TV show aspects of it was pretty
good as well but I'm okay with them
getting rid of the TV show focusing all
in the game it looks like a mixer like
quantum break and in this game I love
called psyops back in the day with all
these psychic powers and telekinesis and
I'm really excited about it looks
beautiful yeah that trailer looks really
amazing one of the trailers that I saw
that maybe you guys might have missed
was ghosts of Tsushima no I saw it that
looks
that's that sucker-punch game that we
were talking about and like oh my god
like does anybody has anyone played or
seeing ghosts over in the Sony but it
looks amazing it's so beautiful
open-world samurai gonna live my Kill
Bill fantasy I'm so excited for it okay
so well what did you what have you seen
out of the show that you're really
excited about i i am beyond excited for
The Last of Us - yes it is I think the
best game trailer I've ever seen in my
life the most beautiful cinematic just
the technical prowess of that trailer
blew me away
it was almost breaking - like the
happiness like juxtapose war it's like
brutal dogs it just like it was like all
of the emotions I had from finishing the
last of us had settled down into this
like emotional silt in my psyche and
that was just like a wave that stirred
it all up oh hey remember all your feels
and I'm really excited for it and I love
that in in that trailer they resisted
the urge to go from this beautiful
cinematic like like narrative experience
in the trailer they resisted the urge to
move from that into and now here's our
gameplay better than that I thought they
definitely so glad they didn't do that
and I just like if I were handing out
awards I would give them all to whoever
cut that trailer why don't you just
bring your own awards every year all
right the we t4 trailer I love the most
goes to the Last of Us and Ellie Velez
go team yeah
okay Patrick so what about you what did
what have you seen that you're the most
excited about I think I'm excited about
Tomb Raider honestly like I love Tomb
Raider and I love that she's gone full
Rambo this time and just you know mud
all over her face going stealth mode
just brutally killing everybody like I
love Tomb Raider and I like the trailer
they like she caused the problem you
know she's the one who had woken
whatever's going on you know she always
just runs into these tombs willy-nilly
and she's like I'll take this I'll take
this I'll take this and you know who
cares what happens so I like that
they're gonna deal with some of the
consequences this time and I'm just I'm
really excited I'm glad it's not an
exclusive this time I was so mad last
time yeah yeah I'm glad that it's not
even a I don't even think I've time Dix
no just like straight up everybody
finally I played it the demo of this at
a few weeks ago and I have to say
there's there's a sequence where you are
running away from a lot of water so like
a flood sequence when you're running and
they take you off the rails and normally
in a game like that like you're kind of
going through and it's sort of a
QuickTime motion and you're you're
pretty well-protected you just have to
hit the buttons at the right time my
friends I got impaled so many times over
and over again on a spike because I
couldn't make one specific jump I kept
trying it over and over again and then
finally I figured out like oh I'm
actually going completely the wrong way
because they don't show you anything
like you they just say look it's just
like Lara is figuring it out so are you
yeah here here's an emergency figure it
out I was a little kid I had a
reoccurring nightmare that I was caught
in a flood don't play I was caught in a
flood and like 1:00 in the LA River like
with the concrete channel and you can't
get out check it out and Venus the water
in there like getting anxiety just
listening to you talk about that yeah
maybe I maybe I'm gonna give that a pass
very stressful okay so we talked a
little bit about games you're super
excited about that our triple a huge
game so there any like smaller sort of
indie games that you've maybe seen that
excite you and anyone can jump in on
this
it's not necessarily an indie game but
I'm really excited for that jump game
that looks exciting where I can fight in
our Udo and go yeah I'm super excited
about that he's bringing all my favorite
anime characters together to fight each
other I'm all about it they should just
jump in the Super Smash Brothers and put
it all together we go we should stop by
Nintendo and just let them know just in
case they're looking for more than the
65 fighters they already have they could
just add a few more cool in there what I
love is that Nintendo is like hey people
who love smash here's a giant birthday
present with a pinata and a cake and
like a million dollars and everybody's
like yeah but that one guy I like can't
say that now because everyone's in this
game that's not what Twitter says Yeah
right it's mad someone's left out well
everyone's mad about waluigi yeah yeah i
understand why luigi stands i understand
i had to ask my friend Felix what the
name of their game was because I've seen
it and I didn't know what the name of it
is I'm beyond excited for it so my
friend Felix works for a studio called
fin G okay and they have a game coming
out called
that is like you look like you're like a
little kind of like Elfie Nome kind of
person and you're like cruising around
like a Super Mario Odyssey style kind of
platformer thing and it is freaking
adorable
and it is exactly like I started gaming
on the Atari 2600 I really came of age
playing on the Nintendo Entertainment
System
so platformers are like that is where my
heart and soul live yes I love
open-world they're great but like a
little platformer where I can predict
what I'm supposed to do this game looks
amazing and I love that it's a tiny
little indie title yeah I am I really so
I'm really into indie games that's like
Ike weird little indie games are some of
my favorite games I recently picked up
west of loading on the switch which is
awesome you should totally play that if
you haven't played it but I'm really
excited for as a as a Kickstarter backer
a part of the Kickstarter backers
I am really excited for blood stains on
switch and ps4 like it's coming out on
like almost every platform I
it's basically Castlevania it's it's
Symphony of the night and so but but
remade like for a new era and a new name
and all that stuff with ego so I'm
really looking forward to that I get to
play in I think tomorrow so I'm like
really excited about checking that out
okay so we've talked about big games
talk about little games now we get to
talk about games that like may be
questionable like I'm and I don't mean
like quality wise cuz there are great
games out there but things that maybe
you're not super interested in playing
like your saw it and you're like wow
it's a really big game it's not for me
but other people I'm sure love it
for me like guys I gotta be honest this
is a big confession please don't rush
the stage and cause a riot
I don't know how excited I am about
death stranding yeah I'd same I don't
get it I don't get it
and I so I love Metal Gear and I love
Hideo Kojima's games but I see every
trailer for death surrounding and I'm
like this game is getting weirder and
weirder and I don't know if I enjoy the
idea that it's weird for the sake of
being weird and so uh yeah this trailer
to me is crazy if anyone understands it
please come on stage and explain it to
me because I would love to hear your
opinions but for me like the whole thing
where norm arenas is carrying a
suspended baby inside a backpack and
then he's carrying more stuff in a
backpack and he's sort of a katamari but
a human it's really bizarre and I don't
know what is going on here in him I you
know what I eat baby I don't but when I
mean did you see this trailer guys think
I watched a I have I'm on a riding
deadline so I had to choose the trailers
that I watched before I came in today I
didn't watch this but I will say this
just based on my knowledge of Kojima
this trailer looks super weird this game
looks incredibly bizarre but everything
he does has an internal logic I know
like maybe maybe maybe part of what is
going to make this cool is like maybe as
a player you have to do some work and
meet him where he is
I don't I don't mind reiative Lee after
to him a little bit yeah I really don't
mind that especially at a time in
prometheus five like the trailer for a
like so many games are so derivative of
the same five ideas that like I just
love that if you're if you've had it
with first-person shooters if you're if
you're bored to death with like with
multiplayer battle games here's
something that is super weird and way
outside of that it absolutely looks so
so I'm willing I'm willing to in favor
in the back end you know I don't get it
these spaces and walk into me i'ma buy
it I'm a player
Jonnie Jonnie letter C Oh Johnny God you
know probably the world spanning
gorgeous with ladders history I want to
play the game where you play as Johnny
ladders and you walk around all
different game anymore
Tron just cancel this for you when they
announced the mobile Elder Scrolls game
yeah blades way scrolls black oh man I
was so excited because I I live in
Skyrim so Ashley and I are
extraordinarily good friends in real
life yeah and we talk about games all
the time and one of the things that has
come up for like two years is hey will
why don't you play Skyrim and the answer
is always because if I do I'm just gonna
fall in it and never leave so according
to my dashboard eight and a half days of
game playing ago that's a 24 hour games
of gaming ago I started Skyrim so I was
you're gonna get it you're definitely
gonna get a tweet from Felicia Day about
this I know because I teased her so hard
about it
yeah I know and now I'm gonna start
fighting with her about how my houses
are better than hers but I was so
excited for this game and right up until
they were like and it's free because
there's another way to say that which is
this game's gonna be awesome until we
bring in the microtransaction give us
all your money
idiots ha ha ha I'm super bummed about
it I was so excited it looks amazing I
know okay so fallout shelter did any of
you guys play fallout shelters yeah my
olaf all shudder so if you play fallout
shelter Bethesda I think has done a
really good job of giving you a game
that you can literally just play right
like you don't have to buy anything you
can buy the lunchboxes and get like
extra characters legendary vault
dwellers things like that but like you
don't need it and I think for my first
year of playing fallout shelter I never
bought anything yeah but it was a year
and then you gave in I was like I feel
like I've given this game so much time
that I'd like to give money to the
developers like I felt like she's like
sure I feel like I've gotten so much
value out of this game that paying ten
five bucks for a lunchbox or whatever
feels okay like I that's kind of how I
judge my free-to-play games now cuz
there's still many of them and I have a
feeling we're gonna be seeing even more
going forward like fortnight is a really
good example I think they've done a
really good job of giving you a free
game that is extremely full and like fun
and people really like it and my god
they're the for tonight pro-am yesterday
it was like a stadium that they filled
up it was crazy but you can also just
customize your character and buy like
cool clothes or you know dance moves or
whatever it is like cosmetic stuff but
see like I never really participate in
the microtransactions like I don't know
what it is it's like a thing where I
just I mentally refuse to do it like
I'll go to Starbucks every day and spend
five dollars on a coffee but it's fake
Alliance for a new outfit I'm like no I
will not I will put that i star play i
will play for sixteen hours to get that
outfit but I will not pay fifty cents
for it I'm seeing I'm a person who's
like I'll spend that money and I don't
have a problem spending money on games I
fully believe in supporting developers I
want to pay to support development I
want to pay to support my fellow artists
hey you want a pair
yeah shut up and take my money I agree
and they don't give me part of a game
give me a demo I'll take a demo no box
meet no link box
everybody overwatch is the only one that
did it right and then they started put
in they put it in my son's for the game
and ruined it they put it in my NBA 2k
game and ruined it put in my wrestling
game and it ruined it I hate it just let
me again they said let me pay upfront
I'm happy to play 60 if 170 tell me you
want 70 right don't you come by and then
try to just steal money from me and
that's what it feels like there was some
way that they could because there is a
thing about like when a game is
free-to-play it absolutely opens that
game up to people who don't have $70 and
on a game and it involves them in the
gaming community and I'd like that's rad
and I'm super okay with that likes are
cool but I wish there was a way that if
you are fortunate and you can afford to
just pay upfront you can just sort of
like oh cool I want to opt out of this
part of the thing I still want to be in
the economy of the game and still want
to be in the world of the game where
they say like if you pay X amount of
dollars it's ad free right you unlock
all the stuff yeah
but if it's all cosmetic stuff then a
lot of people go well that's not worth
it I don't want any of this other
cosmetic stuff except for this one thing
like you know I'm eight so it's like
it's a tough thing but the good news is
is that this year at the show like there
was very much a de-escalation of loot
boxes like even you know battlefront
they were like yeah we're done with that
now like we're gonna go ahead and like
them companies are learning their
lessons very quickly like eh you know
learn to really lessen this year and I
think that that's probably the case you
know I just don't like the games that
make you pay to keep playing like some
eight eight hours where you can play
again right by this and like no now
that's never fun never nobody wants to
do that I like your don't loop box me I
think it needs to be a t-shirt okay
right there come back next year
alright boxes yeah I think I'd be really
good okay so other games you're
skeptical about is there anything like
really big that you saw they were like
oh I don't know I'm in a little
go ahead good just a little bit about
smash brothers because I was just really
hoping for a new game you know and I
understand that they're given a lot with
all the new characters and everything
but it is basically the Wii U version of
the game and so I was a little
disappointed by that but I'm sure I'll
get over that quickly you're like just a
little iffy about about paying a full 50
60 for it again that's fair and know why
Luigi yes
don't be an add-on later you can pay for
I'm too old for Luigi like waluigi kate
like was introduced to the world when i
was already like a curmudgeonly old man
yeah I have no emotional investment at
all as long as like Wario I'm yeah I'm
even too old for Wario but like as long
as I've got my Mario and I've got my
Louise Smash Brothers oh yeah I'm Way
too old for Smash Brothers yeah it's not
free I don't get it at all my kids are
crazy about it well my kids my kids are
in high school their friends would come
over they would fill my house with the
stink of sweaty teenage kids and they
would have these crazy Smash Brothers
tournament things that they were nuts
about and I was like anybody want to go
to the arcade and play karate champ a
little bit yeah and they were like
you're lame I was like I know I know
please let my brothers know like you
can't play Smash Brothers you're bad at
it yeah oh so bad at it I like to watch
it yeah I'm terrible at it I got to see
that they like so much fun but I'm just
terrible
I'm that guy going off every time I'm
one of those cars that's just animated
guys but I'm kind of just going in a
circle and you're like why are those
people fighting over their lives down
yeah it's too much for me play smash
yeah I get it for sure
yeah I love Smash I'm just a little bit
I just wanted a brand new product but
that's
you're open for all new yeah I I get it
I think I think it's a good point I
think it's a good is a good argument to
be made does that a lot they did it with
Mario Cart
it was basically the same game again and
I think an important thing to keep in
mind is so few people got a Wii U that
they like I loved Mario Kart 8 and I was
really sad on Wii U that I had nobody to
play with
my little game dad no one to play with
this is so depressing and now I get to
play tons of people on the switch and so
I I get it like in a way I kind of
understand like though well we have this
like amazing engine that we had and used
and like why not use this again yeah can
- we've seen like a lot of you know what
you can do with Smash Brothers you know
like it's is what it is yeah the concept
is there you know you can update the
graphics and maybe a few of abilities
but for the most part to get you know
the game is the game at this can I like
I do like that it's an ultimate mode
with everybody like I think that's
really cool um okay so I am curious
because this is a game that people have
been waiting for for a really long time
what you guys think and feel about
Kingdom Hearts 3 does anyone have a
strong opinion about Kingdom Hearts
I thought the trailer was really weird
like the very first one the Pirates of
the Caribbean one way it was just like
randomly cut together of all the people
having played Kingdom are no I haven't
but if I can play as Keira Knightley I'm
in all right have you guys I have I am
so far out of the demo for that game
I've never played it the only thing that
I even know about their bad head looks
just like Sora's hair well oh well sure
that that is that that head picture
everywhere is Instagram and I'm like
it's just like Sora well all I know
about it is what my crew who look from
Penny Arcade talks about but my
information about it is like three years
out of date I just like I rarely feel
like well I'm a 46 year old dad and I
really feel that way is when Kingdom
Hearts comes up ah
a nerd I thought you'd be really into
this I know that's what everybody says
I know I listen I'm with you I'm shocked
played Kingdom Hearts I have play
Kingdom Hearts I don't like it I don't
care for it I don't it's guy seems like
I'm very middle-of-the-road RPG to me
with a bunch of Disney elements that I
also don't care about Disney function
I'm sure that was interesting that
wasn't the controversial statement I
expected it happy people understand just
shudder this project get back to work on
the Final Fantasy 7 remake and forget
about this we didn't hear anything about
Final Fantasy 7 remake I also made a
joke yesterday that I think we should
have Aerith and Smash Brothers and then
her trophy would be like Sephiroth come
down and stab her boiler alert guys but
then it was a stunt because everyone
would be crying all the other fighters
would be crying because it was so sad
like anything music would play it would
be a really good that would be a really
good ultimate idea of a stun attack that
just emotionally take me back to my 16
year old self in high school playing
Final Fantasy 7 it's like oh like that's
that was my emotional stunning that was
a good one I know I'm I'm with you i am
i think ff7 doneita don't need the
Kingdom Hearts I'm excited about Kingdom
Hearts but also like really I think I'm
really need that Final Fantasy 7 remake
news yeah I just like a new sequel to
the old Genesis Aladdin game over
Kingdom Hearts give me that oh man that
was a really good game great game me so
many memories oh my god that escape from
the sands like it's so good just putting
your head underneath the Mickey Mouse
ears and getting a free life that was
the best try November when that game
came out and it was like how did they do
this animation
okay look like the movie like that was
it's rare that a game excites me the now
the way that I go ahead to the Cave of
Wonders and without the escape was so
good okay we got like three minutes left
okay I think we got like a half hour
look producer look in our show us a half
an hour right not an hour okay I just
want to double check I got really scared
there for a second okay I want to do a
quick fire questions for you I want to
give everybody an idea of what kinds of
gamers you are based on these quick
questions and I'm excited to ask them to
you because I think they're gonna be
very illuminating so we'll go through
them really quickly favorite game of all
time cata Maradona C good one
Super Mario 3 called 1964 that is an
aged well book publishers please make a
katamari dama C for the new generation

much yeah yeah we all need that I think
we can all agree we do okay most hated

everything you don't have enough time
basically our depression in a game yeah
I hate it time toys I hate the way that
makes me feel because it's beautiful and
it's perfect in literally every other
every other way I feel like with cuphead

relationship
I am it's true what about you I mean
Kingdom Hearts I hate oh we knew that
