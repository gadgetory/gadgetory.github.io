and if there's a company that defines
the actioncam market it's go pro and
last year its hero 3 black edition was
definitely a big step forward for the
company and although not without issues
it turned out some great video for 2013
the hero 3 plus builds on that success
improving things like Wi-Fi and battery
life and adding some shooting features
to keep the Black Edition as a leader in
the category the design is still the
same though you now get a smaller
lighter and consequently less waterproof
housing the controls are the same for
better or worse and the ports and
battery size are the same too now a big
issue with all action cams really is
battery life and gopro now claims up to
two hours but that's with Wi-Fi often
recording at 1080p at 30 frames per
second your mileage may vary of course
and you'll probably still want to buy
extra batteries Wi-Fi performs better
with the GoPro app giving you less delay
with the preview and the app is also the
best way to make setting changes because
navigating with the onboard controls or
the included Wi-Fi remote can be
frustrating there are a couple other
additions like an auto low-light option
that will drop frame rate so necessary
but really it's all about the video and
that's still really good if you're just
looking for something to upload clips to
YouTube you and your bank account might
be better served by something else but
if video quality is most important this
is it I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look
at GoPros hero 3 plus black edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
