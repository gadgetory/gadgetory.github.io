think we've done yet yeah even better
than the skydiving yeah we're on a boat
with a whole pod of dolphins surrounding
us and taking pictures with our new
action cam I know we're so old school
we're actually using cameras instead of
phones so I am gonna try out the
hopefully waterproof and otherwise
rugged fujifilm finepix XP 200 and you
have the olympus tough TG 2d now both of
these are supposed to be good underwater
up to about 50 feet we're gonna test it
with just snorkeling in the water and
then we're gonna hand them off to some
divers to try to take them just a tiny
bit deeper
thank good to Bert
oh my God look at this job just there
nature
dude pretty good huh yeah that's
outstanding
all right I have to say so far our
cameras are holding up pretty well yeah
it's gonna come down to image quality
okay so we have the two Tim's here yeah
we wanted to make it fair so we got to
Tim's we didn't want to have that make
them more off exactly and the Tim's are
diver
we are not edge of ever IR dive
certified so we're gonna go ahead and
give each of you a camera
Tim's are you ready you're all right
down to two Tim's in the water two tips
in the ladder damn it I think one thing
we can guarantee is that Tim would
Olympus might be done oh no it was odd
all the way to 130 feet at lost focus
around 80 man just when they started
coming up she shut off really she had an
event
so went 100 it was mine yeah floor tour
still taking pictures of the other 10 in
130 oh sweet
it's got me much more fun than that God
probably always
so I'm assuming there may be some water
in yours I dried mine off to open the
battery compartment which we take
unlocking it okay
there's definitely moisture in there all
right
a little water right there oh let's yeah
that might be what happened to it okay
just because my camera doesn't work
anymore and every glass surface has
moisture under it
Oh doesn't mean the pictures might not
be amazing let's check them out okay oh
nice shot though Thanks
Wow Wow oh wow I know that was a great
that was a moment ever
that's a great photo that's been you got
a print that yeah you know put that on
the wall I have to say that I'm thinking
that image quality is almost a draw at
this point I agree unfortunately for
your camera that does not appear to be
the deciding factor it was fine down to
50 feet but low that not so much I think
that both of these cameras did a great
job with pictures and video both
absolutely I would feel perfectly
comfortable taking any of these on a
snorkeling trip I just think if you're
gonna mess up maybe go a little more
rugged yeah that ultimately the Fujifilm
stayed strongest it's a little unfair it
says right on the front fifty feet so we
did exceed that but if you're gonna
award a winner the guy that can go
beyond and still hold up has got to be
the winner yeah I mean I think it's
clear that even in non optimal
circumstances the fujifilm finepix XP
200 is
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
