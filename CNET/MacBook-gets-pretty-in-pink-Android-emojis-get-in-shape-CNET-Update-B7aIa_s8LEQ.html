android emojis get in shape and a new
PlayStation may be plugged into the
metrics I'm Bridget Carey this is your
seen an update apple just gave a
hardware upgrade to last year's 12-inch
MacBook you know the one that comes in
gold and only has one port to do
everything well the new macbook now has
a faster processor chip although it's
not as beefy as the processors in other
macs apple also says you can get one
more hour battery life out of this and
it comes in rose gold of course price is
still the same starting at around
thirteen hundred dollars but if you're
looking for something more interesting
from Apple and you'll have to wait
another two months Apple announced that
its annual worldwide developers
conference known as WWDC will kick off
on june thirteenth Apple has this
colorful little dost looking tease about
what may come this event is when Apple
talks about new software and operating
systems last year Tim Cook unveiled
Apple music at the event and that's not
all in Apple news the company has
confirmed that it will no longer patch
security problems for windows QuickTime
this comes after security experts warn
people to uninstall quicktime for
windows even the US Department of
Homeland Security told people to get rid
of the program because there are ways
hackers can use it to infect your
computer but this can be a headache for
some folks because some of the dobies
programs do require QuickTime the Apple
version of quicktime is safe so if you
really need it for work see if you can
use a Mac over on the other side of the
valley Google's YouTube is now live
streaming 360 degree videos so you can
look up down and all around during a
live broadcast and big news in the world
of emoji Android emojis soon won't look
like ugly no gender blob sex Google
tease the new look of the new emoji
coming in the next Android and update
this year and many will look human
Smiley's no longer have those dragging
butt flaps and look more like gumdrops
plus there are brand new icons to
represent different food objects and
people there's even one for taking a
selfie now there's no word on when the
new emoji will land on Android but
perhaps before
even get the new emoji there could be a
new Playstation yeah multiple sources
have confirmed to our sister site Giant
Bomb that Sony is working on an upgraded
PlayStation that would be faster with
improved graphics and higher memory
bandwidth it's code name is neo whoa it
may not be able to stop bullets but it
could potentially be better for playing
in virtual reality I mean plane in the
matrix that's all for this tech news
roundup and you can head to cnet.com for
