Nev Schulman rail Schulman and henry
joost who are the three people behind
the movie catfish which is not the
facebook movie that tells the story of
Facebook but the facebook movie that is
documentary about sort of the impact
facebook is having in our lives and
catfish might sound like an unusual name
for maybe what is a catfish Nev Wow
catfish is an experience it's it's a
moment in your life where you decide to
go outside of your comfort zone take a
chance put yourself on the line let go a
little bit and hopefully come out the
other side having learned something and
experience something that is important
and valuable and hopefully fun and
exciting and emotional it's it's uh yeah
it's a sort of that letting go and do
you guys have a catfish story of your
own besides the one the one that's in
the movie well that what happens to us
in the movie is probably the craziest
thing that will ever happen to us in our
lives certainly so far so I guess the
biggest catfish in my life is my brother
and he's impulsive and and sort of a
daredevil and he keeps us on our toes
and you'll understand from the movie
what just what kind of person a catfish
is um yeah I'd also say these guys are
my biggest biggest catfish in my life
rels my filmmaking catfishing is my life
catfish and obviously the movie is about
a relationship that starts out and
develops on facebook are you guys still
active social media users what do you
recommend for folks out there yeah i'm
still at least I mean I talk about
enough the internet how can you not be
but hey yeah then what you know these
days slough what's next for you guys I
guess we'd like to make another sort of
radical movie about about real people
maybe not a documentary but something
based on true life yeah I mean for me it
is a combination of the movie coming out
and it's sort of being so personal and
all the people that are meeting all the
traveling in the press and the sort of
heightened intensity of this experience
of sort of tempted to to take a break
leave my computer my cell phone behind
and maybe just sort of like go paddle
boating across the Caribbean or you know
I don't know just a total paddle boating
or maybe just rent a paddle boat even
like in the in the Caribbean or
somewhere awesome and just take a couple
weeks or a month or why I wanted a
measure specifically I don't know I've
always loved the open water and seems
like a great way to get from small
island to small island maybe the
Galapagos that can be paddled living in
the Galapagos that's what I want to do
and you go fishing and maybe even catch
a catfish noodling also this fun even
interestingly that is one of the cameras
that part of catfish is shots true well
so i'm just using a handheld cannon here
for those that can't see it well thanks
a lot guys for cnet I'm unif read the
movie is catfish it starts coming out in
September in a few cities and it's going
to spread out to more of the country for
