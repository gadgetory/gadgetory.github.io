phone you may be giving up your Fifth
Amendment rights I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update
a recent case in Los Angeles has stirred
up questions about your constitutional
right to remain silent
the Fifth Amendment protects you from
incriminating yourself giving you the
right to not say a word in a court of
law
so no one can force you to verbally give
up your password to any phone or app or
service but biometric passwords are
falling under a different set of
standards in courtrooms
in LA authorities obtained a warrant to
compel a woman to unlock her iPhone with
her fingerprint so they could search
through the phone they have the right
but by putting her fingerprint on the
phone some legal experts argue that she
just testified without saying a word
validating the contents of the phone and
giving up her Fifth Amendment right now
the other side of the argument is that
searching a phone is no different than
getting keys to search an apartment when
you have a warrant but while you ponder
the two sides remember this when a phone
is rebooted it requires a passcode you
cannot just use a fingerprint so this
request would be useless for law
enforcement and also touchy on the
privacy rights side is something Sony is
working on the company just patented a
contact lens that records video and it's
controlled by blinking it's able to tell
the difference between voluntary and
involuntary blinking can tech companies
should stay away from my eyeballs just
the other day Google filed a patent to
inject tech into your eye to help
correct vision I'm getting an itchy eye
just thinking about all this stuff and
other tech you can wear IBM designed a
dress from model Karolina Kurkova to
wear at the Met Gala in New York on
Monday technology and fashion was the
theme for the Knights costume
extravaganza and this IBM dress used
watson technology to light up in
different ways depending on what people
were saying to her on social media the
lights changed for different emotions
conveyed Claire Danes wore a stunning
glowing gown with embedded fiber optics
but most other outfits just took the
tech theme to mean hey let's dress up to
look like silver robots or in the case
of Lady Gaga robot hookers
Zayn Malik just looks like a cyborg in a
tux and Katy Perry seem to have
channeled the spirit of encryption with
all those keys dangling off her and
there's also a tamagochi around her
waist
I'll give her points for that that's all
for this technique up you can head to
