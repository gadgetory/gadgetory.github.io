Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the Apple TV streaming box has
added HBO go and watch ESPN these apps
tap into HBO shows in ESPN broadcast but
you can only access them if you already
pay for cable there's also Sky News and
a crunchy roll app for anime Apple TV
owners could have watched video before
from an ipad or iphone app and then just
streamed it to their TV sets using the
airplay feature it's just that now they
can pull up the videos directly from the
Apple TV box oh and there are some weird
exceptions the HBO Go app isn't
available for direct TV or charter
subscribers and those with dish or
directv can't use the ESPN app thanks
lawyers iPhone users don't have to
suppress their emoticons any longer on
facebook in the latest version of the
iOS app facebook users can add little
Smiley's and other faces to their status
updates it's something people could
already do on the desktop website
including adding graphics for when
you're watching something reading or
eating but keep in mind when you share
that you're watching or reading
something specific like say the great
gatsby the book is going to be added to
the books section of your profile but
aside from the silly stuff the update
does have an important new feature you
can change the privacy settings on the
post that you've already shared that
security feature was also just added to
the Android app in the latest twist of
the National Security Agency
surveillance saga google has filed a
motion in court arguing that it has the
First Amendment right to share how many
data requests it gets from NSA companies
including Microsoft Facebook and Apple
have been asking for the ability to
share the type and the number of data
requests from the NSA but the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court has
enforced a gag order on these companies
to prevent them from sharing any
statistics sony released an update to
the PlayStation 3 that caused a serious
glitch for many users ps3 owners took to
the forums to complain that the
four-point 45 update caused the system
to freeze during bootup sony has pulled
this update
is investigating some commenters on
Sony's forum say they can still boot
into safe mode which is perhaps how they
can update the console again once Sony
releases a fix and for all my fellow
geeks out there that grew up with Bill
Nye the Science Guy there's now a bill
night app in itunes to celebrate the
20th anniversary of the show so now you
can make sure a younger generation gets
their bill nye fix with access to old
episodes games and instructions for some
easy science experiments that's your
tech news update you can find more
details on these stories at cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
