is the 2013 Geneva Motor Show and this
is almost 4 million dollars worth of
excess it's the Lamborghini veneno and
only four of them are going to be built
and you can't afford any of them and it
is an ultra-exclusive supercar built by
Lamborghini to celebrate its 50th
anniversary this model is based on the
Lamborghini Aventador so it's got a 12
cylinder engine the outputs been bumped
up to about 750 horsepower and pretty
much everything about this vehicle as
you can see is all about light weight
and aerodynamics nearly every panel of
the vehicle has been sort of like formed
or doubles purpose as a wing or a
diffuser of some sort to reduce drag to
guide air over the vehicle and to
increase downforce at high speeds we've
got all sorts of like cool features like
this sort of dorsal fin that runs down
the center of the vehicle to aid in
straight-line stability when you're
doing over 200 miles per hour inside the
cabin we've got a basically restructured
dashboard interface that has more of an
interface on racing less of an interface
on infotainment so you've got more
things like rpm and top speed right
there at your fingertips and in front of
you when you're driving another awesome
example of repurposing are the wheels
you've got 20 inches of front 20 inches
around back but they've got these carbon
fiber rings around them that sort of act
as turbines and blow air over those
carbon ceramic brakes and you're driving
so you can keep them cool when it comes
time to stop this is pretty much the
ultimate example of exclusivity and
excess again only four were made only
three of them are gonna be sold
they've already been folded
you couldn't afford one anyway I'm
