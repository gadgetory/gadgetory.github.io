2015 geneva motor show thanks for
wanting get out here and we're kind of
wrapping up our coverage let's give you
an overview of the trends the show and
as always tell you some of our favorite
cars i'm tim stevens I'm editor large
your CNN I'm when Cunningham and I'm
antuan goodwin and there are certainly
some beautiful cars on the show floor I
think one of the biggest trends these
hyper exotic super expensive track toys
ask Martin with the the Vulcan perhaps
is the identity of that sort of trend a
big massive really expensive not
street-legal count outrageous car
absolutely beautiful long and low and
mean but not really a practical choice
for a lot of people similarly we also
have a Mercedes AMG gt3 which is the
race version of the GT really impressive
looking car and obviously designed for
the track and then there's also the
craziest of the cart near the bridge era
just a ridiculous lot more power and
empowering without even actually
understand how it works the coatings
about 1,500 horsepower 1,500 horsepower
from a plug-in hybrid system actually I
kind of wanted to count all the
horsepower we've seen here today from
the big cars because it just it's just
adding up and adding up it seems like
just yesterday that the Veyron came out
in your minds with this house horsepower
now that's special and this was do any
more errands coming to an end now we
also blood on Allie la finale the 450th
Veyron built here at the show I
blood-red beautiful addition is the last
one and it's already been sold so you
didn't get your bear on yet so are you
it's the boat oh yeah they had used at
this point suppose we could buy you too
baby I also you also saw a couple hot
hatches Monsieur for the civic type r in
the Focus RS are pretty keen develop
Focus RS and wanna know you're keen
about the seams fan of the Civic as they
are reformed on the fanboy and it's the
fastest if ever and on to clint's the
fastest hot hatchback of all time so
they back those numbers up pretty well
end up being a European show they love
their concepts not here we love the
concepts too late
ooh there are a lot here volkswagen has
what they call the sport coupe which
isn't a great name but but it's a
nice-looking little car there's some
wild things like the rinspeed booty
which is based on a BMW i3 it's supposed
to be a robot friendly car it's
something weird like that last I saw a
autonomous racecar this is from a design
company called ed the car's got the
torque it's electric no dry although
driver can be in it they have this weird
thing about the car can assist a drivers
it's very unlike worked out but it's a
very odd-looking thing they get pretty
wild with the concepts here then there's
the production-ready infiniti QX 30 is
something we're actually in the sea
production ready next year so I think
what we've seen here is is pretty close
to the end result and of course there
was the Bentley exp 10 speed 6 which was
their big concepts I can parking back to
the suite 6 of the 1920s or 30s which
back then was at six and a half liter
inline 6 they haven't said what's under
the hood of this new speed 6 concept
other than the fact that it's gonna have
some sort of battery hybrid system in
there they put lots of copper details on
the outside to kind of make me think of
batteries i guess but it wouldn't tell
me what's under the hood probably
because there's nothing under the hood
at this point but but who knows i really
like the looks of that car and i think
that could be the next thanks Bentley
Continental because it's just a new
direction at forward direction for
Bentley that I think they really need at
this point yeah absolutely beautiful car
and then of course lots of hybrids
couple fuel cell cars as well and lots
of other wonderful beautiful things on
this wonderful expansive show floor
behind us like like beautiful shiny
candies all across the show you know but
one thing we haven't really gotten are a
lot of just everyday attainable cars
here there's the Toyota Avensis the
Auris but not not a lot of just your
mid-level everyday cars right for chess
Park uh yeah yeah we'll be back for
frankfurt a couple months in superhead
the levorg which is their kind of
stretch WRX wagon which they will bring
in the u.s. rather sadly yeah by and
large this is a show for the super cars
for the designer concepts from the
expensive models that's okay it's nice
to dream
huh expensive is right that's uh that's
a key word here superb innings before
you complete scheme all right let's go
through pick our favorite cars into any
1s or with yours I'm going to go off the
beaten path and go other car that most
people have probably never heard of
before it's going to be the quantum
Monte know they're doing an interesting
thing first of all it's a small 2+2 sort
of shooting brakes ordeal something that
I love it's really short wheelbase and
it's an electric car that uses in here
sort of what's called a nano flow cell
of fuel cell technology and what that
means is that you fill it up with two
different types of ionized liquid and it
actually creates electricity on the fly
the idea that you can fill it up and
about the same amount of time it take
you to fill up the gasoline car it's
kind of pretty big tank but you'll be
able to drive about maybe class 600
miles on a charge and that's kind of
blowing anything that we've seen from
electric or hydrogen cars out of the
water and there's going to be no church
they say they're going to make one this
year they've already got two other
models that they're working on as well
so I mean I don't know how it works but
say it's gonna be on the road wait I
really like the Koenigsegg Agera a ridge
era that you mentioned earlier this is
this plug-in hybrid and you know sure
it's got massive horsepower 59
horsepower it's got different drive
modes but what I really like about this
car is it's beautiful I think it's the
best looking thing tone exec is that
must have kind of says cars are sort of
race cars for the road with the big
bubble cockpit and spoilers in all this
this is Albert jerez more like a 1960s
roadster nice long body twin humps
behind the cabin for aerodynamics just a
really good look at guard actually looks
comfortable girl is good for your super
crusher sure you've got 1,500 horsepower
smearing your faces and abused
comfortable you can as far as me i love
the speed 6 look at that Bentley i think
is amazing but i'm probably gonna have
to go in the 488 GTB in the prior the
458 replacement and keep calling the GTO
for whatever reason but at this is a
twin-turbo v8 I'm very curious to see
how it drives but I think it looks great
in the 458 amazing car so
more power with turbos in a Porsche
that's an urban turbos in a Ferrari
that's an interesting it is a thing that
he's certainly done before and the BF
series cars back in the back mid 90s and
i don't think it was complaining about
those so i think i think it will be just
fine but certainly there's some nervous
times monks for our fantasy exactly how
much ink dries and exhibition or any
party talks from geneva before we wrap
things up i'm going to go up pizza for
time to me out of every time I see that
Parker that it goes dead in it hard to
get into one of the beyond and I just
could soon the NSX from the first time
which is quite nice when the eruv
interpreted by the way in case when I
was wondering I'm going to sit in one of
these custom cars here that you don't
really see anywhere else you get from
these tuner shops that puts a matte
black paint job on something and puts
big comfortable seats in and weird
wheels it might start life as a you know
a land rover defender but now it looks
completely different so basically to
come on itself dollars are we going to
wrap things up here in Geneva I think
our next show will be the new york auto
show the end of march and i'm freaking
early April slowly back on there and
I'll be with your coverage from Geneva
and then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
