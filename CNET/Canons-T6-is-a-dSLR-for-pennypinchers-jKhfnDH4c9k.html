DSLR with decent photo and video in good
light and a not quite bare minimum set
of features but similarly priced older
cameras or cameras which cost just a
little bit more offer noticeably better
features quality and performance I'm
Laurie grinning and this is the Canon
EOS Rebel T 6 also known as the EOS 1300
d the T sixes photos look like they were
shot with the DSLR or mirrorless camera
with the same size sensor so they're
definitely a step up from a phone or a
point-and-shoot and they're about as
good as its direct competitor so there's
that but because it doesn't have spot
metering the camera doesn't handle
backlit subjects well automatically and
it's focusing in burst shooting aren't
fast enough for a satisfactory
experience shooting kids pets or other
subjects in motion also there are no
features for people who want to have fun
with the camera say filters which
mirrorless models offer in real time the
Canon only lets you post process with
them it's relatively light but feel
substantial typical for a beginner DSLR
unfortunately retains some of the
irritating aspects of its predecessors
including the tiny hard to see auto
focus points in the viewfinder and
forget about stealthy shooting since the
shutter is loud plus if you don't like
jumping back and forth between Stills
and video after rotate all the way to
the end of the mode dial and back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
