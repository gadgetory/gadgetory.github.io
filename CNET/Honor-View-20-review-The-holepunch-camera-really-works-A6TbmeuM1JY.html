20 and see yes I couldn't take my eyes
off of that mesmerizing finish it's
actually hypnotic the way that the light
shifts and reflects off the back to form
this chevron pattern
it feels very liquid in fact but there's
more to this phone than just that it's
the hardware matched with the honor view
twenties price that make it such a
compelling better than mid-range phone
let's start with the screen it's got a
six point four inch LCD display with a
23 10 by 1080 pixel resolution that's
pretty high and it helps keep words and
images looking sharp on the screen but
notice how the screen stretches from one
end to the other with only a narrow
bezel around the rim
there's no notch along the phone face
and what's this no sensors either
instead the honor of u-20 uses the new
punch hole design to place the camera
within the screen almost like it's
peeking out through the display and the
sensors have moved up to the phone's top
edge I'm happy to say that the punch
hole design really works this is a 25
megapixel camera and I was able to take
selfies smoothly the circular cutout
never felt disruptive or covered
anything crucial sometimes it just melts
into the background when you open up an
app other times it sort of floats on top
now as far as photo quality goes that
was pretty good too there's a beauty
mode and dramatic lighting effects to
spruce up photos but not all of those
effects work some of them cut off half
my hair a our lens which is Huawei's
taking on apples and emojis it's kind of
fun to completing the tour of the casing
you've got a USBC charger port for that
enormous 4000 milliamp battery and you
have a headphone jack up top there's no
support for external storage but you can
go dual SIM on the back you have a 48
megapixel camera with a 3d depth sensor
lens next door you can use these to take
portrait shots with all the trimmings
and there's a wacky mode on here that
lets you digitally make someone thinner
but the far more interesting tool is the
AI ultra clarity mode that combines
multiple photos into one optimized mega
picture that you can crop in on it's
much smoother than the regular 48
megapixel image but you lose some color
in detail it also takes 5 seconds to
shoot this way and it works best for
landscape shots with ample lighting
to take photos faster with AI you can
tap the AI mode in the camera app if the
phone recognizes a scene it will
automatically apply settings to optimize
that photo it works especially well with
photos of people flowers and food
battery life is impressive on this phone
running 16 hours an hour continuous
video loop test on airplane mode the
four thousand milliamp battery that I
mentioned is the same capacity is on the
galaxy note 9 a phone that costs about
twice the honor of u20s price
anecdotally it lasted a full day and
well into the night you've got 128
gigabytes of on-board storage to play
with or you can pay a little bit more
for the 256 gigabyte version like the
one I have the honor view 20 runs on
android 9 with the magic UI 2 interface
it will sell in select markets around
the world but if you do get your hands
on it it's a strong value Android phone
that's guaranteed to turn heads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
