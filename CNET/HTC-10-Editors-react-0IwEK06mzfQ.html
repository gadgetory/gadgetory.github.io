new flagship going to give some of our
first reactions now this this is the
phone my first reaction is that I
actually quite strongly dislike the
design say I'm not I'm not too keen that
like design is what traditionally HTC
has been really really really good at
and this one feels a little bit chunky
I'm not sure about these bezel deji's
round here I mean just when you bear in
mind that the competition for designers
is very very stiff like Samsung's s7 is
a really nice looking phone this is a
little I know it feels like something of
a step backwards yeah it was for time
try to see to kind of push the boat out
because this phone is very similar to
the previous few generations of its
flagship so as you say stamp stone is
really overhaul this design with the s6
and vs 7 is beautiful mm I think we need
to do something a little bit more but
design is quite subjective so people
might feel differently um how about on
the inside what's going on on the inside
is quite interesting because what HTC
has done is it tried to streamline its
software a little bit so instead of
bundling its own web browsers along with
chrome and it's and having multiple
versions of the calendar it's decided to
only use the best of each so you don't
get it was not multiple ways of doing
things which I know for a lot of people
switching to android can be quite
confusing because there are so many ways
of doing warm tasks so you get those
pop-up saying which app do you want to
open this with exactly if you don't know
and you don't know which one's best so
HTC is trying to make that a lot easier
to use you're quite into photography and
is there anything noteworthy about the
camera yes so HTC made a lot of promises
about this it's got a 12 ultrapixel
camera never ultrabooks is a name that
is used on its cameras before well it
basically means it's got bigger pixels
to let in more light okay sounds good on
paper but HTC has made a lot of promises
about its camera performance and
previous models and so far they're
almost all disappointed old vines maybe
promises like we just here I've got the
the quay p9 so there's another phone
that sort of only a few weeks ago they
made similar similarly massive claims
they have camera capabilities it's a
minister it's every every tech company
says they've got the best cameras but
they doona problem is is that some of
them do have the best one samsung and
apples are brilliant
the competition for cameras has never
been more fierce if that really needs to
perform in four cameras okay so it seems
like based on our first impressions
might be fair to say that we we're not
convinced HTC has done enough we might
change our minds once we've spent more
time with it but I don't know her anyway
let us know what you guys think this is
the HTC 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
