to contributor and today I'm going to
show you how to browse your Instagram
feed on your iPad without having to use
the Instagram app let's take a look
alright so let's take a look at insta
pad insta pet is an app for the iPad
that allows users to browse their
Instagram feed directly on the iPad now
this is different than installing the
Instagram app and blowing it up to two
times and using it on the iPad when that
Instagram app is designed for the iPhone
so it works okay but at the same time
you don't get that iPad experience where
this app is specifically built for it so
what I have here is I have my feet
pulled up and what this is is photos
that all the people I follow have
uploaded recently if I wanted to view on
one I'd tap on the photo I could swipe
in either direction to switch between
the photos if I want to like a photo I
tap on the heart if I want to view how
many likes or who's liked it you tap on
the icon over here also see what
comments have been left or leave a
comment myself all right now to get back
to the feed just tap on the photo again
and it minimizes if we tap on the icon
or the option up here we'll have my
photos I can view the photos I've
uploaded to Instagram my followers who
I'm following photos I've liked in the
past as well as the popular photos that
are currently posted and selected and
listed on the popular page so once this
pulls up and I'll show you another
feature that's built into the app let's
pick that photo there and now you'll
notice up here is send postcard this
actually uses sincerely ship sincerely
ship SDK which allows any app to send a
picture and have it printed out and sent
as a postcard for a fee now when you tap
on this you're warned make sure you have
the copyright approval from whoever took
or uploaded the photo before you send it
off I don't know who this is I don't
have approval I'm gonna go ahead and tap
yes anyways and
there you go there's a sincerely ship
SDK you would follow through the process
pay whatever it is that they charge and
send that Instagram photo as a postcard
I'm gonna back out that's not my photo
and I don't feel comfortable doing that
so we'll go back to my feet all right so
that's insta pad it's a quick look at it
it allows you to browse your Instagram
feed on the iPad this is Jason Cipriani
