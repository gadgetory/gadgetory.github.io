one of the best budget smartphones
around I've Jessica dual-core for cnet
this is the Nokia Lumia 521 for tmobile
compared to other Lumia phones this one
is shorter smaller and lighter than the
rest it's got a 4 inch screen screen
quality is pretty poor actually it's
highly reflective and you can tell when
you compare it to another phone that it
just doesn't have the oomph in pop of
some of the others as for the rest of
the phone this one is white and it
pretty much looks the same with the
buttons on the side including the
physical camera shutter button although
there's no screen sensitivity or
wireless charging for this phone you do
get some extras through Nokia's apps
including nokia drive and nokia music
there's a 5 megapixel camera on the back
that captures 720p HD video but there
was no front-facing camera photo quality
on the camera was pretty decent for the
price that you pay for the phone and I
was actually pretty impressed with the
low-light shots as well underneath the
hood there's a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
dual-core processor I noticed that the
phone was a little bit slower speeds are
going to be slower as well because
although it does run on t-mobile's hspa+
4g network there is no LTE for this
phone however it is very low cost so you
do get a lot for the money it's a
hundred fifty dollars up front no
contract that's through t-mobile and
Microsoft stores or you can buy it from
walmart for 130 dollars t-mobile also
gives you a down payment option where
you'll spend thirty dollars up front and
then five dollars every month for the
next two years the price definitely
makes it one of the best budget phones
available for any mobile platform I'm
Jessica doll quartz this is the Nokia
Lumia 521 for t-mobile
