picks this is net picks and we're
talking Netflix original series comedy
specials documentaries and movies these
are the ones you won't find anywhere but
Netflix March twentieth brings blood
line set in the Florida Keys and about
one family's drama starring Linda
Cardellini and friday night lights Coach
Taylor I mean Kyle Chandler catch season
9 of Trailer Park Boys March 27th but
inspector gadget is also available that
day so choose wisely after that the next
Marvel property we all have high hopes
for daredevil begins April 10 so with
all these titles why doesn't Netflix
have an original section probably
because it'd be a huge mess and
seriously blur the lines between
originals exclusives and continuations
under original series shows made by or
for Netflix you have one such as house
of cards orange is the new black and
hemlock grove those are the truly
original originals then there's the
originals that really are just
exclusives meaning netflix has sold
distribution rights for them in the US
like peaky blinders the fall Happy
Valley lillehammer and knights of
cydonia then you have continuation
series where Netflix picked up a show
and produced seasons of it after its
initial TV run like Arrested Development
Trailer Park Boys the killing and
Longmire basically most things you see
branded as a netflix original really
just means they paid a lot of money so
you can't watch it anywhere else here's
the full list of every netflix original
available to watch whatever that really
means well that's it for netflix
originals I'm Caitlin stop watching this
and start watching that
