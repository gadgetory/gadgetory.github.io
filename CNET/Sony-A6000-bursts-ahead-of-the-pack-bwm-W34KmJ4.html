follow-up to its NEX six mirrorless
interchangeable model is it seriously
speedy continuous shooting it laps the
field with its 11 frame per second burst
and that's with autofocus and auto
exposure in either raw or JPEG I'm
Laurie Brennan and this is the a6000 not
only is it fast but continuous shooting
and JPEG runs at least 50 shots and
probably more I just didn't try although
it takes a while for the camera to save
the images to the card that doesn't
interfere with shooting another burst it
does prevent you from reviewing though
and for some reason Sony put the right
indicator on the bottom of the camera
instead of the back in all other aspects
of performance it tested a bit slower
than the NEX 6 though in practice it
feels about the same you can speed up
the autofocus system by turning on pre
AF for one of the continuous autofocus
options but features like that use up
more battery power and the a6000 while
rated at a hundred shots more than the
NEX six still only lasts about 420 shots
on the charge the autofocus system works
pretty well most of the time but on the
occasions when it makes the wrong
choices it can get really frustrating
and like many mirrorless models it's
pretty slow on startup the a6000 has a
higher resolution sensor than the NEX 6
it jumps to 24 megapixels from 16 and
that means there's a lot more image
detail I found that even as low as ISO
800 though I could get better results
from RAW processing than the JPEGs which
look kind of mushy you can fill with the
amount of processing in-camera if you'd
like on the other hand I did shoot some
ISO 12800 photos which while still noisy
we're certainly usable there's a
reasonable amount of recoverable shadow
and highlight detail as well and the
default creative style color settings
don't push contrast or saturation
egregiously though the neutral setting
is more accurate video looks quite good
as well with the exception of a few real
annoyances I really like the cameras
design and features implementation Sony
gives good grip on its merrill list
models and everything an advanced user
might want is easy to get to quickly
although the EVF is smaller and lower
resolution than the NEX six it's still
fine and I didn't really notice and it's
really necessary since the otherwise
good LCD screen is hard to see in direct
sunlight Sony does get brownie points
for the tilting flash the Wi-Fi
connectivity works fine although it's
really laggy for remote shooting but I
really hate that in order to update to
the full Smart Remote app a capability
that most competitors simply built-in
you have to sign up for a Sony
Entertainment Network account and it's a
real pain entering text on a phone
without a touchscreen in order to log in
despite the small annoyances though the
a6000 is a great overall camera for more
advanced photographers who want
something smaller than a DSLR especially
if they need the continuous shooting
speed I'm Laurie Coonan and this is the
sony alpha a6000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
