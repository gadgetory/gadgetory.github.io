gates the Magic Kingdom is reinventing
and reinvigorating some of its most
elaborate shows and beloved rides with
technology the new paint the night
parade now lights up the park with 1.5
million LED lights performers like
Tinkerbell can change the floats colors
using handheld devices that rely on
wireless infrared technology to Zelda
tap out the float and cause a float to
come to life in a different fashion with
different lighting looks Disney is
bringing its famed fireworks show a bit
down to earth in addition to the
fireworks in the sky special projections
transform several landmarks now during
the day Main Street looks like this but
at night it's a whole new
anybody the projections are created by
layering video imagery in a process
called video mapping so you have one
piece that's moving and that piece of
stained static and all those layers
stacked in a digital way on top of each
other when you have different layers
back and forth this could be out of
focus and this could be in focus you
have to actually adjust that digitally
projections also change the Matterhorn
from a snow-capped mountain to finding
Emo's mount on a hook on loogey inside
the Matterhorn Disney aim to make the
rollercoasters scarier with the
abominable snowman we looked at new ways
of motion new ways of using technology
to bring the most animation to the
figure the old snowman first appeared in
1978 the new one stalks riders in
several places with a more menacing room
so our audio engineers took some of the
original pieces of sound of the roar and
crust it up with some other and animal
and panther and lion sounds to give him
this much more breathy bigger voice in
the Haunted Mansion Disneyland
resurrected the hatbox ghost it vanished
shortly after the mansion's 1969 opening
when it didn't perform well Cheever
Moskowitz says the technology used to
bring it back to life wasn't available
even ten years ago it's a mixture of
using projection lighting effects and
and some really cutting edge technology
inside the animatronic itself to be able
to achieve the effect that we've been
looking for it so we'll just have to
wait and see what new tricks Disney has
a bit sleep for the 70th anniversary
