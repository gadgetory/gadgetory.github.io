calling the new flagship Windows Phone
the HTC 8x or as they are officially
calling it the HTC Windows Phone 8x they
are pretty fired up about this
partnership now this is actually a
pre-production unit so we don't get the
whole SuperDuper unboxing I don't even
need my cool box cutter which is kind of
a bummer but nevertheless let's see what
we've got
oh it is taped up yay box cutter time
the Windows Phone thing seems to be like
make a really colorful pretty phone so
this one comes in sort of a lime yellow
and this blue one which I will never
ever ever get out of this box look look
how flush that is it's just gonna live
in here forever sorry phone torture test
starts early this year no really how do
you that was not my summer to something
better
okay oh I know how about this you push
it up boom I did it that's a little
ridiculous also in our box
congratulations you're one of the first
in the world to experience the new
Windows Phone 8x by HTC for AT&amp;amp;T you
probably won't get that in your box but
let's have a look at our power brick a
nice curved design does it look just
like the Apple one which is kind of a
refreshing change and then of course
what appears to be an extremely short
little USB cable micro USB charging that
is it let's have a look at the phone
this is pretty this definitely gives the
Lumias a run for its money in terms of
looks it's kind of a curved back here
not the hugest phone so it's nice for
those people who are feeling like phones
are getting a little too big these days
let's turn it on now Microsoft is not
letting OMS customize the operating
system the way that Android
or the way that Google is with Android
so you should get a pretty consistent
Windows Phone experience across the
board this phone is also available on
three US carriers the t-mobile Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T which is a change from the
Lumia so the Lumia 920 I think is only
available on ATT you have the
now-familiar Windows Phone tile
interface here which I like alright
let's talk about the guts the 8x has a
4.3 inch touchscreen display it's
Gorilla Glass 2 so it should be pretty
tough and it's a really nice HD display
1280 by 720 resolution and it looks good
with movies it comes in 16 gigs only it
has an 8 megapixel camera on the back
and a front-facing 2-megapixel front
camera that's a pretty nice front facing
camera it can also record a 1080p HD
video there's a dual-core Qualcomm
processor running at 1.5 gigahertz so it
should be plenty powerful we don't know
too much about battery life it does have
NFC Bluetooth 3.1 and of course Wi-Fi
one cool thing to note if you buy this
phone on Verizon it has support for a
wireless charging that's a pretty good
feature one note about the camera we've
heard that some of the photos can be a
little disappointing read our full CNET
review for more information on that one
reason might be that even though the 8x
has an 8 megapixel camera
it defaults to 6 megapixels for some
reason all in all the 8x is a really
nice phone it has a great design if I
saw someone using it I'd want to know
what it was it's beautiful its
lightweight and this operating system is
very good and usable the biggest problem
with Windows Phone of course there
aren't really very many apps available
if the only app you use is Microsoft
Office 13 then you're in good shape but
if you want something else you might be
in trouble
this phone starts at $1.99 on most
carriers with a new contract of course
you can find all the details in our full
review over at cnet.com
