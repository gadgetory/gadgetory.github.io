welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe i'm jeff
cannata ashley Esqueda is out sick today
so we send her our best wishes to get
well soon but i still got some headlines
for you researchers at Stanford have
introduced a new robot and this one is
focused on versatility this robot is
called the Stanford climbing and aerial
maneuvering platform or scamp for short
scamp flies like a drone perches on
vertical walls adjusts itself if its
perch starts to slip up climbs walls and
then peels away from the surface to take
off again spined feet give scamp the
ability to grip onto rough surfaces like
wolves and accelerometers and rotors
work together to correct scamp's
position as it climbs the research team
says they cease camp as a jumping-off
point for a family of perching and
climbing robots of different sizes and
use cases this is particularly cool
because scamp can access places that
don't have any horizontal positions to
land on they should rubble and kind of
dangerous locations where you would want
a drone to go into but may not be able
to land anywhere because there's so much
uneven surfaces to be able to perch on
to a side wall super cool a dutch parcel
company has introduced a delivery
service that will actually make your
product while it's being delivered post
NL consulted with 3d printing expert
URIs vent to Bergen to ship a box with
nothing inside but an ulta maker to 3d
printer that would create a trumpet
while the box was on its way to its
destination they switched on the printer
and sent it out for delivery to Hollins
number one trumpet ear and on arrival he
assembled the trumpet and was able to
play it of course this is an ad so
there's probably a little bit of
finessing involved with the finished
video but it's still pretty cool stunts
and we thought you might enjoy seeing it
first of all I want to know if there's a
lot of competition to become Holland's
number one trumpet ear and secondly I
think this is pretty
cool it kind of throws the whole idea of
manufacturing and delivery all out of
whack but I do think it might be easier
just to have your own 3d printer at home
love to hear what you think about this
stuff you can always use the hashtag hey
TD on Twitter to let us know what you're
thinking and if we like your shouts at
us over Twitter we'll use your comments
on our long episode on Thursday where
Ashley and I will hash out these stories
I think we're going to have to dive into
this this 3d printing idea on thursday
sounds like a really good story all
right now it's time for our phone tog
refer of the day today's phone tog refer
is Jared who took this on his iphone 5s
Jared Wright's hey guys love you and
your show I took this shot with my old
