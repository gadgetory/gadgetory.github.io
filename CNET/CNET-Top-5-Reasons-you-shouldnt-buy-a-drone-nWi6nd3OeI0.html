companies like parrot DJI are a lot of
fun
they shoot amazing video and they're
much more stable than remote-controlled
airplanes or helicopters if it sounds
like the hobby for you here are five
things you should know before taking the
plunge starting off at number five
they're expensive sure you can buy those
little indoor drones for like thirty or
fifty bucks but the real deal starts at
around five hundred dollars you could
buy a Playstation 4 and a game for that
and get about the same amount of
physical activity either way you're
really just standing there with a remote
control in your hand except the drone
runs out of power in 15 minutes at
number four it's creepy
people are rightfully freaked out about
drones spying on them so when you're
flying one some people will stare at you
an MV and others will stare and concern
in judgment and if you don't think
drones are creepy just wait until your
neighbor buys one next thing you know a
GoPro video of you sunbathing with your
manboobs exposes trending on twitter
hashtag drone moobs coming in at number
three the law the subject of where you
can and can't fly your drone is being
fought in courts every week it seems it
is now against the law to fly drones in
national parks you can't fly drones
around airports and you can't fly drones
for commercial uses whether that's
delivering an Amazon package or
recording video that you intend to
profit from they have interactive maps
now that show where it's illegal to fly
drones and those areas are only growing
so not only do you feel like a creep
when you use one but you also feel like
a criminal at number two safety you ever
had four plastic blades whipping around
your face at thousands of revolutions
per minute it's unnerving so you take it
up a little higher only to wonder what's
really preventing that thing from
falling down on someone's head and even
if you're Johnny safety with this thing
you can't control other people not to
mention nature can you imagine how much
you hate drones if you were a bird just
saying if you buy a drone and a bird
poops on your head you had that coming
now before we get to the number one
reason not to buy a drone let's take a
minute to acknowledge one of the best
reasons you should buy a drone right now
it's still legal before local laws in
general paranoia ruined the party
get yourself a drone in
fly it until the man shuts you down the
way things look now regulations are only
going to get more strict but the number
one reason you shouldn't buy a drone
it's a slippery slope first it's the
drone then it's the camera upgrade then
you upgrade the controller the gimbal
you buy more battery packs you buy an
iPad so you can plot out your flight
path you get an oculus rift so you can
see what the drone sees in real time and
then the next thing you know you're the
guy who's out there on the beach with
your VR goggles on your face and $10,000
worth of delicate gear hanging in the
air turned around to look back at
yourself getting pooped on by a large
flock of enraged seagulls let me save
you the pain so there you go five
reasons not to pick up a drone as your
new hobby i'm donald bell and for more
