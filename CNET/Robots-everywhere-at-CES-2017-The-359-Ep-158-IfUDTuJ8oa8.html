of CES 2017 let's see next page I'm is
Zach turnham doing what's again by Roger
Cheng and Ben Fox will be for giganto
sized episode of our excellent bite-size
news podcast the 359 if you're new to
the show Roger and Ben break down the
most important text stories in about
four minutes today we'll be talking for
a lot more than four minutes let's talk
about tmobile first up Roger your
tmobile expert let's talk about what
they introduced last night so it's
really just a set of discounts of
incentives really to get you to switch
through to their unlimited data plan you
know the first thing is basically
removing taxes and fees so if whatever
the advertised rate is whether it's for
a dollar seventy dollars for your plan
is exactly what you pay right your phone
bill you probably see a listing for the
actual rate and then like a whole number
of other line items adding up to a huge
huge bill and so what they're trying to
do is simplify that so what you see is
what you get so they basically cut the
price again yes actually they so this
actually cut the price and absorb the
texts themselves incorrectly they've
eliminated taxes in their development by
the way my headline had it in quotes
which is that why splendid you can't
avoid tax right you're saying benefit
taking the price of the actual plan but
it in a mess oh you believe for the
customer ultima they they do lose the
they don't have to pay the taxes anymore
so that's I mean they're paying taxes
but yes there are two things that are
certain rushed nope great things that
are certain weight I'm gonna dance the
taxes and tmobile John Legend wearing
pink yeah well that magenta um actually
oh my god the other the other feature
that they announced if you use two gigs
of data or less they will give you a
credit of ten dollars a month a month a
month yeah so as long as you're on Wi-Fi
and you're not like bogging other
network then I give you another discount
well it's not really designed for people
who are heavy users right this is for
like your father grandfather someone who
doesn't use a phone that much really
just texts or emails and two gigs of
data is plenty of data for them and so
it's I think what this is really this
isn't this isn't really a game changer
at all what this is is fixing the
with the last t-mobile one announcement
right well they first said we're going
to move to a limited data everyone's
gonna go unlimited data people were
pissed right people weren't happy about
that because that was one price like if
I want a cheaper plan with less data I
no longer had that option so what
t-mobile did yesterday was offer enough
incentives to get everyone to switch on
with that plan god they're simplified
plans when comes to that there's also
the idea that this is this is when there
are another uncarrier movements yes
they've stopped numbering these things
ever regularly all right cuz they were
like up to uncarrier 12 well this woman
on Carrie 13 and that's on look at some
point where you gonna go in carrier 2025
it's gonna sound really bold and dumb
right well my question is like are they
making any money they keep doing these
added incentives it seems like they're
getting additional customers but is it
working for them is it's like helping
the bottom line at all financially
speaking they're actually doing pretty
well they actually look the plant the
deal with the limited plan is it did
raise the price for a lot of people if
they had if they were to jump into a new
plan now it's more expensive than they
would if they had a basic plan so what
makes that 2gig model exactly so so
they've actually kind of stabilized how
much money they made after all the crazy
and centers that they threw and early it
could look uncannily started to make
money it's it's starting to pay off for
them yeah okay fine I'm a verizon
customer though are they going to start
giving me free pizza all right well I
don't think verizon 50 back out of that
creepy to deal with Dino but i watch
creepy took about two weeks that was
dead so the question I like to collect
two weeks your verizon to the question
is well other manufacturer carriers
follow suit like I mean t-mobile every
now and then they seem to like rattle
the cages of the wireless carriers to
the point yeah that they change what
they're doing so do you think that this
is going to change the what verizon or
AT&amp;amp;T or Sprint does well you saw a
sprint already kind of move to a limited
plan and you know verizon has said
they're still not going to do it but I
mean if you look at the history what
t-mobile has done in terms of the
various moves kill subsidies kill
contracts the rest of the industry has
moved in that direction and and really
t-mobile's hoping that get to this this
point where all mobile data is unlimited
you're watching the video version of the
359 on the podcast looks like Rogers
about to drop it because that's right
most people hold them like the bottom oh
he's dropping a beat Wow and I'm done
okay so yeah this is the super extended
giganto episode of 359 and you luckily
and you beat boxes we had a special
appearance of brian van delden so thank
you very much for showing up yeah right
so let's keep talking about that so you
had John larger stage yeah did he offer
you any style tips cuz Amanda magenta
yeah well I've got to I've got bright
bright yellow shoes so now there is yeah
I've got bright yellow shoes which he
took offense to because it's all these
carry guys only see colors in like
branding like if I went blue I'm
eighteen t if I went red we're we're
verizon apparently so exactly oh yeah I
didn't actually happen but it's like
sometimes like you should get new shoes
by the way my shoes are awesome and I'm
not changed I like the yellow and black
shoes thank you thank you good thing why
you called Roger the bumblebee Chang
doing i will be now and that is so sad
we got i as a wolf of course the
wimpiest nickname I like it I think it's
like I think it actually sorry becoming
of you so you look great bumblebee you
look right about robots robots are a
huge trend at CES this year we've seen
all kinds of things LG's got like a
whole bunch of them if they're at their
booth there's like links the human Alexa
the humanoid Alexa thing what do you
want to start on this I think LG's got
the most interesting things because
they're like we got robots in this is
now going to be normal yeah well look so
that's the thing I kind of take some
issues that the hub robot that they
announced I thought it moved around and
its really she says lily has a buddy
doesn't move around it has a face it has
a face but it doesn't move around it'll
why is that really a robot or is it just
a speaker with a cool little gimmick the
actual
advise the hub it's a little like two
parts no man if you look at that way
right and it does wiggle and it can turn
around but I can't like drive itself you
like mine okay but what's the point of
similar what's the point of doing that
like what exactly why why would you give
the thing a face so actually I talked to
them about that they said the design was
intentional is really to create this
emotional attachment okay and it is cute
it's adorable so we're seeing that the
singing now hover over that there and
the weird thing is you interface with it
on its face it's a touchscreen it's got
two little eyes on it and it gets it's
just a fingerprint match yeah I feel
like I'm doing something rude when I'm
touching its face like a Sorry Sorry
interact with that you know what I'm
okay fine I'm sold I'm sold I was like I
want to swaddle this thing I feel
emotionally connected with it now this
really feels very good joking about the
emotional connection that seems to be a
huge thing that these companies trying
to do is to have an actual Oh total into
these robots yes density people will
personify these things if you know they
can interact with them in a certain way
absolutely if I mean that's the whole
this is this is like maybe it's a little
too simplistic to just give it two
simple little eyes I just I don't really
see how that works exactly but maybe
people really like it there's also right
now we're seeing a video of the the
airport vacuum cleaner robot which they
didn't mention on their keynote but that
is a thing and it didn't announce any
partners also a vacuum cleaner what I
don't want the air robot and not just a
vacuum vacuum please got a face oh I
think that's is that CX what's the line
is that the criteria what does it have
to make it a robot yeah as a face I
don't know well have you seen pepper on
the floor I like pepper pepper moves
around but it looks like a robot it
looks like what you would think a robot
is it's got like this touch panel oh
yeah it looks very non-threatening
rights very friendly that was the whole
intention is that like it's super
friendly but granted if I bumped into
pepper right in like a dark back alley
somewhere and like pepper was angry I
think that would be terrifying because
I'm so cute looking you look you bring
up pepper and that's Ric is our reporter
Katie Collins actually managed to play a
game card to get to manatee I can't
start out the best part about cards
against humanity is just how vile it can
get yeah so how can pepper play cards
against humanity is a program to be
vile and often also that means Oh it'd
be the alliant so it does yeah it
doesn't offer the answers it gives you
the combination and you're supposed to
select it and it acts as the judge it's
like the MC right so you give the
answers and it judges which is the
funniest pepper qualified oh it's
qualified but how so it has a database
of basically every single term in every
combination and it can do that because
it's a robot right and it sort of stack
stood against the best most rule best
answers the answer I would like that's
not a cool so it's basically using big
data what that just means that somebody
has prejudged the best combinations and
told this robot this is the way to go
that's yeah i mean but it is based off
of sort of like crowdsourcing so they
can change then absolutely okay so
what's interesting about that too is
that like why would pepper do cards
against humanity it's another one of the
like going back to the original point of
we want to make these things have an
emotional connection we want people to
personify them in a certain way we want
people to keep interacting with this
stuff so that's why you see certain
little things like cards against
humanity that's why Alexa tells jokes in
different things like that so I think
we're going to see a lot more of that
kind of stuff from robot's voice
assistance just to get people a little
more comfortable with this stuff you
know like it's still very new to a lot
of folks I find this very troubling
because I thing ember they Sony AIBO dog
robot people had a whole bunch of the
thing is they're becoming sad because
they're trying to repair them and
there's no longer part so they have an
emotional connection of these devices
and they're dying also the devotion by
20 or 3d printed parts that people
actually 3d printing parts to save their
I bows so these robots that people have
an attack red of all yeah because it's
you're creating this emotional
attachment you're also causing grief to
put people so be aware of that you're
buying delayed sadness anytime you buy
anything oh my god people don't start
burying their robot dogs they recycle
them let's go into the next big thing
we've got all kinds of stuff it's on
Ben's list what are we talking about
here so the next big thing was yesterday
with Brian Cooley and Lindsay Turrentine
up it was this whole big effort about
the smart home how do we get the smart
home to be much more significant one of
the points that I thought was really
interesting that was mentioned there was
a lot of these smart home and home
automation features maybe six or seven
percent of the u.s. population is
actually
interacted with them so far upwards of
ninety percent of folks haven't talked
to Alexa they don't really know what a
lot of this stuff is they don't know how
to turn on and off their lights using
their voice so there's this enormous
amount of opportunity to get people to
really start using the smart home a lot
more so you see but I also brought up
that being security concerns right that
that was sort of yeah issues yeah they
showed this mr. robot video on stage
that was just kind of this this
terrifying potential of everything that
could possibly go wrong in a fully
integrated smart home where this woman
was in the shower well you know they
some hacker like made it really really
hot and she had to like get out of the
shower all of a sudden the alarms were
plastic and she was on the phone with
some text somewhere and they said well
you know just unplug it unplugged the
system you'd be like there's nothing to
unplug it's all in the walls so
eventually she just had to leave her
house and you know the mr. robot people
took over whatever but this was just
this kind of scary notion of you know as
we automate more things as we add more
Wi-Fi connections into things but like a
worst-case scenario and like it could be
you know potentially even worse this is
like this is even worse case scenario
though right like we saw that with a
botnet attack last year right these
these connected devices were all kind of
put together a sort of an army of
botnets that took down the internet
right so there's definitely I think a
legitimate threat there I think that's
part of reason why a lot of people
haven't tried the stuff it's a little
scary right a little intimidating so and
the privacy concerns are legitimate yeah
and and in fairness to Google and Amazon
who are on stage they said anytime we
develop these platforms we do it with
security is paramount you know they're
obviously very mindful of the fact that
this is new technology they want to get
people interested in it and they want to
get people comfortable with look it's
the thing of it is is yes Google and
Amazon these big companies have lots of
resources to put into security where you
get the trouble is with a lot of these
smaller companies that are building
products that don't have the resources
for for security you know their their
focus is building a product getting it
out selling it Praia majan for a lot of
them security and privacy are fairly low
on the totem pole they may not say why
they may not say that but it's clear
that allows companies are not think
about security mumo specifically
reference that and they said
it's incumbent on us to really try to
find these smaller companies and help
them can give them the tools that they
need because it doesn't help us if there
are these botnet attacks if it really
kind of hurts that situation one other
thing that I want to mention that was
you know kind of reference that the next
big thing was this idea of like what
does the future smart home look like and
it's basically everything is automated
so we talked about like what could go
wrong if everything is automated well we
have this cool video about well you know
here it is right here you basically walk
to your door it unlocks it opens for you
the lights turn on the blinds change
exactly how you want them to be the oven
turns on and you know you can you can
start cooking your food the refrigerator
tells you what may or may not actually
start going bad so maybe you want to
make a salad tonight something like that
so it was all you know very integrated
from front to back and it I don't know I
I thought it was kind of cool obviously
we're a couple years away from that but
I don't know what do you guys think
would you want to live in a house like
that of course I do I live in a house
like that now no you don't want that all
right we got we're actually running out
of time you believe this is at all all
right let's talk about smart pajamas
that we're talking about to our PJs we
are talking about under armour okay army
about it cuz I I saw this and I'm like
why would you pay 200 otters for pjs cuz
you know you're comfy but two dollars
yeah well that's then this is sleepwear
technology apparently this these are
some very expensive pajamas but hundred
connected they're not connected
fortunately the cockers cannot get your
pajamas good to know this fortunately I
know what it does is get the special
fabric that absorb some of the the far
infrared heat that your body admits and
transfers are back in and it's supposed
to promote better sleep and better by
recovery now this is something I talked
to Tom Brady the pictures quarterback is
that right yes so under armour partnered
with Tom Brady to basically pitch this
is going to be the subject of the under
armour keynote the CEO is speaking later
today at the show so Tom Brady is
pitching pjs for Under Armour is this
correct and this is this is correct this
helps your technology is going now
called the ultimate recovery sleep where
this is like you know adult you recover
technology is is a hot hot trend right
you see you know I've heat back haha
iphone and night you know I thought
sorry guys uh look derail a lot of these
companies are looking to you know
they're there are motion trackers for
sleep there in the bed you know there is
a night motor night vision for a nice
shift what is night mode for iphone
right oh yeah the technology companies
are increasingly conscious of the fact
that people need to get more sleep
better sleep and as a father of a nine
month old I completely agree and hope
one day that actually happens we try to
cram in the PC talk right now what do
you think guys of course all right let's
not a 359 experiment as much as possible
we're talking about pcs personal
computers right now no okay so there's a
good stop the deli there's a dell
latitude 7285 it's one of the first
laptop from dell that actually has a
wireless charging base I've seen that
stuff on the floor call the longest time
Intel's I was like wireless charging and
charging we're gonna have it in laptop
like when when when it finally I wait
but it's a fairly large base I mean what
yes you just keep it that while you just
plug it in it's not a gun right not that
much harder to plug one are you come on
what is your beef with wireless charging
i know i love wireless charging it makes
sense for phones where you could move
them around it like get charging at
starbucks or whatever but this is this
is just moving the charging plate around
if you took the lap line you'd have
multiple plates i'd imagine that way you
can put your device down right away
plates you're gonna have three maybe you
could buy a laptop bag for your plate
yeah a separate bag though okay okay
what you guys are ridiculing this i find
it to be a good thing that is cool when
I go to my desk I put my laptop down I
don't want to plug in a whole bunch of
stuff affected to have wireless USB
which it's not it by the way the plate
has to be plugged in you realized that
right charger yeah no I'm just saying
yes no wireless charging they're truly
wireless it's not very good Tesla
situation where this I just think it
makes less sense or a computer than it
does for phone I don't agree at all i
think those things should be built into
desks at some point where you can put
that down yep that's the dell there
that's a tune one instead of taking it
apart right now in the video and they're
supposed to be a charging plate as well
for it i still think that wireless
charging because there you go there's a
oh look at that could you imagine who
that baby move how about that a lot
imagine you go to a board room and
there's all these charging places I've
having like these ridiculous proprietary
you know I excited for whatever else you
have a good point if they have them
built into desk that that sort of
integrated vision of future
that I can get behind for sure let's
talk about future stuff a little bit
more let's hit razor because they had a
crazy crazy laptop called Project
Valerie it's a concept device now Razor
does they show lots of concept devices
right and sometimes they never come out
but then you're like razor will come up
with this and here's a laptop so awesome
and so we've got this three screened
laptop and the the what yes oh yeah
those two screens pop off the sides and
this is enormous they actually have it
on the show floor there's no plan for
this to actually come out by the way is
no product release data this is not
meant to like I feel like a lot of these
gaming coupler gaming laptop companies
that's what they do with these shows
they come out with the craziest funkiest
product trying to get the attention and
then wait and then maybe it shows up
we'll see I mean it is pretty amazing
i'm not even gamer and i kind of want
one it's fantastic looking i like the
idea i don't think i would ever buy it
okay I think I one day one day when
they're like rollable I see that
happening a lot but I just I do like the
idea that they bother to do it because
that's crazy that's great engineering
it's a it's right it's a nice show piece
it gets their attention but if they find
out that people actually want this razor
is crazy enough to do it I think yeah
absolutely they might charge like seven
thousand dollars people I guess someone
will buy gamers will buy that thing yeah
or if you're like you do a lot of cad
work or video editing like you have this
thing on you I like here if you're
writing stories for seeing it yes rejane
I could actually see how I would you use
that it's that would be awesome I like
it and I think that's gonna have to wrap
it up for us guys you think so all right
all right you can find a 359 on itunes
soundcloud google play and of course
cnet com for the 359 podcast I'm Maya's
actor I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin
