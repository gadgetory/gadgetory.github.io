and with me a special guest Sally Nieman
hello Sally helped produce the our
in-depth look at the Sony AIBO robot
before we get to that we want to talk
about Elon Musk is boring company
it's reportedly abandoned plans to dig a
massive tunnel under Los Angeles's
crowded 405 freeway
and push its loop mass transit project
turns out I guess there's some lawsuits
that are looking to get more of an
environmental assessment of this project
Elon was hoping to bypass all this and
now he's he scrapped the plans well it's
funny because I was in attendance when
he announced you made this big
announcement in May we were in we're
right off the 405 freeway he talked
about the you know the hope the the
promise of this loop project idea that
these things can go 150 miles an hour
and cost a dollar so what would you do
with a dollar mass transit system I mean
that sounds amazing and I would probably
use it every day I grew up in a big city
where I had to drive everywhere and I
hate driving moving to New York for me
was amazing because I don't have to
drive and for a dollar
yeah right I don't know like MTA fees
keep you learn up so a dollar would make
a huge difference I just don't see it
happening
yeah so there is he is talked about
plans for connecting Dodger Stadium to a
local subway stop so and that's like
like a three-mile stretch so maybe that
happens maybe the loop project is still
alive all right next up Sal you spent
you and birch carry spent a week with
sony's AIBO this is the $2,900 robot dog
tell me what were your impressions so
bridge I got to take it home the whole
week she was able to enjoy a boat
together with her two-year-old daughter
and I got to see a lot of it as well we
took it to meet another real dog and we
took it to a Senior Center where we got
to see how older people interact with
AIBO because it can be sort of a
companion way anything you would think
robo-dog probably a toy but it's so real
that it can actually be
good companion for older people
interesting yeah and I know that was one
of the big pitches for IMO correct I was
a little skeptical at first but I mean
what did you think was it was it
actually was a cute was it extremely
cute it's not creepy it's the idea very
scrappy but it's extremely you see it
and you you can not go to it touch it
and just play with it like if it's a
real dog it's just the whole AI and how
he moves and how it interacts with you
right it's extremely incredible we're
seeing some footage of I bow with
Bridget's dog yes and that's both super
adorable and there he's pretending to
pee oh really
so he does different tricks right he's
verbal commands correct he does about a
dozen action saying you can use
different words for different things
that he can do like pick up the bone go
peepee it can actually take pictures
with the nose oh really
yep once the app is out together with
eyeball and yeah I just you can teach it
to do different things alright so lastly
let's talk about the electric scooter
craze these rentable scooters are
popping up in cities all over the
country but our own Derek kurz talked
about how they're leading to a surgeon
injuries including two deaths attributed
to Easterners not a surprise right
you're whipping around zipping around
the city in crowded traffic you know
they're they're calling this disruptive
technology one doctor she talked to
quick but this is disrupting your elbows
and knees and head so if you are into
the scooter craze be aware it could be
hazardous to your health and please wear
a helmet yes for a full coverage Sugar's
on CNN I'm Roger Cheng and I'm Sally
Nieman thanks for sayin
for to happen the most part of this test
was seeing my daughter's interactions
but I needed to do more research work to
others think of ivory
I've said that was super normal all that
footage cool alright thanks everybody
for joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast it's time to go ahead and
submit any questions or comments you
have about I bow Sally had a lot of
first-hand experience with the dog and
she could probably floor any concept or
curiosity you might have for me I am not
surprised about this whole Elon Musk
development at all I mean come on it's a
great idea on paper but the level of
ferocity that he went into this without
what I felt was necessary research and
inclusion for the local agencies to get
on board of this I mean come on he did
include some city officials but who were
on board with this but you know there
are other folks other local folks local
parties who yeah Wanda get a clearer
look at what this might actually mean to
the community from an environmental
perspective yes so and you know you
almost didn't want to go through that
that kind of rigorous process I was
hoping to kind of bore his way through
and yeah like these lawsuits that
basically stopped him in his tracks as
far as AIBO goes let's get back on board
all right so Sally what was your
favorite trick that I Bo did my favorite
freak
I guess when he started singing so
unexpected like how does he sing like
because you expect a dog to bark yeah
the hand to maybe go peepee
but not to sing so when he started like
randomly singing I thought that was
pretty cool wait and tell me put this
pee-pee thing cuz like he doesn't
actually pee right he just does the
motion and you can hear sound there's
really no liquid coming out do you have
to take him to go pee like once a day or
something no cuz I think you just
randomly does it he went oh really
so you asked him to go you can command
it to go P yep yep well if you want it
to be as real that's true well I mean I
couldn't I don't think that's true so be
like batteries would fall out oh it just
makes out right yeah yeah great it's a
card right it's not softer it's not soft
he doesn't have fur yeah and it's still
cute and I mean and I want to say this
now we're looking at some footage of
being at the Senior Center and yes there
were people who were skeptical and
saying like why am I supposed to talk to
an inanimate machine yeah I'm quoting uh
one of the people we spoke to but then
there's you see this lady and she just
fell in love without ya and she was just
so it just made her day and I would say
it made her weak like the the small
interaction she had with the dog she was
just so happy you wanted to cry watching
her oh wow it was so amazing yeah we've
definitely we've done a bunch of stories
about sort of the the benefits
psychological benefits of having a robot
companion and like having something as a
cute looking as I bow I mean I could see
how that can be I could have almost
medicinal purposes right I mean
definitely therapeutic for sure and you
know you could it's the right word not
medicinal yeah yeah you think about the
initial cost which is $2,900 yes and you
think oh but if I buy a dog it's gonna
be cheaper than that but not in the long
run no true and it's a lot more trouble
actual pee and so it's it's big money
yes but you know if you can afford it
right there will most likely not be an I
bow in the Chang household anytime soon
I don't think I mean I'd love to check
it out check it out once there no Sony
wants to send me a loaner for a few
weeks
love to take it home exactly I can see
how exactly I would like imagine I'm
trying to imagine like
my son would react to I go run around
yeah III think and I think that's one of
the things that Bridget enjoy the most
about having IVA it was hurt her
daughter's interactions with the dog oh
yeah you can see all of that in the
video so make sure to watch it there you
go
Ron what questions do we got well I mean
I was gonna say let's address the
elephant in the room about that price
but you guys just kind of like covered
that III think it's interesting a lot of
people brush this off like why wouldn't
you just get a real dog but there are a
lot of scenarios where you can't have a
real live animal allergies come into
play sometimes like if you were if
you're in a Senior Center not to sound
crass but there's sometimes elements of
those citizens that may not mesh well
with a real animal perhaps dementia
could cause complications and issues so
still giving them in that opportunity to
experience joy and companionship albeit
automated I think it's still kind of a
fantastic thing and the way they've kind
of set this up and priced it out that's
kind of the ideal scenario it's not
really consumer friendly price wise to
put in every single home right but I
love the idea of being in a Senior
Center and having those people being
able to interact with or even bringing
into the classroom and teaching kids
that perhaps grow up you know in an
inner city it don't necessarily have a
lot of opportunity to have pets to kind
of teach them to to co-mingle with
another quote-unquote living creature
yeah I have to wonder if like down the
line you can get like an insurance
company to pay for some of this whatever
like if it has psychological benefits
right like if it is you know therapeutic
as you say like you know I know apples
been trying to do that with Apple watch
like who's the save Sony that couldn't
do something similar with I'm sure it's
a lot more research yeah absolutely but
having said that he does recognize 100
faces Wow and and the dog is looking for
that emotion so if if it comes to you
and it's giving you the hand and he sees
that you're happy he's gonna continue to
do that right and it's interesting I
didn't actually know this but it comes
with an 18 t Wireless play right
there's no Wi-Fi around it'll actually
connected Network right yeah I didn't
realize it actually need the network to
to operate properly yeah but everything
is internal though all the commands is
are internal so it's also not recording
your audio or any yeah I saw that in
British story that was that was a good
bit of detail because we didn't really
know beforehand like what prior to the
story like what the privacy aspects for
this thing was you say it comes with the
18 t plan does that come included in the
price of yeah price covers a three-year
plan to be a coverage plan oh that's
cool yeah be it'd be kind of lame if
they're like and here's a new Wi-Fi bill
right or I wonder if they'd ever give
you the opportunity to tap it into a
pre-existing plan oh maybe I mean I'm
already an AT&amp;amp;T customer if I want to
has those uh you know yeah after three
years I have to wonder how much the plan
is I imagine I don't imagine there would
be something like that like it'll cost
you ten bucks a month or something hmm
all right let's take some questions from
the chat here's a great comment from
Ryan he says I feel like I'd like this
AIBO better than an actual dog a lot
less cleaning up yeah plus you don't
have to worry about dog sitting if you
go away that's a good point to like you
can shut AIBO all the way down right
yeah it actually has an on enough button
they don't recommend you shutting off
but it is that's when you're at home
with it interacting because at night it
goes into the charger when you're not a
home he goes and sits in the charger oh
really does a sit in the charger by
itself by itself yeah you connect the
charger and there is an actual camera on
the back which is mapping the room and
you should there's a map the room like
would it know like if the charging
station is in the living room and I take
it to a bedroom would it know to like
walk its way back into that you should
know I guess it depends how long it's in
the root lane but you'd only had it for
a week for example and she had a hard
time leaving the living room okay so it
didn't really roam around all of the
apartment gotcha
and that's the other thing heed it his
movements are amazing but he doesn't
walk up or down the stairs okay so it
tells us something like which like I get
it I mean having that comes with a
firmware upgrade research in robotics
and how stairs are a huge challenge
robots like a sophisticated $50,000
robot still can't climb up stairs so
it's not surprising has enough money to
spend on AI boy it probably has true
true so if you have the charger
downstairs well then you got to build a
little like stair elevator thing that's
something that's what I was gonna say
you got enough money for I boy I got
enough money for a dog elevator probably
yeah but it's supposed to no address
like even if you put it on a table
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
it can fall off you can okay got it
it'll kind of like fall asleep so it
doesn't how durable is it has fell off
the table we did not try it yeah she's
probably yeah I I would freak out if
like my $2,900 basically robot toy fell
off the table like fell three feet like
inches oh yeah that would be bad it's a
good question I'm not really sure how
adorable it is all right yeah these
these the the footage that we're seeing
it's just yeah it's just that's too cute
it's heart-wrenching when uh when Olivia
had to say goodbye oh yeah I was almost
crying with her our next question is
coming in from James Gordon what did the
real dog think of the Robo dog oh oh yes
so we took it Yahoo is is place to meet
Tori who Sam and the real dog actually
at first he didn't know what he was it
was kind of sniffing the ball a little
bit oh yeah then it hated him it was
just working like crazy and then a
little bit after that she just didn't
even Carrie was day he just ignored him
ignore him completely
that's so that feel I feel like that's
more cat like I kind of apathy something
right there if you see he's just barking
at the dog and then he didn't care
and actually there was another dog at
the Senior Center that somebody brought
yeah and that dog wasn't really paying
much attention to Weibull but it was
funny to see that most people were like
really going into I bow and not really
paying attention to the dog
besides the owner poor dog alright to
bring things full circle let's talk
about musk one more time what is the
next steps then what is this Dodgers
Stadium plan he was talking about there
yeah there's basically he'd proposed
underground tunnel connecting Dodger
Stadium to a subway station three miles
away I think it's a little bit less
ambitious than the than the plans to put
a tunnel underneath the 405 I don't know
it's that it's all still kind of up in
the air at this point but I think
they're still trying to pursue something
with with LA I mean I want to see I want
to see something happen I'd love to see
I mean the Olivia ting the 405 traffic
that I mean that would've been a huge
deal like I can see the benefits of it
yeah I don't necessarily know if Elan
should have assumed that he would bypass
some of the standard you know review
process for it but I could see like LA
desperately needs like a mass transit
system that's effective like there's you
know there is a subway now there's
there's a there's a light rail system
I've been on once so people people other
cars out there that familiar with aller
but I know my sisters who live in San
Diego just driving down to a ladies oh
yeah yeah yeah the drive from LA to San
Diego it's it can be bad
yeah for sure so how long until musk
tries to put something like that in for
the new Amazon HQ in Queens I don't know
I would love to see that actually
I would love to suggest a new sides to
current New York Metro transit yeah yeah
I mean it's not gonna happen just
because there's like if you think you
know
has a lot of regulatory red tape I mean
New York City is gonna be way way worse
we're wrapping up here let's take a
couple more questions from Ryan are
there any plans for any other animals
like AIBO cats hamsters any other thing
like that no I mean it looks this is a
reimagining of the original iPhone right
why there's a dog I don't know if
they've explored other like they want to
see how libel works before they start to
do other animals right such a big and
robot is the robot dog is such a I do
you immediately understand that right I
could see like maybe a cat there are
other folks working on companion robots
Patrick Holland wrote a story about like
the Affleck duck there's like a robot
Affleck duck for children cancer
patients patients who can't actually be
around real animals so there's a bunch
of this stuff going on right now it's a
fascinating area are you even if you go
to a toy shop I mean you can't really go
to toy shops anymore but you look at
Amazon and or they write all the toys
are mostly I mean maybe you wouldn't
call them robots right fancy fur bees
exactly that's a Furby so the for real
stuff all the you know babies that oh
those creepy babies it creepy babies Wow
everything you have to pay for diapers
for those babies it's kind of crazy why
those fake babies that's it's insane yes
Bridget always touts the Hachem older oh
yeah really hip and trendy right now
yeah they creep me out big-time
my wife's totally like we should get a
hatch mole for a kid I'm like beanie
babies furbies hatch imel's all right
down the chain oh the same thing I
really wonder though going back to we
were talking about with the other
animals if that is really necessary
because as much as I bow
does it really behave like a dog as much
as any other automated
Sheen would or is it really just our
minds tricking us by looking at it
saying like oh it's a robot dog could
you essentially just put it in a
different chassis and call it something
else does it it does have the mannerisms
of the dog but I get your point I mean
there like I said there are other folks
working on these companion robots most
of them know that it doesn't work to
have a companion that looks like an
actual human because it creeps you out
too much but like a cute thing you know
like really LG companion robot that
failed on us to see us like something
like that the one that took the
faceplant office yeah I mean it was
super adorable right it was also kind of
cute and whatever it's non-threatening
looking that's sort of what I think
that's what a lot of these folks are
trying to do it didn't it may not
necessarily be a dog but some sort of
like cute approachable form factor going
back to the dog even if your mine is the
one that's playing tricks on you yeah if
you're a person that hates cats you want
you prefer a dog or any of you don't
like dogs you might be more interested
if he looks like a cat hi Bo cat yeah
it's just a thought I had like does it
really matter
or is it just another another gadget
really
but I guess depends on how well those
man your isms kind of develop over time
I mean I do think it matters like the
fact that it's a dog I think makes it
more approachable for people yeah it's
like psychologically they get that it's
like a little companion that's what a
dog is man's best friend and just
putting you in back that form factor
makes it more approachable yeah and it
just matters because that's what people
want
yeah it's like you know going for a new
iPhone and if they don't have the roast
goal at this store you might wait any
matters and the phone is exactly the
same but you want that color I won't
have to actually start doing paint jobs
for I bow just like white and silver
yeah right yeah hundred dollars I should
be able to choose the color yeah what if
you want a green dog yeah
dog or or like an app store so you can
change the voice yeah see maybe they
could actually do that pretty easily
yeah right that's just software yeah and
I mean and there is going to be
improvement also in like the commands
and the things you can do like
eventually it'll do more stuff with
updates yep what a horrifying thought
you got a plug your dog into the USB
port to make it learn a new trick no you
don't because it's an 18 to write down
the Wi-Fi yeah Wi-Fi or so never plug in
things because it kind of works by
itself and just sits you know he's
charging I'm sure that that would
destroy the illusion if you had to like
port it to it like ah I like this recent
comment from tech slacker aren't people
getting paranoid with everything in
their home soon turning into a mini
computer with a speaker microphone
camera Wi-Fi connectivity and even a I
that'll learn your habits yes it's
interesting about this because well this
specific dog is not really recording
audio right or video when you take the
pictures once it comes out and you can
take the the pictures with the nose that
will be saving to the cloud but it's not
really
every whatever set it sends to the cloud
the data and the record of what's
happening but it's not it's not like
Amazon Alexa we're like it records what
you're saying yeah yeah yeah and you can
always delete everything but you just
have to call customer service to either
call customer service yeah there isn't
like a web portal where you just or
browser where you just I would have to
look more into it for twenty dollars
they did invest in a website say I mean
you could easy you could be at ease a
little bit sensor it's not really
recording your conversations right right
a lot of processing is done locally
right exactly so everything is internal
right so everything he learns so it'll
save it'll send things to the cloud
because it is learning more things with
time but it's just the record of what's
happening hmm more than actual audio
yeah although I imagine if you're yeah
if you are creeped out by privacy issues
I mean that this is probably gonna worry
you like
yeah and the thing that is sending to
the cloud is the big church just because
you can get them on your phone right
right right
you know there has to be a way of it yep
you know you always talk about the the
camera in the nose but you keep skimming
past my favorite feature the dog but cam
that's just Matt being the room you
can't take a picture with it's but no
until somebody hacks it sorry I had to
go there yeah I mean I was talking to
Bridget about this and I was and I was
saying what if I go into a place where
there's no Wi-Fi can i connect my phone
into the dog if it has the AT&amp;amp;T service
you have to hack the day yeah sure okay
I can't imagine this is a like a really
high speed connection No so yeah we're
talking about hacking without it I mean
once you do that then I don't know you
get a call from you TT like okay you've
used like I don't know how you're I Bose
use 50 gigs of data but we're shut your
I bow down I'm sorry all right I'm
putting a challenge out there to anybody
out watching this show if you do get an
eyeball I challenge you to hack it and
show us the results we'll have you on
the show
I want to see that yeah I would love to
see that we're just about out of time
let's talk real quick about the electric
scooters Timothy says the electric
scooter is a next version of walking
down the street using a cell phone and
looking down and not paying attention
hopefully it all calmed down eventually
he's not wrong there I don't see as many
of the scooters but I know our our
friend Joey here in the office he uses
the one wheel a lot any number of
variants in there
I should we start licensing people for
these scooters cuz like if there's that
many out there who can't well that's the
issue is it's not people buying these
East Cooter's it's these rentable
scooters right like bird and lime a
bunch of these services which haven't
come to New York yet but I think will be
coming soon that just like our our city
bikes basically can rent you know 10
minutes on the scooter so they can get
across town so you've got people just
are randomly riding these things
and so that just I feel like that is a
recipe for injury particularly here in
New York and also I mean I know there's
a lot of loss like in New York you're
not allowed to ride your bikes on the
side so I walk yeah you know is that the
same with the scooters I don't know I
think it kind of goes with anything that
is a two-wheel rideable thing I think
they even get uppity about it with scape
words even though it doesn't technically
they don't want you using a vehicle on
the sidewalk so yeah I would imagine a
scooter would qualify would have to be
on the street as a plane you actually
imagine driving a scooter or riding a
scooter in the streets of New York City
next to the bosses and all the traffic
next to the next to the cabs and the
cars and other bikers I mean that just
yeah I'm still flabbergasted by the
bikers themselves like the way they
handle themselves in and out of traffic
and with the city bike rentals and all
those things happening the ride-sharing
stuff like that's getting bonkers and
I'm seeing people out there it's always
funny to see that guy in like a full
button-down suit riding a bike to work
oh yeah it's like props to him for the
effort but you see more often than not a
bunch of them who probably have never
ridden a bike in their life using city
bike yeah not cool to see what I hate
seeing is people riding a bike looking
at their phones would drive me crazy
without a helmet and and I've been here
about a bike before cuz also they they
think that traffic laws don't apply to
them right so you're looking to see if
there's a car coming and it wants to
make a bike comes from the other side
and I mean the scooter is pretty much
the same thing oh yeah scooter you're
thinking the laws don't apply to you
yeah yeah well anyway PSA time watch the
road no matter what you're riding or
driving yeah careful out there we don't
have enough doctors out there to handle
everybody falling off scooters these
days we are out of time thank you
everybody for joining us thank you Sally
