know you're carrying I'm Dan Ackerman
and this is the Lenovo la vie Zi 360
this is a hybrid version of the live
easy a laptop that we think is very
impressive because it's got a very slim
very light magnesium lithium alloy
battery it makes it super lightweight
the regular clamshell version is 1.9
pounds this hybrid version that has a
touchscreen and folds back just like
lenovo's yoga tablets is 2.0 4 pounds
that's exactly the same weight as
Apple's 12-inch MacBook although this is
a much more powerful system it has an
Intel Core i7 processor versus the core
m in the MacBook unfortunately it
doesn't have the same design fit and
finish as the MacBook does or even the
MacBook Air it's really got this fairly
bad keyboard I especially hate the small
shift key over here it's very easy to
miss type with a shift key and the arrow
key right next to it and a small
backspace key you'll find a ton of
annoying things about this keyboard but
it's got a lot of flexibility you can
use the hybrid hinge just like on the
yoga to put it into kind of a kiosk mode
and then you can fold it all the way
down to use it like a tablet we've seen
some complaints that the accelerometer
that changes the screen like this works
fine in tablet mode but if you just flip
it upside down into like a table tent it
actually doesn't kick in and rotate the
screen after we fold it all the way down
into the tablet mode to do that that
actually is pretty annoying especially
if you want to make use of all the
different forms that you can fold a
hybrid like this into besides that it's
a little bit more expensive than the
clamshell at 1699 versus $14.99 got the
same core i7 team 256 gig SSD I do like
however that it has a touchscreen which
is pretty much a must-have item for
anyone using Windows 8 these days of the
two options a hybrid Z 360 and the
clamshell just regular Z I don't go with
the other one because there's $200 less
and weighs less this way is the same
amount as that 12-inch MacBook but you
do get the touchscreen with it so if
that's worth a little bit extra to you I
totally understand I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Lenovo the VZ 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
