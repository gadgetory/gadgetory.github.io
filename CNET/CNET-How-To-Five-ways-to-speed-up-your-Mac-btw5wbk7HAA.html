you might start to notice it slowing
down to a crawl
applications take too long to load and
even doing simple things like saving
files can take forever but before you go
out and buy a new computer here are five
ways to clean and speed up your Mac
first if your computer is slow to boot
up it's probably because it's trying to
launch a bunch of applications at the
same time to fix this all you need to do
is disable some of those startup items
so go to System Preferences then to
users and groups and then click on the
login items tab to see a list of the
apps that open when you boot up your Mac
remove any apps that you don't need at
startup another big problem is getting
major slow down when you're using more
than a couple applications for most apps
your computer should be able to handle
this without a problem but if an app is
taking up too many active resources it
could wreak havoc on your system so open
the Activity Monitor the numbers here
are constantly going up and down showing
you the amount of CPU and memory
resources each app is using so if you
see an app is taking up too many
resources it might be time to look for a
replacement or if you absolutely need
that app consider using it without any
additional apps running at the same time
another culprit might be your hard drive
if it's getting too close to its storage
limit in this case use an app like Omni
disk sweeper or disk inventory X to find
out what's taking up space on your drive
and delete any big storage hogs if you
can at this point you should also use
the built-in Disk Utility to fix any
issues there might be with your hard
drives directory the directory is like a
road map your computer uses to retrieve
files and if that's out of order it can
cause your Mac to slow down so head to
the Disk Utility and choose your hard
drive from the left panel make sure
you're viewing the first aid tab and
then click the repair disk button in the
lower right corner if you did all of
these things and your Mac's still won't
perk up you might need to
more RAM you can get eight gigs for
about $50 which is a whole lot cheaper
than buying a new computer check out
cnn.com for the guide to doing it
yourself and finally always keep your
operating system current it's free and
the new systems often include
improvements I can speed up your
computer light compressed memory in OS

your max performance and you can get the
