at or below the hundred dollar mark the
camera makers make up for a lack of
features and middle and video quality by
throwing in a bunch of accessories
Xiaomi does the opposite for its Yi
action cam
I'm Josh globe loosey net and xiaomi
used higher-end components things found
in cameras costing $300 or more to
deliver excellent video quality and a
robust feature set including 1080p
capture at 60 frames per second 720p at
120 frames per second or VGA at 240
frames per second plus many photo
options there's built-in Wi-Fi too so
you can remotely control the camera and
get a viewfinder as well but since the
camera is made for the Chinese market
not all of it is in English enough so
that you can use it though also since
it's primarily available in China you'll
have to pick it up from an online
retailer there are a few other downsides
to consider mainly that you'll have to
lay out more money for a waterproof
housing or even a basic adhesive mount
and you'll want an extra battery or two
if you want to go out all day and shoot
because battery life is just ok you can
check out the full review on cnet.com
but all in all it's an excellent camera
for the money I'm Josh Goldman and
that's a quick look at the Xiaomi yi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
