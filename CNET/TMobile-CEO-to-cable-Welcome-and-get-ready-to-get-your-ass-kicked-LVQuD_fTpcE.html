2017 joining me now is a very special
guest t-mobile CEO John Leger great to
be here thanks for uh thanks for being
here your star Roger I'm not pleased
fans waiting there with you not yet
trust me
haha sure Roger rook ah so you just
wrapped up the the t-mobile presser for
the folks who didn't get to go want you
to run through the the announcements
that you made for t-mobile one yeah well
we did we did a couple things first of
all and you've been a part of it for
years ago today we announced the
uncarrier and so did a little
recapturing of how much the world has
changed one hundred and fifty five
million people know along I have
contracts all that crazy crap used to
know about free devices all overages
until we captured kind of what's gone on
and then I actually announced q4 results
because I wanted people to know how well
things are going to point 1 million net
additions 1.2 million postpaid nine
hundred thirty three thousand post paid
phones and five hundred and forty-one
thousand prepay let's so get into some
of the easy for you to say get on to the
news and so then what we did is we had
discussed the fact that the world and
mobile internet has changed and requires
new rules so amongst the new rules were
what you see should be what you pay so
with the first wireless carrier on the
postpaid site to go all in taxes and
fees so that's $40 a line period for a
family of four
then we announced something called
kickback and what it is is what if you
don't use it we should pay you for it so
in effect additional lines on t-mobile
one are $20 but if you use two gigs or
less will give you $10 back we also
extended the uncon tracked team over one
unlimited which means we will never
raise your rate we guarantee and lastly
what we kind of said is internet mobile
access shouldn't be sold in the bit and
byte so I announced it as of January
22nd we're going all-in on t-mobile one
and all we're going to sell is t-mobile
one unlimited so I want to jump in on
that because yeah you first did that you
made that announcement in the summer
with uncarrier 12 t-mobile one would be
the one plan
you guys you got a lot of backlash for
that you got a lot of lot of heat folks
weren't really happy with it the cynical
folks would say well you're eliminating
the cheap plan for folks who don't use
that data so in effect is this sort of
your way of addressing some of those
concerns you know interesting if you
this is going to take some time for
people to realize that it's not trickery
right because in effect let's suppose
somebody was a you know a low end user
you know minimal data plan suppose they
paid $50 that plan would taxes and fees
is more than you would ultimately get if
you're a low user and you bought one
line on t-mobile one and got kickback so
in effect $40 along let me give you one
piece that's cool at Verizon as hell up
Bryce it's kind of same colors they um
their XXL plan that's kind of like the
me size plan it's a hundred and ten
dollars a month but the bill says two
hundred and ten dollars and seventy
cents because it's part of the industry
in the United States has 17 billion
dollars worth of fees that aren't part
of what's advertised so a big deal
because taxes of fees aren't under your
control right taxes and fees can
actually go up where taxes can go up
state local taxes right so it's so in
effect what we're doing with this we're
not raising price so voila
everybody will save money now we
anticipated this when we announced t
know t-mobile won and we are not raising
prices and we are investing this money
these fees don't go away
USF sales etc etc we're going to pay
them investing in our customers and
that's what makes us the fastest growing
wireless company in America okay well
moving on I mean you made some other
bold predictions one of one which I
found very interesting was Google one of
the big players entering the wireless
business what I know what makes you
think some of these guys are gonna well
it's get in there you know for the
people weren't there I decided at the
end just make a few predictions like no
big surprise that the cable players are
coming in to wireless so Comcast and
charter are coming in with an MVNO and
what I what I predicted is M
no it's not going to work nobody's
buying that crap it's you know if the
Verizon MVNO is not going to provide
them the ability to compete with us and
those monopolists they don't know how to
compete so well c'mon in
you're gonna get your ass kicked now
second then I said you know this the
mobile internet space is huge so if your
Facebook your Apple your Amazon your
Google you're gonna sit by and watch
somebody's coming in in a big way and I
picked Google I mean they got Google
five got pixel good Android so I don't
know I'm not clairvoyant I say they're
coming in and by the way come on in so I
had a few other that's the thing that
Google is a big company with a huge
brand right I mean why why wouldn't you
be nervous by a Google competing against
Google ok I'm cute right now Google is
in Wireless it's called Project five and
you guys are partly due yeah of course
yeah listen I think what you learned
from the uncarrier over the last four
years is if you focus on your customers
and give them that one you shouldn't be
shocked when they love it
and there's nothing there's nothing
Google has to offer except a whole
shitload of money you can't say that in
this stinking oh oh bleep it later
but now bring them on in and by the way
remember with t-mobile we do mobile very
well and the industry is going to change
I'm not saying we won't be a part of
some of these things right we may we may
find a way using our brand and
capability to deliver right now last
thing I'll say this don't you think it's
crazy that the industries are defined by
the infrastructure that they built so
it's the cable industry the wireless
industry the Internet industry I get
news for you these folks with their
devices could care less they want all of
you to get your together and then
figure out how to let them watch
whatever they want whatever they want
wherever so bring it together it's all
coming together so I wanted to ask and I
asked you this at the press conference
yeah oh are you looking forward to
president elect Trump well listen so far
there's a lot of anticipation about an
environment of less regulation
potentially lower tax and
vironment the ability to invest more
some of the restrictions that have been
put on us there's a lot of expectation
that they will be freer to compete
certainly the markets have been quite
responsive to a lot of his initial ideas
and I would tell you that I'm quite
optimistic about the economic
environment and I'm planning in
seventeen to invest heavily and grow in
the business and I wouldn't you know do
that unless I was you guys have made
peace after your little Twitter feud I
you know I don't I don't see anything as
a Twitter feud the issue for me is I've
always been outspoken on Twitter so has
you know president-elect Trump and we
did at one point time what to people
that play on Twitter do you know only
four other people is that seen as
abnormal you know somebody tweets a
tweet back by the way I would say before
he came along did what he's doing on
Twitter I was like you know a pretty
good Twitter guy that guy's got game
he's not you know and he gets up and
does his geez it's a big deal that's
that's debatable
I actually think he's using social media
communications in a way that no one's
ever seen before and I know because I do
it
similarly myself yeah I would argue that
you from an interface from a business
perspective is it again done for there
see Roger yeah you know I can you know I
can tweet about you please don't yeah I
got photos please don't just saying uh I
know you do yeah yellow shoes on which
is kind of knowing to me Laker Laker a
make a yellow by the way okay not sprint
game doesn't wanted to be clear nope
look it leads me my next question
because Trump is all of a sudden very
BFFs with the masses on who's the head
of Softbank who is a sprint parent
company do you see a Sprint t-mobile
murder down the line first of all let's
not let's not trivialize mafiosi son
took just being Sprint this is one of
the wealthiest most powerful guys you
know in the world and he made a fifty
billion dollar invest in fifty thousand
job commitment to president like Trump
that's a big deal and it should be
applauded then there's what gets into
that is what's going to happen in the
environment the United States and as I
said Sprint
needs to do something and you know some
people are asking is there a possibility
yeah there's a possibility of any
different kind of consolidation you know
there's also a possibility that a cable
company would by Sprint
it's going to be changed it's going to
be fantastic and right now it's
certainly you know it's it's it's
created a lot of enthusiasm around the
industry yes certainly the telecom
companies have been pretty happy about I
don't know I don't know if everyone's
happy about it but yeah everybody except
CNET
I mean here come on look at you you're a
star here this is I'm not a star please
stop saying that yeah so then it
wouldn't be it wouldn't be an interview
video interview with you without the
word association game cuz I wanted to
end it with with that so I'll throw out
a couple words please give me the first
word that comes up in your mind all
right
18t for pariah we can't say that
Verizon okay dumber sprint yellow Google
big unlimited only a t-mobile
okay what about Sprint now like John
lemon if it doesn't work it's alright
last Ben Affleck Oh Batman alright
pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
