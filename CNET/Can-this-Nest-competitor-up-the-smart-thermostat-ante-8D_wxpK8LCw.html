here with a $279 Honeywell lyric
thermostat so the most noticeable thing
about this is its rounded shape it's
very similar to the Nest Learning
Thermostat that's two hundred and fifty
dollars and it's pretty clear that
Honeywell got its inspiration for this
smart thermostat from the nest so first
off I really like the design I like the
rounded shape I like that it has this
dial that you can turn to set the
temperature it's a really sleek looking
thermostat it's definitely an
improvement on design from the Honeywell
Wi-Fi smart thermostat and the Honeywell
Wi-Fi smart thermostat with voice
control that I reviewed last year it'll
definitely be more of a statement for
your wall than those traditional sort of
square utilitarian thermostats that
we've seen lately I also really like the
design of the app I think it's very
intuitive very well laid out and very
easy to use
well Honeywell definitely drew some
design inspiration from the nest it
definitely has some features that set it
apart rather than a learning algorithm
that sort of adapts to your usage over
time this one has geofencing that
basically means that you can set it to
500 feet or seven miles and once your
smartphone gets within that radius it
will shut off to a way mode and when
you're on your way back home it'll do
the same thing it'll switch back to home
mode I do think this is a really smart
solution for people with really hectic
schedules something that might be hard
for an algorithmic base thermostat to
keep up with I really like how hands-off
that is and I like that you can set it
to 500 feet or seven miles that makes it
really simple for both urban and more
suburban lifestyles but I did experience
some weird glitches with the geofencing
in particular I set the app to send me
notifications when the geofencing
crossed the 500 foot threshold both
going away and back home and I
continually got error messages and it
never once worked correctly and it did
set itself to away mode and back to home
mode successfully most of the time the
problem I had though is that both the
thermostat and the app didn't say away
mode or home mode so you couldn't always
be sure that it had worked the right way
especially because the notifications
weren't working a handful of times I
also ran into a problem where I would
set the geofencing to 500 feet leave
home come back and that would work
perfectly
but then once I got home it would revert
back to a way mode which is obviously
not ideal so while it's a little bit
glitchy right now I think with some
firmware updates it could be an
excellent Ness competitor thanks for
watching I'm Meghan malort in Pristina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
