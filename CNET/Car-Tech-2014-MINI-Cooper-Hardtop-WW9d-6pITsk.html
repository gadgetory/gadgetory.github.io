and this is a big deal this cars been
out about what 12 years and they've only
revised it once before since launch so
here's the third generation car look at
it you could walk right by it and think
it's the last generation car very subtle
differences because that's the name of
the game when you're in the retro icon
business little different taillights are
one spotters trick they're a little
bigger with some LED modules it's also
got optional LED headlights which is
pretty unusual in this price category
your base car is a one and a half liter
three-cylinder I'm that's something new
your s car is a four cylinder 2-liter
turbo used to be the turbo was the esket
now they both have turbo chargers that's
how they make up for the missing
cylinder on the three difference in
performance about a second to 60
separates them there's a giant mock-up
of the new mini touch controller so it's
not quite this big but it's much bigger
than it used to be they've now got a
large central knob that has the turn
click and kick functionality common in
so many cars plus you got a bunch of you
you know home run buttons here they'll
take you directly to certain functions
like audio telephone on the main menu
this is also dialing into a revives mini
interface on the LCD but what's really
new is they've got a head-up display a
HUD available for the first time that's
also I think a first in their class okay
minor revisions to the overall layout of
the dash is where a lot of the icon part
happens as well you got the big old pie
plate central gauge which is optional
with the LCD multimedia screen and the
mini touch controller we just looked at
all of them have a little different knee
bolster shaping here the way this
inverted T comes down together and
they've also redone this binnacle where
the tack and the speedo live minor
differences over all the car prints
about the way it was except for these
new technology interfaces one thing I
hope they can address with this new mini
are there either meant to in the cellar
reliability ratings on these cars in the
exuberance around their style and
kookiness sometimes that doesn't get
noticed by buyers it's an important
issue though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
