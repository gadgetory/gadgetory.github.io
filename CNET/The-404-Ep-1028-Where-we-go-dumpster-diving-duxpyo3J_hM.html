show on Sina TV I'm Jeff Bakalar and I'm
Justin you and this is the show where we
go dumpster diving hell yes uh we'll
have a little funny story about that I
want to ask Richard cuz he's back in the
studio yes yeah welcome back man thank
you I know Mark was gone last week so
you had to do double duty in the morning
I did a lot of that have to do it's
tough switching man haven't told you all
the appreciative emails we've gotten
from listeners that want more of you on
the show yeah yeah just what do they say
they're like force him to serve more
yeah oh yeah I don't talk much I just
cuz whenever I start talking I get
confused and I pushed her off oh yeah I
know that's like it's not easy it's
tough pushing all the right buttons f
does so we really appreciate that
Richard we're talking about we talk
about dumpster diving in the in the
pre-show and you know that usually has
to deal with people like hackers who go
dumpster diving like you know corporate
garbage disposer raises and find out
like password could have been written
down where I guess is like the simplest
explanation though I was always setting
it with like a crust punk thing where
they wanted to be like freegans for
example no I think it evolved into that
too but i think the it's sort of debut
what or at least its its popularization
was because right you know they would go
in and sort of look for information you
like it to steal or like Fight Club
right go and get that fat exactly good
fat the fat of the land so you Richard
used to dumpster dive where when I was a
teenager I would go dumpster diving at
the hostess store so your is in Utah
yeah because it because I'd like the day
things expire they throw them all away
right answer you can go behind the store
just over the dumpsters get all this all
these donuts and Twinkies and stuff yes
and there they expire that same day so
not bad yet there in the wrappers and
everything would only throw the hostess
uh baked goods away together I'd they
would put trash in there you would have
coffee grinds in the bags yeah it was
mostly just the just the baked goods
their roster I
though this is cool about it did you do
this no I did this a lot what did you
get berkeley they had the cliff bar
factory yeah those are even better
because they're all individually wrapped
and they were so throw away yeah they
would throw away boxes and boxes and
cliff bars and those are you know those
last forever I'm not sure I can endorse
this why I mean if you are if you're
really struggling yeah I mean you gotta
do what you gotta do here's another pro
tip there's a million dunkin donuts in
the city oh yeah they always throw the
bags you don't even have to dump some
guy for that you gotta fight bombs for
that if you go to a dunkin donuts and
the ones that are not 24 hours you go
like maybe 15 20 minutes before closing
time right you will never have to pay
for donut ever really he's just going
you say hey yeah what are you throwing
out and they'll be like here you do that
we used to do that in college there was
a dunkin donuts that was open until four
right every night why were they open why
were they not just open 24 hours hours
yeah they're open 24 and we would have
we get there like 3-330 and it was just
you know filippo i think his name was
and he would just give us that's awesome
just ever just everything yeah it's
great we would go to 89 munchkins yeah
would you do it that's party it would
draw my cars except it's great I think
all that you want to throw anyone you
throw one ain't I've been to bakeries
like yeah the really nice like cupcake
bakeries yeah go like right before they
close they'll give you a whole cake it's
amazing okay yeah yeah I got a whole
cake one haha Richard takes the cake
yeah certainly does they would have
there's a north face outlet in Oakland
and when those clothing would expire and
when the clothing when the gore-tex
would go back they would but now they
would put a jackets that wouldn't sell
in the dumpsters as well huh but they'll
be kind of messed up about it they would
slash the jackets before I him away why
just to be spiteful of the kids that
they knew would pick it up it's messed
up yeah cut up your you know plastic can
what are those things called plastic
things that well service a turtle's find
themselves locked in oh yeah yeah like a
separator cut those up yeah not a jacket
jacket uh how was your guys's holiday
weekend it's pretty good yeah good had
fun didn't do anything didn't do
anything that around that's always fun
to yeah yeah I guess you guys don't I
really have family local know
I went to back home to Jersey in my
parents place and my moms like you got
to clean out your closet you've moved
out of here for like six years ready
it's ridiculous clean out your closet
okay so not only did I find an NES to
Dreamcast why we'll have to dream cast
for let me remember buying one let alone
tune-up a plethora of games more than I
needed a Super Nintendo Sega Genesis and
an original PlayStation ah so I didn't
bring them back as the box that they
were in ER is enormous but uh we're
gonna do something with all this up it's
too good to pass up you can't just let
that go by did you find a giant file or
you know like CD organizers no games to
know the games no they were also in
their cases listen to this okay so
here's also a weird thing and tell me
what you think about this this is I
think this is more revealing about me in
my possible OCD I had boxes and boxes
and boxes I think a total of six or
seven filled with empty CD jewel cases
huh but they had so so the CD wasn't in
there and the booklet wasn't in there
was just like the back oh right because
you had the organizers that you would
write the bullet and the CD right I
don't know where those are I think those
were maybe under my bed I just didn't
look yeah but I found boxes of those
with the cases and how crazy is it kept
the back part of it what was I thinking
what CDs were there dude little 700 CDs
that's awesome so many the fact that you
actually bought CDs I found like bent
the Dookie CD I saw yeah so like early
ranted stuff stuff from like 91 92
what's crazy that all seven of those
cases is probably worth maybe five or
six dollars nothing nothing literally I
don't think they're worth anything yeah
maybe like the vinyl original vinyl
Prince of them right you know and I was
just like what was I thinking I had all
these empty jewel cases I don't know
yeah it's crazy to me so did you keep
all the games and stuff yes games are
all fine I didn't bring him the old me
because they're just the thing was just
so massive yeah
but I actually found something else
pretty cool I used to I used to really
be obsessed with drawing and like and
specifically the far side remember the
far side yeah of course so I found like
a whole book of cartoons I got to bring
that in but I also was drawing a lot of
like comics and like Green Day stuff
pull this up this is so here's a photo
of you just got this green day kerplunk
I'll come again the album before Duque
was called kerplunk right and I don't
know i was just like into drawing stuff
about it and i just drew like they look
like this is what i did is the door so
what year was that that one yeah
kerplunk a mountain like 91 or 92 or
something like that all right look at
that that's what the cover looked like
flower more or less i think it was like
a girl wearing a t-shirt of that
flattered but pretty much yeah it was
called kerplunk pull up the other thing
i was obsessed with the max look at that
max drawing huh pretty good that's not
bad what did you take out so you took a
photo of this drawing with yourself on
right buddy's Flyers 1995 you took a
picture yeah how you got this yeah okay
yeah say uh this is funny cuz you signed
the name with in cursive yeah Jay
bakalar 95 yeah it's awesome it is cool
i love this like Max logo is pretty
spots not bad at the lining no that's
great I'm I'm not gonna lie kind of
feeling myself right now yeah you shaded
in properly it see when I drew stuff
like Ninja Turtles and crap yeah it was
always like with really like like the
cloud shaped muscles right right birds
like em birds right all right there
seems to be more detailed definition
although his kneecaps are pretty pointy
yeah but I think that's what the max is
all about he had like weird body
features yes but his claws look okay I
don't know man I'm kind of psyched on
this I was like yo present well you know
you it's almost what almost uh man oh
man it's like fifth of 17 years yeah
what's going on in the background here
what did I don't know i don't remember i
think that was from like sleepaway camp
or something yeah it's adorable wacky
stuff in the back there so that's what i
unearthed while i was why it's crazy all
and i found old tech remember the Sega I
r7000 I've no idea what that look that
up for me because I found one
should have brought that I've never
heard of that Sega I r7000 me da yeah it
was like a PDA I found my Palm Pilot I
found uh here alone pilot did you have
like a palm five I think okay the one I
guess shaped like a V I found this thing
what is this I like it was made by sega
yeah as maybe sega uh you could do like
a battle mode over infrared hence the ir
um and I think you just like I things
just like had a calendar and like
contacts in there and you like beam it
back and forth I forget I wanted one so
bad and I just don't remember what I did
with it that's really cool it's crazy i
found old uh I found a watchman do you
know to watch yeah yeah yeah I found
that that was crazy it was black and
white um I found remember lick lick
those cameras uh man you're like testing
my google speeds there there were these
old cameras he's like single shoulder
cameras as opposed to cameras that have
multiple ish matter but it was I click
yeah lick lick I forget I was Chris old
old film cameras okay they were like
very 80s so much so that they would look
awesome in like Williamsburg man happy I
mean yeah yeah autotech crate crazy
retro tech found a bunch of Motorola
flip phones and or about you have a box
full of this out a technology and on the
box it said old-school tech oh wow I was
like oh what this motorola phone i found
was enormous yeah you know what i want
us crying again is my old talk boy FX
plus never that home alone yeah i had
one of those yeah the one with like that
cassette tape you would put into yeah
you could slow it down yeah it's awesome
you know what else I found this thing
called the final word you know that is
no this little black box not no bigger
than like a deck of cards smaller uh
with a button on the side you click the
button and it says like hey go after
yourself welcome like that yeah oh yeah
they're like they recorded voice of yeah
yeah I had one of their like keychains
cursing to like yeah I crap right right
I've ever had one of those I had one
that you could throw against the wall
and when it hit the wall it would say
those days like now watch it son of a
bitch yes SMR effort right whoa this is
what I haven't
junghans so cool crazy I want to find my
gak again too yeah I Niccolo image a
bubble gak yeah I had the bubble yeah
you know we're talking gak was like
Nicola ladies branded slime remember
that God became Iraq I came out around
the time of double dare we mark summers
in kind of variation on the slime that
they poured on people for sure and it
was kind of like malleable goo yeah what
would you even do with it I don't know I
remember ghostbusters uh had it to where
you just sort of poured it and you
played with it and it wasn't dirty like
it didn't stain your clothes it was
actually kind of cool it smelled real
weird yeah because it was probably
nuclear right example out pick pieces
often and eat it throughout the day all
that you would you yeah that was a bad
the bubble gak was the best though and
then they have like gak that was
multicolored they really went off on a
total ran with that I was I don't big
rob 29 the chatroom points out that you
have obviously make fart noises with oh
yeah you could when you were squishing
it india right area it would be like
there's nice yeah really cool stuff
we're not even talking about technology
not anymore it's just it so then this
whole weekend was just a blast from the
past yeah unearthing old childhood
secrets I would love to find all my own
old palm pilots I think enough time has
passed where those things would be kind
of I'm kind of an idiot abroad it all
back yeah I just didn't have enough
because we're bringing so much other
stuff I just never room will bring it
back next we will next time a lot of old
photos too mmm need to digitize that
like Polaroids just like go from going
to shows in the early night uh yeah I
wanna see what a fourteen-year-old Jeff
Beck oh it's mom I mean no not in a lot
of them get on the chains on no way tree
this is pre genco job okay yeah anyway
that's what I did this weekend hope you
guys had a great holiday weekend let's
uh hit up the run down and see what's
shakin for this monday april 9th yeah
what about this story about ipads in
church what is that oh yes this is uh
kind of interesting so I know you didn't
go to church yesterday no I did not did
you even look at a church about church I
don't I don't see churches or temple
yeah I'm kidding um so there was a new
york times article that came out
yesterday
it's sort of focusing on this church in
Illinois uh call the willow creek
community church right and uh sort of
talking about how using tablets and uh
smartphones in church are kinda becoming
more acceptable now really obviously the
past few years uh you know smartphones
getting more popular those oh weird
stigma against using them because they
kind of are huge distraction but now I
feel like churches like you know what
anything to get people in exactly so far
as to even allow the pastors to use
church to use iPads for you know all for
their Easter services now if you are now
open your Genesis app right to things to
a struck me is really interesting one
they were talking about how pastors are
starting to not have to memorize their
sermons right because they can just use
their iPads as like you know
presentation sure and slides to they're
also talking about how you know like
churchgoers are using their iPads and
it's becoming a huge distraction for
pastors that don't like technology in
the services because you know it's kind
of like that effect in the movie theater
where if you look out onto a sea of
faces you're only going to look at the
one that has a giant you know their
faces lit up right by the devices
they're using it and so like those dim
lights obviously create a problem and a
distraction for the pastor as well I am
honestly a little surprised that this is
okay in some places yeah yeah I am I've
seen it a lot in in my church that I go
to because people put their like their
Bible in their scriptures on the on
their iPad so they'll read it right but
they're they're not like distracted by
angry birds space every now and then
like yeah I think so did I yeah right
but it's a lot easier than having to
flip through every chapter you know when
you want a reference it yeah it's like
yeah you can just search it or whatever
it's Lottie right get this area to get
you huh so I could see how that and then
also carrying around a heavy Bible would
probably be a sure just an iPad gotta
you know we gotta keep the everyone's
spine in check yeah I think what if one
of the guys that uh is pro using iPads
compares it to how he's like well you
know when the original Gutenberg Bible
came out I'm sure that the noises of the
pages turning was really annoying for
the pastor's as well
another thing that they have to get over
the grasping at straws yeah kind of a
dubious compared for sure haha
interesting but I could have bet yeah
I'm sure like oh yeah that's yeah you
know God can't have any of that they
hate it um I want to get into another
story this is kind of old but we
definitely should bring bring it up
number one because it just makes me
think of Wilson a little bit uh who yeah
and it's a little old like i said but a
big story that made headlines late last
week and over the weekend and it's so
funny how you hear about these stories
and so late after they actually break
we're talking about the mac flashback
virus that has a supposedly hit an
estimated 600,000 max which is a lot i
think that's a lot right that seems like
a ton it seems like a time so basically
you know the the the virus came out last
week and or I'm not to came out last
week but it was just sort of making
headlines and it's basically in fact
infects your system by creating a fake
flash installation interface okay so
people like oh I'm just installing flash
will know you're installing this this
virus but I think the big story is
forget the virus viruses on max that's
the real thing people was like oh I'm
invulnerable you know I'm invulnerable
to to viruses because i have a mac and
i'm actually surprised it took this long
for something this pervasive right you
really start to create some waves you
feel like people one of the main reasons
people think they're bi or one of the
reasons they buy a mac is because they
think it's impervious through higher
that's a huge selling which is simply
which has never been the case never been
the case there have been mac viruses
forever right but they're pervasiveness
hasn't reached a tipping point where
people are making viruses for that
platform so this is more like a Trojan
right like right not a virus that I by a
conventions of your computer right it's
more like a fishing thing to get
personal information from these users
direct all it i'm just usually it virus
to you know it's really it's still an
unwanted mail we're sort of
infection right right see like when I
when I'm thinking about viruses that
convince me to buy mac / pc it's the
ones that i don't have to worry about
you know like my computer slowing down a
lot right like the hidden ones that sure
in fact pcs a commonly I'm I feel like
I'm gonna catch a las like for saying
this yeah lately I've not been overly
impressed with lion and how it it's the
multitasking is in it I just I feel like
it struggles I feel like it chugs along
a little bit occasionally I don't know I
don't get that super quick I mean the
machine i have here is is an insanely
fast machine i think this one is like 16
gigs are a minute so it's not really
gonna stutter are you worried about I
just say that flashback might be on you
not at all no I just think in general
I'm just I don't know there's something
going on it just doesn't feel as quick
as it used to right and I know it's it's
it's it's a totally subjective or
anything right it could be and it's
subjective to like I just remember the
first powerbook I had just I just
remember having all these apps opened up
and I know absolutely you know uh demand
more memory and I know they get more
intense and they get more complex but
the hardware and and processors are
supposed to you know evolved parallel to
that them right in power I don't know I
just feel like do you also have an
updated version of the operating system
I do gonna have the latest and greatest
yeah I don't know even the imac i have
now on my desk if i have like two
browsers open and spotify yeah it lags a
little i feel like we haven't really
crack that egg yet to really figure out
why computer slow down over time right
they just keep everything I just or to
do that's just something we've come to
accept but maybe it should be like it's
their one sort of human characteristic
yeah they get old they get old and they
stop they don't work as fit and I don't
it shouldn't be like that right yeah I
don't know I feel like I feel like I'm
gonna we're going to cash now that the
story's a little older there's got to be
ways that you can sort of detect to see
you oh absolutely there's plenty of ways
to do it so head over to cnet com we
actually have a is like a web utility
yeah utility we can point you in the
direction of that tells you whether or
not you have it and how you can delete
it right I checked all my computers all
right you know
no I wanted it uh this is something that
is sort of related uh there's another
story in The New York Times today that
was kind of cool this is talking about
text message spam okay apparently that
has doubled in the amount of victims
that it's affected lat since last year
it's I guess in 2011 there were four
point five billion spam texts mmm sent
and I don't know I wanted to ask you
guys in your experience have you guys
been getting these uh like you know text
messages offering you discount soon or
for signing up for surveys anything that
I was unwanted because a member you've
been getting a lot of weird spam from I
am recently okay I yeah those are all
porn I mean um I've been getting all
I've got my first official spam text
like two months ago yeah was it for do
you remember um mine was Porter related
as well as like everyone is he dirty
girls reply yes yeah yes i did i just
replied maybe yeah yeah you know maybe
maybe coy with that he will you to know
higgs a dependent member it was for
definitely pissed me off yeah thought I
was clear you know I mean you know when
you have that number and you're like no
one knows this number who shouldn't
write you know odd that so the are
setting the articles talking about and
says kinda scary a lot of the spammers
get their information uh sold to them
from i don't i don't know if it's
actually the Red Cross but volunteer
donation no like that where you text you
know yes or a number two you know like
three four five nine they're
automatically donate a certain amount to
agency well if it's for charity they're
saying that made they're getting a lot
of their information from those firms so
that's implying that these charity
organizations Ric selling your
information and they own their donation
but using that money for charity right
which is fine I hope you know it's not
bad as i find you use in there some sort
of privacy policy you you unwillingly
signed there's gotta be but they don't
really detail that when they just say or
things like uh online oh no I'm sorry
things like mobile voting or reality
show like measure I don't you deserve
yeah
you gotta assume you yes you should be
getting span right because if you're the
type of person that votes in American
Idol yeah you're probably gonna wanna
come on i watch American I don't vote
right but i watch million vote if you're
one of those people are like voting oh
my god oh my god David Cook my son and I
got you deserve to get span yeah it's a
trade-off it's a dream about you got it
except to think about it because you fit
in that demographic right exactly if
you're entering in your willingly
disclosing vital information about your
habit right you're like hey I'm one of
these people that vote in reality shows
don't be surprised when you get a
payless coupon key to your text hey sims
death yes that's what you're saying some
pretty much I beg I don't have enough
stuff to buy I need to enlarge things
yeah and I need you know I need to be
buying stuff um yeah this is funny like
I guess it's gotten so bad that they
invented a new term for it uh you know
how fishing we just talked about is
fishing is is get trying to get
violation account information right
typically through e mail fraud there's a
mobile version of that now and it's
gotten so bad that they're calling it
smishing like SMS Oh fishing yeah ok so
don't fill out surveys I guess the two
most popular ones are like a need cash
now spam right we're like they'll offer
you cash for just filling out certain
information like providing them you make
account sure yeah um so don't do that
guys smishing yeah I like that fishing
Oh have you been smishing you look
terrible yeah that's got a dirty it does
sound dirty all right moving right along
google maps which has become my saving
grace for all things navigation i use
google maps on my android phone for
navigation purposes it works i'd say
ninety percent of the time to my liking
but a lot of people are hopping off the
google maps bandwagon and a recent
patent buyout points the signs that say
google maps could be under fire so get
this i didn't know this this is crazy
you know a lot of other websites they
sort of outsourced google maps and they
embedded in their site and yeah use that
you know foursquare wikipedia both of
them officially off the google maps
train mmm isn't that crazy so this
recent
an acquisition by i believe it was
microsoft acquired all these patents
from AOL right a billion dollars worth
could this be that they're sort of uh
planning to make a move against Google
Maps I don't know it's possible I have
started noticing a lot of competing math
sites popping up like for example
remember last year Facebook got all like
being mapped out yeah and so now
whenever you want to check into a place
you by using places it'll use bing maps
right which is kind of weird to me I
always thought that Google and Facebook
had that relationship it's interesting
because Google Maps has always sort of
felt like the free open source you know
entity right uh because Google doesn't
really sell stuff the way Microsoft does
yet at least but yeah it's actually
they're actually finding their way out
of a lot of websites um I don't know
there's a there's a openstreetmap
initiative have you heard about this
yeah and that sort of seems to be taking
the place of a lot of spots where Google
Maps once were I don't know but I think
the exclusive content that Google Maps
sort of prided itself on the traffic
stuff the places stuff they're not
really you know holding all the all the
sort of features to themselves these
days yeah I mean openstreetmap is cool
and it sort of fits with the whole
wikipedian model because I guess anybody
can contribute changes to roads right
you know so if all of a sudden they shut
down or like put a wall up somewhere you
can submit and then others will vote on
that and then it'll go into the map I'm
not gonna launch abhi cuz how many times
have you looked up directions on google
maps and it just led you a number of
time yeah um we're and you would think
that they are constantly updating their
maps right feel like that's a
misconception because you find me
personally things are not always right
even things that have been that way for
years right like new construction
bridges you know bram stuff like that
they're just not where they need to be
I'm curious what other people say
because I know in our area things are
always changing they're always doing
construction they're always building I
want to know about people in Middle
America
be where things don't change as much
perhaps but yeah that's that's what's
going on so the new war on the internet
the map war mmm really exciting stuff
super excited we're excited I mean
there's a big story today that uh I

writing on the wall leans towards the

right calls from the public baseball has
started thus the ridiculous sports
questions of the turn hey what up Boston
from Snipes baseball's opening weekend
was this week I was wondering if Justin
Kane answer us a question um what is the
difference between a 6 4 3 double play
and a 463 double play I know alright
Tiger even yeah I know what the
difference is you know spin 6kg
someone here we go can you just repeat
the question what's the difference is
doing a 6 4 3 double play and a 463
double play notice that the three stays
the same so that might give you a little
hint I don't know if you'll get there's
once it's like just this one thing
that's done in baseball scoring I'll
give you a hint about so a double play
all right don't look too much into that
the double plays the same right someone
stepping on second yeah someone's done
around at first yeah it's the numbers
obviously what is that new idea you
can't even come up with like a funny
response to that nothing gonna sit there
and make me I have no idea Richard
Richard do you ever know you don't know
yeah I know it's absolute like okay like
how many runs get no or Nothing do that
you don't know no all right well I just
I'm gonna just be like the lame ass dude
who explains it yes play in baseball
scoring every position in the field gets
a number so a third baseman is three
right I don't know I guess shortstop is
six and second basis for what those
numbers base so it's saying six meaning
let's just say six is the shortstop six
gets the ball so he makes the play 006
throws at the four it was a double the
second baseman then throws at the three
gotta jet the first base yes suppose a
second as opposed to a 463 means the
second baseman get the ball through to
the short cybersex who take on second
and then throw to first god that's a 64
350 that makes perfect sense yeah okay
that's no idea that the nut there
weren't even numbers of Susan yeah
that's how scoring works in baseball
like you've ever been a baseball game
you see some dude who's like writing
down the whole what's right right he's
writing down numbers and stuff and that
tells him all fly ball to right everyone
all nine people on the field have a
number so here we go yes sir the chat
rooms clarifying a little bit so
shortstop is six there you go for is
second base and three is first right
there it is hey hey now learn a little
bit more every day you know these are
little fun facts I would real I'm I
would be curious to find out how much a
percentage of our listenership knew that
yeah that was kind of a tunnel i think
it's lower than we might a lot lower
yeah because in here was only thirty
three percent yeah
so Z of that never translates or actual
listening audience um let's see what the
Oh in the vein of talking about spamming
and text messaging and whatnot here's
this hey Jeff in tuscaloosa Chicago from
Eric a little glowing cash and texting
my friend about alone about 20 minutes
later I get a random spam text for a
cash advance loans no there's a
coincidence or one out there they're
trying to take on it and Jeff are you
but what the hell is up with your new
phrase uh know what I mean driving crazy
with a key Kaminski in there man he's
great do I say that a lot no to me I've
never knew my earnest you know what I'm
a treaty world do i say i guess i've
noticed good I don't know you know what
I mean ya know I don't know what I'm
asking me that I like how he did bring
up the spam thing that went really well
with what we just talked to for sure so
he's implying that his texts were
filtered and and monitored for keywords
and then he got a sort of relevance
missing schmick shin she mentioned
smishing mission oh that flows right off
the tongue someone's sniffing his text
messages I guess so like that is scary
yeah we should just write back and forth
each other one theme over and over like
pizza made you pick up pizza hey I'll
get that got bonita yeah did you get
that coupon I really love saving money
on pizza don't you just yes she's just
talking about cash advances a lot i well
you said he said yes this buddy about
alone yeah yeah that's be easy isn't
that crazy what would you get text
message spam about then just sail on
hockey say she's gonna sell this week
she's gonna see better hard drugs yeah
yeah black tar heroin as weekend yes I
don't know I would die done there's no
all my texts are just important sort of
bits of information that i pick you up
in 10 you know nothing vital like that
um yeah so there's that last week i got
a little mad when it came to talking
about Instagram android on the iphone
and how some iphone users were upset
yeah that people got Angela you
is to grant we went from a gated
community to section 8 housing and it
right yeah well that guy got his ass
kicked this weekend let's listen to
someone else who who seems equally upset
birmingham you're talking about
Instagram be on android and iphone users
think android users don't have the money
to create better photos hmm the iphone
3gs is more inexpensive and those
androids so he was seeing the point that
I was trying to bring up with you you
sort of made me think otherwise you paid
how much for your iphone i paid 299 for
mine you paid 300 bucks for your I don't
think I think you got taken waiters are
only supposed to pay 200 for your iphone
you talking about right how much I have
2 32gb pins on how many gig how much you
pay i think i paid 199 for 60 16 so
that's what it is but he's talking about
if you were to buy a 3gs you would only
pay 99 for sure there's a lot of android
phones that are expensive and more more
expensive yeah so what the hell are we
talking about it's all fine just take as
many crappy photos 01 I never look
crappier and then put them on Instagram
what's funny is that i truly hate
Instagram regardless of the plat I'm
universal hey I was just mad at the
iphone a UH Instagram snob joking on
Instagram what's the problem here why
it's because I don't know what it is ya
know I know you know what it's sort of
its cool yeah not is it I guess if you
there's no reason you should be on
Twitter and not beyond its but because
pictures everyone will agree is better
than reading but then for sick and i
don't know it instagram it i'ma show you
what instagram is after this no I'm
gonna be hooked I know I know it is and
I know it has addictive traits ya to it
but still you're not going to get me to
sign up for that camera my nexus isn't
that great anyway next go pay 40 for
this is andrew from South Florida
regarding what you guys are talking
about how people talk real loud no cell
phones right the reason that is is
because you can't cure your
voice in the speaker of the phone much
like older phones that you would used to
have your house I'm about 31 I guess
Jeff you're probably 30 so well part of
that generation but i'm i'm thinking
that um it's going to be a generational
thing no one got kids growing up with
cell phones of never heard their own
voice okay i'm gonna take a step back
yeah i don't know if that's true that's
not true universal he's saying that
wired of phones back in the day you
could hear your own boyhood you could it
was like a like a monitor you could you
could we talk about two phones that have
separate receivers no uchi is the really
old yes the ones from the ones from
boardwalk empire no no there you'd have
to hold one up and then like put the a.m
be like I'm dialing hello sick yeah yeah
no not like that you big idiot you
talking about like these ones yes talk
about those or exactly I love you have a
property like this I don't know that is
kind of perfect but yes he's talking
about those phones yes when you used to
use e a rotary one or a pulse one that
had a feedback you could hear yourself
in the ear piece of tourists even like
the phones we have here at our office
desk so exactly they just r out a little
bit by it's just the way it's always
been right cell phone some of them do
have that some of the older ones do but
i think i'm pretty did that but that was
the last phone that did that right i
know for a fact my palm pre most
certainly definitely did that but
everything else my evo and now the nexus
do not yeah there you go let us know
what you think internet 866 four for
Cena is number to call or we can reach
us via email at the 404 @ sina com did
anyone email us about technology they'd
like to see implemented in their
everyday life because i thought of one
that was good oh no about a few emails
but not about that well what did I'm
really frustrated with cutting nails
nail cutter yeah what are you looking
it's just very specific need a
technology yes I hate having to do that
it's like this huge process and you have
to file your nails on afterwards they
don't get stuck on the clothes yeah I
just really long just want you to do
every single week
every two weeks you just wanna stick in
like the equivalent of like a pencil
sharpener yeah exactly i want one that
I'd see my whole hand in it because it's
on my neck dude everyone's pencil is the
same not everyone's fingers the same
yeah I'm just saying it feels like
archaic technology every time you have
to bust out well I guess I do agree i
hate cutting nails the worst anyway
