to the Apple buy for reaction to WWDC
2016 which could potentially mean bad
apples unless they did everything
perfect and some of the things they
didn't tell you now there's a whole lot
to cover here and we can't get to
everything but let's start off with what
surprised me the most at the show watch
OS or what we like to call it here watch
O's trace now Apple has finally given me
a reason to give my Apple watch another
try with a completely overhauled
interface and superfast app load times I
didn't end up selling mine just so I
could see if it actually did anything
legit with the software and it was their
strongest announcement that
significantly improved the product that
really needed it the most and I know
what you're thinking it was the Minnie
Mouse watch face that got me wasn't it
where you can change dress colors to
match wristbands in yeah no comment
now Apple's biggest miss here they still
refuse to open up custom watch faces for
developers there's still control freaks
when it comes to the Apple watching you
know what that's a bad apple but big ups
for creating the stock app breathe that
reminds us all to breathe all right TV
OS got a few nice tweaks but my favorite
was the single sign-in so you no longer
have to sign into services like YouTube
or Netflix or HBO GO every time you set
up a new device it's all linked to your
Apple login dark mode is a nice addition
but it didn't appear as an option in any
other OS and the sling TV app brings the
first TV streaming subscription service
to the Apple TV before Apple was even
able to do it so maybe Apple is no
longer in a rush to do it anymore and we
finally have an official name for the
new OS 10 it has been changed to Mac OS
and we finally know the last name to our
friend
my name is Makos Sierra just like the
rumor said Siri integration is here the
crowd was surprised and excited about a
universal clipboard to copy and paste
across your devices touch ID integration
is a clear sign that will see the
feature in future hardware like the
next-gen MacBook Pros resources found in
the Mac OS Sierra developer beta even
reference and led with multiple
functions that point directly to that
rumored OLED bar with new functionality
now safari 10 will also be part of
Sierra but Apple plans to disable
plugins like Adobe Flash Java
Silverlight and quicktime by default in
order to focus on html5 content for a
better web experience but there's more
love for the Apple watch in this keynote
Auto unlock with matt go west just think
starting at $300 you too can unlock your
Mac without entering a password and
taxing your fragile fingers just another
reason to buy an Apple watch totally
worth it and finally iOS 10 the biggest
change is going to be the lockscreen and
notifications which lets us interact
with our phones without even unlocking
them and it's going to be super
convenient I'm digging this 3d touch was
the demo requirement to interact with it
but my hunch is that a long press on
devices that don't have it will do the
same thing plus big thanks for finally
allowing us to remove Apple's stock apps
you're not actually deleting them but
removing the hooks and user data so
they're technically still there but you
won't see them and that's a good Apple C
good job now opening up Siri to
third-party apps got some of the biggest
Cheers until the next day developers
realize sirikit is specifically limited
for these type of apps and only these
apps sad Apple and let's talk about Siri
we were hoping to see a truly smarter
more complex and sophisticated Siri but
all it appeared to do was add support
for more tasks instead of coming
anywhere close to Google's context-aware
and multi-layered queries Siri is better
because it can do more things but it
didn't look that much smarter and really
that's a bad apple
but what about iMessage first of all I
don't hate it
iMessage apps will get a lot of love and
you know I'm going to emoji I everything
plus who doesn't want to use the
eggplant emoji that's now three times
the size but it just seemed like Apple
is trying so hard to say hey we're cool
we know Millennials check out our
facebook Messenger means Google alo
meets snapchat messaging app they
dedicated 15 minutes of the keynote just
on iMessage I timed it it was the
feature that got the biggest focus of
the entire keynote are you kidding me
now there's this product called the iPad
pro that you Apple you touted as the
future of computing it's one of my
favorite pieces of hardware that's
completely neutered by iOS that only
reaches half of its potential with the
lack of a true hybrid OS you gave
iMessage 15 minutes and the iPad a three
second mention for split screen mode in
Safari at WWDC that's horrible and you
know what that is that's a bad apple
what do bad apples on the new Apple bite
oh yeah
alright that's going to do it for this
week's show we'll do our speck giveaway
winners next week
but you can still use the code Apple
byte for 15% off on their website email
us at the Apple buy to see Netcom or
tweet me at Bryant on with what you
thought about WWDC thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
