faces and looking for life on Mars I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update it's not often we get a
shake up an email but say hello to
Microsoft's new free email account
outlook.com it'll eventually be
replacing hotmail and you can go to
outlook.com to grab your name now aside
from a new clean look it adopted some
windows 8 touches like people hub it
also has a strong tie in with social
media you don't have to leave the email
to send a facebook message or tweet to
friends and you'll find social media
info pulled into your contacts it's not
too far off from what you might be used
to already in gmail but you can check
out a preview of the features at cnet
com it's an exciting time for science
the Mars Science Laboratory Rover called
curiosity will land on the Red Planet
overnight on Sunday to search for the
building blocks of life and if anything
could live on Mars now this is the most
expensive and complex Lander that's ever
been sent to Mars its nuclear powered
and can scale a 3 mile tall mountain
some say this program could be the most
important event in the history of
planetary exploration in other news
we're watching the Apple TV streaming
box just added an app for Hulu Plus and
there's a new tag for twitter using the
dollar sign before a stock symbol will
create a cache tag and when clicked it
takes you to financial search results
for that company if you've been using
stocktwits then yeah you know all about
the cache tag stock to it says Twitter
stole the feature from them right after
claiming it wasn't interested a few
months ago part of the fun of playing
sports video games today is seen your
favorite players on the screen and they
can look so realistic but ever wondered
what it takes to make that happen I got
a peek at ea's head scanning technology
at Grand Central Station where the
Tottenham Hotspur soccer team gathered
to have their mugs added to the next
fifa soccer 13 game players are
surrounded by 18 cameras that snap every
angle of their face for about two
minutes it creates a base model then the
images are sent back to the game
development team and it takes about 12
hours or so to process each character
players were told to make a neutral face
because if they actually log photos of
everyone's emotions it would just take
too long so the computer will program
some basic expressions for them he's
been traveling the globe to chase down
teams of every sport and FIFA was the
first to incorporate this scanning
technology it's about two minutes
literally you go in and get your picture
done and the top of your head and that's
it so it's easy as that that's your tech
news update for today for more on the
stories mentioned in today's show you
can head on over to cnet com / update
