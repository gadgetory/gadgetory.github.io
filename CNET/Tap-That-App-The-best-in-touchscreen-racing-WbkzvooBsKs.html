jason parker and this is the show where
we talk about the hottest apps in the
mobile space real racing has been one of
the most popular racing games on iOS for
good reason real-world cars tight
controls and amazing graphics make it a
no-brainer for iOS gaming fans now we
finally have the latest installment in
real racing 3 while it is definitely the
best of the series some people may be
turned off by the game somewhat
intrusive freemium model let's first
look at the game itself there is no
doubt real racing 3 delivers the most
realistic racing experience on iOS
devices everything from the car models
and textures to the lifelike physics as
you've speed around real-world tracks
fully immerses you into the racing
experience you have a number of
different control options with
selections for tilting your device to
steer or using an on-screen steering
wheel there are also driver assists that
help you with steering traction and
breaking into turns if you're worried
about the difficulty of the game early
on but as you get used to speeding
around the track you can turn off the
assist and rely on your own reaction
times in real racing 3 you need to win
races to make money and earn Fame points
which allow you to upgrade your current
car or buy new cars to qualify for a
different racing series with your first
cart you'll be qualified for the pure
stock challenge and the road car
international each of which have a
series of races you can compete in that
include cups elimination rounds
head-to-head challenges and even drag
races once you run enough money you'll
definitely want to upgrade your car
because in the later races of deep
series your opponent's cars will get
better as well choose from engine drive
train brakes and tire up grades each of
which will give you an edge in your next
race but here's where the freemium model
comes into play every time you need to
repair your car or commit to an upgrade
there's a wait time associated with each
service you can choose to turn the game
off for a little while to wait it out or
take the quick route of using your gold
coins for immediate gratification you
only get a limited number of gold coins
to start but you'll earn more as you
move up in levels real racing 3 lets you
use real money to buy both in-game cash
to buy new cars and gold coins to speed
up upgrades
and repairs it's a little frustrating to
battle the time delays but I notice it
gets much easier when you've made enough
money to buy more than one car when one
car goes down for service to switch to
the other car even with the freemium
model real racing 3 still holds the
crown is the best racing game on iOS
anyone who like the earlier versions of
the game are just like speeding around a
racetrack should definitely tap this app
immediately that's it for today's show
but if you have any suggestions hit me
