norm under normal circumstances mostly
people drop gadgets just from like this
hi we're gonna push it a little farther
than that you know and so we were like
let's get a ladder and we did and Brian
tongs are going up the ladder first okay
so we're gonna drop just once just hand
them to me let's get that going I'm
gonna climb the ladder I know my god be
careful okay so he's gonna drop and then
I'm gonna go assess the damage let's
start with like a sort of an easy one
okay guys when we drop it do we drop it
flatter we drop it on its Horner guys
exactly that's how we did all right
count with me we're gonna go three two
one drop it here we go ready guys three
two one drop it oh my gosh is that the
scream that didn't go well Brian I can't
believe it but when you dropped it from
9 feet you broke the screen that's
horrible that's that's your basic fat
damage right there I think that the
razor is supposed to be pretty tough the
Droid Razr
right razor HD this is meant to be
rugged it's got Kevlar on the back I
have high hopes for this one so I hope
my butt okay here we go guys ready three
two one drop it well it's not like okay
it has hairline fractures
that someone's like oh no I'm trying to
turn it on oh I don't care oh and I'm
pretty sure it came on before that drop
but now it doesn't so that's also kind
of it wow that's a pretty big letdown
actually that not coming on there's like
I think there are glass shards in there
from windows heck shards so good no this
one I have seen people using phones in
way worse condition than this so I I'm
gonna call this usable assuming that it
comes on later on you guys want to do
something bigger cuz normally I think
who's bigger is better this is hey you
know you tell me what to drop this is
gonna give you I'm gonna give you on the
corner Oh God
dear Lord forgive me for I have sinned
here we go here we go in three two one
drop it getting kind of hard to get in
here oh my god you guys it's totally
okay wait wait will it turn on
Oh
there's life one more drop one more drop
one more drop alright alright we hope
this drops on the core not we've gotta
live with it alright here we go let's go
three two one drop
oh it wants to live it puts the weight
in the booty guys what can you say hard
you know that's funny too because I took
an iPad Mini to Paris recently and
dropped it on the shops at lyc√©e and it
completely broke and this guy is a-okay
let seems this is our first success
story I can tell you that I'd literally
tried to drop it on this corner and
everyone saw that here right this is no
like Apple by preferencing right you're
like how about oh you guys really want
to see the surface you kind of want a
little tablet run I think I'm gonna do
no first I gotta say some of the good
stuff for me yeah yeah for sure
I mean not that the Nook is not good
which it is the Nook is good and I think
the Nook is somewhat sturdy all right
here we go ready let's do it
three two one drop it oh oh there's
damage I can already tell oh oh yeah we
have the we have some coming apart at
the bottom here but it comes on totally
still usable welcome back covered under
your 30-day warranty I know your nook is
your nook is ok-ish except that you're a
little SD card slot here I think it's
not in good shape so that's not gonna be
as usable anymore okay no no longer
expandable all right oh God
turns out this ladder is pretty high
let's try that iPad Mini with a case
since we've already you're gonna have to
retire than that shorty okay so this is
the G form case that they lent us to try
the drop they they asked us to drop it
flat
that's kind of anticlimactic it looks
okay I mean if you t go get it the one
you're the fetcher if the one without
the case survive flat and we drop it
flat that's probably gonna survive I
don't know if I'm in I was okay I'm
gonna fetch it like a dog well I did
okay it's totally fine you guys that
case you can tell it's completely feel
good still good guy good your iPad's
okay okay what do you want next okay all
righty
okay I'll go up one more step for this
Oh God alright you know time it's okay
they do but not me
all right next to seven ready you're
gonna turn the corner corner three two
why you guys but you only do that for BT
let's do you say okay all right there
you go make the really thing two one now
that's exciting it came apart wow this
is amazing the Nexus by the way awesome
we have this super we have this
wonderful system another GoPro that is
streaming so that's how you're getting
that cool split screen there all right
here we go guys we're gonna do see if it
comes on or test here
he's like where's that I think maybe
that thing has to touch that other thing
for that thing to go on yeah oh yeah I
got to get the buttons on that part okay
okay here we go this is like I feel like
I'm at Foxconn right now okay I'm just
up here on the ladder do soon okay I'm
trying to vocally the source here we go
holding the power button holding the
power button no huh all right all right
let's keep going
okay I bet that's gonna be fine I'm not
worried about that here you go huh all
right time for that's not my personal
one right okay so let me out no just
want to make sure it does still work you
can see my little kid on there but this
is the one that we've already tested so
okay right make them do the thing you
know it kind of fell sideways but you
got you have the damage here where would
actually made impact right here can you
see that oh yeah but otherwise it's
right on that corner right there
everyone was like wow I'm mesmerized
okay yeah okay let's do this one rugged
phone let's see how well we got to do
the surface you're right yep let's just
it's time I don't know that thing's
heavy
okay Steve I want you guys to know that
during his acknowledgement Steven
Sinofsky dropped this thing a whole
bunch of times he's skateboarding on it
it was pretty tough when Jeff kanata how
to go on it inertia I'm gonna die on
this ladder
okay make him go three two one drop it
that was dramatic that did fall in the
corner okay here we go some cows from
here so you can see some of the Battle
Damage here where the camera is the
alignment of the kid a little camera
piece here the metals been warped right
oh that's too bad
look it's sending a message I'm okay I'm
okay to go here's the corner we're a hit
but there you go five turns out drop a
bunch of stuff all right here we go this
is the Samsung rugby pro ruggedized
phone so if it is not fine I'll be very
surprised in three two one
drop it
Molly works out clearly okay
here we go the USB port guy did open on
the drop that's kind of new that's a new
feature and over here here's the Battle
Damage here you got the little rugged I
did alright so there you guys have it
let's see if we can empower this bad boy
on here that's not so bad though I'm
here you go
right it's a lie there you go
survived boom okay I love it
I'm here with Chuck I'm ready to get
suited up for a liquid nitrogen to have
my apron on for splashing and look at
that like look at the freezing steam
coming out of this thing do you think
okay so here we have a GoPro camera
yeah we had a GoPro camera we have an
iPhone five in a ballistic case which
they say is like military spec but there
are holes and then we have the naked
iPad do you think anything on this table
it's gonna make it we also even have I
think we can't do the Samsung right I
don't know anyway we're good night rate
is 321 degrees below zero so can you
give us like a little demonstration I'll
put my gloves and my goggles and stuff
on show us what happens to things when
they go in liquid nitrogen
whoa there's snow flying all right so
you can see the rows kind of pull
it's basically bubbling in there like
it's being fried it looks like it's in a
fryer
right up probably our devices aren't
gonna go in that long huh
oh poor little thing look at that look
it looks like eggshells
I probably shouldn't like mean over that
close to that okay which one we gonna
first up let's go I think we should go
with the GoPro which look is recording
okay as we go yeah so as it goes to its
humor little fryer basket it's still
recording the leg is still flashing
I mean go bro
seriously though recording right now but
the fryer basket stuck to the side now
do you want to drop testing not this one
look at that look though near as I can
tell even though there is a cold smoke
coming off of it this is a highly
unexpected outcome I have seen how long
is it gonna I can feel the cold by the
way through these gloves which are like
an inch thick how long do you think it's
gonna take to warm up yeah that's a good
question
each item is different you know yes
that's true all right well we're gonna
set I hear like cracking as it's warming
up there I think the plastic is starting
to crack as it warms up all right well
this is dramatic though because the
camera inside still okay I'm calling
this a conditional survival and I am
pretty surprised all right let's keep
moving we have so we have there are two
ballistic cases turns out these are both
ballistic we're gonna try them both the
iPhone 5 is in here and this one has
some little holes in the front let's see
how it does
oh wow
it's gonna like turn it on oh you're
brutal you're really getting into this
they're like I don't have this kind of
time let's check this bad boy that one
clearly we're gonna have to wait
remove from the case or two I don't even
know
are indeed it's just frozen solid
power button ooh I hear crack it's
it's not it's not coming on I think the
button maybe so I think the buttons
frozen yeah okay but you know we'll let
it warm up over a period of days I guess
look at the frost on that one okay and
then let's try the s3 in the kit the
case though by the way structural
integrity wise at least the case is
looking good the Samsung Galaxy s3 is
inside this ballistic case which seems
I'm a little but the cameras are exposed
oh there's no film oh yeah so that's
kind of a bummer for that device but
nevertheless and it goes oh look at the
bubbles it looks really pretty like
Halloween I think our studio audience is
horrified right now they're in stunned
silence GoPro by the way still recording
okay can you hear that a cracking going
on in there
do you hear those sounds at all all that
cracking all right now though okay once
again the phone seems okay though all
right once again we'll let that warm up
you guys will probably still be here
when we see if it's okay but we have one
last device to do the only one that's
going in unprotected brine Tong can you
come here for a minute because I think
we're gonna this is a two-parter I'm
sorry you guys there's one device that
we're taking out of the giveaway pool
and that is our so far indestructible
iPad because everything we've done to it
it's been okay now it has water in it
and it has no case and I've going in
last I I think it's gonna survive and it
goes and then it actually sounds like
it's frying I know it sounds exactly
like a fryer and it looks like it did
the bubble so that's just why the screen
the screen the screens on you guys see
that yeah that's great it's on I know
Jeff went away
wow it's a last breath yeah you guys
thing is unbelievable look the water on
the inside is starting to freeze you can
see the ice where that was the water
from the inside all right well now that
it's well and truly frozen it wouldn't
be a liquid nitrogen test if we didn't
go a little bit Terminator on it okay
maybe I should bring it over and you
should climb up I don't think you can
climb while you're holding it we're
gonna go ahead and drop this one baby
back up just a bit take one step back
cover your beautiful faces
all right like it's frozen on the inside
all right play the logo just went back
on look he's totally like now and on top
step the logo is still on you guys that
thing is amazing you can give that to
any kid you want okay you guys ready
we're gonna count this out little not
Chuck because I'm gonna do three two one
drop it
come cover your eyeballs I mean I'm just
gonna I'm gonna be like this I got to
protect this face you know what I mean
okay here we go guys ready three two one
drop it
is that screen it's not okay I I
actually think it was so strong it
dented the cement it dented this okay
here we go guys let's pick okay as far
as I'm concerned that is a pass this
thing is still kicking that's
unbelievable all right incredibly every
device we put in liquid nitrogen came
out okay the GoPro hero2 not only
survived it recorded the whole
experience recording the light until
plastic and the iPhone 5 and galaxy s3
were fine inside their ballistic cases
it looks really pretty
once we let them thaw out a little both
turned on you hear those sounds and all
that cracking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
