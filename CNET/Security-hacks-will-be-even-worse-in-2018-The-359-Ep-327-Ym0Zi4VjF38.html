it's episode 327 of the 359 podcast on
BVG and your host today are Alfred Inge
and Roger Chang good morning guys
morning morning so we're gonna be
talking about if we're getting to the
end of the years so we wanted to sort of
take a look back at some of the big
trends of 2017 Oh first off we'll be
talking on security and how it just sir
sucked
yeah 2017 was not a good year yeah
looking ahead at 2018
surprise surprise things are gonna get
any mores will off-road some tips and
suggestions on what to do both this year
and next year and then we're gonna be
talking about Google Facebook and
Twitter and how this is kind of year
we're like everyone sort of turned on
them it felt like I know you're already
kind of not in the pro goal Facebook
Twitter camp but like this year everyone
just decided these guys 2017 was a major
he'll turn o as always if you have any
questions live in the comments section
Brian will pick out the best we will try
to answer them in three minutes in 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm
Roger Jane I'm Alfred ring we're getting
to the end of the year which gives us a
chance to reflect on 2017 and Wow where
things bad from a security front we saw
a big security breach or hack in every
month through November and our own Laura
Hatala predicts things would get even
worse in 2018 Albert do you wrote the
big kind of piece looking back at 2017
where were some of the big low lights
for you well this one just sticks out in
particular to me just because it's so
fresh but Apple with its root issue yeah
where you could type in root as a
username and not require a password
they've since patched it but there's
also been a lot of reports about how the
patch doesn't entirely work but that to
me is a major low point for security
only because of such a high-profile
issue right that had like it was so
exploitable though so stupid you
physically had to be free yeah yeah I'm
surprised you didn't mention Equifax for
me yeah that would that would be the
other one losing your social
information is yeah and just the issue
with that though in terms of security
was that you know this was taken bought
based off the Apache struts exploit
which had been warned the Equifax had
been warned about in March and they were
supposed to patch it I think that's the
crux of a lot of security issues that
you see from the past year human error
essentially yeah nobody is patching
these things or people are making these
like very small mistakes you look at
wanna cry another security low point
that had happened that had also been
patched by Microsoft but it also
targeted really old computer systems
that you found in hospitals universities
and ATM machines that just never updated
so yeah you can you can attribute a lot
of that to just lack of patching sadly
it's not really the computer that are
failing us it's it's us that's family
families to update the computer yeah and
so I mean what are some of the tips and
advice that you'd offer to our viewers
or listeners
on how to protectors well taking a look
at you know all the points that I just
made I think the biggest issue that you
want to take here is to patch your
system as soon as they're available I
know a lot of people often look at
updates and don't know what they're for
or anything like that to be fair it's
not explicitly stated in these updates
but most of the times they're to fix
security issues and you should you know
handle that right as soon as you can you
know kind of avoid suspicious looking
emails a tip that I had heard
essentially it's don't click on
Lincoln's links and emails and just kind
of go to the website yourself right
other people for for security breaches
like if they lose your birthday or if
they lose like your address or anything
like that they've suggested you know
putting a fake birthdate unlike Facebook
or anything ready to to kind of prevent
that it's really to test my real friends
yeah that well beyond some of the other
Laura had a couple good tips for I use
two-factor authentication this is really
dumb but backup your information backup
your photos then don't just rely on
passwords and just generally use common
sense right yep essentially all right so
continue with our retrospective theme we
wanted to talk about rich Nieves look
back at Google Facebook and Twitter this
year it's really 2017 was a year that I
think a lot of people kind of turned on
these companies you know there's sort of
hold up as the bastion of our our future
our potential right Silicon Valley it
says this great thing and really over
the last couple of months I mean it's
been taking a pounding right yeah I mean
for a while it had exclusively been
Twitter like Twitter had been kind of
the the pinata of yeah and a lot of
people were harping on Twitter and then
it had come out that you know the this
kind of abuse was also happening on
Google and Facebook particularly with
Google on YouTube and this isn't even
you know international espionage stuff
it's more like there was the child abuse
platform right that was going on on
YouTube and all these issues and the
idea is like these platforms have gotten
so large that they can't police
themselves to this degree anymore right
and I mean look we didn't bring up
Russia which I mean they'd spent hours
testifying before Congress is trying to
explain themselves and really not really
doing a great job of it yeah I mean a
lot of it like I said it because like
they've grown like way too big to you
know manage everything on their platform
yeah all right for those stories and
more check us out seen it I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Alfred hang thanks for
listening so I always follow that rule
about checking are not clicking the link
in that you know that's I don't know
that always seemed like common sense to
me thanks everybody that's a conclusion
of the recording of the podcast I'm
gonna go ahead and start digging back
through the chat and find good questions
and commentary in the meantime what are
let's give everybody three great tips
for not getting hacked in 2018 yeah
we're like the three like really usually
when I think of tips I think do this I
don't you think that like anybody can do
I mean if you want like advanced if you
know no no no VPN bori chips that
everyone any you should yeah it's like
these are tips that I think are like as
easy as like flipping a switch on or
something like that so like using
two-factor authentication if it allows
for it
imager had gotten hacked recently and I
got particularly annoyed because they
don't allow for two-factor
authentication so I just changed my
password on it but it's still
frustrating that's like the guys that do
that it's good thing is a lot of
services
bigger services do yeah yeah
essentially use a password manager if
you can LastPass offers like a free
service for that kind of stuff you don't
have to be bogged down remembering your
passwords and it creates a difficult and
unique password for a lot of websites to
develop and yeah avoiding phishing
emails I would say that's where maybe
like 95% of attacks are coming from so
you essentially just want to keep a
careful eye on those things there are a
lot out there that are so difficult that
sometimes even you know experts they
can't like tell the difference between
what's legitimate snot that there's it's
yeah the the clicking like just going
straight to the website itself as
opposed to clicking on the link is a
pretty useful tip for that so that you
know even if it looks exactly like
something you think you would receive
you're still not like falling for it
like through your email oh yeah what
about being a Nokia 3310 because there
is a sentient nope Nokia 3310 in the
chat that says I can't be hacked
I'm sure I can I mean you can but it's
not really worth yeah unless you're
talking about like physically do
somebody psyche score
I think it's indestructible though so if
somebody tried like a hacking at it with
like an axe or something I think the axe
would think it's destructible but yeah
it definitely would it'll it'll last
longer and drop testing I mean nothing's
indestructible on a literal and
figurative speech
there's consideration but what about big
servers Pele says won't quantum
computers take care of security soon
making big servers they're nearly
unhackable and I don't know if he's
being sarcastic or not I also don't know
nothing I don't know computing that's
really a specialty for colleague Stephen
Shanklin who would probably be able to
answer that I would say no matter how
fast or how powerful these computers are
I don't think anything is yeah that's
the other thing too I also a lot of you
know hackers they're not targeting this
like the hardware itself they're kind of
targeting dumb people yeah you know like
if you if you have a quantum computer
and you're using Gmail on it
and you click on a link with malware on
it it's not exactly they get the malware
on your computer it's more than you type
your password in and then there it's not
like there you need to be on your
computer to get to your email address
right there I mean they're basically
going after the weakest link I think
that's what happened with the HBO hack
right like it was like HBO's internal
systems were like like low-level
staffers exactly yep
a lot of chatter going on about password
managers in the chat right now Michael
Brown does say that's kind of a bare
minimum that's a no-brainer absolutely
thank you for that Michael
let's recommend a couple I use LastPass
yeah yes I only I recommend LastPass
just cuz it's free yeah right yeah I
don't I don't feel like paying for it
Roger any others I use LastPass as well
yeah I think a lot of us here in in the
CNET office do so that's not a full
endorsement by any means necessarily
we're just fans and yeah it's gonna
collect my check but you just said
nothing is indestructible
Mathew catch I just liked this comment
and - always a highlight in the chat we
might as well just start walking around
naked considering how much information
the hackers already have about us I
already do you know by the way don't
tune in tomorrow all right
Mohammed can someone eventually hack
blockchain that's a little over my pay
grade yeah same here already put you on
the spot is a good question though I'm
you might not have that's a very like
vague question that's like that you know
it's like kind of like I was gonna can
somebody hack math it's hard to like
Berkeley I don't know what you mean
I mean I guess like if you're talking
about like Bitcoin then yes because
that's already happened right and
there's been there's like a lot of
malware out there now that's like
targeted toward like Bitcoin wallets and
you know basically setting up so that
your computer is mining Bitcoin for them
and things like that so if you're
talking about like using blockchain and
like malware then yeah that's that's
happened yes Michael Brown also says
don't click on ads a lot of heads can be
harmful oh yeah definitely also just
don't click on ads in general yes there
are cnet.com where we
just quick just gone on website right
now and just click on like several ads
in ten but yeah I I don't
I've never clicked on an ad on like a
website I mean like I've clicked on
referral link ads like Google yeah like
from like see not exactly
yeah but banner ads I'm not a big fan
unless I'm like the only time I click on
a banner ad is like I did it by accident
like we're gonna link I somehow hit the
stupid banner ad I've seen ads and I've
like oh cool hot singles in my area let
me like google it I don't like click on
it I mean I got these really cool tool
bars installed me find things and get
the weather so I don't know what you're
all complaining about yeah there's a
little purple gorilla just pops up on my
desktop yo let's talk about that
I missed that dude that was fun back in
the day I know it was a danger zone but
when I was like 14 years old I did not
know that but that thing was fine I
remember seeing it on my like aunts
computer or something whoa that's hella
cool how do I get that on my computer so
I google it I put on my computer like oh
listen album that was arguably the
smartest malware ever because it totally
it was like clearly words it was like
putting bleach in a candy dispenser
getting kids to just chug it like that
was the best oh that's so stupid
Christopher Osborn this is a great
question do you think there should be
some sort of legislation that requires
companies to have a certain level of
security in place depending on the type
of information they collect from
customers
yeah there's there's actually
legislation being proposed for that
right now there is a secure iot bill
from Senator Mark Warner of Virginia
it's also co-sponsored by Senator Ron
Wyden of Oregon and Senator Maggie
Hassan from New Hampshire essentially
it's requiring a baseline level of
security for devices that IOT devices
that the federal government buys and you
might think oh well what how does that
affect like me if I go buy like a smart
camera from from Best Buy or something
like that the idea is I like the federal
government actually uses like a ton of
IOT devices when they're like collecting
data from like street lights the ocean
and like research and things like that
the the premise is basically like
because the federal government purchases
so many IOT devices that its event it's
like eventually gonna influence like the
market to like just create you know
secure IOT devices in general so
everybody like would have to buy secure
stuff so there's that bill there there
was another bill that was proposed I
think sometime last week essentially
requiring jail time for company like
CEOs if they like don't disclose really
yeah yeah this was this bill would like
suggest jail time for them Wow Wow my
favorite I can imagine yeah yeah while
we're on the topic of IOT devices you've
done a lot of research and had a lot of
experience with smart home devices and
hacking potentials and we've seen a lot
of that get to bunked and what what
would be some good advice for people
looking to protect themselves before
legislation is there to protect you you
should stick to like big name brand ones
I know that it's very enticing to buy
you know to get what you pay for
situation yeah I know it's very enticing
to get like a cheap like off-brand IOT I
don't know like what light bulb or
anything like that because it's like
half the price but the idea is like the
security really isn't there for that you
I personally always wanna when I'm
looking at IOT stuff like buy from a
company that I know has a lot riding on
its name that's like most of the IOT
devices at home are like from Google or
Amazon because like I said they have a
lot riding on this and you know there
was a lot more liable you know at risk
for them to lose if they if they if they
eventually do get hacked I think there's
a pretty good reason why the like for
the echo being as popular as it is and
being out as long as it is that we
haven't heard of any kind of like major
vulnerabilities like happening with the
Amazon I go it's a different story about
the the smart key thing though but that
that was like we had written a story
about it McKee yes with the camera the
smart doorbell where they were able to
get it disconnected from the Wi-Fi
briefly but once that happened it
doesn't shut off it just leave
screen for what it is so theoretically
somebody in a demo'd attack they showed
it where it's like they froze it and
then they just open the door went in and
stole something and I went back out it's
like the digital equivalent of like
putting a photo up like to the camera
right yeah yeah
needless to say the big concern with
getting hacked is not somebody
controlling your home devices in a
gremlin desk type montage rather the
loss of identity and therefore loss of a
use basically yeah I know right I know
that's like a major concern for a lot of
like security researcher so that I've
spoken with at least it's not the idea
of them like just making things terrible
for you it's more so just about like
extortion see that's the kind of hacker
I would be in a way I would just prank
missing people yeah yeah so the idea is
that like oh they're gonna turn off like
they're gonna it's kinda like ransomware
but for like the devices in your house
right so instead of you not being able
to use your computer it'd be like oh you
have like $300 worth of like groceries
in your refrigerator and we just shut it
off you should pay us $200 to get it
back online like what a bizarre thought
of ransom is like it's good we're gonna
turn off the lights and it'll be dark in
your apartment until you give us a TV
that's so annoying well she pay us 50
bucks but yeah I'm the node of like just
like hacking just for like causing
mischief I remember there was some like
malware that you could download for like
back in the day where it would like open
and closed like your friends like floppy
but not floppy does their CD drive and
it would make a fart sound yeah for like
I remember that yeah I did that I put it
on like it was a friend's computer yeah
it was not hard at all how bad she was
it was really funny now I know though
that's wrong and don't don't hack kids
we should totally do like a PSA video
with you like a hack McGruff the Crime
Dog outfit don't hack the more you know
anyways the point I was trying to get to
earlier about I'm ecommerce and
transactions is yeah what are some of
the better online money handling portals
out there I mean I use PayPal
there's venmo of course where
where are some of the most highly
secured ones and I know that's kind of a
gray yeah I mean I mostly I use venmo I
don't use PayPal's often anymore but I
tend to use banks I mean if you're
trying to chase bank to bank yeah
transfer your funds from if you're
trying to be really secure I mean I hate
to endorse it but just just use like a
crypto currency if you're really worried
about like people who want you to
discuss Bitcoin detail and I think
that's a topic for another day but yeah
we're talking about like optimal
security on something like that but yeah
I just PayPal I basically I generally
feel that any website that has HTTPS on
it is essentially like secure enough for
reviewing unless your device is already
compromised like yeah if you're talking
about you know oh like can they pick
like my credit card out of it like
either that website is like insecure or
your devices and Scarah and I bet like 9
out of 10 times like if something was
stolen from you it's your device yeah
all right so we are almost out of time
let's leave it with a great topic from
Michael Brown again can we finally have
a discussion about downloading apps and
software from proprietary app stores
chrome windows Apple instead of
downloading apps and software from the
web how much security really comes in
play when you're going to a quote
unquote trusted outlet I think with
Apple they've done a really good job of
preventing that I would say Google
play's a little bit yeah standards are a
lot lower but I still think it's much
safer than downloading straight up from
like a third-party provider I know that
a lot of stories that I write about like
scam like apps like the back-to-school
story that I had written about like oh
here's all these apps are supposed to be
for like back-to-school help but it's
actually malware the majority of them
are from like third party like stores
and the issue is that it's not so much a
US issue whereas it is an international
issue like if I'm on an Android phone
and somewhere in Asia I mean the biggest
thing is in China where the Google Play
Store isn't available
exactly yeah so that's where a lot of
all these third-party app stores and
thrive yeah and I also
that's like when you were talking about
like the banner ads with like all the
toolbars and like bonzi body and all
that's up if you had same if you had a
Chromebook that doesn't allow for that
only let you download from the Google
like Web Store like you would never have
any of that on your device yeah but
there's enough mess on the Google store
to still be at risk but it doesn't come
from a banner head Touche
like you have to seek it out directly
yourself to do that gotcha
yeah that is good advice and
unfortunately we are out of time
still more great questions maybe for
another day we'll put this in the back
of our heads definitely should read ress
smart locks should talk about Google
Wallet and yeah and Bitcoin yeah let's
let's all pin these for another day in
the meantime thanks everybody Roger
you're gonna take us out yeah if you
like to anything you saw over here check
us out on CNET podcast is available on
itunes tune in stitchers be Berner
google play music and the amazon echo
y'all tomorrow see you tomorrow folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
