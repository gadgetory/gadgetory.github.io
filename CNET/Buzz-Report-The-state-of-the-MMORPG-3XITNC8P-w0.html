report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
Nintendo Wii it's like the black truffle
of the gadget world it's like a rare
diamond that only the chosen committed
few will be allowed to grasp in their
hot little gamer hands the wiimote is
becoming the stuff of wishful legend as
children rock themselves to sleep at
night dreaming of zelda the wii was on
sale at amazon again this week for just
28 short minutes barely long enough to
get a credit card out of a wallet and
rest assured my darlings I'll be
dreaming with you i'll be dreaming
66
and now for the news their reports that
YouTube may have been censored by Fox
Broadcasting the network apparently
ordered YouTube to take down videos of
Paula Abdul acting like a drunken
rambling lunatic on some local Fox
affiliate shows but now some critics are
saying that Fox has gone too far and the
move amounts to flat-out censorship of
embarrassing material oh no para seem
overall do decedent had to take down all
the video Molly drunken acting a fool on
YouTube they'd have to shut down the
entire site yet get her out of here haha
seriously like throw away the key next
time I really don't need her getting me
fired sony BMG and Universal Music have
decided that they will not allow users
of the Microsoft Zune to share certain
songs with other zune users this even
though songs that are shared between
zunes can only be played three times
before they either expire or you have to
buy them and in universals case they're
already collecting royalty fees for
every zune being sold in order to offset
what they say are enormous losses to
piracy nevertheless both labels refuse
to allow even the slightest opening in
the Iron Curtain of digital distribution
lock down even though it actually result
in people discovering and then being
encouraged to buy new music from both of
these giant music labels which I would
think is what they actually want Wow
what jerks plus they would totally be
killing zune sales if there were any
zune sales speaking of unfortunate
Microsoft News Microsoft Vista is barely
even out the door actually it's not even
out the door yet for consumers and
Microsoft is already hard at work on
service pack 1 in fact the company has
basically acknowledged that Vista still
has some quote high impact issues to
work out whew like what like you install
it and then it crashes instantly and
gets a virus and you can't figure out
how to use it because it's like all
weird and like a Mac and stuff and then
like none of that pretty shiny stuff
works it just slows everything down and
then you get so mad that you hurl your
computer against the wall like that kind
of high impact issues there's
heartwarming news from China this week a
teacher had her purse snatched
containing money and her mobile phone so
she sent the thief
a series of 21 heartfelt text messages
begging him to return her things and
telling him that she forgave him two
days later the thief returned all her
items and left a note saying that her
tolerance had moved him and he planned
to correct his ways and become an
upright person oh that is so sweet they
totally don't have anywhere to sell
stolen mobile phones in China now this
week as you know was the president's
annual State of the Union address and
with so many changes afoot in the United
States it was one that many people were
watching with interest but you know
these days there's more than just one
world to think about and with the recent
release of the burning crusades
reinvigorating fans everywhere we've
invited special world of warcraft
correspondent veronica belmont to join
us and reinterpret the state of the
union for all you while fans take it
away Veronica Thank You Molly mr.
Bronzebeard vice president for dragon
members of shad rap fellow Questers and
raiders i stand before you tonight at a
time when Azeroth is growing ganking is
low our citizens are seeing unparalleled
epics and our nation is a force for
rating and change throughout the world
of warcraft ladies and gentlemen the
state of our burning crusade is strong I
know we face conflicts the Horde and the
Alliance continue to warn earth I Basin
and of course our challenges in outland
grow every day the insurgent forces
continue to attack and kill night elf
troops and draenei citizens and that is
why we must act now to bring peace to
the region you've heard about my plan to
send a surge of gnomes into kalimdor to
help quell the violence there right now
we are lfg to raid the crossroads and
hopefully bring about a quick end to the
insurgency I'm confident we can get this
done and bring our troops home to
stormwind as you may also know our
renewable resources are becoming
dangerously scarce rune cloth
consumption is too high and our reliance
on farmers in ishara is too strong that
is why I am calling for twenty percent
reduction in rune cloth consumption by
the year twenty seventeen we must make
Griffins that are more bread efficient
and we must also double our emergency
room cloth reserves I call on both sides
of the house the doors and the tauren to
work together to reach these goals
to save our precious resources and
finally as you know the dwarfs have
taken control of Ironforge this year I
want you to know that I am committed to
the tauren working with the dwarves to
pass better laws increase wealth and
prosperity of our citizens and to make
Azeroth a better place to live thank you
and good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
