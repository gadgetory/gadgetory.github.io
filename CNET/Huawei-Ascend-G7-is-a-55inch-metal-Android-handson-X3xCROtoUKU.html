a look at the quarry ascend g7 and this
is a 5.5 inch all-metal Android phone
from Huawei
that comes with 4G LTE and should also
have an affordable price tag now one of
the main features of this phone is its
metal body if you turn it round you can
see you've got this all metal back will
be different colored panels at the top
and bottom 5.5 inches it is quite big
but it's quite slim as well so shouldn't
be too difficult to fit into your
pockets now the 5.5 inch display has a
full HD resolution so everything looks a
nice and sharp
it's also bright and seems quite bold as
well inside it's running on a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor which
isn't particularly powerful but it does
seem to at least make the interface
quite nippy now it's running on Android
4.4 KitKat
but Huawei has put its emotion user
interface over the top so you won't
really notice a lot of similarity to
regular Android in particular it doesn't
have an app tray so all your apps and
widgets are just kept across the home
screens it's got a 3000 milliamp an hour
battery which is quite capacious but
with such a big bright screen we don't
quite know how long that's going to last
on the back you'll see there's a 13
megapixel camera which Huawei says is
very good with low light situations and
there's also a 5 megapixel camera at
start on the front that has some
software features that will sort
brighten your skin tones make you look a
little bit prettier and also there is a
panoramic selfie mode to capture more of
the scene that you're still in now this
energy 7 is due to go on sale across
Europe in November
although wider availability hasn't yet
been announced why hasn't said exactly
how much is going to cost but expected
to sit somewhere below the 260 euros
mark we'll find out more when it goes on
sale
I'm Andrew coil for CNET and this is the
huawei ascend g7
