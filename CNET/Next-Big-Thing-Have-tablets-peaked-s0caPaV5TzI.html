while and there's a reason for that
you don't need any research to know that
tablets flag behind smartphones
substantially just look at the people
around you IDC predicts will end 2014
with 1.2 billion smartphones shipped
almost 20 percent more than the year
before
compare those numbers to tablets slated
to move only about 250 million units in
the year about a fifth of the smartphone
sales and declining in 2014 for the
first time
Best Buy CEO Hubert Jolie recently said
that tablet sales at his stores were
collapsing and you hear anecdotally from
many consumers that they find that the
older tablet they bought a number of
years ago it's still good enough I
almost never hear them say that about
their smartphone so in light of all this
manufacturers are of course doing what
they can to spike a market a large
market but one that seems to have
crested here are some which you should
watch for starting with tablets
depending on the size and who's counting
these little big screen devices can
count as tablets or phones either way
they are arguably the hottest thing
going right now at least related to
tablets convertibility a lot of users
have realized in the last couple of
years that having a smartphone a
notebook and a tablet is a device to
many the phone is supremely portable and
applicable the notebook is the most
powerful so convertible tablets seem to
have found some traction being the most
positionable pretty tough road this was
a big gotcha for a lot of early tablet
buyers who realize now a tablet is not a
thinner skinnier laptop it's got less
power it has less applicability it runs
less powerful software so now we're
finding that there's a one-off out there
with Microsoft Surface pro 3 which is
the only one that's really trying to say
a tablet can be a full pc replacement
there alone in this one and having a
pretty tough road display quality this
one tends to have good traction in the
tablet market because it's a big enough
screen where you can really show off and
be wowed by and appreciate the
improvement in the display technology
brighter better color a finer dot pitch
more than HD resolution these really pop
on a tablet it's kind of hard to
appreciate them on a phone finally
there's the very pedestrian sounding
keyboard quality but goto
big conference or a huge classroom today
well you used to see a sea of notebooks
a few years ago you're likely seeing a
sea of tablets today with keyboards
attached if you really want to get into
your tablet and do some kind of work
having an excellent quality keyboard is
essential</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
