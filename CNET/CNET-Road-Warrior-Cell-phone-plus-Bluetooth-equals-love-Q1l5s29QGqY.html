cnet.com and welcome to Rogue Warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up hot
new cell phones and the Bluetooth
headsets that love them really Bonnie
Josh starts us off with the HP ipaq 510
finally a cell phone that really listens
but the great thing about this device is
it has some advanced voice command
features so you can actually dictate to
the phone no training required and it
works really well playing music hi got a
1.3 megapixel camera on the back and a
microSD slot on the left spine the only
thing Bonnie didn't like was
speakerphone quality wasn't that great
speedy and attractive not talking about
Danica Patrick here it's the LG CU 400
cell phone of course a big feature with
this phone is the singular video support
which is access to like single ur TV
content like HBO mobile yes pn mobile we
weren't too excited about the vga camera
and it's only UMTS speed which isn't the
3.5 g hsdpa speed that we like from
singular but it is still a pretty solid
phone a pretty great offering from
cingular if you want to have cingular
video the CU 400 also gives you access
to XM mobile and myspace mobile if
you're into that sort of thing like
britney spears without underwear or
springtime without baseball you
shouldn't have a cell phone without a
bluetooth headset the techni cell t-50
is like having 50 headsets in one take a
look there are the 50 face place that
you can sort of insert out of this
plastic cover right here it also comes
with 50 different bling-bling adhesive
crystals you can sort of stick on your
headset to personalize it even more as
far as sound quality is pretty good for
a headset like this so if you want to
have a personalized hits of any sort of
pattern you want for each day of the
week if you like this is the headset for
you just call ahead to make sure you and
your best friend don't wear the same
face plate how embarrassing finally
sound flavors has a Bluetooth headset
that does some cool new tricks to help
the hard of hearing
that's also a walkie-talkie mode so if
you have two of these headsets you can
sort of pair them together and use them
as walkie talkie headsets which is
pretty cool that was an optional
CompanionLink microphone which you can
use as a hearing aid of sorts you can
put the microphone your TV you can wear
this headset so they can hear the TV
better you'll pay a pretty penny to get
those extra features though almost six
hundred fifty dollars that's it for this
edition of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt
check back next time for more gadgets
that keep you armed and dangerously
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
