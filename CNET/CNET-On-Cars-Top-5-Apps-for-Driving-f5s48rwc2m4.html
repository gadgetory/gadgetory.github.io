like driving without a map used to be
nowadays your smartphone's part of the
behind the wheel experience but what are
the apps you really need I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five best apps for
the driver I'm gonna rank these bike
categories and by the way we're not
covering music apps because I bet you
got that staked out already or
telematics apps like OnStar and the
others because they're very specific to
the model of car you are let's go number
five performance apps I put these at
five because let's face it most folks
don't give a rat's ass how many genes
they're pulling but if you do these apps
are cool you typically pair one with an
obd2 dongle that plugs into your car's
data port and merges the vehicle's data
with time and GPS location and unlocks
an unseen world of motoring we use one
of these four CNET on cars chutes to
merge the cars telemetry with video out
the windshield even using one with out
and obd2 dongle your phone's built-in
accelerometer can do a lot to coach you
to drive more efficiently or more
precisely others function as GPS
speedometer and odometer combos and some
even have a mode to become a sort of
poor man's head-up display this is truly
a great category for the car geek number
four gas apps I rank these low ish
because I think most of us just buy gas
when it's handy when the light comes on
but if you're the Ben Franklin type
these are great for finding cheap fuel
and tracking the real fuel economy of
your car won't you be surprised when
it's different than what the car's
computer says these are also great for
quickly finding the nearest gas station
when your car doesn't have built-in
navigation
number three our parking apps one of the
great driving frustrations in 2014
remains what to do with your car when
you get there here we are still driving
around and around the block in a
combination of childlike faith and pagan
ritual hoping to find the spot parking
apps can reveal municipal data on where
spots are located say in garages as well
as what the cost is to use them
crowd-sourced apps
can let people share information about
spots that they are leaving so someone
else can come get it and don't forget
the other apps that let you actually pay
for your parking and renew it without
having to run back to the meter all the
time with coins or a car use one of
these and then go rediscover your
childhood some other way number two
navigation and mapping apps duh being
able to live search for what you need
tell that app to navigate you to the
result or take you to the address of
what's coming up in your calendar then
fold in live traffic conditions and best
route information that can include
crowdsourcing or even use one of these
to find a great scenic drive when you're
not in a hurry and run all of this with
great voice command all better on your
$200 phone then on your car's $2,000 nav
rig but not more safely which we'll
tackle with number one in a moment
before I get to number one I'll tell you
what it won't be to some of your howls
of objection and that is speed apps
I know these are popular calling out
speed traps and even alcohol checkpoints
but there's something unseemly about
apps that are meant to circumvent the
enforcement of laws that work best when
you don't know where smokey is so I'm
kind of leaving these out the number one
kind of app for really any kind of
driver I think is a car mode app this
functions with whatever you're using
your phone for and turns your phone into
less of a disaster waiting to happen
behind the wheel the idea is to put the
car relevant stuff on the screen behind
big buttons and then bury the 99% of
apps you shouldn't be using while
driving while rolling in easy access to
voice command and bonus points for a few
of these that combine a slick head-up
display mode to keep your eyes out the
windshield customizable buttons help you
make it yours combine it with a good
windshield mount not one of those crappy
ones you get for seven bucks at the car
wash and you've got a great infotainment
system in the car for more like this go
to CNET on cars comm where it's all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
