a new smartphone I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update this is going
to be a big week for Amazon the company
is expected to reveal its first
smartphone on Wednesday but just before
we see a new phone amazon wanted to
boast about the size of its App Store it
announced there are nearly tripled the
amount of apps in its App Store since
last year amazon is selling more than
240,000 apps and games that's roughly
the same amount of Windows Phone apps
it's also a quarter of the size of the
app stores for Apple and Google kindle
tablets can buy from the amazon appstore
and it's also available to anyone with
an android device a large app store is
crucial to convincing consumers that an
Amazon smartphone would be worth buying
the company also says Amazon's coins are
growing in popularity as a credit to buy
things in the App Store the benefit to
using Amazon coins over normal money is
that sometimes it's cheaper to buy
things with Amazon coins and in other
digital currency news bitcoin is back in
the Apple App Store iPhone owners can
once again download Bitcoin wallet apps
to make payments using the digital
cryptocurrency coin pocket was the first
to return to the US App Store which
let's just send and receive bitcoins and
transfer funds between wallets late last
year Apple removed and rejected virtual
currency apps but it reversed its dance
and it's now allowing approved virtual
currency apps at least for the time
being to keep Bitcoin users from
switching to android if you're
unfamiliar with Bitcoin it is an
occurrence you can touch there are no
actual coins everything is digital and
it's not tied to any nation bank or
central authority it's growing in
popularity as more businesses accept
Bitcoin for payment just last week
Expedia began accepting bitcoins for
booking hotel reservations and if you're
looking for some shall we say more
traditional apps well check out the new
swiftkey on android
the popular keyboard app used to cost
four dollars but now it's free instead
of charging you up front you only have
to pay for the extra keyboard designs
and add-ons it comes with 14 free
keyboards and new designs will cost a
dollar now this app will be coming to
the iphone in the fall Apple is allowing
custom keyboards for the first time in
iOS 8 that's your tech news update but
there's always more at cnet com and you
can stay updated by following me on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
