10s and the iPhone 10 are share nearly
the exact same specs same camera on the
front and same main camera on the back
except of course the tennis has two but
is that extra camera worth the two
hundred and fifty dollars or more that
you'd be spending on the higher-end
model well that's why we're here I'm
going to take the ten are and the 10s on
a little photo shoot if you're looking
at the photos on the phones the ones on
the 10s might look a little bit better
colors appear to be more vivid and
there's better contrast but that
probably has little to do with the
camera and a lot to do with the screen
OLED on the 10s versus LCD on the 10r
once off the phones though they should
look exactly the same
because for general shots they share the
same main shooter with the same
processing power and smart HDR feature
and the results are impressive same goes
for selfies they both have that seven
megapixel true depth camera that can
take regular or portrait mode selfies
and video will also look the same in
fact both these guys have one of the
best video cameras we've ever seen on
any phone now where you will start to
notice a difference is with the zoom the
10s uses that ii telephoto lens as an
optical 2x zoom and then pushes to
digital beyond that which means photos
at the same zoom will look sharper on
the 10s and it can get even closer than
the 10r which uses software only but the
most practical tool about the zoom on
the 10s is actually that 2x shortcut on
the camera interface that's convenient
for quick one-handed zoom you'll
probably notice the biggest difference
in portrait mode
they both do it but the 10s is using
that second telephoto lens and it crops
in closer whereas the 10r is using
software only so you have that wider
angle field of view the downside is it
only works on humans
this means no objects no plants no back
shots and no animals which as a pet
owner is kind of a bummer the only way
to get portrait mode on the ten are to
work on animals for now is with a
third-party app or if you add a human or
tiny human to the frame and sure the end
results look just as cute on both phones
but getting it on a 10 are was a
struggle I had to readjust my distance
multiple times for it to lock into
portrait mode the 10s also has more
information to work with coming in from
both lenses so it's a little bit better
at determining where to apply the blur
and the edges tend to look softer but
subjects look sharper on the 10r
and you can fit more into your shot plus
you still get that slider tool to adjust
the intensity of the blur before and
after you take the shot and those
lighting effects - stage light and stage
light mono the downside of having the
wider angle lens though is that it can
start to distort the subject if you come
in too close
or position your subject along the edges
of the frame the upside is your
low-light portraits will look a lot
brighter and sharper on the 10r
because it uses that wider aperture lens
that's able to let in more light this
portrait and the dimly lit tiki bar
taken on the 10s is barely usable while
the one shot on the 10r is by no means
perfect but at least you can make out
the subject and the scene a lot better
at the end of the day both these phones
are gonna take great photos because they
share the same main camera now the
question is whether or not you need that
second lens and it really depends on
what you're using it for I for one take
a lot of portraits and I want to have
all the options available so I would
probably still splurge on the 10s but
what do you guys think let me know in
the comments section below or hit me up
on Twitter and make sure to watch our
full review of both these phones on CNET
