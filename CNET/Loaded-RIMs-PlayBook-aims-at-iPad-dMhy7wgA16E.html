Research In Motion announced its
much-anticipated tablet device yesterday
and it's not called the black pad
instead the company is calling it the
playbook rim says that it's the first
professional tablet it's got a 7-inch
touchscreen to HD front and back facing
cameras a 1 gigahertz dual-core CPU one
gigabyte of ram Wi-Fi and an html5
browser with flash support the new
device doesn't run on blackberry OS six
but a new tablet OS based on qnx a
company rim purchased last year
Microsoft is saying it will abandon the
windows spaces platform for windows live
in favor of the more popular wordpress
blogging interface this move mirrors
what the company did with its video
sharing site soap box opening up the
option to post videos to youtube or
facebook as well with apple relaxing its
App Store rules apps that use google's
voice service are starting to appear but
the big elephant in the room is whether
or not Google itself will release an
official app altogether according to
TechCrunch they will the tech blog is
reporting that google's voice app has
already been approved and that the
company is working on updates to support
iOS four and multitasking the US
government has asked Congress for
permission to wiretap any communication
service including everything from
encrypted blackberry messages to skype
calls to even Facebook messages the
federal government says that new
encrypted communications effectively
prevent the government from wiretapping
so you can now add the US government to
the ever-growing list of countries that
are pushing for increased access to
private communications and finally
Logitech is about to release a new
gaming headset that can wirelessly
receive audio from three separate game
consoles the f 540 will retail for a
hundred and fifty dollars and let xbox
360 and playstation 3 users also chat as
well the f 541 supports surround sound
but it can charge over USB for up to
10 hours of playtime look for the f5 40
