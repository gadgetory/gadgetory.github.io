about olympics coverage goes to Twitter
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update this year's NBC broadcast of the
Olympics may offer the best streaming
technology yet for watching the games
online but NBC has come under fire from
critics for not being good enough in
today's instant news world cable
subscribers will they can log into the
NBC website or use the app to stream
live events without any commentary but
sometimes we need that commentary
because I'm no expert in gymnastics
scoring critics have said that loading
the streams on apps can also be
problematic at times but since primetime
is more profitable well the best matches
are tape-delayed hours after the news of
who won is spread across social media
and tape delay has always been a
complaint for the games but our culture
now is so engulfed in social media more
than ever before and were used to
getting our news instantly so much so
that people have begun mocking the delay
on twitter with hashtag NBC fail and the
count NBC delayed which post breaking
news of years old olympic events others
have posted their methods of getting
around NBC and accessing BBC's live
coverage from pirated feeds but even
though more complaints are being voiced
nielsen reports that this year's
primetime broadcast has more viewers
than beijing did four years ago there's
been another tech complaint of the
Olympics apparently there are so many
people tweeting and posting from their
phones that the infrastructure in London
cannot handle the volume and it's
interfering with the transmission of
data and television commentators can't
get information so the International
Olympic Committee is asking those
attending to cool it on the texting if
possible in other news Apple announced
that its latest operating system version
called mountain lion has set a sales
record it's been downloaded over 3
million times in the first four days of
availability September is looking to be
a busy month for Apple the blog I'm or
has heard from trusted sources that
Apple will announce the iphone 5 and the
new iPad Mini on September 12th and will
go on sale nine days later on September
21st we've heard many September reports
before so there could be some truth to
this Apple and Samsung
been waging a patent war around the
globe for the past 17 months but the US
trial has just begun Apple aims to
convince a jury that Samsung copied
Apple's technology and Samsung well
they're making the case that the iphone
and ipad would not have been possible to
develop without its technology this
trial could last for weeks and it's
possible the outcome could stifle
legitimate competition and that'll be
felt to all of us in our wallets that
your tech news update for today for more
on the stories mentioned in the show you
can head on over to cnet com / update
and many thanks to Jeff Bakalar for
filling in while I was away from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
