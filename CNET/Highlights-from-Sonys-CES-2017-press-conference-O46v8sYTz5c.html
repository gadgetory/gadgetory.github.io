our new display technology the crystal
LED integrated structure which
incorporates ultrafine LEDs as its light
source now as you move around it you
will notice that it has an extremely
wide viewing angle with very little
color and brightness shift and unlike
other large format displays it is
virtually impossible virtually
impossible to see the pixels or the
seams even if you're standing right next
to it now ladies and gentlemen please
don't take my word for it you need to
absolutely experience it to believe it
the crystal LED display here within the
Sony booth is 32 feet by 9 feet
featuring an 8k x 2k image but thanks to
the scaleable title title structure the
size of the canvas is actually only
limited by your imagination and today I
have two new additions to our bravia
lines that bring the experience of 4k
HDR the processor excellent extreme to a
broader audience this is the first new
bravia that will feature a slim stylish
design with extraordinary brightness and
harnessing our slim backlight Drive plus
the display both spectacular brightness
and contrast using an intelligent
backlight driving technology and the
result is a stunning and vivid picture
satisfying the most discriminating
viewers who are seeking optimize picture
quality and we are proud to introduce
this series as one of our best LED TVs
under our flagship Z 90 this is the
bravia OLED and this is a unique
execution of an older display that only
Sony that only Sony can really bring to
life all that is designed to reproduce
deep blacks in dark scenes and when it's
combined with our x1 extreme processing
technology it renders every detail of an
image regardless of any ambient
darkness in the scene we offer further
flexibility in style and in home
integration with our second generation
second generation ultra short throw 4k
HD our home theater projector the
projector is minimally intrusive and now
over 40 percent smaller than the
previous version yet still able to
provide stunning cinematic quality
images discreetly displayed right into
your own living space the ultra short
throw lens lets you place the projector
close to your wall for a giant 120 inch
image and since it's near a wall viewers
shadows will interfere with the picture
allowing for more open floor space as
well and for those of you who desire
disk media with the most advanced
technology to provide the ultimate in
picture and sound quality our first
Ultra High Definition blu-ray disc
player for home entertainment will be
coming out the spring as well and here
our sound bar delivers a complete 4k HD
our home theater experience with three
dimensional immersive sound like Dolby
Atmos and to make this sound bar the
very best for home theaters we
collaborated with sound professionals at
Sony Pictures who lent their expertise
to calibrate the audio quality and
optimize it for the playback of movies
and today we're showcasing our latest
noise canceling innovations two
prototypes of in-ear Wireless noise
cancelling headphones
one features a sleek behind the neck
style and the other is a wireless pair
of earbuds free of cables housing or
headband we're giving you more choices
in how you listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
