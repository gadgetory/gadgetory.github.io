down the top 5 tech gifts under 50 bucks
at number 5 a tablet who knew that you
could get an actual tablet for $50 well
you knew that but most of those tablets
were crud tacular and Amazon fire tablet
is better than that does that make it a
great tablet no is it a very good $50
tablet yes it's great for someone who's
already got Amazon Prime so they can
watch prime video all day on its 7 inch
screen it also has a micro SD card slot
so you can expand the storage if you
want to load up on content at number
four a fitness gadget the misfit flash
is a great little starter fitness gadget
it cost about 20 bucks it uses a coin
battery so you don't need to charge it
it worked with both Android and iOS
phones the mr. flash is also a basic
watch 20 bucks at number three a
Bluetooth speaker listening to music
using your phone's internal speakers can
be pretty awful
you're in luck there are a couple of
glutes with options for you there's the
phillips bt 2500 it's small and it cost
about $35 there's also the logitech X
100 it looks like a hockey puck and its
sound is decent for its size at number 2
a video streamer when I was a kid there
was no way to get a video streamer for
under $50 as you can see I am NOT a kid
anymore
and you can get a streamer for cheap the
best all-around option is the Roku
streaming stick that will give you so
many video app options you won't know
what to do
there's also the amazon firetv stick for
you Amazonians is that what they call
you
then there's the Google chromecast that
costs $35 but you better have a smart
phone or the chromecast doesn't do much
and the number one tech gift under $50 a
nice pair of headphones almost everyone
loves listening to music
except Earl you guys know we're all he's
weird anyway if you're willing to drop
$50 for yourself or a special person
you've got plenty of choice the over the
ear Panasonic RP HT x 7 are light and
have very good sound then there's a JVC
H as400 headphones with carbon nanotubes
they fold flat and cost around twenty
five dollars online they sound good
there's even a Bluetooth option for
under $50 the creative soundblaster jam
it costs $35 with about 12 hours of
battery life its design is a bit on the
matte side but it's sound surprisingly
good if you've got more coin to spend
