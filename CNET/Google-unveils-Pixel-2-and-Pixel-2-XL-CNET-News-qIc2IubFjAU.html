a five inch and the 6 inch XL we've
evolved a pixels iconic look to be even
bolder the all aluminum body with a
premium hybrid coating gives it a sleek
and clean profile the refined visor is
made of sturdy gently curved colored
glass and transitions seamlessly into
the metal body we've placed a
fingerprint sensor where your finger
naturally Falls it's extremely accurate
secure and it unlocks faster than any
other smartphone we also added a small
pop of color on the power button for a
bit of playfulness over on the front
pixel two's front-facing stereo speakers
are precision tuned to deliver the
perfect balance of volume clarity and
frequency response we placed them so you
can comfortably watch videos in
landscape mode without muffling the
audio with your hand if you prefer
headphones use your existing analog
headphones with the included adapter or
your digital USBC headphones for the
highest resolution audio all the way to
your ears or avoid cables altogether
with your upgraded Bluetooth 5.0 support
and high five codecs the smaller 5-inch
pixel too
features a full HD OLED display and it's
as smart as it is beautiful the display
intelligently selects which specific
pixels to turn on leaving the others
perfectly dark for a 100,000 to 1
contrast ratio pixel 2 comes in three
colors kind of blue just black and
clearly white we elegantly curved the
glass to bring the display to the edges
the screen supports 18 by 9 qhd+
resolution with over 4.1 million pixels
which equals 538 pixels per inch for
amazing detail we tuned to display to
take advantage of the wide color gamut
for vivid and realistic colors we've
integrated a circular polarizer which
lets you enjoy the screen even while
wearing sunglasses and we've optimized
that this
on both phones for virtual reality
they're both daydream ready the pixel to
excel comes in two colors just black and
the stylish ly simple black and white
both devices are ip67 water and dust
resistant and have an all-day battery
the charge is super fast you get up to
seven hours of charge in just 15 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
