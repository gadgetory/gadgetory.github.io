Developer Preview on an iPhone 10 and I
want to run you through some of my first
impressions what it's like to use the
new interface and a couple of new
features now bear in mind this is a
developer version and things are likely
to change between now and the final
release
so let's unlock the phone and get
started so if I'm up the phone the first
thing I'm not gonna do is start a quick
screen recording just so you can see a
nice clean view of what I'm doing
hence the red icon up here so you'll see
that iOS 12 has a brand new wallpaper
this is the default wallpaper if you
decide to choose to put it on your phone
it's going to look like this with the
gradients of the red to the blue this is
the first time that I have open iOS 12
so bear with me here you're going to go
through this just as I'm experiencing it
first thing I want to try is the app
switcher so I've been using the iPhone
10 with iOS 11 and previously when I
wanted to actually close an app from the
app switcher I'd have to press and hold
on the actual app in the switcher and
then hit the little X to actually toggle
out of the app now you'll notice that
that doesn't work when I do that so if
I'm going through the app switcher and I
want to switch atom and app all I'll
need to do just to close it is to swipe
up like that which is a feature that
anyone who is not using an iPhone 10
will be we're well aware of so now I'm
gonna try something fun and make my own
emoji so let's get started okay that
doesn't look like I think I look but
that's okay I can totally go customize
things let's see oh we have something
with bangs there we go my nice little
hairstyle there but there are a lot of
different options here there are a
couple of highlights oh that's kind of
neat you can add a little bit of a
highlight option eyes green just gonna
speed through this and do a really quick
one there we go I'm gonna come back and
refine this browse nose and lips he is
facial hair so you can get really
granular here there are a lot of
different customization options
okay so there we go I've completed it
and now I'm talking to you you know iOS
12 with my brand new emoji so I'm gonna
start recording and now it looks like I
can choose around 30 seconds whereas the
previous and emojis I believe were
around 10 seconds so there we go
hi there's the tongue detection at work
that's quite fun all right speaking of
all things face there is now the option
to actually add a second face to your
face ID so I've just opened up the
Settings app and we're gonna go and try
and find this face ID and passcode okay
let's see if I can find where we do the
second base setup an alternate
appearance here so in addition to
continuously learning about how you look
face ID can recognize an alternate
appearance this is pretty good because
sometimes when I have my head tied up or
have sunglasses on doesn't necessarily
recognize me so being able to set up a
second appearance for face ID it's
pretty useful or alternatively adding a
second face altogether if you want
someone else to be able to unlock your
phone also in the settings let's take a
look at some of the big new features in
iOS 12 including Do Not Disturb and
screen time so let's start with screen
time first this is the first time that
I've opened this app so I don't really
think that it's gonna give me any data
on how much I've used my phone yet oh
actually I was incorrect here we go it's
giving me an idea of how long I've used
my phone so I've spent six minutes and
settings three minutes and messages two
minutes in Chrome in four minutes
elsewhere and I've been using it for one
hour over 32 minutes today approximately
31 minutes above my average time which
is kind of scary given it's still early
in the morning I can also set some app
limits so obviously if I'm using an app
like Instagram Twitter so on and so
forth
far too much I can go through and I can
choose that so let's say social
networking apps so it looks like it's
categorizing them all in one so if I'm
using social networking apps for more
than an hour it's going to
me a little notification there we go so
I've set that up for one hour let's see
how I les stick to that and then I can
always do the always allowed so these
are the apps that I want to be able to
use at all times so in this example it's
by default setup messages and FaceTime
to come through during downtime but for
example if I wanted to add another thing
like a notification from a third-party
messaging app perhaps I could also add
that into so you can just drag it or
remove it in as you like now let's try
the iOS 12 notifications grouping I want
to see what that looks like
so in iOS 12 one of the big changes is
group notifications on the home screen
rather than getting a huge stream of
notifications you now get them all
bunched up together by sender and type
so for example you get emails and text
messages like so like before you could
swipe across and open them if you like
or you can also swipe this way instead
of just clear all and view you now get
this option called manage so it opens a
dialog like this and it gives me the
option to either deliver them quietly or
I can turn them off altogether and that
essentially shows it just switched off
let's open that again so quiet
notifications will appear in the
Notification Center and badge the app
icon but will not appear on the
lockscreen
present banners or play a sound so I can
turn that to deliver quietly and see
what that does is that essentially it
delivers it but it doesn't put it on the
actual lockscreen itself so that's a
nice feature to kind of clear up that
mess on your lockscreen
so now I'm going to take a look at some
of the new apps in iOS 12 including the
measure app here so I have a MacBook
Pros sitting in front of me I'm just
gonna calibrate the phone like so it
says move iPhone just start okay here we
go so it looks like it's ready to go I
have a plus icon here and a point on the
screen I'm guessing that's where I'm
gonna have to start placing the point by
pressing the plus icon moving it across
like so pressing it again and that line
and it's giving me the measurement of
one of the sides of
the MacBook there you go now for
something fun I really want to try is
making a FaceTime call with me emoji
first times had a couple of different
updates including 32 person FaceTime
calls which I'm not gonna try now but
I'm gonna try them emoji so it looks
like there's this new icon here hi
what's up I'm gonna try and be merging
you okay let's try this I'm gonna tap
into the an emoji tab tap into my me
emoji oh yeah what do you think you like
you like and they got my tongue sticking
out to you alright alright that's a lot
of fun that is active in the iOS 12
developer beta right now so you can have
fun with that
finally let's go to Siri shortcuts now
this is kind of to make Siri do a little
bit more than just your stock standard
weather directions and all of that so
I'm gonna try and find that within the
settings so I'm going to go to settings
Siri and search and then this new tab
called shortcuts pops up so it's kind of
looking at the things that I've recently
done which is like starting a video call
for example so if I want to try and do
that as a shortcut it looks like I can
just tap that plus icon and then if I
want to start a video call
I can then basically record a
personalized phrase and it will do that
so hmm let's think of something fun to
say make lunch for Nick
okay so when I say that that's gonna
start a face time cool alright let's
let's try it now make lunch for Nick and
there we go it's cooling face time and
then I can add my emergy again like so
that's pretty fun hi I just got to make
lunch in the series shortcut and it
calls you because it's lunch tired
alright later
so that's the first run through iOS 12

questions about what is in iOS 12 please

of different features that I didn't get
a chance to touch on including some of
the photo stuff so stay tuned to seen it
