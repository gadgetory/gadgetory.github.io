about phones of the year the Google
pixel three and three Excel are finally
here as you can expect the phones are
all about the camera on the backs it's a
12 megapixel shooter and on the fronts
it's two eight megapixel cameras a lot
of the new camera features work in the
background and use AI to enhance your
photos that includes using machine
learning to recommend the best image a
new feature called super resume also
takes multiple shots to put together
ultra detailed close-up images Google
improved the pixels ultra low light
shooting mode too and it doesn't depend
on the flash it's coming to the pixel 3
next month and it uses software to
choose the right colors based on the
content of the image as for the front
shooters the second camera has a wider
field of view so you can fit more stuff
in each frame this year Google is really
emphasizing the phone's helpfulness to
users a new feature actually screens
incoming calls and answers spam calls on
your behalf
while transcribing the conversation to
you and as part of its well-being
endeavor the phone has tools that'll
limit your time spent on apps other new
features include wireless charging and
Google is selling its own wireless
charger called the pixel stand when you
place a picks on it it switches to a
different mode both the pixel three and
three XL feels sturdy and life compared
to last year's pixels it just feels a
little bit more luxurious and you can
tell by the glass backing that it's
smooth and it's really comfortable to
hold there's still a signature glass
shade so people still know that you're
holding a pixel and some of the color
variants come with an eye-catching color
accent on the power buttons in addition
to black and white Google also added a
new color which is called not pink but
it's a very very soft pink that I'm all
about if you're debating between the two
phones know that the main difference
I'm mostly sighs scream and price the
pixel 3 has a 5.5 inch screen while the
pixel 3 XL has a 6 point 3 inch screen
other than that though the phones are
pretty much the same they have the same
cameras the same processors and the same
software the phones go on sale starting
October 18th but you can pre-order them
now the pixel three starts at seven
hundred and ninety nine dollars while
the three XL starts at eight hundred
ninety nine dollars for more info check
