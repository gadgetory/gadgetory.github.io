of the packaging design team at
Microsoft ok we and we have here inside
this box a adaptive controller from Xbox
but let's first talk about what this
thing is yeah that's in the box yeah so
this is actually a shipper box that you
get in the mail when you order the Xbox
adaptable adaptive controller from
Microsoft comm and it just to be clear
what the controller is yeah right it's
this special thing that was designed
over the last two years for people with
disabilities right yeah forgetting we're
still limited mobility yeah and it has
all these abilities to plug in to
different things and all these buttons
and all that stuff and that was
announcement yeah a whole months ago yep
so now we have the actual box that's no

yep exactly so any time you order it we
wanted to make sure that you could get
the Box open you know anybody who
decided to order this online we wanted
to make it empowering for everybody to
box and first off you'll notice that
this doesn't have the standard shipping
tape that you would get on a box that
you were online most shipping tape you
know you need an exacto knife or keys to
get open this one actually has a little
loop that we designed because we found
through research that loops are actually
very highly leverageable for people with
limited mobility to get into any sort of
packaging so you actually just slide the
loop right off and you'll see that you
know we just have a standard shipping
box but you can also just leverage the
crevice there to open the box up and
go with the other side and you'll notice
that the box itself it does have these
beside air cell buffers so when it gets
dropped in shipping the box is nicely
protected we're avoiding using things
like plastic bubble wrap extra
components for shipping that we don't
need and that's by the way pretty cool
that you have something that it's easily
open about it's still all cardboard with
the exception of the tape and the tape
is pretty easy to pull apart - yeah so
let's get into the over here yeah so
you'll also notice that this you know it
just looks like a a nice X Box box that
you would see you know just like a
controller so it really lives well
within our ecosystem in retail so
premium white yep green and white nice
and clean presentation of the product
and very very easy to read text you'll
also see that we do have a break the
seal label that we have on all of our
retail boxes so obviously you want the
Box closed when you when you're when
it's sitting on shelf and you can
actually very easily open this as well
because we do have loops for both sides
of access so you can tear it away from
the left or right I'm gonna go ahead and
tear it from the right as you can see it
peels away really easily and once again
same ideas the packaging loops yeah you
get your hand in - yeah how capable you
are yep exactly
and for each step of the process we're
creating the right size of loop for like
the size of the elements that it's
around as well so you'll also notice
that we do have a loop that goes to the
full length of the box this is a nice
soft ribbon that you can easily open and
you'll notice that when we're opening it
the the hinges in the back lower back
placement of the box so it's easier to
get open it's a low access of opening
and when you do open it you see that
nice pop and you do see the panel that
come for here this hinged panel presents
this a multiple access point area where
you can either get your hand in under to
slide out or another loop yeah or
exactly another loop that you can either
open underhand or overhand you can also
slide out the controller like so and it
it lands nice and softly on this panel
as well in case you do need to slide it
up as you see this loop right here it
does have the QuickStart guide so it's
just a easy four steps nice icons just
to represent you know how to how to set
it up right away and this generous loop
as you can also see is applied right
here on this component and when you pull
this component out you'll notice that it
has these open ends so if you need to
slide this cable out you can do so you
can also just simply just spring it open
and when you do that you'll notice that
this cord insight does not have any
twist ties or any fasteners so so super
easy to pull hard
plug in exactly this is my charging cord
yep and as you can see all the elements
they're unified and they're really in
relation to the rectilinear form that
the actual product has just a very
simple unboxing process as well
absolutely and I'm curious about this
hinge here yeah that's not very common
in a lot of these boxes we do have this
hinge living in some of our boxes as
well with the xbox controllers as well
and also the fact that this is a rigid
box makes it all that more easier to get
into that's really and this is the whole
thing yep well thank God we wanted to
just create like a nice confident
experience for everybody to open yeah
it's super easy cool well thank you
thanks again really appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
