and one of the three and the crockpot
Express croc multicooker both cost about
$80 $70 for the crock pot and are
extremely versatile kitchen countertop
appliances which one should you buy both
offer a hearty six quart capacity both
can function as pressure cookers to
speed up cooking times and both
appliances offer true one pot cooking -
they sear and saute steam and slow cook
the traditional way if you've got the
time there are some differences though
the instant pot has a stainless steel
cooking chamber that delivers more even
heat and Browns food better than the
crock pot Express that translates to
deeper tastier flavors especially when
preparing meat dishes of course the
inner pot is harder to keep clean than
nonstick surfaces rice in particular
tends to adhere to the bottom of the pot
a little soaking in water will loosen
debris but it's still an extra step rice
cooked by the instant pot tenant to be a
little mushy - and not as fluffy as I
prefer you do have the option of buying
a ceramic inner pot accessory with a
nonstick surface it's sold separately
for an additional $20 by contrast the
crock pot Express comes with a nonstick
cooking chamber similar to what you see
in electric rice cookers as a result the
rice the crock pot made was softer
lighter and fluffier than what the
instant pot whips up the drawback is the
crock pot doesn't develop quite as much
flavor when sauteing items for
meat-centric dishes the instant pot is
more flexible than the crock pot Express
- it has 12 cooking presets compared to
the crock pots eight including what
those are a few for creating specialty
items like eggs rice porridge even cake
there's a manual mode as well to tweak
settings and experiment the crock pots
automatic cycles don't include a manual
setting the cookers presets however
handle more staple fare the chili
setting is particularly nice the instant
pot doesn't have a dedicated button for
that that's too bad too since it's such
a popular food with multicooker fans so
if you plan to play around with your
recipes even create a few of your own
then get the instant pot especially if
you're a meat lover that wants maximum
flavor
if you're looking for a pressure cooker
that can make chili and rice in a snap
then the crock-pot Express will be your
new kitchen buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
