welcome to the Apple bite and you know
we'll talk about everything good and bad
from WWDC 2013 and let's start it off
with the rock star of the event
iOS 7 now we finally saw the new fresh
coat of paint Apple has been working on
and it looks like a cleaner and flatter
iOS and the use of the slimmer font
called skinny jeans it's apples modern
take that should make most Apple fans
happy since it's a fresh look for them
and they're finally starting to catch up
with their hand roid peers now even our
own CNET poll showed that with over
30,000 respondents over 66% of people
liked what they saw
in iOS 7 now my first impressions I like
it and where they're going with this but
I don't love it Apple's sexy video sure
they're one thing but using it right now
it's a little too bright overall even
the icons kind of look kiddush and text
can be really hard to read at times and
let's just keep it real
it takes a quite a few cues from Android
Windows Phone 8 and others now I'm not
gonna judge it too hard right now it's
still just the beta and it's coming out
this fall but I think the biggest thing
that sticks out to me was the lack of
any game changing features now the iOS
and car interface might end up being the
standout but we've seen something
similar from Samsung already now Siri is
better integrated for telling it things
like turning on Bluetooth but it's still
the same Siri at its core it hasn't
shown it's improved and it's a
technology that's still behind -
Google's speech recognition then you
have apple's map it's getting better and
iTunes radio also made an appearance
with little fanfare as an addition to
the music app iTunes Match users will
get an ad-free version and everyone else
will still be able to use it for free
with ads then we have here control
center to get quick access to your
services it's finally here and that
might be the biggest thing for iOS users
that aren't jailbreakers well Android
users they're kind of laughing alright
guys one cool feature that hasn't been
talked about is that iOS 7 will include
support for standardized my game
controllers which will finally enable a
handheld
Gaiman experience with iOS devices and
really this has a lot of potential and
one hidden feature that people have
found is the ability to use a panorama
picture in your lockscreen here like
Jeff Qin did and you can spin around and
around to look at it until you throw up
now iOS 7 will be available in fall and
surprisingly work with the iPhone 4 and
higher the 5th gen iPod touch the iPad 2
and higher and the iPad Mini now Apple
also showed off what they've been
working on with OS 10 and they're moving
away from cats and calling this one OS
10 mavericks no not after the dallas
mavericks basketball fans but the
surfing location in northern california
where waves like routinely crested over
25 feet they get like top out at 80 feet
that's gnarly
um Thank You Wikipedia now some of the
cool new features were finder tabs that
consolidate all those Finder windows
into one I love that multiple display
support with Doc's on every screen the
ability to tag files to help you sort
them and a dedicated OS 10 Maps app
where you can send the directions you
found directly to the maps on your phone
and a bunch of other features and
performance tweaks to increase your
battery life so Apple here is really
hoping they can make some waves in the
OS and it's also expected to release
sometime in fall now we predicted a
refresh for the pro and airlines but
surprisingly we only saw new MacBook
Airs
there were no cosmetic changes and we
didn't get a Retina display even when
there are plenty of other competitors
out there with higher res laptop
displays like the Toshiba Kirra book and
the Chromebook pixel so that's pretty
much a bust now the main upgrade will be
battery life
they'll come loaded with the new Intel
Haswell processors the 11 inch air
starts at $9.99 and goes from five hours
of juice to nine and the 13-inch goes
from seven hours to 12 hours and starts
at 1099 which is $100 cheaper but it
looks like for whatever reason we'll
have to wait for the MacBook Pro retina
updates probably around the
back-to-school season in the july/august
timeframe and there is a new airport
extreme and time capsule that looks like
a squarish paper towel roll shape it
supports the faster 802 11 AC standard
that's three times faster and strong
than current Wi-Fi and starts at $1.99
but really for me the biggest surprise
was the sneak peak at the Mac Pro yes
Apple's powerhouse desktop finally
showed itself with one of the most
unique form factors that we've ever seen
in a desktop well unless you use this
coffee grinder now you know the internet
went to town on this one with some
amazing let's just call them Mac Pro
mock-ups like the Mac Pro tissue box or
it could be a home for a seal and I'm
all for protecting animal habitats check
out this one it's really classy for you
shabu-shabu fans out there and you know
I love this one and dim sum but
seriously this is a radical design that
is really unlike any other using
next-gen intel xeon e5 processors with
up to 12 cores to AMD FirePro GPUs and
the top-of-the-line PCIe flash-based
storage that's ten times faster than
desktop hard drives plus you get four
channel ECC ddr3 memory this beast can
edit full res 4k video while rendering
the effects in the background it has
expansion with the next-gen Thunderbolt
2 it's one-eighth the size of the
previous Mac Pro 1/8 dry creek and
coming later this year now Phil Schiller
wanted us to make sure we knew what we
were looking at can't innovate anymore
my ass
but Phil hold on hold on now don't get
too ahead of yourself because then the
interweb isn't going to remind you that
iOS 7 pretty much took elements from
Windows 8 like the call screen the
control center is pretty much like the
notifications cool down with access to
services from Android the multitasking
is almost a carbon copy of webOS and the
weather app yeah this is Yahoo's weather
app and this is Apple's in iOS 7 so
let's just slow your roll down a little
bit now overall if I had to give WWDC a
grade I'd give it a b-plus they really
delivered with a new refreshing OS it's
solid most of you guys will be happy but
I don't see it luring over android users
and it's enough to keep the Apple users
then we're getting frustrated on team
Cupertino see I just say Cupertino kids
that YouTube guy now MacBook Airs we're
solid bump but current owners won't be
racing to get one iTunes radio is nice
but nothing special and the Mac Pro well
we might as well call that thing beast
mode if you're in the market for one so
I asked you what do you guys think
well Karin Stevens writes in with I know
I know iOS 7 isn't original but the
overall aesthetic has changed an apple
needed to reflect that change or die out
like the dinosaurs could it be less
girly and pastel yeah it's almost 2
hello kitty even for me is there even
such thing as too much hello kitty no
Julian on Twitter says as a dev I was
hoping for a lot more than we got failed
to see how this is the game changer
Apple needed and the ever optimistic
Alex Carroll writes in with I can't wait
to get iOS 7 just waiting on the
announcement of the iWatch and the iPad
Mini 2 so there you go guys that's gonna
do it for this week's show send me your
email through the Apple bita cnet.com
and your tweets at Brian Tong and let us
know really what you thought about WWDC
as well I'm Brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
for another bite of the Apple
