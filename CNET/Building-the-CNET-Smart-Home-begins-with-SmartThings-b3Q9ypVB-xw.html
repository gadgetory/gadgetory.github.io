number of home automation hubs were
entering the market and we tested them
all some are good others not so much we
had high hopes for this category of
smart products but here we are two years
later and not much has changed home
automation hubs are still far from
perfect that's because no single hub can
do everything it's also a challenge to
make an app that works with so many
third-party devices that's also easy to
navigate so we've got some tough choices
to make if we're going to turn this
house into a cena
if you were to ask me today is a home
automation hub really necessary for a
smart home I'd have to answer honestly
no probably not in fact most of you
would be fine picking a single thing
you'd like to automate like lighting or
door logs and buying a product
specifically for that purpose but this
isn't an ordinary house in fact it's
more of a lab for us than a home to
bring you reviews of what works in a
home environment and what doesn't for
that reason a hub makes sense and while
none of the options out there are
flawless we're gonna start with the
second generation smartthings hub
because of its sheer number of
Integrative will devise if channel and
alert options but as you're about to see
interacting with it isn't as simple as
we'd like it to be basically everything
in the app is either hard to find or
hard to set up or both for instance the
apps home screen is kind of confusing
what am I looking at exactly and setting
up new configuration rules forget it I
have such a tough time even finding
where I can make those adjustments that
I spend more time searching through the
app than I do actually making
substantive changes but after you've
managed to set your automation rules and
custom alerts the hub really does work
well I can turn lights on and off
remotely receive alerts from the motion
sensor get a message when someone opens
the front door and because it has such a
wide range of compatible devices we
should be able to test out tons of
sensors and automated switches without
the need to install a new hub every time
but the smart home landscape is changing
fast and we're keeping a close eye on
competing models like Insteon hub pro
which is compatible with Apple's Siri
based home kit platform and we're still
hoping for that ideal automation hub one
that can turn this house into the
smartest home possible be sure to check
back over the coming weeks and months to
see all of the plans we have for the
cnet smart home we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
