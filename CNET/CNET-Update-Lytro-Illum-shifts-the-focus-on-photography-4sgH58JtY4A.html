photography I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update if you've been
watching the show you've heard me talk
about technology that lets you change
the focus of a photo after you've
snapped the picture we've seen this in
Google's new camera app and it's also
technology built into the HTC One m8
smartphone but there's a new standalone
camera that can accomplish this
it's the Lytro Illume it lets you
refocus the shot after it's been taken
because it absorbs and records all the
information that comes through the lens
creating a file that can be altered
later by tapping the spot you want to be
sharpened and you can slightly shift the
perspective an interactive version of
the photo can be shared on a website so
people can click to change the focus
themselves but this isn't the first
Lytro camera the Lytro light field came
out more than two years ago the unique
camera was inside a colorful rectangular
block and you need to transfer photos to
an app or to your desktop to edit the
focus but you can still buy one for $200
this new model however looks more like a
real camera with a grip and a
touchscreen it also has an 8 X zoom and
hits us stores in July for $1,600 Lytro
is targeting professional photographers
with that high price and on the topic of
prices Netflix is planning to increase
its monthly subscription price soon
chief executive Reed Hastings said in a
webcast that soon Netflix will cost a
dollar or two more a month and that the
money would go toward expanding content
but current subscribers you are in the
clear for now it might be two years
before current subscribers see the
bigger bill the price of a new
membership could jump sometime in June
so if Netflix goes to $9 or $10 a month
it would cost more a year than Amazon
Prime of course what matters is content
Amazon has access to plenty of kiddie
programming with Nickelodeon exclusive
television shows but Netflix also has
plenty of gems of its own including
Disney movies and if paying more has you
feeling down well maybe some home
beer will cheer you up sparkling drink
systems is a company that's making a
machine that lets you instantly brew a
beer in the similar way you might use a
Keurig to brew a cup of coffee or a
SodaStream to mix your own soda pop the
Machine maker has partnered with Pats
backcountry beverages which is selling
concentrated beer packs that will mix
with carbonated water to give you craft
beer at home you can't buy the Machine
just yet it's coming later this year and
we can't wait to review it that's your
tech news update you can head to
