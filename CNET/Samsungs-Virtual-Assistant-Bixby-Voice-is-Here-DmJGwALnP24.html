hear what it is if you own a Galaxy s8
or s8 plus go download Bixby voice right
now it's finally available Bixby voice
is Samsung's virtual assistant that
helps control your phone so you can do
things with your voice that you would
normally do with taps and text on screen
for example say host my latest photo to
Instagram and she'll go right ahead and
take you all the way through to the
final step you can activate Bixby voice
with a command hi Bixby or press the
dedicated button on the side of the
phone Bixby voice was first announced
when Samsung launched the Galaxy s8 but
the rollout was delayed because Samsung
said it lacked enough big data over
100,000 users did get to try it out
under the early access preview a few
weeks ago but you did have to sign up to
the program to take part according to
Samsung improvements you'll see in the
new consumer version include improved
response times better optimization with
third-party apps and Bicks we can now
read the latest messages in the native
app out loud Bixby voice is entering a
crowded field of voice assistance
there's Siri with her updated smarts in
iOS 11 Cortana that works across mobile
and desktop with Windows 10 Amazon's
Alexa on phones like the HTC u 11 and of
course the Google assistant now Samsung
said that it's not supposed to replace
the Google assistant bug and in fact you
can use both side by side on the SOA so
what are you waiting for go and try it
out right now and see if Bixby voice
will win you over
