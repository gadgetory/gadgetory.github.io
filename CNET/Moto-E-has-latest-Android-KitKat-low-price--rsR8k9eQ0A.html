recently of making great smartphones
that won't cost you the earth its latest
effort is this the Moto e let's
investigate so let's start with the
basics the design this isn't a
smartphone Goliath like the Galaxy Note
3 it's not huge it's actually quite
compact it's not the slimmest phone I've
ever seen but it does feel quite nicely
feels quite sturdy
I like these curves around the back it
feels quite nicely designed if why it's
not your style it does come in a bunch
of other colours as well so it is
slightly customisable this is a 4.3 inch
display it has a 960 by 540 pixel
resolution now that's not especially
high there are smart phones out there
with high resolutions but it looks
alright to me I've seen more luxurious
screens but bear in mind that this is
quite a cheap phone I think it will
handle the basics like email Facebook
just fine inside there's a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor that's backed up by
one gigabyte of RAM again not the most
powerful tech specs but it doesn't feel
that slow moving around the home screens
and surfing around Android it feels
quite slick rounding things off is a 5
megapixel camera on the back now as you
can probably tell this isn't the most
powerful phone out there but one thing
that is great is that it has the most
recent version of Android that's Android
version 4.4.2 also known as KitKat and
it's great to see a more modest mobile
like this getting access to cutting-edge
software so finally what about the
all-important price well this thing is
going to cost around 130 dollars off
contract in the US and 89 pounds in the
UK so it is cheap but is it good value
we'll find out more in the full review
so stay tuned check out Cena comm for
more on the rest rate and this is the
Motorola MOTO II</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
