Pierre Theodore alongside his surgical
tools he's experimenting with a piece of
tech Google glass inside of the glass
what I'm seeing are CT images which are
basically cross-sectional x-rays of the
patient's chest and it allows me to
operate at the same time I have this
critical data right in front of me
wearing Google glass is like wearing
your smartphone on your face you can
read your email make phone calls and
take videos and photos doctors and other
hospitals have used Google glass to
broadcast live video of their surgeries
dr. Theodore is instead focused on
getting information in lieu of looking
behind him on a screen dr. Theodore can
just take a quick glance up which he
says saves time and improves patient
safety the advantage of the Google glass
is that the images come up really at
exactly the same point of care so the
physician doesn't really need to leave
the operating room doesn't need to turn
a different direction doesn't need to
leave the operating room table in some
cases even scrubbing out to look at
films during the hour-long lung surgery
dr. Theodore says he called up eight
different images and had Google glass
activated for roughly a quarter of the
time sometimes that can really matter to
not have to change one's attention at a
critical portion of an operation so what
we're really seeing in my mind is kind
of a tantalizing glimpse into the future
one of dr. Theater's goals is to take
this wearable technology out of this
operating room worldwide to hospitals in
developing countries you can service
both a teaching tool and a way of
augmenting the skills of physicians in
resource-limited places the Google glass
pilot program at the University of
California San Francisco Medical Center
has uncovered a few limitations of the
technology voice commands are
insufficient the battery drains quickly
and the image size is relatively small
still it's an encouraging first step in
San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com
