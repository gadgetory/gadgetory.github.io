it and we are in my office taking a look
at the power up series 2 by up desk and
what this is is essentially a standing
desk that is motorized and you can
adjust the height from sitting to
standing and it'll supposedly help you
stand more often in the workplace and
hopefully that's you know better for
your health better for your well-being
and all that kind of good stuff so the
power up series 2 costs eight hundred
ninety nine dollars now that seems like
a lot but compared to other devices out
there and other deaths like this that
are motorized they can run for a lot
more money so what do you get with power
ups series to essentially it is
motorized and has an adjustable height
from 25.5 inches to 50.5 inches it also
has a control panel with a digital
readout and what's really nice is you
have memory for three positions you can
adjust the height and have it saved say
for standing or sitting maybe even a
coffee bar setting for enjoying an
espresso in the afternoon you also have
300 pounds of lifting capacity so you'll
be able to put all your monitors and
keyboards and other office equipment
lamps on the desk and not have much
problem there it also comes in multiple
finishes like the maple finish we see
here and also mahogany black and orange
right now we're looking at the small
version of the power up but it also
comes in medium and large sizes also
nice is that there's a cable management
channel underneath that you can push
wires through and keep everything tidy
underneath I'm Brian Bennett for seen it
and we've just taken a first look at the
power ups series to buy up desk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
