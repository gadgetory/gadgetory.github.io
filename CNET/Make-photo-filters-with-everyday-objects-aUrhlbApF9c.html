cellophane and some cling wrap help you
get a different look and feel to your
images I'm Lexi CBDs from seen it I'm
going to show you how to use these three
items for some unique photo effects
first up we're going to use colored
cellophane to emulate a colored filter
and also to add some really nice light
leak effects to your images grab any
color you like and cut off a small
segment that will fit around your lens
attached with a rubber band and look
through the viewfinder to position it
where you like in the frame depending on
the effect you desire you can cover half
the lens a small portion or the entire
thing if you want to color gel look you
can even experiment by taping different
pieces of colored cellophane together
and attaching them over the lens there's
a really neat effect next we're going to
use a wine glass and thanks to the magic
of refraction when I fill this with
water the image inside the glass is
going to be inverted grab your glass and
put it in front of a subject choose
where you want your point of focus to be
and then use a shallow depth of field or
a small F number to get a background
blur to really make the image pop you
can then flip the image in
post-production Pro trippy results and
finally do you remember that old
Vaseline lens trick I'm going to show
you how to create that effect from
vintage and ethereal looking photos
first grab your cling wrap and wrap it
tightly around the barrel of the lens
pull it taut and dab Vaseline around the
edges depending on where you place the
Vaseline you can make it look like a
foggy day or add a dreamy feel to
portrait but its effect you can also use
a cheap skylight or UV filter so you can
smear the Vaseline on the filter itself
sure you might get some funny looks when
using these tools out and about but it's
all in the name of having fun with your
photography so go out enjoy and check
out plenty more tips on using everyday
items for your photography as creative
filters over at the how-to on CNET</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
