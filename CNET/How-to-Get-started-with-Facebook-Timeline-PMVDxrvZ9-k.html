cnet.com here to walk you through the
new facebook profiles now known as your
timeline timelines are completely
different than your profile and they
start with a new edition called the
cover photo for my profile I picked this
photo of myself but it can be whatever
you want like a photo of your dog or
your favorite city to change it hover
over your photo select change cover and
choose a photo from your facebook albums
or upload one from your drive just blow
your cover photo you'll see all of your
info on the left and other profile items
like friends apps and photos on the
right to edit or change the privacy
settings for any of these items click on
the item this works for your info photos
friends and other modules you can also
decide which boxes show up at the top
click the arrow to expand hover over a
box and click the pencil there is an
option to swap the box with something
else or remove it entirely there is a
new app called maps which is a
geographical version of your timeline it
plots points where you've tagged a
location in any of your posts it's
pretty cool but if you think it's creepy
hover over the box and remove it now
comes the fun and kind of scary part
your timeline all of your Facebook
activity is now viewable to you and your
friends in chronological order going all
the way back to the day joined facebook
in the very beginning you'll see an
empty section for the day you were born
the idea is that facebook wants you to
fill in events that happen throughout
your life even before Facebook to add an
event hover over the point in the
timeline where it happened and click the
grey line you have the option to add a
status update photo location you visited
or type of life event for example maybe
you learned a new language broke a bone
bought a new car or graduated there are
about 20 different suggested events but
if you want to add something of your own
just click other life event once you
fill in the information the story will
be added to your time line and it will
show up in your recent activity at the
top but what if you want to hide some
events from your timeline
you might be embarrassed or regretful
about things you post it in the past but
luckily you can hide them the easiest
way to hide old posts is by going to
view activity at the top here you'll see
a simplified version of your timeline
which you can filter by type once you
find the post you want to remove click
the arrow next to the story and you'll
see many privacy options you can hide it
from your timeline change the privacy
settings or delete the post entirely
which means it's never coming back if
you have a lot of old pose you would
rather hide this process might take a
while but at least you only have to do
it once once you've added and removed
posts from your timeline you can start
featuring the ones you want to highlight
find the post you want to feature hover
over it and click the star to make it
full with too unfit for it just click
the star again when you've tweaked your
profile to your liking click the
Settings button here at the top and
select view as then enter any friends
named to see what it looks like to them
or click public to see what your
timeline looks like to everyone
including people who aren't your friends
I know this is a big change so if you
have any questions feel free to ask me
on Twitter or of course my facebook page
for see nut I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll
see you on the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
