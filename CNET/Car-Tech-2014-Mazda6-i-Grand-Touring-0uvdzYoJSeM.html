Hyundai and Kia took over the role as
alternatives to the hoary old trio of
Camry accord and fusion now they've got
more than kim jong on to keep them awake
at night because the mazda6 is back and
gunning for them let's find out how well
it's doing as we check out this 2014
Mazda 6 hi Grand Touring and check the
tech
now right off the bat you can see Mazda
tore everything up and started over
again look at this car I mean it used to
be in a perennial race with Camry to be
the car you least wanted to be seen in
now it's entirely the opposite they D
goof aside the face and got rid of that
dopey Pixar grin that all the other
Mazdas are still stuck with this is a
handsome car I see this metamorphosis a
lot like what happened with the recent
Ford Fusion redo except this car stays
hot all the way around the rear where
the fusion kind of gets a little lumpy
around the pipe
as with the exterior Mazda blessedly
threw out everything on the interior
their cars used to look like they had a
majority stake and recycled plastics
factory now you've got great materials
at least on this Grand Touring one first
off the navigation right here under a
very simple nav button you get two
TomTom powered nap one of things I like
about it is simplicity if you get stuck
or lost you're not a techie all you got
to do is stab at the screen and up comes
the home menu to do simple things that's
part of the TomTom DNA right there from
there if you're a TomTom user this is
gonna look really familiar to you and
there are tens of millions of them out
there maybe hundreds of millions I don't
know but it's a damn popular platform so
this will not require learning for a lot
of folks who buy this car and if you
don't want to poke through an interestin
ation through the touchscreen then it's
generally pretty responsive you can also
use this controller this is kind of a
take off from the iDrive controller and
then it has a lot of shortcut buttons
around it that's a page they've taken
from BMW along with turn kick and push
pandora's built in at this trim level as
well it's one of the best I've used also
in that it completely works without any
fussing once you pair the phone for
Bluetooth hands-free Pandora is up and
running period now we have SMS text
message handling in this head unit as
well it's a mixed bag you'll see I'm
gonna get a big sort of interruption
screen it says a message has arrived
doesn't tell me who it's from or
anything more about it but I have to
decide to download it or not shouldn't
it automatically be reflected in the
head unit I mean it's connected by the
way this typically is where it really
falls down I did a bunch of tests with
text messages it took eighteen to twenty
seconds on average for the text to
download it's already on my phones
you're telling me it takes that long for
that SMS to go from here to here then I
get this very long download completed
screen that I can't interrupt barely and
then I can finally read this thing
now once you get it you can reply with
canned responses only there is no sort
of voice dictation freeform reply which
also limits the system it blocks out
reading while you're driving that's why
you have text-to-speech message
seriously that is of M AGP a6 it's only
a little ironic that the car can't read
its own brand name and has to spell that
out
now before I tell you about the engine
this car let me tell you about Mazdas
family of engine technologies because
they go by the name SKYACTIV which
doesn't tell you anything about them
it's one of the worst engine brands I've
ever heard of here's what it consists of
though first of all very high
compression thirteen to one which gets a
lot of power out of a given amount of
fuel the downside is it always wants to
predetonate a spark not basically to
manage that they've got several
technologies including a four to one
exhaust manifold and outlet that they
say draws heat away from the engine
faster combating predetonation and
they've got a proprietary piston design
here it's basically a piston with a big
old well drilled in the top in the
middle of it which they say is a key
combustion technology to managing that
high ratio of compression and finally
there's a regenerative braking
technology called e I loop or some
nonsense another horrible branding
exercise what it does is regenerative Li
gather energy from braking which a lot
of cars do but instead of putting it
into a battery or the service battery it
puts it into a giant capacitor that is
used to run the onboard systems in the
cabin okay that plus they say an
advanced transmission they're all
advanced these days is SKYACTIV two and
a half liters sidesaddle inline for
direct injection like a lot of motors
have these days beyond that nothing
fancy like turbos or anything else going
on here it's naturally aspirated 184
horsepower 185 foot-pounds of torque
moves this 3,200 pound car to 60 in
seven seven seven point eight seconds
somewhere in there and you're gonna get
26 38 mpg unless you get the manual
transmission only available on the
bottom trim car by the way and that
drops your 1 mpg city and highway not a
big deal
notice the engine I noticed the
transmission I was sure it was a CVT a
continuously variable transmission it's
not it's a six-speed automatic and
that's no compliments but that's how
kind of vague and almost slippery I find
this transmission I'm not sure if it's
the gearbox or if it's the way that the
programming is operating power flow to
it but either way it's not a real well
engaged feeling it always feels kind of
rubber banding so once you get through
all that how's the engine
it's nothing notable I don't know if
it's the transmission getting in the way
or not but there's no urgency on this
engine it doesn't mean it's not adequate
but there's no urgency there's no real
kind of you know cutting thrust in there
it's very three numb in some aspects
none of which is to say this is not a
fun car to live with as much that's not
a fun car to drive you know the
difference I mean one is about driving
lean forward the other one is about
using the car everyday real good in the
latter not so much in the former
okay they said it's the mazda6 I Grand
Touring and that's probably the right
model I'd go with to go CNET style
here's how I'd set it up start with that
top trim car it's thirty thousand six
delivered then there's an option for
nine hundred bucks to get adaptive
cruise control which we have here and
forward collision warning tech kind of
the same technology doing different
things I'd roll that in as well
bottom line this is now the most
incredibly competitive sector in auto
dumb you've got Hyundai Ford Kia Chevy
Toyota Honda these guys all offering
outstanding cars that all look good I
don't envy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
