doesn't hold back with emojis I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google really wants you to use
its google plus social network trying to
become a new version of facebook didn't
stick so now Google is trying to become
a new version of Pinterest Google just
launched something called collections
and it's the exact same concept as a
Pinterest page you create a topic for a
group of links and photos and you can
share that with others Pinterest is huge
right now it's valued at 11 billion
dollars and it's a great place to find
random inspiration for projects parties
fashion or dinner but I don't think
you'll find people using google
collections in the same way as Pinterest
you see google's tied to your real name
and it can be pulled up on a Google
search so people seem to be using
collections in a professional way such
as making a collection of their own work
as an artist and Pinterest is making
changes of its own it's allowing
developers to make apps that connect
with pins so maybe there'll be an app
for ordering ingredients inside of a
recipe pen or book a trip based on a pin
about travel with 50 billion pins on the
site there's an opportunity to make some
money here let's switch gears to talk
about video streaming and a new feature
on Comcast smartphones make it easy to
hold the live video call with anyone
anywhere provided the person uses the
same phone or application you do but
what if you could stream a live video
feed on your phone and have it show up
on someone's living room television
that's what comcast is doing with
xfinity share use an xfinity app to
broadcast a video to your home TV or to
another comcast customer TV as long as
you both have a certain set top box so
if the grandparents can't come to the
birthday party they can watch a live
feed on TV and as for streaming at
39,000 feet amazon prime video is coming
to jetblue flights later this year
Amazon's making its TV shows movies
music and digital books available to sub
jetblue flights and it'll be free
unlimited for amazon prime members
here's the kick normally you have to pay
for internet access on a flight to
stream video but JetBlue won't charge
for internet
when you stream amazon and in other very
important texting news microsoft is
giving us all the middle finger the
middle finger emoji icon that is you may
not be aware but the group that creates
the emoji font has created several new
designs that have not yet been adopted
by iPhones and Android phones one of
such is a hand with an extended middle
finger but Microsoft has come to our
rescue and will offer the one fingered
salute as a choice on Windows 10
arriving later this year you also get a
few others like a person making an okay
gesture and a flushed face Thank You
Microsoft for the courage to set the
bird free that's your tech news update
you can head over to cnet.com for more
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
