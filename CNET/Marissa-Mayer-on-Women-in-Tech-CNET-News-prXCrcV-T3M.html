technology via the founder being an
executive you think it's incredibly
exciting time and technology in general
especially with the rise of mobile and I
just think that it's a really fast
moving industry but I think that's
something that makes it possible for
women to move fast catch up now you can
actually come into computer science late
like I didn't really get into computers
and technology until I was in college
but you know because it is a fast moving
industry it's an easy place for you to
pick things up a lot of the studies show
that women hesitate to get in technology
or computer science because they think
there's a certain culture right you know
that you know you you know can't dress
tonight you stay up all night you you
know eat espresso you know beans covered
you where's on whenever I know and I
think it's more about seeing there's all
kinds of different women who can do this
you can wear ruffles right you can be a
jock and you can still be a great
computer scientist or a great
technologist or a great product designer
and by seeing many different people who
can all do it on their own terms you
realize that you can do it on your own
terms that you don't need to conform to
that stereotype and to that culture that
you can bring with what you have to
offer the table right now is a great
time do you women in tech but there's
not enough women in tech right but I
worry that a lot of times the
conversation gets really focused on what
percentage of the pie is women right and
the truth is the pie isn't big enough
right we're not producing enough
computer scientists we're not producing
enough product designers we need a lot
more people to keep up with all of these
gadgets all this technology all these
possibilities the jobs of the future we
really need a lot more people interested
in mobile technology in computers right
we need a lot more people and if we grow
that number the number of women will by
its very nature go up right the
statistics are things like for the
advanced placement exam 200,000 students
a year take cut the calculus exam only
14,000 take the computer science exam so
7% of the kids who think they're good at
math go take both the math exam
and the computer science exam but if you
talk to Google engineers they'd actually
done studies only 2% of Google engineers
weren't exposed to computer science in
high school which means if you graduate
from high school and you haven't been
exposed to computer science the odds
that you're going to end up being an
engineer somewhere are incredibly low so
we really just need to get that number
up right imagine if we had 200,000 or
500,000 students graduating from high
school every year that we're taking
computer science as well as calculus as
opposed to just having personnel when
you look at really successful people you
often hear stories of people who just
worked 80 100 hour weeks for decades on
end like look at people like Winston
Churchill or Einstein right like they
and you're like how did they do that
but I really think that you know a lot
of you think about burnout being related
to not getting 8 hours of sleep a night
or not having time with the family or
not getting three meals a day and I
don't think eyes anything to do with
those things does for some people but it
really is is what causes resent and what
causes burnout is resentment is that
feeling of I worked 80 hours last week
and I had an eye but had to blow off my
friends or you know I worked 100 hours
last week and I missed the soccer game
right and then that feeling of
resentment kind of builds on you and
makes you feel like well I won't I won't
do that this week and so I think that
one of the exercises I've done with my
team and for myself is what is it that
you need in order to not be resentful
and I've done this exercise a few times
there was a young guy in my team where I
was worried he was working really hard
and I said you know take a month really
think about while you're working what is
it that you need in order to not be
resentful and it came back to me a month
later and he said Tuesday night dinners
tourney he had just graduated in school
and the whole friendship group would
kind of do this potluck on Tuesday
nights and he said like how much is a
nativity said well know too late dinner
as we'd all do this potluck and if I
have to if I have to you know skip it
when it says someone else's house and
not see them or even worse buy it to
cancel it when it's at my house because
something comes up on Tuesday night
I'm just resentful the whole rest of
week I just feel
like no I did all this work and I
couldn't even get to Tuesday night
dinner I said okay then let's just never
miss another Tuesday night dinner now is
my job to help make sure that doesn't
happen
I had Katie a soccer mom who was really
worried about her her team on Google
Finance was in Bangalore she kept doing
video conference calls at 1:00 in the
morning and I was like Kati you've got
three kids 222 and more twins like you
know I'm really worried all these 1 a.m.
conference calls she's gone but she
managed said don't worry about the damn
conference calls they really don't
bother me she's like what does bother me
is missing the soccer game or being 10
minutes late for the recital and walking
in in the middle and I said okay well
then my job is to make sure that you
never missed something for your kids and
it was actually really interesting to go
through that process because there be
days when we be sitting there in that
meeting at like 335 and I know that
Katie had to be out of there for that 4
o'clock game and he would be like well
okay we get up to go me we'll be like oh
just just five more minutes
just fine we're almost there like you
know even let's just let's just finish
this with power through and I'd have to
say no Katie's got to go like we can't
we can get this back together again
tomorrow and I think that really matters
and you know I think it also changes for
people throughout their life I don't
have kids right now for me it's travel
right once every say four months six
months I like to go somewhere I've never
been and also have the benefit of being
out of the office for an entire week
missing every standing meeting once you
know my team understands I'd like you
know the world doesn't end when I'm not
there
I understand the world doesn't end when
I'm out there and it's just really very
it doesn't provide a lot of sanity and I
think that that will change over time
but it's really about thinking about
what is it that you need so you don't
hit that resentful point for a lot of
people that is a good night's sleep no
time with the family a few good meals a
day but you know sometimes it's
something that's just really personal
and really basic and it's about really
tapping into
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
