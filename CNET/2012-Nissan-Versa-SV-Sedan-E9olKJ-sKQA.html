pure Drive you're damn right it is
because this car doesn't do really much
of anything else but that's its mission
let's drive the 2012 Nissan Versa sv
sedan and check the damn near total lack
of tech now bear in mind before you go
be a big smartass and tell all your
friends you bought the cheapest car you
could get realize it if you do that
you're going to get up a few things like
power locks power windows wheels well I
think it comes to the last part there no
map light I mean nothing this cars a
real stripper instead we've got the SV
which is the middle one which is kind of
a more reasonable buy more up to like
closer to 15 grand now the head unit is
base am/fm CD with speakers go with the
convenience package for a silly 350
bucks and you're going to get an mp3
compatible CD reader interestingly
enough an iPod connection with this
proprietary cable but no USB and you're
also going to get steering wheel mounted
controls all bunch of them up here so
you ask where is the navigation not
available in this or the base trim level
you got to go up to what they call the
SL when you can option it for an
embarrassingly cheap 750 the tech
package which would get you GPS Navi
XM radio XM Nav traffic a USB jack also
for a whole variety of portables or
thumb drives with this single line
display scrolling your ipod is a bit
like cryptography take some math classes
okay more than once I've told you about
car makers taking engines making them
smaller and getting more power out over
this is not one of those stories this
engine is smaller and with less power
1.6 liter sidesaddle inline 4 they had a
1.8 in the last generation versa and the
horse powers come down at a dozen or so
109 horse 107 foot-pounds of torque it's
this very light 2,400 pound car up to
sixty eventually 10.2 seconds but that
isn't the point of this vehicle mpg is
and that's where it shines
30:38 this fuel door and hood release
are right next to each other invisible
and require about the same effort yeah
popping both open at once that won't get
old one of the saving graces in this car
is Nissan's
expertise doing CVTs continuously
variable transmissions I don't think
anybody consistently does them well like
this company CVT is tend to be a slip
box
they're always spooling and the ribs are
all over the place and the power arrives
sometime tomorrow around lunch but these
have enough grip while at the same time
not having any real gears that's what a
CVT it has got belts and pulleys
relationship all the time and that's a
key thing to make this cars power always
on cam it's got a very limited power
band I'm sure but at the same time not
feel like it's looking for grip the ride
quality is actually far short of harsh
it's bouncy but it's not harsh that's a
key difference in making a cheap car
feel a little bit less than cheap the
thing I look forward to the day I bought
one of these is wearing out the tires
which I bet with a car this light will
like never happen but when it does I'm
putting on some wider boots this car is
going to handle a lot better
did you see the tires on this guy I mean
they're like that one that's part of the
mpg formula in this car but I will shave
off a fraction of an mpg or so to get
better grip and the part of a cheap car
you look at everyday is not the outside
others will sneer at you for that but
right here the center stack and the
gauges and look how nicely done these
are as limited as they are in terms of
Technology that's a good-looking
instrument panel and center console now
and that helps to make the car feel less
cheap living with a day-to-day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
