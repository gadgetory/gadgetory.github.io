with President Donald Trump leading tech
companies such as Apple Google Microsoft
and Facebook are among the 97 businesses
that joined forces to file a legal brief
against Trump's immigration ban arguing
that the executive order is unlawful the
order prohibits citizens of seven
predominantly Muslim countries from
entering the US for 90 days the
administration says it crafted it with
the intention to prevent terrorists from
entering the country but leading
technology companies argue in the legal
brief that the order violates
immigration laws and the Constitution
the brief also states that the order is
discriminatory and that it would hurt
their businesses by making it more
difficult to recruit talent and compete
in the global market and in effect it
would encourage companies to expand
operations outside of the United States
the amicus brief was filed Sunday
evening in the 9th US Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco it was done in
support of a lawsuit first filed last
week by the Washington State Attorney
General most of the 97 businesses in the
filing our tech companies including
Airbnb eBay linkedin lyft uber Twitter
Yelp reddit Salesforce Spotify intelli
Netflix that's just to name a few but it
also includes some companies outside of
tech like jeans manufacturer Levi
Strauss and yogurt maker chobani having
nearly a hundred companies work together
to speak with one voice in a single
legal statement is quite out of the
ordinary but these are not ordinary
times the contentious policy came within
Trump's first two weeks in office and it
led to a week of protests across the
nation the order also impacted many
employees of these tech companies Google
alone had over a hundred and eighty
employees affected on Friday a federal
judge in Seattle put a temporary block
on the travel ban order the trump
administration has a Monday deadline to
justify the order and the court will
consider the legal brief filed from
these tech companies as it also
considers Trump's arguments to reinstate
the band I'm Bridget Carey you can keep
