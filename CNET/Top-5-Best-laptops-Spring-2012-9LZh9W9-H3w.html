days around portable computers centers
on ultrabooks
that would be the MacBook Air and all
those Windows machines that want to be a
MacBook Air but I've got a sneaking
suspicion you might just be part of that
silent majority who just wants a good
laptop not a little skinny thing or a
wimpy little netbook you don't mind
handling a little luggage for a machine
that could really get the job done I'm
here to help
I'm Brian Cooley with just what you're
looking for the top five laptops that do
it all and do it well number five the
samsung series 9 this guy's fresh out of
the gate we just reviewed it look how
sleek and thin it is kind of Ultrabook
like but it's still got a generously
large screen that makes it look even
sleeker and thinner great to carry if
you like attention from hipsters who
ironic beards this one's got big buzz
around it but for the $1500 price it's
basically a little larger version of the
much cheaper 13-inch cousin and for that
price they should have found a way to
wedge in HDMI and Ethernet without using
dongles that are bulkier than the
computer itself number four the HP
Pavilion dm4 39d beats Edition here's a
14 inch laptop it's got one of those
cool hybrid hard drives part rotating
part solid-state a great matte finish
display you don't see that many of those
and a red backlit keyboard I could live
without the built-in subwoofer as part
of what makes it a beats Edition however
if you're looking at this one you need
to also look at the not much more money
HP Envy which we will do in just a
minute
number three is the samsung series 7
here's a 15-inch model that lets you
exit plastic land thank you it's got a
metal chassis a thin screen bezel great
power a good battery life dedicated
graphics all that rolls up to remind you
why you spent 1300 bucks on a laptop
about all we can find and gripe about on
this one is the lack of blu-ray drive
and the screen cannot show full res
1080p display which would make this kind
of a good value in a home theater to go
number two is the HP
b15 seriously I don't know why Apple
hasn't sued HP over this one see what I
mean it looks just like a MacBook slap
an apple sticker on the lid and a smug
look on your face and people will think
you're rolling Cupertino style from five
feet away beyond looks this is a great
performing 15-inch for about eleven
hundred lists and seriousness is
important it's got a little wheel for
the volume control you won't know how
much you've missed that until you try it
okay our number one laptop these days is
the Apple MacBook Pro yeah still I guess
it's only fitting that the one machine
that tops that HP we just saw is the one
that a Texan looks like the MacBook Pro
15 inch with a 2.4 gig quad-core i7 CPU
and dedicated AMD graphics is serious
this is that rare laptop on which you
can edit video and not watch your
grandkids grow up and go to college
while things render the touchpad still
feels like Apple has a patent on the
whole idea and seven hour battery life
that's coast to coast and a little bit
more now at 2200 bucks the way we
reviewed it it's not cheap and the
upgrades they go north from there and
annoyingly HDMI and built-in blu-ray
cannot be among them those are the best
laptops we like right now but this
market changes all the time folks if
you're looking for one make sure you go
