everything google that we can pack
inside of a show right off the top
Google i/o 2016 registration is now open
and will be held at the shoreline
amphitheater in Mountain View California
on May eighteenth nineteenth and
twentieth it's a more suburban business
office area instead of an awesome city
with tons of things to do like San
Francisco now it's nine hundred dollars
per ticket or three hundred if you're a
student so I suggest you sign up for one
credit of underwater basket weaving at
your local junior college like
immediately now once you register Google
will randomly select applicants to
invite to the show google i/o has always
been a showcase of the latest hardware
and software and we expect to see a
preview of Android n with its expected
May eighteenth release date after the
keynote now no one still really knows
what the N in Android stands for
typically flavors of Android have been
sweet treats so the end could stand for
nougat or Nutella I want to know what
you think and will read some of your
responses next week you can just tweet
me at Brian tongue or I'll dare to look
at the YouTube comments and see what you
all come up with all right the Samsung
Galaxy s7 reviews are out in its hands
down the best galaxy phone to date that
we've seen and arguably the best phone
on the market right now which it should
be it's getting great reviews for its
design it's big boy battery life and a
killer camera reviewers still complain
about TouchWiz which has become less
intrusive and some of the additional
carrier blow air but I'll wait to check
out the material design theme myself
before I dismiss the software now its
waterproofing as a standout as well and
youtuber jerry-rigged everything took
one apart to showcase what internals are
protected that allowed this phone the
last 30 minutes underwater at 1.5 meters
and people just love scene phones get
torn apart anyways alright the u.s. 7 is
a great boost for Android but Android
adoption to its latest operating system
is still very slow based on
manufacturers and carrier rollouts
marshmallow adoption almost doubled to
just two point three percent since last
month lollipop 5.1 5.1 makeup 36.1
percent while KitKat is at 34.3 now
marshmallow will get a big boost
the next few months with new phones
coming out that's where we tend to see
the biggest bump into adoption not from
carrier updates but new hardware
chromecast is making some good noise
according to strategy analytics Google
streaming dongle made up as much as
thirty five percent of the streaming
market in 2015 Bestine Roku Apple and
Amazon Apple TV still leads the pack in
total shipments at 37 million since 2007
but the chromecast is nearly 30 million
over just two and a half years see
digital streaming just keeps getting
bigger now more important than video
streaming Google's acquisition of
satellite imaging companies skybox from
a couple of years ago is now rebranding
itself as terra bella initially they
were proposed to help keep google maps
accurate with up-to-date imagery now
their goal is to pioneer the search for
patterns change in the physical world
using their satellite imagery the hope
is to help address global economic
environmental and humanitarian
challenges you know no big deal now more
than a dozen satellites are set to
launch by 2020 and I love seeing some of
Google's big ideas finally getting a
chance for practical use after the
economic times reports Google's Project
loon is in talks with India telcos to
launch a pilot program if you don't
remember a project loon is there
internet delivery balloon system that
now has their own auto launcher system
and can successfully deliver speeds up
15 megabits per second that's fast
enough for streaming video like your
favorite ones from cnet now the
government has been very supportive of
the technology but its deal with the
telcos will be necessary to make it
happen alright that's going to do it for
this week's show you can email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for some more of
that Google ishes
google Isha's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
