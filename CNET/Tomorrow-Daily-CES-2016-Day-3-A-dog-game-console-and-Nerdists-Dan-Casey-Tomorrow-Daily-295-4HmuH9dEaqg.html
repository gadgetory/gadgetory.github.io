demonstrates a dog gaming console we
also have a human being don't worry and
his name is Dan Casey he's from the
Nerdist and he's going to tell us some
of his favorites from the CES show floor
and he might also demonstrate a dog game
console daily
citizens of the Internet welcome to
tomorrow daily domestique talk show in
the known universe I'm Ashley 7 i'm jeff
cannata and you have a guest joining us
right at the top here yes will you
please tell everybody what you're clever
pet and pleased already who you are and
what you do there this is dan Knutson
the cofounders of clever pet i'm also
the CTO CSO clever pet now tell us what
the goal of clever pet is the goal of
clever pet is to give America's dogs who
spend a lot of time home alone one that
people go off to work something
meaningful and engaging to do all day
long all right so you have done
something very special for us here at
cnet stage we actually have a very
special guest Princess Fiona that's
right we'll be joining us uh so if we
could bring princess that's not just my
stage that is not just a stage name and
the name he gives the hotels when he
stays out that odd this is all gonna
just feel as adorable hi Frances Fiona
are so cute look how unhappy she has to
be left home alone like please note only
mean she wants something ain't fun and
engaging to do so uh we also have clever
pet we have the console right down here
and if you could walk us through how
exactly it works that would be great
yeah so what the console does is it
presents simple games two dogs using
lights and sounds it's got three light
up touch pads at the front and it's got
a speaker in the back so you can present
simple puzzles when dogs solve the
puzzles by pressing the right button at
the right time they get a bit of their
food for the day and it's connected to
Wi-Fi so you can keep track of how
they're doing all day long and we can we
can adjust a difficulty in real time and
you get adjust the difficulty like oh
that's right food yeah that's okay i've
been training animals for the last 13
years with computers and machines at
people in neuroscience and we're taking
the science of animal behavior and
bringing it into the home excellent okay
well let's uh can we can we test it out
this seems like a really smart dog I
don't know if this could work on a dog
life is amazing okay so so she so so
she's in a very simple game it starts
out very easy yeah and don't my
microphone just fell off here um it
starts out very easy and all she has to
do is express one of the lit up buttons
okay any of them will work any of them
will work at the references you could do
it
is already opened up know what you'll
see over time is as she gets a few right
the gamer get a little bit harder than
the only only be two lit up and she's
got a press with their nose alright is
there a boss battle we're working on
that are their dog raids cuz i have a
few dots yeah they come up and take on
for a better treat yes he says you know
me only two of them are lit up oh no she
pressed the middle one I do a flashing
one yeah on another one Princess Fiona
where's that food at oh gosh that's
great that's so great so is there a
danger of my dog becoming too clever ah
well I don't know I mean I don't want my
I don't want a dog to be smarter than me
Oh video game I have enough problem with
the kids on league of legends maybe you
need a wing pup is Fiona will let you
will let you go back to the green room
and relax and we'll put roll bring the
clever pet right up here onto the onto
the desk so we can take a look at it oh
no no no I think sunny day she will be
Queen someday wait also cutest CES
attendee I think I can reasonably give
out that award uh Jeff I think I would
like you to try this okay but I think we
need to give you a dog man alright well
that seems only fair right um don't
Britain you have a theater your majored
in theater so I need you off some masks
work I need you to and use my proudest
moment by the way channel a dog for me
up I proudest on it pretend you're
pretend you're your dog honor dad this
is what I do for a living dogs don't doc
are you ready yeah all right okay so
it's gonna flash you okay so it these
flash yeah that's right as you're harder
less fun mm-hmm that's right mm-hmm I
know you get I Tragon I gotta eat it I'm
not gonna eat that is um I felt what it
was like to be a dog it's me your dog in
fact um this is cool this garden is a
crowd fund right yeah that's right we
did a Kickstarter yes so we had a
thousand backers just under a thousand
backers sign up to get one of these and
we've opened pre-orders just during CES
so you get them through tomorrow at our
website oh so is the idea that we're
going to be sitting at work with a
little webcam watching the dog play
video games uh yeah some people want to
play like that so
we have a mobile app so you can check in
and see how your dog is doing we'll
update that with how much they've eaten
when they level up and I leveling up
yeah dogs the dogs will rule us all
Jagran soon my dog will be able to play
fallout for me just let me know how it
went oh my god to be a cleric yes uh so
it any other levels of complexity it's
pushing light it so it starts really
simple like this to get them to
understand how to use a game you know we
know how to use keyboards and pens and
pencils but dogs don't understand what a
button is so the first thing you have to
do is teach them that from there we can
do things like pattern games so my dog
Artie plays pattern games he can press
blue yellow white in a row my dog pool
and we'll never figure that out I bet
they would we got your daughter together
as idiots so there that's unloving
through nickname we called it whether
Italian Greyhounds don't call them
idiots uh I'm sorry everybody but the
little offensive but they are not bright
they are not bright animals and so I
were I worry about buying this and
having them just stare at it in bart i
bet that they're more clever than you
think if they like food this thing
starts out very simply just by giving
them food for free if my dogs are in
fact too dumb to use this does clever
pet offer a refund yes double-checking
frenched uh yeah right dog just fellow
I'm sorry so hungry I could figure out
the video came from inside of starvation
but it won't happen we haven't we
haven't found a dog yet and we've been
looking yeah so so have you seen
measurable increases in chug
intelligence capability I'm a scientist
so I don't like to claim things before I
have enough evidence to prove that so
I'm really hoping we'll be able to find
that and say definitively but we have
seen definite behavioral changes in dogs
what happens is dogs get home left home
alone and in the best case they just
sleep all day I'm not doing anything and
they have all this pent-up energy right
in the worst case they'll turn the
energy onto the couch or worst cases
they do what my dog does I gave you take
ins who dug a hole in our mattress life
yeah exactly exactly so they have they
have all this energy and I want to use
it they they evolved alongside us to
have jobs so we want to put them back to
work and make sure they can use that
mental and
and engaging in a meaningful way to them
awesome so pre-orders are open now my
next question is what's the next
evolution of this is it self
programmable where I can program my
voice in here to say who's a good boy
then I want to be safe I am and then it
just hits that one only sure we could do
that all right that would be great I
think I've you're afraid thank you so
much uh-oh thank you so much for this we
are gonna take a very quick break and
then we'll be right back with Nerdist
dan Casey to discuss some of the weirder
tech at CES 2016 so stick around don't
click away it's tomorrow Daily Show
everybody we we do McRaven Casey who's
looking very dapper yeah I'm the Nerdist
dan you've been here at CES all week as
well I've been in the thick of it yeah
every Hall you think is it it's pretty
thick out there I have to say yeah I
don't know the scientific word for it
but I've never seen this many people
centered in one place I thought like
comic-con was a lot but this ya know
this is sprawling yeah yes to it was a
hundred and seventy thousand people
through the doors not any given hi gosh
that explains my thickness yeah exactly
yeah so you've seen some some cool stuff
I have some weird stuff I have what
stuff would you like to talk I'd like to
talk first of all this is definitely the
coolest thing I've seen so far it is a
3d printed jetpack air once airwolf
airwolf and jetpack aviation have made a
married eprint of jet pack previously
this cost about twelve thousand dollars
to make earlier this year the bureau
you're seeing right now is they flew it
around the statue of liberty for people
that think that manufactured jet packs
are too safe this exactly that and this
is yummy differently yourself this is an
actual jet actually ones jet turbines
like water like you've seen some other
places and this is really cool he's with
the 3d printing it only costs about four
hundred dollars to manufacture Wow
affordable for you yeah that's less than
the oculus I just bought this dick that
next year we might be able to buy a jet
pack or a hollow lens for about the same
price these might these are my squad
goals of tomorrow daily that we can all
just get on jet pack
seen a lot of 3d printed stuff here at
the show and most of it is snapped
together plastic so that's what I'm
imagining this jetpack is yeah some guy
like napping it together pretty much
it's eight separate fabricated pieces at
the end snap together and then you can
strap to your bag the foil inside
exactly yeah they've only flown over the
sea so far they were very specific about
that piece of info it seems like if that
seems like a great safety a safety
choice yeah fire for something that will
not actually liquefy me at my way yeah
you don't get a sidewalk Jackson Pollock
you ramp up to that definitely don't
want to do that uh so I saw and I've
been checking out of the e Hong 184 I
went and looked at that last night yeah
it is a one seater autonomous drone yeah
we talked about this a little yesterday
this is uh this is nuts I think a
one-seater drone is called a personal
helicopter is it not I would imagine
what it's kind of a personal helicopter
but a helicopter implies that you have
some control over what's going on this
is a robit' flying you around yeah this
is a robot that ok so the idea is if you
haven't seen it's right here in South
Hall you guys should go check it out by
oculus you get in there's a tablet
inside the cockpit you tap where you
want to go and this thing takes off
vertically takes you where you want to
go short range you got like 23 minutes
of battery life and then it lands and
there you're good there's no you won't
and their goal is you don't need a
pilot's license no pilots license
required you just get a tap you're gonna
go goodness yeah yeah finally something
I can fly that I don't eat a silly
license for idolatry long as it's 23
minutes away I am golden but 23 minutes
as the crow flies as the drone fly so
you can get kind of far in LA I feel
like you get pretty far in a way I don't
it's really neat and there and they said
they didn't want to make it a
billionaire estoy so they're trying to
make this a millionaire toy well I so
that was my joke I was like oh
millionaires toy them but two hundred
thousand bucks that was like the goal so
a couple of Tesla's exactly for a
personal drone that's not that bad it's
a tricky exactly its all-electric they
said that it they really say they feel
it's safe they just need to get all of
the regulations obviously yeah and they
want to have enough people on them door
they can have regional command centers
where somebody watches almost like air
traffic control let's talk to me what I
can snap it together oh yeah that's why
it's like a 3d printed I saw something
cool today
talk about is the glyph this is a pair
of earphones that you listen to your
music you just got good sound quality
and then let's say you want to watch
some video or something like do yeah but
I don't want to use my stupid phone
screen no flip it down boom Geordi
LaForge Geordi LaForge it like it's got
look it's got uh I pieces here and not
screens you're not looking at screens
here's the inside your it's actually
using thousands of tiny mirrors to
project the image to your eyeballs
really so fix it in your eyes so the
result is a much higher looking
resolution because you're not actually
looking at pixels there's no screen door
effect there's none of that uh and look
how r at Sheila's random lessly
integrated with your outfit or I feel
very future estas alia doing that I
might think that they had a problem with
their earphones but I think you're
wearing those incorrectly sir yeah how
did you fall asleep so forward but you
know I tried it and the the visual
quality it does 3d it does head tracking
to season like stereoscopic 3d years and
uh I don't know maybe it looks good you
watch the news I think we have Baba got
here yes stereoscopic yes yes alright i
watch was watching part of the avengers
in 3d on it who and and then you can
also do a head dragging so you can see
3d stuff it'll search right from your
cell phone or from a computer so well
one of those 360 360 videos 360 stuff
and then check things out that's awesome
uh but def yeah our producer just said
not not not porn we got skill of course
whenever he's doing there no no i'd only
want things with VR 3ds story yeah oh
yeah we are very important about story
here on tomorrow um we also jeff was
brave enough to get into the intel sleep
pie I got the sleep pod what happened
inside its Stygian depth oh well I went
to the Year 2247 mine then I came back
okay back up time no this is a an
egg-like device there's me getting into
it there is an egg-like device where you
you sit in it and then they close you
off you wear the headphones and they
measure your heart rate it dropped my
heart rate by like 10 to 15 I was 86
when I got in 70
one when I got really uh it is um it's
comforting but I just question about
like you were laying down so isn't that
sort of that's still friend pretty much
says it all as like I feel like I would
have the opposite effect like my heart
rate would double because I'm trapped in
this sleep egg for effort yes iPods not
for class sure if I was like is there a
sensor that detects abject terror
because that's what I was um it just
seems like an overkill like literally
just find a dark place and lay down man
I don't know I wanna if it was a sensory
deprivation pod I would be in too bad
where it's like just totally closes you
off from the sounds of the show I
thought that would have been really I
like it cuz it reminds me of the chairs
from men in black which I've always
wanted yeah it's chairs yeah exactly uh
was another thing that we saw you know I
as we stop by there but is actually got
to wear the suit I believe yesterday we
got to see the applied minds exoskeleton
it simulates aging this is really weird
it's also here right here in south hall
by uh by interesting enough like I think
it's upstairs way in the back it's an
exoskeleton that you wear in a suit so
here's the genworth aging suit this is I
as wearing it and as you're walking it
can actually limit and restrict your
mobility so that you feel older and it's
got a bunch of our metric do yes you're
in there well so the idea okay wait so
we should explain what the goal of this
is cuz it seems a little weird I'm gonna
buy a suit that ages me to 100 years old
goal is to make you feel entropy as it's
happening helping of cosplay as my
grandparents cosplays your grandpa it's
exactly right that's your uh that's rude
comic-con cost exactly grandpa where's
grandpa the idea is generous wants to
take this on the road in a tour to
universities and differently no labs
things like that and they want to teach
people empathy or the elderly so that
when they care for them they can sort of
get a better understanding of what you
know and the experience at the end of
the experience a large speaker just
shouts call your grandma yeah yeah
exactly it's like that they're really on
a sweater and anything else we got
school uh one thing that I saw its I
might be butchering the name sensa diet
it's an alarm clock that used it
releases sense to wake you up so you can
get like cocoa or peppermint to
gradually ease you into the morning
which I find a
civ on a personal level because I do not
have a sense of smell so I'm going to be
late for all of my appointments what are
they gonna solve that tech pro do not
have a sense of smell legitimately no
you have no sense of smell no where's my
handicap parking sticker I had to walk
all the way across the parking lot to
get here it's unfair can I just say are
all your other senses more heightened I
can jump ten feet vertically daredevil
with your note yeah what daredevil but a
thousand times water smell devil or
something yeah it's oh okay you're
actually pretty lucky because you can't
smell the people in the show oh I
thought you're gonna say because you're
sitting so close to Jeff right now oh
yeah that too yeah I'm smell terrible
I'm sure you have a delightful massa I'm
really shocked by this so this is uh
this is the sensor way okk yeah Lexi was
checking this out earlier in the week
there's there's so much weird stuff over
a tech West if you everybody in the
audience we have a major way over to
check West highly recommended there's 3d
printing and robots and just the most
random stuff you could ever imagine but
keep in mind that a few years ago GoPro
was just the founder with a tiny little
camera just asked in a stall just asking
feel like will you please check out my
action camera now they have a booth
after install 10 rewrite that size yeah
exactly just those little tiny stalls
and now it's this huge thing last year i
think that BMX riders and stuff so you
never know what's gonna be big in a
couple years at CES that you saw maybe
maybe he'll be generally big deal
definitely worth taking a stroll through
there to see some of the cooler weird or
smaller things yeah checking out one
booth and I turned around cuz I heard a
little voice it was this tiny vacuum
robot that started following me and
talking to me I thought it was a bit at
first but it was asking me more and more
questions it was too much pressure for
me so I walked away wow what it what do
you believe its mission was I don't know
what his mission was but I think it's up
to no good definitely working with the
first order you're not trust vacuum
robots at this show yes I said if he'd
had a sense of smell he would have noted
right there early I know I would have
smelled fear okay Barry I will ask you
this what is the one thing tacit why's
it doesn't have to be a specific product
what's the one thing you've seen at the
show where you're like that is a hundred
percent pointless a hoe not enough for
you like obviously an alarm clock with
smell as that totally play yeah
for every but what's the Thunder
pointless uh there I saw it was a robot
that just cleans your grill that's it
like you can do that with a spatula no
not Paul Wall style like your barbecue
grill ah uh just like that was the first
one came to mind it just seems like you
don't need to have a smart grill you're
just believe in yourself you're already
pretty smart like do it just take your
spatula take the little brush just five
minutes after you're done that's it yeah
but have you considered armed that helps
me clean the grill like I don't get
tired like but then i'm just gonna
atrophy in ways yeah exactly and then
i'll be just like that XO squirt
simulates aging i'll be a hundred years
it'll be like in wallyworld rolling
around in those face chairs listen i
will all have retained grills to get my
cupcake in a cup I ain't girls that is
my goal in life okay so tell us a little
bit about what you do over at Nerdist
for those of you who are not familiar
with Dan cases work Dan works for
Nerdist he does a lot of actually you're
not really a tech guy so much as you are
movies TV like pop pop I cover a little
bit of everything I'm a jack of all
trades master of none i cover TV comics
music science we have special people
people are more specialized like kyolic
cover science matt grows near covers
music like 40 covers games i get to do a
little bit of everything which is
awesome because i get to see the holes
broad spectrum of nerdom i'm the senior
editor over there so i cover a little
bit everything we try to keep it
positive host a weekly pop culture deep
dive called the Dan cave written a
couple books can check those out online
so yeah it's fun i just get to nerd out
talk about things I'm passionate about
with people who are passionate about
those same things what do you think is
going to be the biggest trend out of the
show this year the biggest trend out of
the show this year i think is probably
going to be I want us it's I'm torn
between drone technology like every like
every one of their mother has a drone to
show off and I think autonomous vehicles
I think that is something we're going to
see more and more of a special to
Detroit Auto Show right around the
corner and I think that's something that
they're really gonna be pushing for
going forward are you ready to be in an
autonomous vehicle you trust it or do
you r us Cano I think all I think about
every time is that scene Total Recall
the Johnny cabs once things go awry I am
not ready to let a robot takeover the
wii
I have to do is pull the head off
exactly yeah no they're poorly
manufactured I love it okay so how can
we find you online we're gonna wrap the
show up and then we got to go check out
as you mentioned my mom is showing off a
droning I'm just joking actually but uh
yeah we're gonna go check out some of
the show so tell everybody where they
can find you and Nerdist online it's
pretty easy for ya exactly you can find
all the stuff I write about at
nerdist.com you can find me on the world
wide web at osteo ferocious dan Casey
was taken I always wondered about that
happen after we wrap here we're gonna
have a very long conversation about what
life has been like without the sense of
smell yeah I'm intrigued that is a
nutrient versation we should i wish i
would have known that three days ago we
all have dinner together okay so that is
it for our see our CES coverage at
tomorrow daily oh I've been awesome it's
been amazing thank you for sharing the
field of battle with me though oh thank
you monkey writing the best uh we are
gonna be back on the cnet live stage not
us specifically but seeing that will be
back for CES coverage at two o'clock
