business you always hear about f-150 and
Camry and Accord but there's another one
I'm gonna point out to you that I'm in
it right now Honda CRV it's the rock
star of a category full of rock stars
but it just got a facelift let's find
out what they did when they tampered
with success as we drive 215 CRV touring
all-wheel drive and check the tech so
far in 2015 the CRV is running
comfortably ahead of a very tough feel
like the hard to beat rav4 that invented
the category Nissan's resurgent Road and
the ever-popular Ford Escape now as you
can see to be sure they didn't do major
surgery on this latest CRV but enough to
make its potable take a look at the
front face it no longer has these kind
of fussy 3 chrome bars of the outgoing
model now it looks more like a Civic and
it's a little more aggressive or sporty
looking out back they got rid of this
kind of goofy smile like feature line
straightened it out in general the car
looks a little more macho a little more
present now inside the CRV one of the
first things you'll notice is a new set
of head units that are the big 7-inch
touchscreen type this is the high-end
one in this vehicle I've never been a
big fan of Honda navigation as you know
it's a clunky interface it's kind of
poorly rendered since Honda locks out
lots of inputs while the car is moving
and has no control a knob or hand riding
pad yeah better love their voice wreck I
often don't go to nearest Chinese
restaurant hardened Yocum and basically
they can't put any bins in this car that
hold razor blades cyanide or a gun but
you use one or all three after you try
to figure out what mode you can be in to
issue what voice command GAC luckily
you've now got a new option at least on
your iOS device for 60 bucks you can
download and install this Honda link
navigation app which is cloud connected
you can enter addresses via voice here
in one phrase it's fundamentally better
than this you've also got a new AHA app
in here that runs from the phone shows
up on the dash as does the nav now to
get what's on the phone on the dash you
need to get a $100 cable kit that they
sell which is a combination of USB and
HDMI from your iOS device no Android yet
to get that on the screen that is a
horsey expensive mess but here's what
they call their amid their multi
information display this button on the
wheel takes you through a few helper
screens it allows you to split things up
put entertainment away up there while
you focus on nav down here is a common
scenario when it comes to your media
sources you've got the usuals plus nice
touches include Pandora integrated here
HD radio you now have two USB ports here
in the console and the uh nympho
tainment your drive controls in this
vehicle are going to be a one choice
only CVT gearbox you've got a sport mode
here as a gear position not as an
overall powertrain modifier there's no
sport button for example beyond that all
of this is nestled in one of the nicer
looking cabins in its class this is a
mature quality feel for not much money
and if you thought Mazda's SKYACTIV was
a stupid name for an engine try earth
dreams what does that mean well it means
different things in different Honda
engines in this one it means they've
introduced direct injection and reduce
the friction of the internal moving
parts the results are good 185
horsepower same as last year but it
comes at a lower rpm and 181 pound-feet
of torque that's 11% better than last
year while the mpg went up for City and
up three Highway that means 26 City 33
highway through this all-wheel-drive
powertrain with now a CVT continuously
variable transmission that's also new in
this year's CRV
now CRV is not a high-performance
vehicle power though is adequate I don't
have any problem with it and clearly
that additional torque and lower rpm
ceiling for max horsepower are helping
and an awful lot of a kind of a crappy
engine note coming through the engine
bay you know they supposedly put a lot
more sound insulation in they could add
some more to along with that rather
grading engine sound coming in is a
rather grading ride quality and it's
been improved they tell me from the last
generation but it could use some more
it's a nervous ride that can be
fatiguing you feel every crack in the
pavement unless the pavements really
nice this transmission the CVT I give a
lot of these knocks this is a real nice
one I didn't even know it was a CVT when
I first drove the car I always drive
these cars knowing nothing about them to
try and feel them without preconception
I thought this had a standard automatic
which is high praise for the CVT no
paddles or any other nonsense as I
showed you earlier it's a
straightforward drivetrain there's also
no settings for the all-wheel drive it's
just there and it's working now all new
on the CRV this time around our driver
assist technologies like lane keep
warning and active lane keep assist you
hit a button right here on the right
side of the wheel and this guy is gonna
steer itself within the lane lines and
it's actually really aggressive in fact
it's kind of earring to be driving the
car and feel how how hard it's pushing
the wheel when it wants to keep you in
the middle of the lane the various
adaptive Drive technologies take over in
a patchwork of speeds Lane cape tech
works from 45 to 90 miles an hour
forward collision braking up to about 62
miles an hour and adaptive cruise only
above 22 miles an hour so it can't
handle a really congested freeway mess
still this is a lot of pseudo
self-driving tech for an inexpensive
little compact crossover and one of the
most useful driver assist technologies
is this one I hit the right signal and
there's a camera over there on the right
hand mirror that gives me this excellent
view on the dash to see if I'm about to
cut off someone like a cyclist over
there or whatever is on my right side
that's one of the best visual
technologies in a car today I don't know
why no one else does it unless these
guys have it
the back our CRV is a touring model so
it's got just about all the bells and
whistles included bass that's about
thirty to five if you want
all-wheel-drive its 1250 more there are
a couple of dealer-installed options you
might want remote start and some rear
sonar to augment your rear camera all in
we're looking at about thirty four seven
is about as hard as you can push one of
these overall as you can see Honda has
not changed the mission or the role of
the CRV they just made it nicer all
around under the hood you're getting
better power and more mpg inside the
cabin a better attempt at cabin tech
though it's still a work in progress and
the adaptive driver assist tech is all
new in this vehicle if you like the CRV
before there's more to like about it now
it's basically grown up marketing more
realities of modern driving revealed now
