to require zero toothpaste you can now
virtually go inside your favorite
painting and Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse
Tyson want your money and we're gonna
tell you I tomorrow daily
rooting citizens of the internet welcome
to tomorrow daily the best scoop talk
show the known universe I'm Ashley a
skillet join these always on this lovely
tuesday kill not what a day what a
lovely day what a lovely day AZ now
alright I'll calm down some people
haven't seen madman the glory that is
mad max pretty sure Logan we're looking
at you through the glass that is covered
that you can't see us but um yeah it was
that it was good weekend we had some
great times kills kale celebrate his
birthday this last weekend it was
actually on Mother's Day but he was kind
enough to give that day to his mom to
enjoy and then actually just celebrating
this last week but ya know it was good I
survived it took all the recovery days
that I needed my black ready to do
whatever that is do we do ready to hit
it alright let's do that alright I gonna
I gotta tell you a little bit about
light sale so um I don't know if we've
talked about light sales specifically on
the show but uh there's no back at our
hack of this week we didn't have a show
yesterday so I figured I'd mentioned
this it's like a Kickstarter but also
pretty newsworthy uh bill nye who is the
CEO of the Planetary Society which is
the biggest I think non-government space
kind of exploration entity in the
country and board member Neil deGrasse
Tyson who we all know from cosmos the
new cosmos I they are kicking off this
Kickstarter to help fund light sale so
what light sale is is it's a it's an
idea that was made popular by carl sagan
he was on The Tonight Show with Johnny
Carson way back in the day like decades
ago here is and he's talking about what
exactly is this is 76 so this idea has
been around for a while it's actually
been around longer than this even it's
been around for about a hundred years
and the concept is is that you would
have this you'd have this sort of sale
made out of mylar the same stuff you see
like balloons made out of that sort of
silvery material and then what they
would do is they would pack it in really
really tight and then they would launch
it into space and then it would expand
into this really big sale and you would
have a CubeSat attached to it a little
tiny satellite and what the concept of
the light sale is is that the mylar wood
and the cubes that would be so
lightweight and so thin that it would be
able to be propelled by photons moving
through space that are that are like
ejected from the Sun so the sunlight
sort of very miniscule it's very
difficult to move things that would be
super lightweight to be pushed by these
photons in space but they think that
with this they can actually travel
pretty quickly too far away places in
the galaxy in a fairly short amount of
time which is kind of neat the concept
behind it and they already have this is
the cool thing they already have 4.25
million dollars of funded out of the
four or out of the 5.45 million they
need to be able to launch this thing so
now to make up for that last 1.2 million
they've gone to Kickstarter they've gone
to you the crowdfunding people who love
to crowdfund and and they want they are
only asking for two hundred thousand
dollars they've no pun intended sailed
past that there are almost 600,000 so
they're almost halfway to what they
actually just need to watch Wow and it
ends in a little more than a month it
ends jun 26 so there's still time to get
in and back this there's all kind of
different levels you can get like a
really cool mission patch for lights a
like put on jacket or whatever stickers
all kinds of stuff they are even doing
parts of the sale itself like a
centimeter of the light sail sail the
mylar sale which is pretty neat but yeah
so that's what they're doing and and
they basically you can go to sail dot
planetary org to learn more about how
light sail works and what exactly they
want to do with it I know Neil deGrasse
Tyson made a joke in the Kickstarter
video about how he wanted it to go by
Pluto he's like because I feel pretty
bad about being part of the group that
downgraded it from a planet so he's Oaks
it's a great a really great video like
you should go watch it I mean I love
Bill Nye from childhood bill nye the
science guy obviously I'm still really
big into helping people understand
science and then Neil deGrasse Tyson
just pretty much the coolest
astrophysicist that there is so um yeah
really really awesome story so light
sail you can go to UM again sale dot
planetary org to learn more about what
they're doing awesome yeah that's what
one of those I think everybody wants a
light sale so can I tell you about this
VR experience you
okay so i don't know if you've ever
looked at a painting invent like own and
going there all the time i have never
felt that way however I do want to do
that now because someone has created a
VR experience of a van Gogh painting
particularly the night cafe now this was
created at a oculus mobile VR jam so it
was created by an animator living in
brooklyn new york named Mackenzie Kali
and basically render basically like
scanned up all the you know the the
stuff from the van Gogh painting and had
to create not only the two dimensions
but also to create three dimensions for
stuff that wasn't shown to other sides
of faces behind doors objects hidden
from view but created this VR experience
because apparently Mackenzie was super
into that so this is rad yeah so it was
digitized with 3d software and there's
even animated effects like there's a
smoking there's yeah a hazy lights I'm
it's just a big old experience that you
can just go through look what what van
Gogh's world would look like if van Gogh
created a world I suppose I didn't
painted it in VR so creative yeah this
guy look at this guy it's amazing so
that's pretty neat it's basically just
you know just something cool to show off
that people are having some fun art
artistic experiences yeah with VR and
and sharing some some old old style
another great use of virtual reality and
I wouldn't have necessarily considered
like off the top of my head but totally
makes sense go let's go walk into a
walking an oil painting yeah it's like
what dreams may come yeah oh yeah yeah
it is like that so that brings our eyes
I got it Oh massage which is 2d paint TD
bank TD paint so we want to know from
you Franklin's is me painting what
Franklin what painting would you want to
experience and VR oh there's so many um
I love that she did van Gogh cuz
obviously it's so visual and so there's
a whimsy to them that I think people
really like I would have to say I really
like maybe any Monet the sort of
impressionists kind of world where it
like and it would be really cool because
as you're walking closer to
things like they get more and more
blurry and like out of cos dirt because
it's impressionist ya gonna be really
rad like you walk away and you can see
everything and then as you get close to
do it like it totally dissolves into
nothingness so that would be really cool
for me that was pretty cool that'd be
pretty cool I would probably just go I
probably just go into Mona Lisa just
like have a chat have a chit it's just
like hey hey girl see what's like like
maybe she's got like a plate of
spaghetti down here something like you
don't know you know no yeah just see
kind of like what's going on in her
world I like you like the Mona Lisa
that's a good one me and Mona is what
see what she's smiling at maybe you
could see what she's look what she was
meant to me she's smiling at me from a
girl hell do you guys she's sweaty right
on tinder so we're good to go Mia Mona
that's what we called it Tobi you're
Ryan Gosling eng Mona Lisa hey hey girl
that's more like Joey from friends hey
how you doing well she's Italian I like
that so TV paint TV faint there's a
painting or paint paint TD paint make it
short okay so there you go TT paint tell
us what painting you'd like to be inside
of outrage with I want to talk to you
about this toothbrush um because I'm a
little weirded out by it I don't know
I'm a big fan of good dental hygiene
yeah ah we've been using the same old
kind of system for a pretty long time
you got a toothbrush got toothpaste
toothpaste brush teeth baking soda looks
a little fuck you foam up in the mouth
you pretend you have rabies that's what
everybody does right that's crazy like
at seven years olds I still do that
sometimes but I think you actually do
every probably that's actually probably
true um so there's this japanese company
and they were product and it's called me
Sokka and it's a toothbrush that they
claim requires no toothpaste now here's
how it works is not just like a little
standard regular old toothpaste they get
off a rack they say their toothbrush has
super thin nylon bristles that are
covered in nano sized mineral ions so
that way you don't need any more
toothpaste it's nanotechnology making it
so that you don't got to use toothpaste
okay you just dip your moussaka and
water and then you brush your teeth okay
and they're saying you only need one
brushing a day you just do it once in
the morning a good three like good three
minute brush
then you're good you're good you don't
need a brush at night which is maybe a
little disgusting no they don't
understand how brushing work and that
but here's the catch so there is a catch
you got to swap out the bristles once a
month in fact the word miss silka
translates to English as the last day of
the month so that's is a reminder of
when to switch them out like the last
day of the month to go to switch out the
bristles did they say how many yen it
was so here's the great thing you can
actually get one on amazon for i might
have to buy it i'm gonna get one fifteen
bucks so fifteen dollars a month so it's
like a bristle description yeah yeah
yeahs such amount so yeah 15 bucks a
month it's not worth the risk for me not
worth the risk no I'd I mean yeah one
forty dollars yeah like where's the
because rushing is like taking you brush
to get the crap off your teeth so that's
while you're brushing in the morning
usually in the middle of day and then
usually at the end of the day and i'm
brushing once just for fun whoa i did it
today no it's like cleaning the gun
clean everything oh and also we've been
so trained to feel that like fresh
breath feeling every eating's jo
toothbrush taking that away I don't know
people are ready for that that might be
that that could be true I mean you're
just pressure chief of water it doesn't
feel as good as having a like minty
fresh or you know if you have like
vanilla flavored she's not going to
remove the flavor for me from your mouth
my other question is is that like they
don't mention needing flossing or like
all the other things that dentists
recommend that you do as you get older
they're like okay so you just rest your
teeth in your kid then you had to add
flossing when your teenager then on top
of that you got to add like water pik
they go to keep adding stuff you a
little rubber squishy thing when you get
older like in your 40s and 50s so they
don't mention any of that like
additional dental care that you probably
should be doing this is suspect I go
ahead and you try it out I'll ciao I'll
just be over here well let me know with
my brethren yeah once you t start
falling out i'll start telling you um no
but i mean i guess i'll wait to see some
doctors try this out okay Ellis if this
is an actual thing I had my parents are
dental technicians okay and this doesn't
sound like anything that it would be
like new be like sketchy hui yeah uh
yeah is baloney yeah they don't talk
about how
like Times you're gonna have to visit
the dentist because yeah terrible also
PS at the end of every month is how
often you visit a dentist get your teeth
cleaned out because this toothbrush
doesn't work maybe I don't know I'll wet
maybe I'll try it don't like 15 bucks
maybe I'll test it out you'll switch it
out for one month I'll switch it out for
my normal toothbrush but I'll just brush
my teeth like twice a day like I don't
like to life's too short to believe in
magical toothbrushes listen replacing
your teeth is expensive so for fifteen
dollars a month I don't think I take
that risk or you can get like one of
those things like immortan joe Oh
perfect that's a very nice reference
sorry sorry sorry Logan I'm in all right
guys that's our headlines we are gonna
take a quick break we're gonna be right
back with new releases of which there

kale will actually finish oh yeah I'd
the problem I tried to I started playing

apparently having great time with us so
i know i'm not a big destiny player but
i'm hearing good things i am not a
console player so unfortunately i don't
get to experience destiny is a huge
bummer cuz i played the demo on my 360
my whole little rusty 360 it's quite
good it was really cool but I just bring
it to pc yeah I think this is like a
perfect pc game some people would argue
no they'd say perfect console on but no
it's uh it's it looks got a controller
for my pc very very true that's what i
use the xbox 360 controller so that's
all right yeah uh and then we got some
movies coming out this week Tomorrowland
comes out this week uh you already saw
it so here's your review I have seen it
here's my review it is a movie that is
by brad bird who if you didn't know has
also made the incredibles and the iron
giant amongst other fine few
retro-futurism themed films my big thing
is is that Brad Bird and I share a
common love of an optimistic future and
this movie Tomorrowland kind of has that
as its central kind of tenants there's
that's sort of the not the MacGuffin but
yeah Tomorrowland is kind of the
MacGuffin in the movie um but one of the
things that it's it's not getting great
reviews so I'm going to put this right
out there there are a lot of critics who
are like not in this like I didn't like
it I thought it was a little uneven and
I don't disagree with that like I think
that there are some like fact there's
some third act issues I think that I
would love to have changed but um
generally speaking I loved the message
of this movie so much even though it was
a little heavy-handed that I that I
found it watchable that I enjoyed it so
for me it was like I really
this movie because it spoke to me
personally on a deep level because of
how much i love this serve like what
other people tell people why they should
see a traditions you should see it if
you love the idea of a if you miss sort
of the the nostalgia of positive utopian
futures like the Jetsons i'll just sum
up what you said you said if you like
the concept of the show and kind of what
we hope to intent like what we intend
possess then you're going to love this
me like it's all about the positivity
and where the positive angles that
sci-fi is going all of technology is
going and the things that means to us
and all the positivity and thank you
that's pretty much it I was waiting for
you to get to them ya feel I positivity
I mean it really is it's optimism about
the future because like that if you have
optimism about the future this is you'll
enjoy this movie it is watchable I'm not
saying it's the greatest movie I've ever
seen I because I saw Mad Max last
weekend but it is a good movie that I
enjoyed and I feel like if I had or knew
children find new any children I would
take them to go see ya it's a great it's
gonna be a good family movie I snatch
some kids and go to thank you I you when
is Danna you interviewed brad bird I did
I interviewed brad bird and a junket
about epcot which kale and I are very
big Disney fans were very Walt Disney
fans and we got to ask him a couple of
questions so i will actually be playing
that right now ro on the show tomorrow's
the show sorry i wish it was today but
we there's some there were some
approvals that I needed to get oh so
there was a red bird well yeah well
Disney and then also from my boss so our
boss oh she has to approve it before it
gets on this yeah Laura Laura Cena as we
call her mrs. C nut sup Laura so anyway
Tomorrowland comes out in an also movie
I missed the last week and I feel really
bad because I love this movie I love the
first one pitch perfect 2 was out last
week but look if you didn't see it which
a lot of people did it made a bunch of
money yeah go see HD 60 million I think
yeah bit so close to 70 60 70 yes 69
points something million so it did very
very well this this last weekend but I
will go see it and I also you were
friend in this Lula's in this movie my
friend Flula Flula I'll
of it I can't wait to see it he's been
doing a lot of press around yeah he's
very excited about it he looks snazzy on
the red carpet and everything I really
this is a good no offense Anna Kendrick
I know I'm sorry I'm will go see it for
Flula see it for Flula you can put that
right on the box sorry can't drink quote
that's a pull quote see it for Flula see
you poulos oh that's new releases which
now we can get finally to the user
feedback about the VR suit from last
week last week oh you're talking about a
million years ago so let's hate user
feedback the our suit yeah the VR suit
alright so to refresh your memory and
kales memory we talked about the Tesla
suit which is a suit that you wear in
conjunction with VR that has these sort
of bands on each of your arms and it
yeah does heat and cool and haptic
feedback and like all this stuff to give
you this really kind of intense virtual
reality experience so we asked you guys
would you dig this suit what would you
how would you use it what would you put
game how would you how to use it okay
where's it going Neil wrote in and said
that knowing mm-hmm when you heard the
Tesla suit was machine washable dirty
minds think alike TD tells and I again
right it can I thought about it again
when you were describing it's just like
yeah oh man this is gonna be a problem
Richard brought in he sent us two tweets
he said awesome but it would be fun to
use as a prank on a friend passed out by
playing call of duty his hashtag
firefight haha and then wrote I had to
share that but the game I would love to
play Skyrim diverse climate and terrain
hashtag adventure you know that's all
sounds fun and good you're like I
wouldn't be cool really experiencing I
know but it's freezing and then and then
a lagging bird dragon burned you bad
like see that's a thing like VR can only
go so far we're gonna hate it so well
before it ends up being the matrix it's
like dude I've the game you die in real
life yeah yeah like I thought it would
be fun but like I don't know it's really
hot at ringside radiation thirsty Tesla
the Tesla suit a fallout version comes
with plutonium embedded inside the bands
and it just lets out a little bit of
radiation every time it you can't get
good at a game no
and then lastly up the Tesla suit dev
team wrote to us I said Tesla suit comes
as a full body smart morphsuit thank you
for the expelled great exposure see you
on Kickstarter so that wasn't a sick you
didn't answer the question no what we
talked about how it remember I said if
it came as a morphsuit i think i would
get it for it so they said it does it
does in fact comes more so you can get
it all together all the pieces together
cuz member they said they sold them in
resurrect nagging at them all so now I
know what I'm gonna kill for his
birthday i wish they had it i wish they
had answered the question though i would
guess what they'd want to do with it
very true so they're like we want to
murder everybody like just secretly it's
no it's like an evil villain it's like
an evil villain super villain like James
they seem like very nice people well
just all super villains seem like very
nice people at first that I think I'd be
a more tanjo okay fair enough fair well
we don't know how he started maybe
seemed like a nice guy first I don't
know maybe when he was young Emmert and
Joey when he was little and more tan
Joey don't Logan hasn't seen it maybe
some people alright fair enough all
right but uh yeah that was our user
