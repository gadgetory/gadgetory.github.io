four-four time on CNN TV I'm Jeff
Bakalar and I'm Justin you and this is
the show where we've bring in our ela
ela just beats popping already hasn't
even started yet ladies and gentlemen
help us welcome to the fine program ela
Morton how are you Ella has nothing to
do with the fact that you're the first
woman to graze are showing a long time
yes nothing to do with that guy just
stopped femaleness thing Oh siren was
going crazy yes we're glad you can help
us fill that void uh thanks for coming
on oh yes I welcome your you're an
ex-senator yes which is probably news to
everyone from the US side of things
you're in the australian i worked at
cnet australia for about five years cool
until the end of two thousand eight so
tell us about that I mean what do you do
like in the pre-show you're like oh I
like being back in this back in the
senior you know world I think because i
joined seen it at some at what was
probably my prime sure it's all downhill
from here but that's it we have a lot to
look forward to well it was my early
twenties and you know things were fun
and crazy and it was a really cool
company right and so I have very fond
memories of seen it but I worked there
for about five years doing mostly
audible audio and on camera stuff cool i
made very very rare appearances on cnet
TV in the US all right now there was a
show that lasted for about three seconds
called planet seen it I remember planet
yes in which different countries
different cnet's would file reports
right and us in the UK tended to file
these bizarre sort of um parodies like
we did this one where it was a fake
current affairs report about how
Australia didn't have the iphone yet ok
and how kids across the country had gone
crazy and we're talking into their ipod
touches yeah because it's just that
that's really good it was on i don't
think we submitted it and it was met
with us a resounding silence yeah ah so
people just don't get your heel i know
they don't well that's okay I you know
not everyone can understand that there's
subtle intricacies
apparent it's an acquired taste that's
very few Americans are privileged we
know that show run too many planets unit
to come back I would like people don't
realize that there are other cnet's in
different countries yeah everywhere yeah
and actually you're a good friend of
someone else who you out frequently
comes on the show ty pendlebury yeah I
pendulum seen in Australia's well he's
come on and talk to us a lot about I've
learned a lot about Australia I am
cheers by being him being I feel like
I've been there but calling people
bogans on Rob bears yeah terrifying by
the way it is the empirical bears yeah
HD no that's ribs I Steve house it's
about I didn't say hey H is actually a
it's almost like a class issue in
Australia really yes so you're saying
ties a bum well I say age and I found I
really hate the sound of hate and you
say zedge all right um unless I'm saying
ZD night yes whoa why is it said XYZ
just flows right off the tongue there
nah mess around ah so and then after
seeing it you sort of jumped around a
little bit you're doing some stuff with
what was right after seeing it uh I'll
just saying that I moved here and then I
didn't have a job for about several
months the American dream yeah I was
kind of terrified that my my decision
was the wrong one but then I started
working at rocketboom okay and hosting a
show called rocketboom NYC right on and
I was there for about two and a half
years Wow right on so after rocketboom
then you're at your current uh no
in-between in-between right at the same
time I was co writing a book sure um the
record set of Book of World Records yes
which we have right here Justin you
thank you very much we actually talked
about a story that involved record said
earlier this week at South by Southwest
Javier kobayashi there he set the record
for I think the most uh sandwiches of
grilled cheese in like sandwiches of
cheese sandwiches of cheese eating out
like I think was a candidate in one day
I believe it's pretty nervous crazy so
that you actually co-wrote this book or
edited it I career I sit right on so
what was that process like um because it
sounds like I mean you know obviously
you guys are like uh in in you know
competition with those Guinness people
right yes what is there like a big kid
record-setter fight like um we see it as
fulfilling different nature if Guinness
was like the encyclop√©die Encyclopedia
Britannica then record setter is the
Wikipedia I like yeah I like that
analogy it's a bit more open sure labret
of right it's very specific as various
begins world record is always like
highest jump but this is like stuff like
most questions asked during a single
drive-thru visit a highly competitive
category yeah that's just time to look
at candy cane to a sharp point that
sounds like something like I think it's
safe to say that record setter their
records are more fun yes I think to put
it simply that's true but it's not all
just ridiculous stuff there are things
in there that are incredibly difficult
sure and uh like there was one that's
most pies baked and delivered to a
charity on thanksgiving wow really cool
so now are correct me if I'm wrong
people can sort of invent their own
records and you guys sort of validate
them yes as long as they're quantifiable
and breakable right then they can be
submitted to the site and I need
evidence in the form of a video usually
I had friends my buddy Evan claims that
he had a record setter for most uh most
boxes knocked down via human projectile
that's that sounds like a records that a
record i think it does not vary record
setter ii and i think there was some
sort of spanish television show yes
that's real vida that yes that Trott
that contacted him to try and addy
thrown his record on their on their
program well they've been having a fight
with jimmy fallon because a lot of
records yes I've been set on Late Night
with Jimmy Fallon yes and this random TV
show in Spain just decided to take on
all of the records that Jimmy found
Brett and they just like hey yeah like
and I'm so glad you brought that up cuz
i reminded me my buddy Evan said
apparently in the what's the name of the
show game ultra otra movida right ultram
Evita apparently there's a sign in the
background of one of the videos that
says fu Jimmy Fallon it is like they
have a lot of respect for Jimmy and it
it's an affectionate thing but it is
kind of jarring to see that like in fig
you like
after you Jimmy yeah yeah it's like we
love you so much go F yourself very odd
anyway it's at one of those records I
would love what we do what you should do
longest period of total silence set on a
recorded podcast just stop talking just
deliver 24 hours silent bad guys any
like that listeners yeah enjoy that what
do you get do you know what there are a
lot of records that involves throwing
pieces of technology okay that's like
farthest distance to throw a printer mmm
any of print I'm not gonna lie i've seen
some printer chuckers before yeah we're
looking at the king right here yeah I'm
the printer editor and then after we
just trash all them so that's perfect
it'll be like the shotput you'll have to
like do some sort of like spiral delay
and then launch it into some sort of
like apparatus sick dude try to
organized all right I'm writing that
down i'm sure the vendors would love c
ya too dude I i don't care if I'm canon
my printer is the one that got chucked
about that I've got to the specs yeah
damn straight most aerodynamic printer
out there that's what you're going for
um awesome so you I mean you've been all
over the place and that's you've had a
very cool career so far I have and yeah
the projects I'm working on right now is
amazing it's teaching me so much stuff
about the world yes so tell us about so
so it's for a publication called atlas
Obscura that's right Alex curious
started out as a website by two guys
Joshua Foer and Dylan Thoris and it's
this website about the world's most
wondrous places sure so I'm currently
writing the book version which is
awesome yeah when is that gonna come out
because I'm here to get my hands on 2013
that's fine that's in the future that's
fine it's gonna be 500 pages oh it's
huge alright pictures uh yet lots of
pictures nice yeah and I can read it yes
psych I love that let's obscure by the
way I read all kinds of dogs just like
they're sure like forgotten New York for
example but atlas obscura is really cool
i used it to find this place called dead
horse Bay oh yeah that's like kind of on
the southern tip of Brooklyn right by
Coney Island it's on the way to this
beach and basically it's this place
where they used to have horse mills when
they returned horse hooves into like
glue and things like that yeah the the
that's what HBO is a lucky
yeah exactly but then like after they
would uh you know grind up these horses
is kind of disgusting yes the bones
would wash up onto the surface of this
beach right next to the factory and if
you go there you can still find little
like inches of bones and then also all
kinds of like debris and bottles and old
shoes and stuff for sure it's kind of
cool and I found that on that lets
obscure a while ago a really useful
website on day trip yeah date first date
you want a dead horse man oh dear it
reminds me of like ever hear of like the
weird brand like weird New Jersey that
when I was growing up injured I mean I
feel like it started when I was in high
school but I never missed one of those
quarterly issues it was always so
strange and everything was in our
backyard it was like oh check out this
slaughterhouse and check out all these
wacky places in New Jersey uh so yeah if
you're into that sort of stuff this is
totally in the same vein atlas Obscura
yeah have you been a lot of the places
on it's great you know what that's
number one question people ask me
because I'm writing about these places
all our world and unfortunately I
haven't I'm I'm blessed in that I have
these good resources that the people
that I work with have been to all these
places so I wrote to them and I read
books and I spend a lot of time at the
library but I'm letting some insane
things like it so you you were sort of
professing this in the in the pre-show
tell us some sort of wacky stuff that
you're uncovering well I'm so many good
dinner party stories these days um I'm
on the Europe chapter at the moment okay
and we have a lot of historical stuff
that we put into the places as well so
there's a museum in Budapest in Hungary
called Semmelweis museum okay and it's
named after this doctor who was around
in the 1840s who worked at a maternity
ward and he noticed that all the mothers
tended to die after giving birth and he
didn't know why and then he observed
that the doctors who were delivering the
babies had just come from the morgue
where they had been conducting autopsies
and so he proposed this wacky theory
this strange revolutionary idea that
people that the doctors ought to wash
their hands oh my god after dealing with
the corpses and before delivering babies
and the medical community was outraged
oh is that what are you crazy because it
for
germ theory and before I chair and
everyone like what there's there's
obviously nothing wrong with the way
we've been doing you know Oh God and in
some one row that's intend their junk
yeah Wow Lisa and he was sort of
ostracized from the medical community
assurance he went a bit crazy and was
writing these letters to them and ended
up in an asylum where he died within two
weeks of septicemia which is the very
disease that he was trying to prevent oh
sweet irony meet irony Wow well your
hands wash your tennis and don't that
this is a short ones I thought you might
appreciate it sure back in the 18th
century when there was no medical way of
determining whether people had actually
died or if they were just in a coma or
something oh wow yeah they hold these
methods to determine whether people were
dead or not okay and one of them was
that they would administer tobacco smoke
enemas mmm using a sort of bellows gives
new meaning to blowing smoke up your
eyes exactly besides the the Thames
River in London they used to have like
these boxes filled with the the means
for tobacco smoke enema so it was like
break glass if death is suspected and
jam fellers you weren't dead before
someone did that I'm ya doing that would
probably kill them yeah any-any revivals
where purely coincidental I'm sure yeah
sure wow that is super wacky Wow uh I
have to ask this question from TY you
told me to bring it up another creepy
story from this universe it's something
about eggs oh okay I I need to read up
on the details of this because it's in
Asia and I haven't gone to the age of
chapter yet but Ron can you speak a
little to it there is something called I
believe it's in China and it's called
little boy eggs and basically eggs that
are marinated in children's urine what
wait us and then sold and people consume
them for their health mmm that's a baby
get like this frothy bubbling super boys
urine it's only boys I think it's only
boys I think it might be a fertility
thing I
interesting is that saved like I people
drink their inner that's true bear
grylls does it all the time yeah he's
the man yeah I've heard of the
thousand-year-old egg or the right ten
century your old egg um that's like
vinegar though I think yeah you're
anything might have been the origin of
it a lot of potentially this is very
very upsetting yeah wow that's so wacky
I think that was our most popular shed
people just people of there any drinking
stories very much the click and there
it's just one of those it's it's a
timeless the timeless story oh here it
is for the ages all right well let's
take a break and digest some of that
more with Ella Morton right after this

yeah you would like that wouldn't you I
would love it we just watch a video a
sort of a montage of you got to
interview a lot of the puppets from from
Sesame Street Muppets I will you just
Jim Henson I know I know I'm gonna get
my ass kicked by some Muppets uh so what
was that like this that looks like it
was a lot of fun it was pretty much the
greatest work day ever yes we had been
contacting Sesame Street for a long time
because I really wanted to go there it's
the Studios in Queens right here in New
York and we've really wanted to go there
and interview them but we thought well
it's probably not going to happen sure
but then it was their 40th anniversary
and they decided to invite people in so
we got to go and basically tore the set
sources so i sat in big birds nests oh I
got inside Oscars rubbish bin Norgaard
yeah that's sick and we went to Hooper's
store we sat on the stoop and I
interviewed cookie monster and elmo
right it's so cool let's watch a clip
from the the cookie monster interview
because it's hilarious we just showed a
montage but here's a ella and uh and
Cookie Monster it's hilarious let's
check it out style well young niggas
sole you use this voice it's kind of
like a bit of um nom nom nom nom nom let
me see when me cooking me I'm numb me do
do that yes yes know what you're talking
about a lot of people are using this
omnomnomnomnom when they talk about
wanting something that's delicious I
don't know me me me um num num no no yes
from you the actual I'm num num num down
yes why me not get royalties on this
because you're my attorney on that this
this distinctive cookie eating it's
pretty good that's so the video is
unbelievable will link to in our show
notes today I just I can't stress enough
how awesome it they I feel like the
older you get the funnier those Muppets
are yeah well it works on so many layers
like for sure key monsters been on
colbert right and you know he talks
about like political issues Kermit was
on the other
night talking about the Republican race
right it's amazing yeah and but even
though I knew that there was a human
person operating cookie monster and elmo
right I still just talk to them up it
right it wasn't as making eyes yeah it's
because it there's something that's so
compelling assure yeah I wanted to also
ask you about the workshop to her that
you took you were kind of talking about
it in the pre-show but I just went to
the jim henson exhibit up at the Museum
of moving image and it kind of showed
some of the workshop pieces like a lot
of the googly eyes and the felt material
they would use but were you able to walk
around and kind of see the puppet
builders you know what they actually
have a policy where visitors aren't
allowed to see Muppets unless they are
being operated they don't want to
destroy the illusion sure because they
get a lot of children coming to the set
that would traumatize again and I don't
see like you know some ping-pong ball
eyes unless afternoon across what about
a lifeless Elmo kid right ya know for
sure I feel like they they really do
protect that cast they yeah you know and
like you said it was so tough to even
get access you know they really they're
sort of like almost disney-esque when it
comes to that but it's such when you're
there it's such a good environment sure
all the puppeteers have been working
there for such a long time it is like
they have this little close-knit family
right we got to watch an episode being
filmed that's cool and everyone's just
so laid back that's really awesome I
want to live there yeah I mean what
could be wrong what could be bad about
that that's pretty awesome um so we
talked all about Ella in your career and
you don't have to come back by the way
this is always a lot of fun okay we I'm
not gonna beat around the bush any
longer there's something I want to talk
about that we have to bring up you know
just because I feel like we'd be doing
our show and in just its anna jarvis
everyone in the chat room sit down so
i'm looking at my notes here and part of
your career includes the occupation
maybe still does of being a burlesque
dancer is that yes that your are you
still doing that yes I'm where are you
doing under a different name of course
and uh I I'm not gonna give out the name
because people can find it
they said hoddan yeah if they really
wanted to unearth it I think it would be
yes unearthed table but it's definitely
it's something that I kept secret I get
hurt for a long time because I felt like
I don't know I mean I when I was on
rocketboom especially i thought well i
don't know if i want pictures out there
on the internet and you know i'm doing a
show that's meant to be family friendly
and um when I talk to my boss about it
though he said oh I don't care go for it
have fun sweet yeah but I do still I I
maintains it a separate you do
identities that seems really cool how is
that tough to balance on the end
especially on the internet being an
internet personality definitely um I'm
getting less concerned about it I don't
think people maybe care as much as I
thought they did right well you know if
we would imagine the Internet is a very
progressive sort of environment and
people can do whatever the hell I want
that's pretty awesome are you doing that
for a while then um I've been I started
out doing Go Go which is um it's when
you dance before the main burlesque acts
sure maybe remember like in the 60s the
girls in the cages yeah sure yes they
had like Goldie Hawn was painted with
peace signs rotary absolutely yes it's
just basically good guy okay so go go
proceeds burlesque it's it's generally
used as a warm-up to the manor it's like
the farm team I thought that is like oh
like uh not major leagues like the the
one below that it's like an opening act
hey any sports analogy is lost on me
yeah me too like the opening band The
Oprah okay and pearl if Burrell s is the
headliner gogo is supporting okay it
tends to be done during the break
between acts so what does that involve
specifically um dancing sometimes on ba
sometimes on a stage and people come up
and put em on each others in your shimmy
belt in your shimmy bill yeah but it's
worth it to note that there is a belt
though right I mean burlesque isn't
always necessarily nude there's no a lot
of cost well in New York burlesque
you're in the allowed to strip down to
pasties and a g-string okay Wow
according to law it's actually illegal
if you're in a place that serves alcohol
to show show your nipples yeah wait a
minute I know a lot of places that are
breaking the law it depends it depends
on
license if it's a theater then
technically it's art yeah right I got
you so that's the that's the discrepancy
yeah that's the difference is that
someone's banging the Georgian swung
open like 15 people to smile into the
road okay we're not done with the dog so
I'm more as a curiosity to sort of thing
so if you're if you're dancing in a
burlesque house where is that guy tends
to be but I mean there are some
specialized venues like the slipper room
yeah okay yeah I've heard of that in
there yeah you've been there I'm not
gonna lie i've been to my fair share of
burlesque shows there are a lot of fun
to go we're sure groups are friends i
think slipper rooms like on orchard and
stanton oh yeah very specific cool and I
think um like I never realized how much
humor is involved yeah for sure I'm DIY
and creates a video really it's like an
improv a sort of situation too isn't it
it's very it's the reminds me of roller
derby in that it's very um people tend
to produce their own shows they make
their own costumes they come up with a
bunch of stuff by themselves it's not
like you're just buying something off a
rack right right marionette it's a lot
of creativity involved there's a lot of
humor and parody sure the word burlesque
actually means like making fun of
something right I get a parody of
something same so that's so how long
have you been doing this um it actually
began because I started writing for a
burlesque magazine back in Sydney well
okay is that popular in Australia
burlesque is yeah yeah um and I'd always
been there's kind of a crossover in the
burlesque community between like the
pin-up aesthetic and fifties fashion
jerseys and rockabilly so I was always
always interested in that and because
you do have that sort of like style
going on for sure yeah no absolutely
it's awesome um so uh so you still so
now we were talking about the the
difference between burlesque and perhaps
we'll retirement for like I like almost
like a strip clubs worth yeah people ask
that all the time and a lot of Bella
stances like some get really offended at
the idea of being compared to stripper
course some say well by definition I am
a stripper huh um but there's an
empowerment aspect to it oh yeah yeah
well like when with burlesque performers
it's sort of like you're sharing an
experience
with the audio right and it's a jerk
that you share as I don't want to speak
for all strip clubs always do but it
just it the few times I've ever been to
a strip club it just seems like there's
a very big separation between audience
and performer and I mean I wouldn't know
i've ever been to us know your you want
anyway i don't read about it all you've
seen on TV writing know you're a hundred
percent right absolutely it's uh it's a
much less uh I for and correct me if I'm
wrong in describing it this way birla
seems to be a much more humanized
experience right yeah as opposed to the
client customer yes situation at a strip
establishment and audiences that
burlesque shows tend to be more depends
on the venue but a lot of them are like
fifty percent women yeah for sure do you
still get some creepy older dude in the
back just kind of lurking around staring
leering guy that happen at once in a
while sometimes yeah I would hmm but the
thing is it's it's such a it's such a
scene like the same people tend to come
out to shows that that wouldn't be
tolerated it would that person would
feel very out of place right for sure I
think if they were looking to get their
jollies they wouldn't come to a
burlesque show because it's not that
kind of experience right you know what
you're getting yeah they're which is
awesome what uh have you ever been to
one in like Vegas I went to forty deuce
when I was at CES oh nice okay I went I
oh that's it's all coming back to me
yeah I remember hanging out with Tywin
dan he's like hey I'm going to see my
friend out of burlesque show that was
probably me and I'm like okay I just saw
just let that go it was it was like Jake
me with just like all right bro see you
later yeah didn't didn't process that
information well that's really cool um
that's that's that's awesome is there a
type of music that you prefer to dance
to i went to this one that was I think
was based on the Sex Pistols I was
called god save the queen it was so cool
but I'd like that different dancers
either choose like the 60s route or like
a rockabilly type music is with a funk
yeah there's classic Berlusconi's
neo-burlesque and near can be any kind
of music like you can dance to like rap
or R&amp;amp;B yeah I I love there's a song by
The Black Keys called psychotic girl
yeah
I love dancing to that all right there
might peek at the moment I Spotify yeah
google the information all right that's
really cool very very awesome Oh almost
I don't think I've ever talked about
specifically this on any publicly I'm
glad we could be the first to sort of
deliver that good enough there is no no
no how did it go it is fine i knows i
think we did a great job shredding
around that you know will you talked
about it on your podcast I think ideas
ago but I serve talks about it in theory
though okay okay tell can you tell us
more about that sure that's called
ellipses right ellipses yeah sure I
started this when I was in between after
the record that a book came out and when
I was about to do atlas oh and I just I
used to write a blog called sprinkle of
ginger hmm and it talked about
creativity and writing and
procrastinating and being redheaded yeah
well then I think it was a mistake to
tie my blog into my heck yeah I died of
talk a bit um I because I right so much
for my job I kind of get home I don't
want to write anymore but I'm happy to
talk to people and interview people hmm
so I started this podcast called
ellipses and i called it ellipses
because what's a tie into my name Ella
the deeper meaning is there which is
that you know ellipsis is of course the
three dots okay and it sort of means
like a something that is acknowledged
but not said okay right implied yeah
sure so I like to take things that
people think and bring them out into the
open and talk about them nice so I've
I've done 10 episodes so far and I've
interviewed writers comedians burlesque
performer my friend alejandro who used
to be a comic book editor at marvel oh
wow that's awesome so it's a pretty
diverse mix and we talked about you know
frustrations of working in creative
field sure and that sort of thing I I
think it's funny ish and embroidery cool
very cool and you said you you don't
necessarily stick to cert a schedule
with the lipstick but well this is where
