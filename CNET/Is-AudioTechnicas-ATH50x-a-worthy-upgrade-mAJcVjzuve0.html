updated its excellent sub $200 studio
style M 50 with a detachable cable
system and better padded ear cups no
it's not much of an upgrade but this ex
model does come with three different
cables and certainly sounds as good or
even better than the original M 50 hi
I'm David cardo and I'm going to walk
you through the small differences in the
two models which look nearly identical
on the surface as I said the key changes
are they slightly softer more luxurious
padding on the ear cups it is a great up
and that detachable cord which some
users will appreciate the headphones
shipped with two straight cords a
shorter 3.9 foot one and a nine point
eight foot one as well as a coiled cord
that stretches from three point nine
feet to nine point eight feet a lot of
competing models like the $300 Beats
Studio included cord with an integrated
controller and microphone for making
cell phone calls alas none of these
cords offer that feature and Audio
Technica doesn't plan to sell such a
cord for its M series line M of course
stands for monitor I think that's
unfortunate given that even though these
are studio style headphones many people
use them on the go back right beside
they are excellent sturdy headphones in
the previous m50 which occasionally gets
discounted to less than 125 dollars is
one of our favorite headphones for the
money sound wise this model is hard to
fault the tonal balance is accurate
stereo imaging for a closed back design
is spacious and dynamic impact is
excellent
while Audio Technica claims there's no
difference between the sound of the
original m50 and this m50x we think the
new one is clearer with more detailed
bass mid-range and treble switching back
to the m50 the sound is slightly veiled
in cloudy
we like the m50x but some folks may
prefer the m54 it's richer more
laid-back perspective although it's too
bad audio technica doesn't include a
cable with controller and microphone
that probably won't bother audio purists
you do have to pay more for this new
model but it still offers a lot of bang
for the buck with excellent performance
and a slightly more come
we'll fit to go along with those added
chord options I'm David Carr noise
