I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update in Facebook's never-ending quest
to swallow up the internet it now wants
to become a main shopping page for
retail stores you've heard of Facebook
testing a Buy button on advertisements
but this latest test is taking things to
a whole new level turning a store's
Facebook page into a full online shop
first reported by BuzzFeed this mockup
photo shows what this page could look
like but these facebook storefronts are
in a limited test right now so you may
not see it but Facebook isn't the first
here it's following a trend of other
social media sites like Pinterest
Instagram and Twitter that are also
building virtual retail shops inside of
their networks in other news the
sometimes controversial anonymous
network Yik yak is in following the
shopping trend rather it's adding photos
but everything on Yik yak is anonymous
so to keep it that way people will not
be able to post photos of their faces
photos have to go through a moderator
approval before they're published which
also prevents people from posting
anything nasty or illegal if you've
never heard of yak yak it's a
location-based message board app where
you can see messages from everyone
within a mile of your location but you
don't see any names and it's that system
that is made it popular with college
campuses where people can post about
their interests invite people to events
or even alert people of something urgent
going on nearby all without
identification but the anonymous nature
means you'll find lots of adult language
so consider yourself warned moving on to
gadget news misfit activity trackers
have all dropped in price and there's a
new cheap twenty dollar tracker added to
the family with misfit you really have
two main models there's the shine which
is a more upscale design of brushed
metal that's now seventy dollars and
there's the flash it does the same
things but it's a plastic design now
sold for thirty dollars if you don't
care about the wristband and you wanted
to choose it as a clip-on there's now
the flash link for twenty dollars also
plastic and what's cool about both
plastic flash models is that they do
more than just track activity they
our clicker buttons that can be
programmed as a remote for different
things click to take a photo with your
smartphone camera for a cool selfie or
use it as a clicker in a meeting
presentation to move to the next slide
or click to change songs as a music
remote and looking ahead Motorola is
teasing it'll have some new phones to
show off at an event later this month in
the invitation it plays off the XOXO
hugs and kisses but it looks like it's
xgx possibly hinting at new versions of
the Moto X and moto G smartphones that's
it for this tech news update there's
always more at cnet com from our studios
