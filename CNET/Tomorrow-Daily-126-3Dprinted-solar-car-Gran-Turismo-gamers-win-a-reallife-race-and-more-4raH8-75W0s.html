show off a solar-powered car that was
built with the help of 3d printing to
gamers take their skills in video games
to real life and are actually incredible
and win and I'll tell you more okay okay
and there's a robot so dexterous it can
make balloon animals which means all
those clowns are gonna be really sad
once robots take their jobs to tomorrow
daily
three days citizens in the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the universe I'm your host
Ashley skele join these always the fifth
member of the temptations kill anonymous
do up do like you're like I don't know
what the whole I can thing going like it
was really only remember that the taste
ations which were are you really taste
station candy that are from like the 90s
which probably point zero zero zero one
percent of people watching even know
about which is that your mom hashtag
bring back a station sorry for ruining
the intro to the show you know we have a
lot of good salaries today we do have a
lot of good stories today I so let's not
waste any more time one side headlines
his first story is about the taste Asia
futuristic space it's a Monday all right
get started let's bring them back let's
do actually alright so this story comes
from some engineering students in
singapore at Nanyang Technological
University and they made this car for a
competition but there's something really
special about it which is that the shell
of the car there's there's two of them
and I'll explain what they are so
they're made with 3d printing the shell
Oh car is 3d printed along with over 150
parts inside this car so okay the the
first one that you're seeing the bigger
one is an urban solar electric car it's
the first one that's been made in
Singapore and they're calling it the NV
8 for short again like I said 3d printed
body over 150 3d printed parts there's a
carbon fiber chassis there are handmade
silicon solar cells that have been
molded to the car shape and curves so
it's like really aerodynamic and also it
fits the the actual shape of the car so
it's not like just like a big panel like
sitting on the top of the car looking
ridiculous it was designed by scratch it
took over a year to build and it will
race in shells eco-marathon asia this
year as an urban concept entry and the
goal of this the goal of this race is to
build these cars that have piqued fuel
efficiency like no matter what type of
fuel you're using so they have you can
compete in in you could have vehicles in
one of seven different types of entries
so you can have our energies you can use
hydrogen electric gas diesel ethanol
natural gas and shale gas to liquids
which I'm not super familiar with but
apparently that's a way to power a car
and then so like I said it's also about
it's about maximizing fuel efficiency
and using futuristic designs to sort of
achieve those ends but they also built
in the picture you can see a smaller car
and this is the envy 9 which is a
separate category in the prototype
category so there's two different
there's like an urban concept and then
there's like this prototype category
this is a three-wheeled car that looks
like a little cockpit that you can race
in and that was also built by the same
team and they're hoping that that also
does very well so really cool stuff that
they're doing over at this university I
just think it's awesome that people are
building I you know these prototype
vehicles with 3d printers like I just I
love the idea that 3d printing is being
used to build pretty much everything at
this point except like is it because it
seems like most of the three minor stuff
is oh really so it's so light because
it's plastic and so the thing is is like
it's supported by that carbon fiber
chassis so it's it's built like a car
but the shell of the car the body of the
car is 3d printed so it's really like
it's really impressive that they've been
able sorry and I would've oh yeah
there's the inside right there and I
would imagine that the the lightweight
feature of that 3d printed plastic
enables it to go farther without using
as much fuel or energy so hence making
solar made a little bit more of a viable
option so I thought this was really
awesome it's very cool lots of crazy
tech going on there it was great so I
fully they win yeah I'm really curious
to see how everything goes so we'll see
what place they come in so speaking of
racing go get him ok speaking races this
is the story of two gamers that were so
good at gran turismo that they were
chosen to be in an actual race I comply
creationist and one but ok so the
journey the journey is actually exciting
ok so here we go so to gamers a wolfgang
reap and florian Strauss we're in the
top of the leaderboards in 2011 and 2012
respectively
in the game Gran Turismo now they have
this uh Sony and Nissan have this thing
called the Gran Turismo the Gran Turismo
Academy where they take the top people
that play gran turismo and they take
them to a camp they teach them how to
race and then if they're really good
they put them in actual competitions
that is crazy this is an actual thing
that happens that is that vein I love
that show these these two gamers were
again from 2011-2012 respectively
entered the but thurs 12 hour race and
won with their teammate cat soon
kazumasa chio so they won they actually
came out first on upbeat actual people
that are well I think racetrack I think
there are actual people who are also
race drivers but the fact that they came
out of Gran Turismo is the craziest
thing I've ever heard yes so if you if
you want to enter if you want to like
and try to enter this you basically you
know obviously have to be a top racer on
the alienator better say if you do come
out on top you get a 1 million dollar
contract from Nissan to race across the
world I was part of the team team Nissan
if you're interested in what kind of car
they drove the rjn motorsport nissan
gt-r 35 currently right now one of their
main drivers came Nissan's main drivers
came from the Gran Turismo leaderboards
his name is John mardenborough he's 22
years old so and he's he's entering the
24 hour of lemans this June and he's
like they're like this guy's going to
win what's exciting about this to me is
the fact that it's so like it's
legitimate or legitimately good because
remember this all has extremely realist
and they all have like steering wheels
and so they're actually like simulating
the drive I want to read can I read a
couple of quotes from you like this is
this is after they were fascinating to
me please after they won this is a quote
from Wolfgang other racers laughed at us
GT Academy drivers but even they use
simulators like us to train so that's
true and then now this is from Jan from
Jan they get the 22 year old who's
killing it is about to race this June
good luck if you had no experience at
all driving anything in real life and
you had a
pedal set up in a rigged and had gran
turismo 6 you could jump from that into
a real car and drive and very near the
limit or on the limit so it is like it
is crazy that these gamers alike if
you're like I'm so good yeah you might
be good actually thanks I'm oh so yeah
there you go it's it's a it's a real
simulator I guess that's amazing uh that
brings us to our hashtag the day which I
thought would be fun TD Drive which is
what video game could you go pro at in
real life and no pong for crying out
loud geez we're done with pong guys yeah
that's good just no more blocking your
life I don't know ping pong oh yeah
Larry um so what would you be good at
what's the what's your what's the thing
that you could go pro at in real life I
I would I guess I'd have to pick a goat
simulator goat simulator just like you
know being a goat totally crumbling
crying stuff with my being a microwave
simulators I'm pretty good madeleine
stowe medalist what about you I'd be
really good at that cat swiping gamer
you just go and knock things off shelves
like that give me the gold medal in that
I just like rage out and just like knock
things off shelves and just keep going
that's what I would do not a single one
of us answered seriously but only they
will so it's TV right you don't I mean
do fine it's TT race TD dry TD Drive can
you drive me drive tell us tell us
please because I'd like it thinks
something you're gonna come up with some
really good serious answers like duck
hunt or you know whatever or you know
like deer hunter it's just like I go in
whoa George there's a little girl shit
but like or like bowling we bowling or
something but I'd like some of you are
gonna come up with crazy answers and I
am gonna take it too far I can i
encourage that I encourage you to cross
the line it was gonna like Mortal Kombat
crap of sorrow i repel ppl spines and
simulator yay alright alright um so this
last story is about a robot that is
extremely dexterous I thought this was
so funny when I saw the video on friday
i was like we have to have this in the
show we have to talk about it this comes
from the robotics company Reese queered
and here's the robot it's called the
highly dexterous manipulation system HD
ms so that's what they this is short get
out of here
so here it is using a zip tie it has two
arms in a robotic torso that can rotate
it's designed for mobile system so like
you would put it on something that would
be able to you know go somewhere and it
uses re square it's imitative controller
tech which I'll explain in a second but
the cool thing about this particular
robot is that it can handle some really
delicate work like making balloon
animals for example and any of that yeah
we do it so here it is it's it's making
a fish which is pretty basic like I get
that I don't understand game robot but
here's the thing it's not popping a
balloon which is really impressive and
it inflates the balloon as well like in
the beginning oh really yeah and so
there it is it's got it and it can do
other things too like check out
suspicious packages and handle flammable
material and it can it's using a box
cutter like first of all I don't want
robots using box cutters that makes me
very nervous oh this is crazy so here's
okay so you're probably wondering how
it's controlled and this is the thing
that I thought was really cool is that
idea by itself well no it's a person
inside there like proprietary control
system called imitative control and so
here he is with the thing and he's
actually using the robot arms to do all
the different things and I just thought
this was so awesome that Reese word is
doing this obviously you can see in the
video it sped up to time so it's he's
moving very slowly in real life but I
just thought this was awesome that's
like okay so maybe instead of like
autonomous robots like let's focus on
something that a human can control and
do things that are extremely delicate so
they were showing like bomb defusal like
oh you this could defuse a bomb or it
could check out a suspicious package
they did a thing where it had like a
duffel bag it unzip the duffel bag and
pulled out clothes and was like okay
it's all clear like it's all good so I
just thought that was really awesome
pressure work though like because you
sent wasn't popping the balloon is he
responsible for not pushing it to
believe so yeah I think it's like he's
he's in control of how tightly the robot
grips anything so in its I mean if you
kind of have to guess a little bit and I
believe that he said something along
like i think they popped like nine
different balloons with a brush i was
gonna say he's responsible for being bad
at making balloon animals not the robot
yes exactly but um but yeah so not quite
replacing all the clam
at kids birthday parties I don't know if
people even still do that but but
definitely definitely pretty cool and I
really just like this idea of again like
I think the big forefront of robotics is
going to end up being sending robots
into situations where you don't want to
send a person so it's you know like this
would be a rescue is what they always
say bomb defusal rescue like all that
stuff so I really thought that was so
cool and I i actually have never I'd
never seen a system quite like that
imitative control so I thought that was
really neat you guys it was incredibly
responsive yeah it was it was it was
unreal and now like it's much cooler
this he can cut a little paper snowflake
look at that mean this robots using a
pair of scissors like very dexterous
incredibly dexterous which I just
thought was so impressed he also looks a
little nervous to his cane yeah i know i
know it's imperfect he's on cam right I
know he's super scared like oh one of my
mom robots watching yeah it's like what
if my girlfriend doesn't like this
papers no Blake my robot girlfriend
doesn't like this paper snowflake
valentine's Day is coming up oh oh okay
there's another thing is that it says
it's sped up two times too right yeah so
a lot of them out you'll see like 2x or
3x like I think one of them even might
have been for X but it's like it takes
time for the robot to actually do all
these things but it can it can even cut
very cool I like this guy yeah so that's
it for our stories we're gonna take a
quick break we'll be right back with a
round of back of her hackett we also
have your user feedback from last week
which are kind of amazing and then also
our photogra for the day so don't click
way it's tomorrow daily also check out
kale
welcome back to the show we have
returned I'm assuming you're controlling
the robot that is running the tricaster
in the other room cuz / dude pretty good
worked so hard to this ready gave him
the day off go to Ashley's camera now
very good come back at a bag back okay
okay there we go we're good excellent
all right guys every week we like to
take a look at a crowdfunded or
crowdfunding project and tell you if we
would like it or not so this is Becker
Hackett I found this very fascinating
and I'm I am very curious to see if
you'd be interested in this because this
seems like one of those things would be
like a gimmick I don't want it or you'd
be like wow this is amazing I gotta have
it so this is called neo and these are
headphones I know that headphones are
sort of thing that is a little bit of a
saturated market I get that but these in
particular I thought were very
interesting because so you when you
listen a sound in general you tend to
either hear it in mono or stereo or even
surround sound but when you move your
head the sound stays relative to your to
your head position it stays in the same
spot so let's say you hear something
behind you let's say you turned all the
way around the sound would still sound
like it was coming from behind you am i
right yes like always behind you okay
these headphones if you turn your head
let's say you hear a sound behind you if
you turn your head around it changes the
audio to sound like it's in front of you
okay so it's like spatially aware of
your head right okay okay it hasn't
really been done a whole lot before um
it would be like if if you imagined a
whole bunch of speakers like around you
for 5.1 sound so if you regularly moved
your head you would still it kind of
does this right so the sound always is
in the same position based on where your
head is all right so but this I get the
cons this pair of headphones moves with
you again if you turn around then the
sound
you just looked at is now in the front
of your headphones as opposed to the
back which is pretty interesting so they
called it psychosis basically it's
basically like virtual three-dimensional
sound where it's awesome they call it
they do call it three days out you're in
the sound space okay so um they they're
looking to change the way that we kind
of listen to stuff but there are some
caveats here so really interesting pair
of headphones I'm I'm interested however
only works via an app right now because
the app has to parse algorithms to
change that's found in your movies and
stuff to that previous starter let's
give them a break all right okay so only
iOS no Android availability right now
also no computer availability so not uh
nope no pc or gaming or virtual reality
availability they say they are it is in
development and depending on how much
money they make in the Kickstarter will
kind of oh they need the gaming angle
real bad yeah one hundred percent I and
the computer angle let's be here sorry
um so you can use the headphones without
the app and you just get regular sound
so it's like you can use the headphones
at act like regular pair focuses our
rate and let if you don't have the app
available so let's see you have an
android phone up to 30 sound sources can
be virtualized so if you have like 30
different sound sources it can like use
the algorithm to change all of them at
the same time as you can read I'm
thinking um okay so here's here's the
price are you ready for the price no
place sounds stupid expensive it sounds
like three hundred fifty dollars it's no
more expensive than an expensive pair of
head a headset a game it so what is it
though right now there's a few left that
I saw at the 209 dollar earlybird level
but the regular original like
Kickstarter price is 249 which is about
a parent like Astro headset like
mastro's gaming headset so it's not
terribly unreasonable but it's
definitely out of the price range of a
lot of folks so and they do say that
they will deliver by june of this year
which i think is incredibly fast
kickstarter very ambitious and i am a
little skeptical of that but they say
they can do it so i don't know is it are
you in you gonna buy something they
didn't mention they didn't really talk
about movies that's the place read once
because like it is Jurassic Park and I
want to like and I hear the Velociraptor
in the back
be able to turn around so that's right
they're saying that you will be able to
open a movie through your your iPhone
like so they and they have like
different places that you can access
like Dropbox Box itunes like anything
you can access via your iphone or ipad
on I excuse me on iOS you're going to be
able to use the app through so anything
like movies TV shows whatever on your
phone that you can access you should be
able to use the headphones okay so do
you would you do it yeah all right I'm
say you're in oh man dig it yeah I mean
there's I think it would be best for
concerts like any of the concert music
like that Dale Adia buddies which I
don't know why you would turn away from
the music oh you turn to your friends
your virtual friends get your head
Center girl i love this concert it is
very gimmicky a little gaming you're
gonna end up facing forward and also
you're gonna like you to be like and
then if somebody calls you in your look
and it's gonna like ruin your experience
but again i just get gaming is where
this this needs to happen I this is like
the only focus beaming the game yeah
yeah because you wear headphones when
you're playing like call of duty to like
listen for footsteps of course you're
where people are moving cuz when they
reload you can hear it so then you could
like turn and you can hear exactly where
it's coming all spatial awareness that's
what that's all about so tell you what
hack it until they do gaming okay I'm
gonna agree with you I think I think no
I vote no until you can get it for
oculus rift and console and PC games
yeah that's what I cuz it's really cool
that it can do like the music and movies
described like that but ultimately I'll
be cool with that for like five minutes
and then I'll be like all right shut
that off let's just listen the music so
so I for that as well so that's a that's
our backer Hackett um and so both will
say hack until gaming but neos over on
Kickstarter if you want to check it out
all right now it is time to go over all
the delightful things you guys have said
to us over the weekend so it is time for
user feedback
last week we asked you guys to use
hashtag TD wax to tell us what's seen
you'd want to like walk through like
it's recreated in wax on because we did
the Madame Tussauds Star Wars experience
that they're doing in London you guys
came up with some good stuff gimme gimme
yum yum I don't know how to pronounce
your name so I'm just gonna say yummy he
says Hogwarts castle are they all gonna
be a harry potter again no okay uh tom
wrote to us and say that's a good one
easy the simpsons how cool it on the
couch was Homer wax yep yep wow yeah
that's great I thought that was really
good one yeah uh Nate wrote in and said
Coraline with the witch Alice in
Wonderland and spirited away can I just
say uh Alice aware that was a good
choice Coraline with the witch scene
like I thought about that cuz i love
Coraline like I keds huge round movie in
the book and I thought that that is the
biggest bucket of nightmare fuel I think
I've ever heard of are you like walking
to Madame Tussauds and it's like that
terrifying nightmare scene is like the
other mother and she's a spider it's
like that's horrifying to me and I just
thought that was really funny that you
would say that like oh that seems like a
thing I'd want to go do like you're
weird guy nay at night I like it Caleb
said I'd want to experience the say my
name Breaking Bad seen my show so much
to two-parter on this I seem like taking
a selfie with Walt liked it I know just
like what up Heisenberg uh two things
with this please don't send me any more
walking debt are very Breaking Bad to
spoilers because I'm right in the middle
of watching it I'm almost done the most
I mean that wasn't a spoiler but I the
eyes but I'm right in the middle of
season four and I just want to protect
myself please don't send over any you
stop doing everything cuz I'm even
during the Super Bowl they had the well
they have that but I'd like that's fine
cuz I've seen him like making you know
cooking and stop fine whatever but like
and I know that his nickname is
Heisenberg like that's it so I get it
but like please don't send anything more
specific like send generic if you're
gonna said anything about breaking bad
just sent in generic which we're listen
the husband and I were barreling through
we're trying really hard to get through
it as fast as we can so to avoid spars I
have been lucky
off to avoid all breaking bad spoilers
on the internet I have not seen one
breaking bad spoiler which I feel like
I'm the only person in the university's
not been spoiled so I literally avoided
the internet for like two days after the
series finale as to but not I don't want
to know what happens so there you go and
then Rob wrote to us and gave us a whole
list of stuff which I love he gave us a
bunch of green oh god here we go I'd
like to see 1420 at Elm Street which is
Nancy's house from a nightmare on elm
street I like that he knew the address
Hathaway house western hills psychiatric
hospital from a nightmare on elm street
707 meridian avenue mike myers house
smiths grove mental institution Camp
Camp Crystal Lake Xavier Institute for
gifted youngsters the Batcave Arkham
Asylum mansion her police station and
resonate evil I like our mansion or
police station from Resident Evil I
should say scary stuff it's all really
scary stuff but I'd like I dig it I'm
into it and Rob I think you can actually
see all those not built in wax but at
like Universal Studios Halloween Horror
Nights that's true sport go do some of
that stuff which I enjoy greatly I love
love all that stuff i like i like scary
movie i cor movies and i love it it's
great so good yeah that's alright that's
our user feedback so it's Everlast pc
user feedback though which is our phone
time for the day
Tom wrote in to us you know yeah it's
about time Tom really uh he said hi
Ashley and Kayla I was looking at my
office window on a Friday afternoon and
snapped these hearts made by tire tracks
in the snow with my hand es for tomorrow
Delia's appointment TV for me and my
family of five on cnet throat good
channel we enjoy being informed with
your tech fun PS I'd be a hero to my
techie daughters if I can make it as a
phone tog refer take it easy Tom near
Toronto hi Tom's family Tom near Toronto
is now here by nickname TNT Tom near
Toronto that's your nickname DMV Tom TNT
explosive yeah um he's a gas explosive I
love this picture its little heart so
that you in the snow yeah Tom you
actually does it like we're not even
we're not even trying to impress your
family these are really good guys are
actually pretty good I I dig it I'm
really impressed hi family hello Tom
TNT's family oh we're a part of it we're
part of the family there yeah we're part
of TNTs family now I'm just invited
ourselves to be a part of your family
are coming over for Thanksgiving ones
canadian thanksgiving Tom I don't know

greatest thing I've ever seen I'll know
it when I see it still always I'm all
right but pretty good i mean to tell me
i say in the 90th plus percentile like
that's up there it's really good it's
really good um alright guys if you want
to submit your pictures to be considered
for our photogra for the day you can
email us tomorrow at cnet com tell us
what what phone you took it with and
give us a little story because we like
that little stories and if you want to
send your user feedback that way you can
too or if you absolutely hate email you
can find us on I feel like I should
taking a big deep breath facebook
instagram twitter snapchat tumblr at
tomorrow daily and tomorrow daily TV
over on google+ don't let you nail them
all it's pretty much everything to right
you did say snapchat whoa still getting
over
hurdle I don't even know yeah we're
trying to fake listen we're old we're
old we have canes and some walkers we
don't understand it's not even that it's
not even that it's just you just how
many things did you name and how hard is
it to like wrangle down on all the
really hard so really hard mostly mostly
our actions happening on Twitter most
Twitter see Twitter an email the email
ones cuz they're very intimate yeah I
like that anyway I don't forget to check
us out on youtube there's a whole
conversation going on there in the
comments don't forget to subscribe like
yeah when you subscribe there you
