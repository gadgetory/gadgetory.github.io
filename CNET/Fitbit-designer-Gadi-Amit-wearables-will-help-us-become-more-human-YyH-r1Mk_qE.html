easy as making technology look sexy
just ask Guardium it's the creative mind
behind several iconic products like the
unconventional light ray camera and the
Fitbit fitness tracker having been at
the forefront of wearable design Guardi
is well-placed to give us an insight
into the devices of the future first of
all I don't think people will have 10/10
watches or gadgets on their on your
wrist
second I think the term gadget is
somewhat derogatory we are moving into a
situation with these objects of
electronics and digital thinking will
become inherent to our existence we
already see that with a mobile phone I
think it's the most person personal
object you have and with wearables it
will grow even further
now most wearables will probably be
hidden and a lot of the fitbit's are
hidden and they were built to be hidden
they'll have functions that are medical
you have functions that are about
communication between you and people
around you and environments around you
and we're just at the beginning I think
it's it's an interesting phenomena the
hype there is hype now about these and
they're very simple today they're
basically kinetic motion and sensors
dealing only with cardiovascular health
but this is just the beginning we'll
have things that are dealing with your
brain with your mental state with access
privileges with a variety of medical
conditions that could be really assisted
by electronic online digital
functions and so on so I could easily
see that the peak of this world this
wearable industry will come only in
about 10 years so and there won't be
gadgets there'll be who we are what we
are yeah and the interesting thing I
mean when I say that people immediately
jump to a conclusion that will be sigh
Birds actually this is my goal with
designing this is that we won't be
cyborgs we actually will become more
human and more free from the technology
I think what we have now in the design
business there are there are two camps
there is the camp that there wants to
create a lot of data and wants people to
analyze a lot of data and there is the
other camp which I belong to that tries
to create devices that are not smart
there are actually wise there are more
than smart there are wise enough to
understand you and actually to filter
and allow you to go on with your life
with all their data basically processing
the background
giving you just hints of what is
essential when it is essential for might
follow function but that doesn't always
make for a great product so how does it
designer know when they've hit the nail
on the head smile there's always this
the interesting thing and every great
product that we've done that moment that
we first showed it to the client the
concept you would know within a second
honestly a second if it if it's going or
not and then later on that second eye
actually translated to reality with the
consumer mind there is some very unique
moment where people are being delighted
let's call it time to delight and it's a
it's it's a fraction of a second where
every
understand intuitively that there is
something interesting here that is new
at the same time it is pushing some
known buttons in your emotions and
that's what we're looking for and and
the Fitbit had it Lytro and ARRA has it
everyone understand there's something
there it's new and it is the ability to
create some kind of a new form icon that
is explaining the technology in a new
way that is understood intuitively and
it has a little twist that caused people
to smile and every time it happened
every time it happened we had a success
