after show I'm Patrick I'm Caitlin I'm
Lin and we're all CNN editors who are
big fans of the show Westworld today on
our show we get to talk with actor James
Marsden who plays Teddy flood and I'm
going to make a variation of the last
word and we'll be recapping episode 5
akane know my so if you don't like
spoilers you should probably leave now
what are you doing here if you don't
like spoilers yeah why did you even
click on this video what do we think
just general thoughts when we saw this
episode we're finally I'm happy about it
it's good to be to feature it right in
the middle of the season I think you
know sometimes seasons hit a little bit
of a lull and then just having Shogun
just inject some really good energy into
it some bloody fantastic energy yeah I
like the one line the heads like yeah
this is the sugar one else for the
people who think West world's a little
tamer like ever done that but okay I
mean we see that with her that was
unexpectedly bloody and yeah there's
just so much violence but at the same
time do you think it lived up to the
hype it had do you think it lived up to
the build-up of all this time ever
talking about coming and seeing Shogun
world did it live up to that for you
guys yes ish I hope we're not done I
hope by saying yes it's like met my
expectations it doesn't mean that we're
gonna leave show the world anytime soon
I really enjoyed what we saw and I hope
we get a little bit more I really liked
it I felt it lived up to all my
expectations and I just hope that it's
not a sidequest that people that they're
gonna continue with these characters and
then it's gonna be all three parks with
some mega uprising yeah I could agree
more in fact we'd love to hear what you
guys think fact you want you could take
our poll do you guys think that Shogun
world lived up to all the build up a tad
and you can take it right now while you
guys are doing the poll we're gonna
actually go to Kaitlyn's cocktail corner
and get this episode's cocktail
today we'll do a variation of the last
word using mezcal instead of gin it'll
be equal parts mezcal maraschino liqueur
green chartreuse and lime juice three
quarters of an ounce of each shaken over
ice and then strain into a glass
oh I like this one's my favorite yeah
good yay I'm glad you guys like it so as
I was saying typically it's made with
gin but I like miss calibers yeah we
discussed this video discussing it so
let's just jump right back in to Kiev
and were like OOP there's so much so the
first thing we want I think we should
talk about is kind of the bizarro
characters with it those are the mirror
copy storyline which I thought was
probably one of the funniest episodes of
West Road we've seen and and then how
even the characters reacted to the
doppelganger so I love I just love the
pasting of it because it's not very
obvious but you're but once the music
starts like wait a minute we're seeing
this stick up with the vault and then
watching the characters from West world
seeing that this play out and they're
like oh my god I'm not even an original
person and I really like how Hector
didn't like his doppelganger he's played
by an actor called Europe named Hiroyuki
Sanada he's from the og ring so I really
loved him and he's just such a badass
he's from los 2 which as the parallels
between West world and lost everyone's
like oh don't you know jump off the deep
end here West world in second season
that really reminded me of lost I was
like oh love him loved his roles and all
kinds of different stuff he's been in a
lot of - like sci-fi properties extant
helix a couple other ones but yeah I
like him I like him yeah I love the way
they reacted to their doppelganger I
loved that they each had a different one
yeah or a different interpretation I
mean yeah like Armas is likely in love
with her doppelganger
dude that's kind of them when the
Armistice is tied up and she warns I
don't we don't I don't think she hasn't
even but I was just calling her like the
dragon lady yeah when the dragon lady is
like and we can't lie to her like even a
snake could be a dragon and then she's
such a frayed there's this is a moment
of like bewilderment and we've never
seen armistice act like that before
or like oh man she's badass and now
she's like just melting well she was the
first one to to recognize that they were
them she goes boo
well I have to say that was on the fair
part was seeing Li react to all this
because I thought last season maybe his
characters a little bit of a douchebag
I'm not the only one who thought that
but this character this season you can
see he really cares about the host not
only their stories and how they react
like in the last episode with maven
Hector but here you could see like he's
really proud like hey you have a lot of
stuff we may have recycled things but he
knows exactly what's going on even if it
doesn't go exactly the way he thought it
would yeah I also like it how they were
kind of hating on him it's like you just
copied us he's like look you try to
write so many narratives it's fine I
didn't know oh no they they said like oh
please dries is like it's not plagiarism
look I copied my own self writing team
yeah is it really just Lee in a basement
just writing on he's like it took me
will you try coming up with 300
different stories in two weeks like okay
yeah I could see Ford being a hard boss
to work for however one of the most
brilliant things I thought I think it's
pretty clever and I hope there's more
payoff like this it's like oh you guys
already all know how to speak the
language it's buried in you you just
have to you have to find it and I think
that's also not only for the language
but there might be some other things we
see later with Maeve where that's true
where there's maybe some capabilities
they all have but they just don't aren't
able to use them or aren't always
accessing them but when she starts
speaking Japanese and when Simon and
when Lee starts speaking Japanese it's
just really cool
I think she's reminding me a lot of Neil
just she's just transcending she's
having all these superpowers she's
learning she's catching on to everything
really quickly she's always the first
one to learn all the languages and all
this stuff and I just think like she's
just kind of she's basically kind of the
one and I love the shot where she's
walking past while all those samurais
are killing each other I'm just like I'm
just gonna do my boo do magic on you
guys and it's weird because I feel like
we're setting up we've always set up for
Dolores to kind of be the one and maybe
she is the one else also but it's a very
different we see two different ways this
kind of new freedom they have are
playing out with Maeve and Dolores I
think that Maeve and Dolores are two
sides of the same coin we see that Maeve
is
tapping into these innate abilities that
yes they might all have but not all of
them are awake enough to realize hey
they have them or be they can access
that I think too when we see her
preparing for when the ninjas come and
when she kind of does her voodoo magic
I think she's you know we would call it
telepathic but in reality as a host
she's using that mesh network and
manipulating it to her own ends so even
though Lee kind of gets a little
standoffish and a little scared of her
she's not able to control him she just
can run the but the hopes it's I think
there's a bit of that he's frightened
but else I think he's also just really
curious at this point like what the
hell's gonna happen
how far can it go how far could it go
and like what is happening because I
don't think he really understands exact
was happening with her but he knows
something is happening he's seeing all
the tangible aspects absolutely I think
he might betray them too because him and
may are disagreeing so I know you said
that he started or he's trying to care a
lot about the host but I think with this
set he's really disagree with me if he
doesn't know if you know her course of
action is the best course of action and
we see him steal like this kind of like
walkie talkie
and keep it to himself and we've seen in
the beginning that he has thrown me
under the bus before so he might do it
again he has the secret walkie talkie we
don't know why he do you think do you
think there's a canyon witness to his
interest or do you think he's just
putting on that facade for Maeve and
Hector I mean he's a survivor I think
that's basically he's doing this to
survive through Westworld
and then if the time comes where he
needs to betray them maybe he will to
survive as well so yeah I think he's
always gonna put himself first and
what's interesting too is to her
favorite supporting characters Felix and
Sylvester they're there but I get lost
in the shuffle but they're no weird wake
up like like us is the audience is
reacting like what so the episode is
called a con a no my which we looked up
and it's akane dances so we kind of knew
we'd see something about that here but
you were really talking about how a chi
is a little different from mave akane
actually has someone who is like a
daughter to her yeah that's her
narrative and it's it's cool to see
Maeve
see witness her doppelganger have a kind
of slightly different narrative it's not
like maybe isn't motherly she did have
Clementine in Mariposa but it's just
nice to see her seeing the differences
also and and the actress who plays akane
Rinko Kikuchi she's just so great and
she you could see like all the pain it's
such a muted performance but I really
loved her throughout the whole it's so
powerful
yeah and what else was she from she's
from a specific rim boy people trash on
it but that's a good really great and I
was like one of my favorite lines of the
episode was a moment between her and
Maeve when he says you can be whoever
you want like and there's like
definitely this like empowerment going
on but also it's weird because they're
parallel but they're very different
it's the same speech that made gives to
some of the people that come into the
thing but it's just kind of nice hearing
it in just a slower pick it was just so
meaningful and poignant versus like oh
you can go screw and shoot everything
it's actually kind of deep so you'll
remember previously when Mae was giving
that speech in the very beginning of the
west-world season one we saw her have
that more muted performance we saw her
give that lower tone slower drawn-out Oh
faraway look kind of thing and they
actually didn't like how it was playing
with the customers so they upped her
aggression and they upped her horniness
for lack of a better word so that more
patrons would respond to it because she
was a madam and that's what she was
there for yeah but that speech never
really resonated with me when she was
telling you know the customers you could
be whatever you want is kind of like
right what you said like you could
basically fuck whoever you want but then
when you hear it just basically the same
speech with a different audience for a
different context it's just so sad she's
telling her daughter figure that this
one right yeah or even think of it like
sisters talking like it's like yeah you
can you can do this like we have this in
common and I'm further along in that
journey that you are but you can be
whoever you want I mean I believe you
I'm an only child but also there's like
some total like no Lee shit where it's
like yeah we're going to say those same
lines and have them have much
which is the whole doppelganger setup
right it's very much look out this
situation changes when we put it in a
different setting look at how everything
reads differently when we transplant it
and I love that about this episode what
do you guys think about there was a lot
of action in this episode what do you
guys think about all the action scenes I
really love the action I thought that
actor Sanada was just so good with his
combat training and sword fighting is
just so badass and it's weird because we
there's always been parent listening
like westerns and samurai movies like
the famous one Kurosawa movie that got
remade into the Magnificent Seven but
there's a big difference between a
gunfight and a samurai sword fight and I
think that was part of the fun or that's
what I've been hoping for for Shogun
where it's like the fights are now maybe
bloodier but there's so much more
attention because you're so much
physically closer to somebody with a
sword or knife not that there's no guns
yeah okay well and then we start that's
actually a great line and I can't
remember this set of so you can help me
if I get hurt I think it was like they
were under estimating them like what did
I tell you about bringing a sword to a
gunfight yeah and they just beat their
ass guys lots of them yeah
now now didn't anybody tell you about
bringing a sword to a gunfight and then
all of a sudden the dragon lady lassos
that this is awesome
I also like that in really small detail
is that when they are being held hostage
the knots it's like in the Japanese and
I started good not I really like the
attention - yes Oh Judy knows so good
you can see on their backs even their
hands and things like that
oh so while that's going on another
storyline that's going on is Dolores and
Teddy and man that is well some lifetime
shit happen in there you know now they
finally make some robot love yeah you
see we see some robot ass yeah it was
hard to kind of is I didn't know what I
was looking at was like an elbow or a
shoulder
that was actually a highlight of episode
for me it's like the elbow it remind me
a lot of the opening sequence so just
the up-close body and curves and stuff
like I remember in the first season the
opening titles were two hosts having set
yeah yeah but the storyline is so tragic
because Teddy you know he's just doing
everything right he genuinely cares
about her and she's just like you know
some people don't deserve it and you're
too soft so I'm gonna crank up your
aggression
what do you guys think of that moment
i'm julie regret it what if he's like a
terrible person
she didn't outright kill him that's her
well did she go metaphorically kill him
though because it's like hey we're gonna
have this amazing night of love and then
i'm gonna completely she did she did
black widow him first sure it's a little
scary
I don't think Teddy Teddy has gone
forever
like I don't think our nice guy teddy as
you're saying is gone forever
right she did bump his aggression all
the way up I'd say a lot more aggressive
but that didn't they didn't we didn't
see them dragony thing down his loyalty
didn't go down nothing else kind of
really enthusiast it of course of course
however I don't think all of Teddy is
gone plus what if bumping his aggression
up wakes him up oh yeah so she could
like he's against her and he's like oh
yeah any aggressive but I'm still the
same Teddy with the same beliefs and I'm
holding on to the moment they had
because I there was so much satisfaction
I think while we were watching it one of
the eyeshadow I was like we never never
gotten to see this part because he's
always fighting off the guests who ends
up getting do yes they said before that
his role is specifically just for the
guests to beat up so they get to do
Dolores so it's nice that they do I mean
before the scary thing happened but it's
nice that they have some moment to
themselves but they were kind of nervous
about it kind of I mean like not to talk
about virginity a little bit but it was
a different thing they probably hadn't
so much sec to so many people where a
guess but this they are actually
choosing to do that and I thought in a
weird very poetic way the way they shot
that scene as well was much more about
them being together in that Union which
just set us up for when they ripped it
apart and like were to make you more
aggressive see what happens
I also there's so Starcross because the
last really nice scene that we saw
together with him was in the last
episode of first season when they were
on the beach and they were saying
goodbye and then it there's the wide
shot where it's just for the audience
and you're like and that was so jarring
and so perfect and then this time
something Bad's got to happen because
they they're these two Cathy no no it's
great for shadowing in
same same level of now we've been
trained that when something good happens
we know it's gonna be couple something
bad will follow well yeah that's a great
segue because speak of something good
happens we got to talk to James Marsden
who plays Teddy flood and so we're gonna
throw it out of the kitchen and let's
pick it up with interview with Jason
thanks for speaking to saying it today
thanks for sitting down with me I read
that you were on a need-to-know basis
with season one when it came to scripts
were you just as confused as we all were
watching yes yes
yeah the first season I didn't even
maybe one or two episodes in I would try
to figure it all out and understand
where it was all going and what the end
game was and then once I you know my
hand got tired of knocking on the the
writers door like what does this mean
with his mean then they would sort of
respond in a very gracious informative
but not informative way I would like
okay they don't really necessarily want
me to know so I started going more down
the path of surrendering to not knowing
so I was okay with with not necessarily
you know as long as I knew what was
going on like that I was informed for
what scene we were shooting at the time
I didn't need to necessarily know that
you know what the puzzle looked like at
the end did you guys have any crazy fan
theories or what's the weirdest fan
theory I heard during during the making
of the show the conversations that were
common were like oh X is a human or X is
a host and you'd you know it's like Ford
is a host or like you know Ed Harris is
a host your buddy you know all these
other you know Barnard is a host and so
there was a lot of that going on it's
like who's a robot who wasn't but as far
as like you know the really you know the
bigger picture reveals of what this you
know this is where the story goes and
what the whole point of this journey is
I think we all were like you know what
I'm not smart enough to understand it
just yet so we just kind of like set
back and let it reveal itself in its own
time yeah that's probably a good way to
do it so best way to watch the show -
yeah um season two obviously a lot has
changed what are you most excited to see
fan reactions - you know the whole first
season the the hosts were the ones that
you empathized with and you know they
were a population of people who were the
oppressed essentially and now you know
what happens when when the power dynamic
shifts and this group of people now have
the stronghold and what that does to the
allegiances of the audience like are we
gonna still feel empathetic for these
people you know sometimes when that
group of people who the oppressed you
know they start to take on the behavior
of the oppressor so these are things
that we we just discuss or we explore
this this time around so it'll be
interesting to see where they're
empathise the audience's empathise lie
we saw in the trailer that Dolores says
that um the hosts are fighting for the
right to live
pretty deep question for you do you
think robots should have as many rights
as humans in this world do you think
that they should well yeah I mean I
think the show asks several deep
questions like that I think one of the
great things you know if you were at the
core of the show it is asking what it
means to be human it if you have these
sentient creatures who are programmed to
accrue memories have experiences exhibit
human-like emotion behavior what keeps
them from being human why aren't they
human so you know in at the beginning of
the first season you see these
characters being used and abused to
really kind of sickening levels that's
at some times and so that's why the
audience the first season was like oh my
god the the humans are despicable these
these creatures are virtuous
thereby does they're designed by humans
but why am i siding with them because
they're being you know they there's a
purity to them that is being abused so I
love that the show asks these questions
it's you know we're holding a mirror up
to ourselves and asking really what it
means to be human and if a thing that's
made out of nuts and bolts and wires and
can have a soul or feel how is that any
lesser than human being james marsden
you're an actor singer dancer former
Versace model how do we know that you're
not a robot you don't it's a very robot
thing to say why don't I throw some
questions or requests yes Siri answer
let's start with Bernhard's favorite do
you ever question your own reality often
alright you're on a runaway trolley
approaching a fork in the tracks and on
the left are all these evil robots from
West world and all this morality test
okay singing robots from it's a small
world who are you gonna crush what's on
the other side evil robots from West
world singing robots from it's a small
world well I would argue that the robot
the evil robots from West Road or not so
evil I would I would probably I have a
bias there so I would I would probably
mow over the small world once because I
see that those were built in the fifties
but walking in the desert when all of a
sudden you see it toward us and you bend
down and flip it onto its back why do
you do that James I didn't do that good
answer all right final question you've
done a lot of Hollywood interviews now
do you ever feel inconsistencies in your
world or repetitions sure yeah but
that's life and it's like there's a
there's a random formula to at all that
maybe isn't so random if you look at it
from a full abstract way this is how our
show run our talks to us by the way you
get no answers you just you just
here abstract answers but yes I think
that's part of it if it's too linear I
wouldn't trust it I guess all right
James man I think you're probably not I
just messed my way through all of those
questions that's the best way to do it
that's how humans do it thanks for
speaking with saying that no you got it
all right welcome back to the kitchen we
are going to jump straight into our
third timeline kind of where we saw
Bernard Carl strand Kosta and we had a
glimpse of Teddy and hundreds of other
hosts that were piloted so we can kind
of infer that they have been dredging
the lake ocean they just have the pool
net yeah and they're there they're
fishing out how to swim the pool to be
that board like all right tech you're
gonna be fixing out dead naked people
who you don't know okay why are they oh
if they're not naked you have to make a
meal you have to undress them yeah we
don't want to lose the clothes I'm all
out undress them throw them in the heaps
we also see them pulling out their light
bulbs yeah they're trying to see what
they have seen right so Kosta is looking
at them and he's seeing like a lot of
them have missing a 30 mm ry shit yeah
what wait why who do you think did that
what do you think happened to that I bet
it rhymes with Bernard oh I don't know
because we obviously you said that line
at the end of the first episode and
every time I say that line you are you
make like so I was like ah
so Mike maybe is it a lie just but not
think he did it but something can wiped
out almost all of those hosts one of the
most disturbing shots there's so many in
this episode with violence is just
seeing the met all the hosts naked piled
up kind of lifeless on top and seeing
Bernard see that I just that to cook me
up really bad
Bernard looks like he has some serious
PTSD and I know he says he can't
remember but you see him staring
lifeless at these empty hosts and you're
just like oh my god poor Bernard
yeah he's seeing some shit yeah I feel
for him
as strange as that sounds I know thinks
he thinks that he killed them I saw him
in the camp that he did not do that
but for him to see that and come to
grips with that and be like oh my gosh I
did this so if he didn't kill them the
natural question is who did kill them
themselves maybe maybe he posited that
that maybe they just wipe themselves
maybe they wipe themselves in an
accident but would it who prompted them
to wipe themselves so I have this theory
I know what I'm getting that yeah it's
very that Teddy who we see in one of
these hosts kind of laying there
lifeless or teddy poor teddy teddy flood
Teddy but got a lot of play this episode
by the way I'm here for that yeah I'm on
I'm okay with the female gaze but
there's a lot of long claws and a james
marsden contract Oh another butt shot
okay did we ask him if that was his but
for real I don't know oh yeah I remember
when he talked about the but in the
interview yeah but that way if we have
the book so my theory is that when
Delores bumps his aggression up and we
see her kind of wanting him to take more
initiative and kind of wake up that he
is actually the one who destroys the
cradle and kind of sort of kills slash
wipes all these hosts including himself
because I think that he's being a Trojan
horse I think that he's going to wake up
I don't think any of those hosts are
really like truly dead as we know what
his dead may never die
oh wait that's Game of Thrones and that
applies here six serious oh boy did you
feel it worked a Sex in the City
yeah so there's a really strange season
right yeah what's up as we know what is
dead may never die when it comes to
robots and I think that teddy is going
to you know either be awakened or wake
himself up and his ultimate goal was to
be in the Mesa to either capture other
data or to start leaving start getting
out of the park so going along those
threads here what snow look it still
talked there I think it's fine
is uh if he's the one who's controlling
teddy
himself he's anyone exactly well or is a
delivery I would say of listening this I
think it's actually a brilliant theory
but I wonder if it's more dolores and
those that's her play is manipulating
teddy - in which case his journey would
take him like that in which case she's
the one who comes off with no blood on
her hands in a sense or no cortical
fluid on her hands I wonder is like she
should have you know kind of tweaked
other things like loyalty and like
compassion because if he didn't believe
she didn't yeah cuz if he's aggressive
but he's not any of those things he
could like turn on her very quickly and
how is she gonna control that well I
guess she could get that tech to do it
again I don't like that army of people
to control yeah you know I just tossed
Teddy let him do he's soft he's just not
cut out for this let him go you know and
then just get all the other people that
she rather we know she has no qualms
about killing people she's like and not
everyone deserves to make the journey
well I mean no she has no qualms killing
someone who disagrees with her reporters
actually agree with her exactly and we
know she still has the tech guy cuz we
see him walking onto the train so we
know they're going on that journey
together let's talk about the trick
because I also think that's like a
little bit of a buried moment - I think
we know where that's going and was yeah
we think going to Mesa hopefully if we
think it's going to Mesa but but they
did build those weird random train
tracks though in correct direction where
are they going yeah because it was going
west as opposed to north north and even
though that was last episode that was
one of the images it was just amazed was
disturbing for sure the bodies becoming
the rails for them also what's gonna
happen when those bodies decompose cuz
those rails are getting it's gotta get
off the rim because I only were doing it
for the Train okay I was just like this
is just bad infrastructure like log must
make log well but I mean I I do think
that the the train they were on they
they want to get to Peter and she knows
that that's one exit out of the park so
like a western cut him off the pass kind
of thing hmm
literally was good exactly so what were
your favorite absolutely favorite
moments of this episode then my favorite
moment was
Felix when his the mean lab guy was like
can't you talk to them and he's like I'm
from Hong Kong asshole that was just so
it made me laugh out loud as an
asian-american that really hit me in a
very personal space and thank you Felix
for saying that I really appreciated it
and semester to jerkface
yeah Sylvester well we already knew he's
just there as a foil to be a poopface
he's very good at it yeah my favorite
moment was somebody allude to earlier
with Maeve taking control and that
moment when she's just look at least at
that first moment the first moment she
looks at that samurai and he pulls his
sword down and like almost kind of
boughs to her I just like the magic of
that moment I know later
I know it's connected probably - you're
like oh I have a bluetooth Wi-Fi mesh
network with all the other hosts I
understand that but that would be cool
it'd be like one of those things or it's
like if there was like a button like it
was off the whole time like it would be
so cool but just the magic of that
moment it's like maybe she has
transcending her her robot in this not
only has this human but also maybe as a
knight like almost like a deity or
something like that I don't know what
was your favorite moment I this was a
packed episode I really loved this
episode I love it is my favorite episode
next to see episode 2 episode 2 in this
episode is probably my favorite so far
it's one of my yeah top for the season
so far we're only halfway through though
we got time we got time this episode was
jam-packed it had the painted black
theme redo which I loved I loved the
idea of these doppelgangers we all are
always like oh everybody has a
doppelganger somewhere everybody has
their twin out in the world but so
rarely do you get to interact with them
and experience that I thought that was
awesome but the main moment where I just
I kind of gasp and I couldn't stop
watching was a comment when she's
actually dancing or when she rather
starts to dance and she's standing there
with Sakura to her right and Sakura is
kind of timid the Shogun of starts to
approach her she kind of tries to hide
and then he's just like stab stab okay
now you can have her please dance and
you could take her with you
and her dead body its worst circumstance
to dance under holy cow and then comes
the moment where a Kanye just wants to
stab and kill him so badly and we know
she has a temper she already did it
before with his emissary she's so down
to just take that temper and stab
someone and she harnesses it and she
holds it in just takes a deep breath and
then she dances and her dance is so good
also to a painted black version mm-hmm
and then she gets close to him she
titles up to him she's like oh stop dad
stop and let me do that she should at
the moment she was like reaching for
100% but that doesn't take away from how
about prominently amazing it was and it
was so satisfying seeing
absent happen because but another part
of that too was seeing made see her do
that like yes I love us we're so great
we're so kilee yeah and she's adjusted
to remember she was like cranks all the
way up this is a client we don't know
tech ever adjusted her this is just her
being og Akane and she's like yeah all
right that's been our episode 5 Akane
