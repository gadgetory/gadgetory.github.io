my favorite color combination the blue
phone with the green case let me get it
out of this case so you can see how the
color looks now despite that comments
about it being unapologetically plastic
it does not feel as plasticky as
something like the galaxy note or the
galaxy phones it's clearly plastic but
it's not lightweight it does have that
kind of pleasant iPhone heft so it makes
it feel a little bit more premium even
though it's a lower priced phone and
this is unquestionably plastic now as
for these cases these are 29 bucks which
seems a little excessive they do add
that kind of extra style although
someone on Twitter pointed out that they
look a lot like either Crocs or Kinect
for and I'm not gonna lie that kind of
ruined it for me because look it really
looks like Crocs the overall style is
on-trend it's definitely hip to be all
kind of 80s in neon but it's not
something you're gonna want to carry for
more than a year or two cuz it's gonna
look dated
alright let's check out I Oh s7 and keep
going about our day
 an empty mall scene hashtag the
zombies I'll check out some
notifications it's currently 64 degrees
the high will be 73
cool so once I have my photo I can do
all kinds of editing so edit menu I can
of course auto enhance there are filters
now built right in which is kind of cool
very Instagram ready the filters are
pretty subtle the only thing I don't
like about all the filters is that when
you apply them and make all these edit
changes you can't save an original you
just save the edited version that's kind
of a bummer but then sharing gets very
easy so the first thing you notice is
that you have airdrop as a menu option
which in theory lets you share instantly
with people nearby who also have iOS 7
devices with airdrop turned on that's
kind of apples replacement for NFC I'm
sure it's easy and seamless but
obviously it depends on adoption use as
wallpaper I'll set my beautiful
hummingbird as both
all righty and check me out I'm so artsy
now one extra bonus that came along with
iOS 7 is iTunes radio if you're like me
and you've been trying to sort of hack
your Spotify together with your iTunes
collection you know that Spotify is
obviously not well integrated with iOS
this gives you the ability to have
streaming radio stations and if you pay
for iTunes Match then you can stream all
the songs you already own which kind of
increases the size of the streaming
catalog in playing with it for a little
while I'm kind of liking it it's super
easy to create new stations to add them
and to integrate with music that's
already on the phone I'm not sure I'm
ready to give up Spotify but if you're
an iPhone user iTunes radio is pretty
sweet now obviously the most noticeable
difference about this phone other than
the shockingly bright colors is iOS 7
which is making all I phones seem new
iOS 7 is one of those things that I
think you're either going to love or
hate right now because I'm someone new
to it I'm kind of in the hate camp but
mainly because I do not like the
aesthetics at all I don't like the fact
that if you have folders filled with
apps they become two-page folders I
don't like the fact that you cannot turn
off the animations which makes me insane
now there is a way to slow it down a
tiny bit if you go into the settings
under general and accessibility there's
an option called reduce motion I don't
notice a huge difference but I noticed
that it does speed it up a tiny bit
that's as close as you can get to making
it less cartoony I definitely like the
control center I like how you can pull
down from kind of the middle of the
screen to get the search bar but if you
don't know that's what you have to do
you will find that you are constantly
pulling down from the top to get your
notifications one other small
improvement that I really like is that
now when you open up Safari this search
and URL bar is permanently affixed to
the top of the page like it should be
and it's just one bar I think it takes
some getting used to if you've been
living with the old OS for a long time
it is obviously going to be more of a
shock to the system and I'll let you
decide for yourself about the aesthetics
at the end of the day the iPhone 5c is
all about the looks if you like the
colors and you like iOS 7
this phone is 99 bucks on contract so
for a certain kind of person this kind
of person the 5c is definitely abide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
