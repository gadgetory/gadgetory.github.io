console Microsoft aims to appeal to more
than just gamers we're thrilled to
unveil the ultimate all-in-one home
entertainment system team Xbox is on a
new mission design and build an
all-in-one system to light up a new
generation of games TV and entertainment
with Xbox one users can stream content
watch movies and television make group
video calls with Skype and of course
play games the system consists of a
controller a rather bulky set-top box
and connect Microsoft's motion sensing
device which lets users control the
system with gestures now if I want to go
home I just grab and I'm home well we're
gonna create a new set of Universal
gestures to control your entire TV
experience for those tired of fumbling
with remotes Xbox one offers voice
commands xbox game go to TV go to music
watch TV crammed inside Xbox one a
blu-ray player eight core processor 8
gigabytes of RAM and a 500 gigabyte hard
drive the dim side of the improved
technology is that Xbox one isn't
backwards compatible this is a kind of
serious issue for people of a huge
library of games and who maybe wanted to
upgrade their console or people would
just bought an Xbox 360 recently there's
no real remedy for this right now but we
can assume that Microsoft is probably
gonna sell a lot of that old software
through Xbox Live but Microsoft is
looking beyond games it announced a new
live-action TV series based on the
immensely popular game Halo to be
directed by Steven Spielberg and so for
me the Halo universe is an amazing
opportunity to be at that intersection
where technology and myth-making meet
Spielberg may be a big draw but
Microsoft needs to convince users in
another crucial way one of the big
hurdles at Microsoft faces is we just
don't know a price yet this could be 7
or $800 for all we know we won't know
that till III probably which is in June
the price is expected to be revealed at
the upcoming III gaming conference along
with competing device and game
announcements Sony is hinting at
something big with a cryptic ps4 teaser
video it may be gaming but it's serious
business for CNET news I'm Sumi das</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
