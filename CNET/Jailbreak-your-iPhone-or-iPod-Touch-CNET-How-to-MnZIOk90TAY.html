just got a whole lot easier and now
according to the US government it's
completely legal
i'm brian tong and i'm going to show you
how to jailbreak your iphone and talk
about the benefits and risks of doing so
now there are a variety of ways to
jailbreak your device but the easiest
way is by going to the website jailbreak
me calm this may or may not work
depending on the version of firmware you
have and the device you are using so
check out this handy guide at jailbreak
matrix comm to see if this method works
for you once you're at jailbreak me calm
on your phone all you have to do is
slide to jailbreak to start the process
the jailbreak will start downloading to
your phone so just leave it be and let
it run through the install process when
it's ready you'll see a message saying
Cydia has been added to the home screen
press ok and then find the city app you
can now launch Cydia select the user
option and it will take some time to
download all the content the main
benefit of Cydia is that it gives you
access to apps and customizations that
you cannot get through Apple's
authorized app store one RIS you do take
is that there's potential for running
across malicious apps now the city app
will also ask you to upgrade the
database content so follow the prompts
to do that as well now it's not against
the law to jailbreak your phone but it
does void your warranty so if you bring
in a jailbroken phone to be serviced by
Apple you may be out of luck one of the
benefits of jailbreaking your iPhone 4
is now being able to use FaceTime over
3G with an app called my 3G so let's
show you how to get that once the city
app is installed and up-to-date search
for Rock app and install it go to the
menu screen and launch Rock app you'll
need to create a username and password
but let it update and then search for my
3G the app cost 399 but there's a 10-day
trial that you can try out first my 3G
tricks your phone by telling it that
your 3g signal is a Wi-Fi signal and it
will now allow you to use apps that you
couldn't before over the 3G network once
that is done launch the app and you will
be able to select which programs to use
over 3G FaceTime is enabled by default
as is YouTube which lets you view
cleaner and higher resolution videos
instead of those janky mobile versions
one heads up is that by tricking your
phone to give you access to these
features you're still using your 3G data
so be aware that this app might cause
you to go over your data limits now if
you decide you no longer want to keep
your phone jailbroken you can always
connect your phone back up to your
computer on iTunes and restore the phone
to bring it back to its original state
but there you have it i'm brian song
with your how-to for jailbreaking your
iPhone or iPod Touch use it wisely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
