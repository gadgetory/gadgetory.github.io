money can buy I say it's this one right
here the neato bot that connected the
newest offering some california-based
manufacture neato robotics coming in at
$700 this cleaner is app enables so
you'll be able to use an app on your
Android or iOS device to start scheduled
or steer this thing around your living
room now that's a nice upgrade for the
neato brand none of their previous robot
vacuums have come with remote control so
now with this app you've got a way to
control it without punching over to
press a button
other notable additions include the
upgrade from a nickel metal hydride
battery in the old models to a lithium
ion battery here in the connected model
that's going to make it last a little
longer and run down a little slower you
also get two cleaning modes to choose
from which is new for the brain the
default is turbo that's the noisy full
powered mode that Neto is known for but
you also have eco mode which is a little
quieter and a little easier on the
battery now all that's well and good but
the reason I think that this is the best
robot vacuum you can get is that the
performance on this is really impressive
and it did very well with pet hair as
well basically tying the previous neato
as the best scoring pet hair cleaner the
one place where it gets beat out is that
stand the Roomba 880 which cost about
the same as this one does a slightly
better job now this isn't a perfect
product the app is nice and easy to use
but it's a little too simple for my
taste I'd like some more information
about battery to statistics and how long
each run takes it also had some
usability perks during our testing we
actually had one model that failed on us
outright it stopped being able to detect
when we were putting it back on the
ground after we picked it up had to get
a replacement it
nito told us that that was a isolated
problem with an early batch of units
that they sent out and something that
they fixed if you wanted to wait and see
how the reviews came in from other
shoppers before making a purchase of
your own I wouldn't blame you but the
replacement unit they sent us did a fine
job had no problems with solid feeling
performance and remote control by way of
a very nicely done app this is a pretty
fantastic product my only criticism is
that it costs $700 200 more than the old
nito's I think it's worth it though
given how strong of a performer it is if
you want the best this is it right here
samaya deters choice here in the CNET
smart home I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
