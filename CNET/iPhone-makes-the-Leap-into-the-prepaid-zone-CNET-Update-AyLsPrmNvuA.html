touchy with windows 8 and leaping over
new iPhone carrier I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update the iphone has
taken a leap into the prepaid no
contract world beginning in late June
the prepaid carrier leap wireless will
sell Apple's iPhone under the cricket
service making it the first carrier to
sell the iphone without a contract but
don't expect the iphone to come cheap
the 16 gig 4s will be priced at five
hundred dollars normally carriers
subsidize a good chunk of a smart phones
cost if you get a 2-year contract and
leap is shaving off just a little off
the full cost so that leaves t-mobile in
the corner just tapping its foot waiting
for its turn to dance with the iphone in
more places it's becoming the common
every man fo now it's like the safe pick
of the smartphone world is it still cool
to have an iPhone send a top video with
your thoughts and we can include them in

will build warehouses in jersey and
would hire several thousand workers

residents in Kansas Kentucky New York
North Dakota and Washington activists
have been pushing Congress to pass a law
so that everyone has to pay sales taxes
in order to make it more fair for those
brick-and-mortar stores to compete
against online retailers but if you're
feeling glum about having a dish out a
few more bucks to Amazon over taxes
there's a new way to make money from
Amazon Amazon electronic trade back
