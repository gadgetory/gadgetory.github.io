most spectacular shows set in on and
above a 1.5 million gallon tank of water
if you think Cirque de Soleil is just
about circus performers in weird make up
think again this is one of the most
technical shows on the Las Vegas Strip
Bob salia has been working on Vegas
shows for decades and it's his job to
make sure everything works perfectly
it's changed tremendously in theater
back in the old days if you enrolled at
a university you would be building your
whole entire set now you've got
automation you've got people who you
have to know welding afternoon
hydraulics pneumatics there's
electronics all of that starts with the
high-tech stage itself separated into
four sections that move up and down
thanks to four massive scissor lifts the
stage drops 17 feet to reveal a huge
pool during the show swimmers can spend
as long as 90 seconds at a time below
the surface a labyrinth of hoses pump
air underwater and every swimmer has
their own regulator with 14 safety
divers underwater throughout the entire
show all the crew except the wardrobe
department are certified scuba divers
and no one misses a cue down here the
music is played through underwater
speakers keeping everything in perfect
time but it's not just about what's
going on down below it wouldn't be a
true Cirque show without death-defying
feats on the high wire and because this
is Vegas Oh takes it to a whole new
level high above the stage a massive
mechanical carousel suspends aerialists
and trapeze artists above the water
while high divers plunge from 60 feet in
the air into the water below in the
control booth to automation consoles run
the show to military precision every
element of the show can be controlled to
the last inch the metal bat oh that
swings above the stage the aerial hoops
the hanging props if one of the aerial
acts stop moving then the crew here can
isolate the problem and keep things
running smoothly so the audience never
knows just like a high-tech magic act
the wizardry here keeps what's really
going on a mystery to ohs audience think
of it as the swan of the Vegas theatre
scene graceful on the surface but plenty
going on underneath the water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
