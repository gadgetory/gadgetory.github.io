about DIY tech and how to i'm eric
franklin I'm Donnell Bell and this week
we're getting our fun on we've got some
recreational AB Smith yeah and if you're
looking to take your sports performance
to the next level a coaching at might
help you get there
oh so don't get the Gulf very often but
I would love to get better so I was
looking for something that will be
efficient with my time but really
effective as far as helping me improve
my golf game now there are plenty of
apps out there but one that found that
really works for me is called uber sense
uber sits as an app that allows you to
court video of your golf swing and then
directly compare that to professionals
or just a community of people that are
way better than me so first off I'm
going to start the app tap record all
right now I can use this kind of outline
of a figure to line up the shot I'm
going to do a face on shot so this is
perfect for me I can also choose to do
it down the line shot but face on allows
me to analyze the video a little bit
closer in my opinion so I get a few more
options here I can started with the
10-second delay and when that countdown
ends I get a nice flash that lets me
know it's time to swing also I can
choose to trim after recording that
allows me to immediately edit the shot
right after I'm done all right let's get
it set up
choose the start of my swing probably
about right here and choose where to end
it right there I can choose trim there
it is that's my video she's done and not
saved I can compare my swing to the
community of swings and some
professionals but since i have an expert
here now i'm going to film him compare
my swing directly and maybe pick up a
few pointers so now that recorded my
video and we've recorded your video
we're gonna compare the two to see just
how bad I am really and see how good you
maybe you can give me some pointers
maybe I can improve absolutely all right
so i can look at them side by side on
one on top of the other or i can
superimpose them i'm gonna do this side
by side first so i'm going to go ahead
and play it here super slo-mo look at me
i look like a barbarian trying to chop
off someone's head look how your body
rides yeah then you go to go back now I
have to do so much work and look at you
in comparison you're so efficient which
your swing looks like you're doing it's
like no effort at all efficiency is the
name of the game and a good golf swing
yeah this is where you'll really see I
want your body moves yeah up look at my
eyes out look at my oh me on and the
drop down and look at all so anyhow
level everything looks with me so what
you're gonna try to do yes just keep
your chin up a little bit tilt forward
and then just make that great swing all
right
there you go play so have me up there
you need out here if you look at the
difference on how much less you rose up
on the top one definitely so that center
of your body didn't move up and down
anywhere near as much as the one on the
bottom yeah when I look at those two
just the idea of having your upper body
not lifting up and down so much I can
see a real improvement you were able to
get the club head back to the ball more
easily and then if I want even more
pointers I can upload my video to the
community and get even more feedback if
you want to get better at something
thinking about what you're doing while
you're doing it that can definitely lead
to improvement but having an app that
can record you and you can go back you
can analyze your performance that can be
even better
yeah uber since is actually really cool
it doesn't just apply to golf but you
can use it for football basketball
pretty much any sport you want to get
better at what about low intensity
rollerblading definitely out actually i
don't know i don't think that any more
also bit thanks to mark from emma's golf
academy he was getting lots of great
tips and it was actually really fun
alright it's time for a quick break and
when we come back we hit the back roads
that's right we're gonna be using an app
to help monitor our bike activity and
help keep us motivated
you
welcome back you know I'm pretty
competitive I know this yes right so I
have a question for you okay how much
are you bench in these days you're
that's not competitive you're just
shaming me are you shaming you just
answer my voice nothing nothing all
right but if you're super competitive
you want to keep up with your stats and
your runs and rides and you want to
compare them with all your friends in
front of me's check this out there's an
app just for that the more I ride my
bike the more you want to track my
progress to see how I'm doing there's a
great way to do that using an app called
strava today I have a nice short casual
bike ride planned but before I hit the
road I want to plan my route since I'm
not really familiar with this area to do
that i'll head to Straub is website and
use their route builder here it's really
easy to find and create routes based on
what's popular in the area you're
exploring here I've got the map pulled
up and I'll go ahead and find my
starting point then I'll just keep
clicking until I finish building my
route and as I do that strava will give
me stats about the route that I'm
building so I've got elevation distance
and the estimated time it'll take for me
to complete the route based on previous
rides there's also this really cool
feature that lets me minimize the
elevations so if I'm trying to take it
easy and I don't want a big challenge I
can just enable this feature and strava
will rear out me so that it's as flat as
possible so the route gives me a grand
total of 1.1 miles and the estimated
moving time is about five minutes and 33
seconds at this point I'm gonna save my
route
I'll give it a name Oakland morning ride
save it and now i can head to strava on
my phone launch the app and my route
will be there so that i can follow it
when i'm actually on the road so i just
finished my beautiful trail ride and if
i hit finish in strava i can see exactly
how i did i've got a map showing me
exactly where i went and i have a ton of
stats I went 1.1 miles it took me six
and a half minutes and I burned 53
calories not bad so even though there
are a lot of absolutely you track your
ride this is one of the better ones for
people who specifically want to get more
out of biking
you know the next time someone forces me
onto a bike I might actually try that
app looks like it might be kind of fun
good for you not for me well more like
me you don't really like exercise but
you love games so this might interest
you yeah we got a fitness app that
entertained you while you walk it seems
like all the phones these days have new
and improved features that track your
every step and all your calories burned
my problem is I need more than numbers
and charts actually motivate me out of
my chair if you need more than
achievements and milestones help get you
motivated I'm gonna show you two apps
that put the fun in front of the fitness
first up we have an app called the walk
it's 299 and you can find it from both
iOS and Android and it's basically like
an audiobook thriller where you advance
through the story by walking each story
has its own fictional map and as you
walk you come across little audio clips
that advance the story along and keep
you entertained as you go the stories
are all very cloak-and-dagger you're a
spy saving the world from a terrorist
plot and it sucks you in pretty quickly
and keeps you going because you want to
know what happens next
who dropped their Walker if you don't
mind walking together we might be able
to pull that same trick any other check
when we come to I've got the device yes
I'll put it on the table under your
papers you pick it up after a few
moments and switched into your pocket
good find a private place to open it
before you arrive I'm sure you've been
briefed the same as I have I've to see
you on to that train to Edinburgh then
you're on your own so underneath it all
you're still getting all the same
benefits of a fitness app is tracking
your steps it's giving you goals and
achievements as you progress you're
gonna get more goals and more story and
that's gonna get you hooked we're just
hoping we can get you out of here in
time come on before they spot you I see
you've got I like the whole system and I
like that all it asks of you is to walk
no running no jogging no shame in
walking at a leisurely pace now on the
downside the little bits of the story
that get doled out can be frustratingly
brief sometimes I'm tempted to just
download a Tom Clancy audiobook and cut
to the chase just people think that
looks pretty aerial by itself for
something a little more intense there's
zombies run 399 for this one also
available for iOS and Android and a lot
of people love this app if you want to
move what's more motivating than the
thought of a horde of zombies chasing
you now the story here is that you're in
the midst of the zombie apocalypse in
your running to pick up supplies for
your town again the map is fictional so
you can be running around your
neighborhood or running around a
treadmill it doesn't really matter all
that matters is that you're moving the
audio story here is just as good as the
one on the walk plus it has zombies and
also this app gives you a farmville
style town that you can upgrade and add
on to with the supplies you bring back
but if you start slacking your town can
get raided by zombies and then you
all your virtual people down now the
downsides of this app is that it can be
fairly demanding physically the best
place for is probably I'm like a
treadmill or someplace where you can run
like crazy when the zombies attack and
not run to the street like an idiot good
we've spoken to Mullins the base you
came from and they're not willing to
send down another helo until we know who
fired that rocket launcher at you but I
like most about this app though is that
the gaming element can get addicted and
you want that also you can load up music
playlist in the app and just have your
zombie run goals drop in periodically
I'll be taking you on a quick tour
around the perimeter of the base today
and show you the main routes into the
city should be a quick easy run so if
you're feeling the need to get
physically fit but charts and graphs
aren't enough to get you going try one
of these apps I mean a personal trainer
would be great but sometimes it takes a
zombie or a secret agent or two to
really keep things interesting I think I
finally found my motivation that's my
zombie attack that's right cannibalistic
humans chasing Donald Bell these if
you're running like that they're gonna
be like get that guy yeah alright that's
