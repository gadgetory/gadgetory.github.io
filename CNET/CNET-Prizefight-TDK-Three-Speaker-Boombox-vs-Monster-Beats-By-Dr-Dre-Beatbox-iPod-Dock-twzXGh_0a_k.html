and it's time to find out who puts the
boom into boom box is a Throwdown
showdown each with the TDK three speaker
boombox and the monster Beats By dr. Dre
beatbox iPod dock or what we like to
call the monster beatbox now we're
bringing in CNET's finest the judges
battle senior editor Donald ring my bell
senior associate editor Jasmine just
dance France and myself Brian the thong
song Tom we'll take all three judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system
it's a four round practice the first
round is design TDK flat out brings it
with one of the most modern and sleek
designs we've seen who needs a speaker
grill if it looks this good now when you
put both speakers side by side in this
case size does matter and TDK impressed
all of us with its clean and unique
design monsters beatbox isn't bad
looking at all but it's low-profile
wedge design doesn't stand out it's iPod
dock is placed awkwardly off to the side
and in a crowded marketplace it looks
like just another speaker dock system TD
ks3 speaker boombox gets a perfect 5 and
monsters beatbox gets a 3.3 next round
with sound and science TD case 3 speaker
boombox is more like 5 when you account
for its edge driven tweeters but the
total effect is an impressive balanced
sound that sounds more rich and detailed
and excels with music genres like
classical and rock and even an
occasional boyband song
plus the actual sound level on this
boombox will blow you away
but when it comes to low end power the
monster beatbox brings a full and
powerful bass that's sure to please
hip-hop fans and all the hip-hop
wannabes the overall sound is really
impressive for a size Jasmine says she
wants to roll around in the music and we
do two monsters beatbox gets a 4 and T
decays boombox gets a 3.3 so after
averaging 2 rounds TDK leads by half a
point with two more rounds to go next up
is features TDK throws nearly everything
into the system you'll get am/fm radio
iPod and iPhone support multiple inputs
like RCA a line input instrument input
USB Drive playback and an EQ for treble
and bass and even a PA tripod mount and
if you want to go portable you can pack
this guy with 12 D cell batteries now
monsters beatbox brings a wireless
remote that's great for using at home
we've talked about its iPod iPhone dock
it supports bluetooth but you'll have to
purchase it as an add-on and the biggest
letdown for a speaker this size is no
battery support you'll have to plug it
in plug it in TDK takes this round with
a four and monster gets a three point
into the final round
TDK has increased its lead the final
round that decides it all is value most
speaker systems are a little impractical
for the price the TD k3 speaker boombox
is $4.99 and is basically an all-in-one
home stereo system disguised as a
boombox monster beatbox retails for 399
and it looks like a portable speaker but
it doesn't run on batteries so you're
probably not getting your best bang for
the buck but you're not really getting
ripped off either and we're calling this
round even at 3 let's average out all
four rounds and enterprise by 14k jumped
on top of monster it held on to its lead
all the way through the finish line
winning three point eight to three point
three and is your prize fight winner so
if you're in the big sound you really
can't go wrong with either of these boom
boxes i'm brian tong thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next time on
another prize fight whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
