Samsung Refrigerator one of many fancy
Samsung refrigerators that I've tested
and while many of them are perfectly
good recommendable refrigerators in
their own right they all share a
maddening design flaw that frankly I am
sick of talking about in my reviews here
let me show you it's this shelf here in
the middle of the door you'll find it in
just about every one of Samsung's
high-end French and four door fridges
the chef's collection the family hub you
name it the problem with it is that
aside from one little look on the side
here it's basically unusable due to the
narrow design and the bulky bulge that
hangs overhead I mean look at all the
basic small size stuff that won't fit
not this cup of yogurt not this teeny
tiny can of Diet Coke not this bottle of
hot sauce not this much smaller bottle
of hot sauce but hey this package of
cocktail weenies fits so there's that I
even took to Twitter to ask followers
what they'd put in a drawer this awkward
my favorite answer came from CNET's own
senior editor Scott Stein who suggested
filling it with loose salsa for easy
dipping that's fridge salsa Samsung
didn't get back to me when I asked them
why they went with this design but I
think that the answer has everything to
do with this refrigerators icemaker
that's it up there on the top shelf the
ice master sounds like a final fantasy
character but it's really just the place
where the fridge makes ice cubes when
you tell it to dispense some of those
cubes for your glass of lemonade the ice
master will drop them down through the
chute in the door that same bulging bulb
that blocks off the miserable middle
shelf Samsung keeps on trotting out this
design and it just doesn't make any
sense to me
competitors like LG and GE have both
figured out how to locate the entire
icemaker into the door itself that frees
up all of that crucial space up on the
shelf that the ice master takes up and
it eliminates the bulky chute that
blocks off the shelf in the door now I
fully admit that this is a pretty minor
quibble but remember that you're gonna
have to pay thousands of dollars for
this thing and then use it probably
almost every day as long as you own it
in cases like that the little things
tend to matter now it's not to say that
it's a bad fridge there's actually quite
a lot that I like about this fridge but
please
Samsung I'm begging you fix that ice
maker design and free that shelf because
I'm sick of talking about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
