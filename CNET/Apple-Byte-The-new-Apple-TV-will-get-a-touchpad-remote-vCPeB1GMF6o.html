to the Apple by you know what we're here
for everything good and bad inside the
world of Apple lots of good stuff this
week and we start with a report from the
New York Times that the new Apple TV
remote control will have a macbook esque
touchpad for scrolling around there will
be two physical buttons on the remote
and their source says the remote will be
thicker in size now the article also
backs up previous reports that we can
expect to see the new Apple TV unveiled
at WWDC this June the new Apple TV will
reportedly be slimmer than the current
model feature a redesigned OS with
support for Apple's new web TV service
and music streaming service it's not
expected to support 4k content yet and
it's expected to use apple's latest a a
processor now billboard reports that
apple still doesn't have the necessary
music licensing deals for their beats
music service a month before WWDC their
source says june won't be the release
date the deals won't be done but 9to5
mac reports Apple is still planning on
making the announcement and they've been
able to lock down deals pretty quickly
in the past now one of the groups
reportedly still holding out is
universal music group but we'll see how
this all comes together and multiple
reports also confirm apples being
investigated by the Department of
Justice over anti-competitive practices
around the rebranded beat streaming
service Bloomberg says the Federal Trade
Commission is investigating whether
Apple is using its large itunes music
store to put a service like Spotify at a
disadvantage and the answer is of course
they want to but it's never that simple
see the FTC wants to see if the beats
music service launch will change how
labels behave with other services for
example will they give Apple exclusivity
to their music / ad-supported
competitors like Spotify for an apple
paid service now music industry execs
say Apple is not making that a demand in
any of the contracts and Apple Insider
has new details surrounding the rumored
ipad pro their sources Apple is indeed
working on an all-new 12.9 inch iPad
with a new touch screen that will have
improved touch latency and will help the
reported Apple stylus be more responsive
this stylus will connect via bluetooth
and will feature a pressure-sensitive
input and
we'll also bring the force touch
technology from the Apple watch and the
new macbooks to the new iPad screen as
well the report also aligns with rumors
that it will feature a USBC connector
and a beefed up a 8x processor and will
include an NFC radio that could allow to
act as a payment receiving terminal for
Apple pay patently Apple reports the big
a was granted five patents covering the
overall design of the Apple watch from
the near-invisible bezel the digital
crown contacts button rear sensors and
strap attachment slot now Apple also
just launched the made for Apple watch
program that allows for third-party
companies to develop their own bands for
the SmartWatch Apple will make the
connecting lugs available soon but it
doesn't mention the hidden diagnostic
port that some companies are hoping to
leverage like reserve strap now they've
confirmed you can charge the watch
through support and our opening
pre-orders for a $249 band that will
also be able to provide a charge to the
watch for more power now it's an
interesting idea it's not officially
supported by apple and I'm spending
enough cheddar on that Apple wrist strap
already but better then those want to be
Crocs jibbitz from last week also if you
love your gold but you'll never trade in
your mini cooper for an apple watch
edition local businesses are
undercutting Apple right now buy gold
plating your stainless steel Apple watch
for just around 400 bucks you can check
out the people at a watch plate calm you
provide the watch and they played it for
you in 24 karat gold and the work looks
amazing another company golden Dreams
will acquire the watch and send it to
you in a nice fancy box with a leather
strap but their pricing starts at three
thousand five hundred and fifty dollars
and we'll wrap things up on a high note
with a look back in time back in the day
now you've seen apples fancy polished TV
commercials these days but imagine the
80s when some of you weren't even born
yet and this was apple's corporate song
used during a macintosh rollout in
nineteen
yes that was beautiful all right that's
going to do it for this week's show you
can email me at the apple byte at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks for
watching and we'll catch you all next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
