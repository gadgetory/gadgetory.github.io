cute I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
CNN update internet browsers can protect
us from harm and guard against dangerous
sites but have you ever thought of your
browser as a superhero
Microsoft Singapore has personified
Internet Explorer 11 as an anime
character her name is Inori
Aizawa and Microsoft posted this
action-packed video of her doing the
Sailor Moon thing and transforming to
battle malware by moonlight and perhaps
winning users by daylight at the end it
cuts away to her sitting at a desk in a
room with a Lumia Windows Phone a
surface tablet and a Microsoft keyboard
she has her own Facebook page with a
description that says when she was
younger she was a clumsy slow and
awkward girl but she's matured and
changed over the years and she's
confident in her abilities an eager to
show what she can do of course there's
also themed wallpaper you can download
all of this came out right as Microsoft
is launching ie11 for Windows 7 and it's
also in celebration of the anime
festival Asia convention but there's
much more to this story
personification of Windows products is
not a new thing for Microsoft fans in
Japan started making anime characters a
few years ago based on the different
Windows operating systems calling them
OS tons and they were all sisters with
different personalities Microsoft
millennium edition for example is known
as a clumsy and troublesome girl much
like the real-life problematic version
of Windows with Windows 7 Microsoft made
an official character and used her in
marketing and these official Windows 8
sisters can be found on some windows 8
product packaging internet explorer
thanh isn't the only superhero making
news today several Marvel Comics
characters will get their own
live-action series to air on Netflix in
2015 in a deal between Marvel's owner
Disney and Netflix there will be four
different shows one for the blind crime
fighter daredevil another for the iron
fist who is known for his martial arts
skills there's a series for Luke Cage

skin

Jones who has superhuman strength and
the ability to fly capping it off there
