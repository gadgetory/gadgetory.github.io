Barcelona Mobile World Congress 2016
we're taking a look at a team-based VR
game now three of us can have to try and
survive in space and all I have to do to
succeed is maintained a professional
demeanor and work well with my
colleagues the game we're playing is 1
for 3 players and involves everyone
working together to check out things
that are happening in their peripheral
vision for instance if one team member
is told that they need to cool down the
engines then another team member will
have to find the button to call the
engines in their view and hit that
trigger the challenge in the game is
solving problems that your teammates of
a skeezer fixed while simultaneously
communicating what you're being told to
do to them change escape system to one I
got that vent atmosphere I've got that
it's fast and frantic and while lots of
the VR demos that we've seen previously
you've been something of a solo affair
it's really nice to see more and more
team exercises emerging so I have to say
that was actually pretty tense but I
think my team pulled through and notice
i say my team anyway that was really fun
and it definitely gives me hope that
there could be a future for multiplayer
as well in VR anyway check out see death
upon flash mwc for much more tech stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
