entire family what a beautiful moment
this history you thank you thank you for
being here I want to know real quick
though like how is your first week back
and also we're enjoying a little bit of
mother's milk in her celebration which
is weird to like to think about what
that probably means but don't you're
back we're celebrating is an appropriate
drinking so yeah it's appropriate so how
was your first week been back I felt
like a little bit of a lost puppy at
first I've kind of been away from
screens for a while which is pretty
refreshing we have a phone once in a
while but still I think everyone's been
really great to walk me back and kind of
back in the swing of things already
after the whole week yeah I knew you'd
be fine hit the ground running as you
always do how about the leaving of the
baby yeah it's a little emotionally hard
off yeah and also it's just you you have
a whole new world of like it's not just
you anymore so getting ready and like
you know I forgot also had to put makeup
on I mean I was like a ponytail look
you're like three months so so yeah
there's a lot of readjusting to this new
life of Mommy and work right difficult
balance but you're pulling it off no
problem also back with us for more fun
and games is mr. Joseph Kaminsky hello
hello hello he says hello three times I
like it Mike Sorrentino and Brian Van
Gelder are watching us in the back
chatting with you live bringing all of
the conversations to our attention now
you can either take
pardon that by typing your questions
into the comments chat or tweet us by
using hashtag open tab we got our own
hashtag now Twitter let us have it is
that you guys it's yours it's now we own
that it's cool it's cool they say
twitter is going to take off okay first
let's get started with our started off
topic we're talking about back-to-school
stuff back to school tech is the sort of
theme that we're going with right now
we're all parents some very new some
experience more experienced so you have
a three month old yes right Joe how old
are your kids well my son is eight
you'll be knighted right where my
daughter is going to be three November
third so yeah I got that nice little gap
between the two but they are both iPad
savvy children already yes yeah my son
actually has an own cell phone what um
yeah really yeah you know that's the
thing I hand me down or like a new one I
gave him he has a 5s okay yes oh here's
a better phone than my mom was that
about if you pass your mom down one of
your phones you'd be doing better the 5s
was my fault it was my older phone um I
figure was small enough for me actually
originally yet started with the 4s I'm
moving to the 5s we get an upgrade all
right i upgraded him because I got sick
of not finishing he's how old age yeah I
got sued I got a savior i upgraded yeah
I got sick of carrying two charges a
30-pin in a lightning it's 11 lightning
oh what a little bit how our deal was do
so all right let me explain my cart this
is how I come to have all these phones
what I do is no i don't care i buy a
dude i buy a new phone every year yeah
and instead of paying for the insurance
i keep the older one is my backup in
case I lose it or break it so basically
I have I don't pay insurance I just live
on the edge yeah well I'm gonna do it I
don't wear underwear ever well I guess I
Drive by the new one and I keep the
other one as a backup so fortunately
I've been lucky so far because I don't
have a backup as of now cuz I gave him
my 5s and Leah's phone got stolen and I
gave her my my six well I got a question
okay so eight years old
a time of grand imagination sure a time
of running around with more energy than
we know what to do with do you feel any
regrets over giving him a phone like
he's going to the phone to play games
instead of doing the other 50 no running
around physical toys well fortunately
thank you david carr no he gave me a
lifeproof case so he has had it in his
pocket and ran through the sprinkler
before and everything ok he is still
active but that's how we're getting our
ass but he does he does he does use his
phone but there was a case where he was
out with my mom and he got separated in
the first thing he did was call me and I
asked him look up at the street sign he
told me where he was and of course i was
playing pokemon go and I talk well I
talked at home I even talked him across
oh my god he was only two blocks away
that's not good on but yes yes but so
here we all right so so that works and
also the fact that when he's in summer
camp and he goes on trips yeah see where
he is because I find my friends I know
his location look so this cool I said no
I we're not judging you well I oh I by
no means I'm telling you I'm telling you
my reasons of it I think I think it's
important to talk about how old is it ok
how old should a child be before they
have their own phone I feel like most
people would think aid is on the earlier
side it's definitely earlier but the
thing is is that i learned from from him
breaking one of my iPads that is better
to have let him have his own thing to
break my procedure for my name is
classes you'd like the only one with the
phone in his class other other kids in
Africa so here's what I think should
happen and they're not really allowed to
bring it to school yeah I would not
think you would be allowed to bring it I
think the thing that I'm gonna look for
when my son who's what is he he's a
mahir in five months when he's ready for
something like that I might want to get
him like a watered down like hit this
button for emergencies Lebanon watches
now yeah like you know GPS I was
thinking I was thinking the terms like
that cross your mind yeah before I was I
was fortunate because I had a line that
I wasn't using and I was paying for I
just dumped it down all right what but
because I ir you're saying so as I
detach yourself from like that we're
talking more about like the you know the
general like not everyone is in your
position with all your lines you don't
to do with them and stuff like that you
got phones coming every hole well I pay
for my mom's phone a favor bright but
like do you were getting down to is like
eight year old should they have a cell
phone versus you know I want to I keep
saying like a jitterbug cuz that's all
you know what I think it also depends on
each particular situation like you know
you know you're still married you're
with Stacy you're married my son's
mother and I are no longer together
right so it's kind of good for me
because I can also reach out directly to
him without it feel like I'm cramping
her style like okay okay it's just dude
I complicating bothering me is
acceptable kid I call him directly he
can FaceTime me anytime he wants it's
not like if his mother's using her phone
he can call me so I kind of like that he
can always a lot of layers I'm always
accessible I mean you can ask a report
today enactment you can ask him he's
like take it in the other room because
one of my son calls mats I get up I take
his ground never want him to feel like
Oh daddy's not gonna be there right okay
you never ever leave a voicemail for dad
always gonna mean if you call me during
the show I we have to reply with a text
right now that's fine um what about
other tech like outside of a phone i
mean loans are like the bad i think i
think the segue to him getting a phone
was he's had an ipad for a number of
years i got a mom when he turned i think
like four i bought him an ipad mini and
I just felt it was like such a big
investment that I went against what I
would normally do when I got on the 16
gig yeah $400 you know so I got him the
16 gigabyte which is ok but he had it
he's had it and he still has it to this
day it's still intact it's also in a
lifeproof case I was like okay he took
care of his iPad and I kind of transit
it to the phone because the phone is a
cellular connection and I mean this kid
loves him some YouTube yeah he's made
youtube videos he wants me to upload but
i mean i've seen some some of the
comment isn't our cruel they are with us
i can't have the store my son before
puberty that's that's like the big
question one like it's on a case-by-case
basis with kids and how mature they are
you started with the ipad to see how he
was with it and you also don't want to
not give them the opportunity to test
out things like oh get really into
youtube videos or want to create things
you know so you want to like not set
them behind when everyone else in school
has written like that
so is that funny balance but I actually
I was surprised with something with my
three month old yeah I was going to say
your daughter's super young but but my
parents are in Florida okay and we
FaceTime and she smiles at dim like my
husband went on a work trip and she
recognized him on a total total that
blew my mind and I also had that moment
of like am i doing a wrong thing because
you should look at a screen this young
but it's amazing she can see the screen
and she sees daddy you know like like
this is it this is like almost magical
future moments you know where you can
you know read a story you know from a
from across the country you know so I
know she's gonna be seeing mom and dad
always do this because it's our job and
she's going to want to play with the
phone because it's what parents do so I
want to do that too but I'm gonna do my
hardest to not give her the screen if
it's possible but then I can't judge is
going to be a time where I'm at that
restaurant and just like every toddler
you know maybe or I'm on an airplane
ever held hostage with everyone else you
don't want a crying kid on the airplane
so you'll do something to entertain them
and you'll put a screen in front of
their face I'll have to go through those
lessons as I as I hit them i guess it's
it's tough oh it definitely starts when
you're on the road yeah I you know right
now I'm at the point where my kid he get
he totally understands like what the
facetime is it's so funny because like
when it hangs up heat like it's the
phones off and it's down then he just
like waves by like that like 10 seconds
later he's like okay bye like I don't
know where you went you were here a
second ago to me that's like oh man he's
like something's going on in his brain
that's just not connecting the dots like
I was poor kid like you know like he'll
reach out to it a lot like he wants to
he wants stacey alike pick him up it was
like sorry dude she's like 40 miles away
just not happening if it's weird it's a
really sits like a heartbreaking kind of
thing and I wasn't expecting him to be
that sort of ingrained in it this early
in his life but he's already excitons
even understand what they're looking at
yeah he no like this is maybe a little
tangential but like he'll you know we
don't watch a lot of TV with him yet he
maybe has like two hours a week of TV
right but he'll sit on the couch and he
knows the remote like does something so
he'll just like pick it up and just look
at the TV you'd be like why okay like I
have one I don't you know and that's the
connections they make their basic but
they're their own I thought with an
infant you can in a newborn you can kind
of watch TV and you know what last night
we were watching stranger things and she
was watching it too yeah he'll be like
the whole time isn't on it and I'm going
are you watching yes I totally identify
with 11 yeah mom oh no it's tough there
there's a lot of you know weird things
that I'm just getting into right now and
you know you dealt with it you'll get
there yeah it's weird and children and
technology its twenty years my
daughter's too and like I said she's
going on three and she'll get up so like
when she facetimes me she has to hang up
yeah i mean her mother sent me a video
one time because she was kind of being a
little running around not paying
attention so I hung it up her mother
recorded her throwing the biggest
tantrum because she couldn't hit the
button because he had he likes to go
bye-bye and hit the button she has to
hit the blunt there's stuff like that on
we have some interaction here on
facebook jim says kids do not need
smartphones and definitely not at school
but Jim I feel like a lot of people
might disagree with you especially some
of the f'd up stuff that happens in
schools these days maybe having some
sort of communicative device is
necessary I don't know cause problems
yeah things like yak yak come along no
loss problems with high school kids so
because those are terribly mean right
that's the thing like there's no
streamline situation there's there's
just the best you can do I agree like I
don't think kids need smartphones but
you know
I think in this day and age there is
something you need to give them that
lets them call for help like there we
can't like we can't live in 2016 given
the technology we are afforded and have
a child who is by themselves happy in a
situation where they're helpless well I
without something like that you I think
like the old-school equivalent me being
old and dating back to my diamond dude I
grow up without cell phones to their
last generation my console does the
thing before cell phones these have
prepaid cards and my mom gave me a
prepaid card at the home card it only
allowed me to call the home phone from
an outside payphone so even as a child I
had that where I guess now the
equivalent would be a cell phone so
growing up even I had some way to call
home from a payphone I've had no money
right yeah also on Facebook someone says
that there should be a low-tech phone
for kids that's what I think they do
have them they're like four buttons
pre-programmed yeah it's like call my
cell her cell or the police it's a plan
it's money so if you're kind of all that
money down for a plan do you do what
Joey did no oh I have an old phone let
me just attach it to that like I said
also the fact that I have a really good
deal on my plan yeah it's unlimited it's
three lines unlimited data unlimited
texting and three gig hotspot okay
here's the part where Joey shows off his
plans well I'm just saying it's just
it's just it's just unlimited everything
and if we get a Joe you're super cool
everyone like it's not super cooled as I
was the hand court anyway so okay so
basically how my son's phone came to be
okay I guess his arm my godson yeah he
lived he lived in New York um and he his
mom worked at five World Trade and she
was there 911 and it just shook her up
and she moved out of the city she just
could not get far enough weirdness okay
so he wanted to come stand the city one
summer so he stayed with me his family
couldn't reach him he has family in the
city but they live like upstate he
wanted to stay with me because I was in
Manhattan so I initially got the phone
for him and I just never shut it all and
then when he got old enough ah beast
he's 28 now when he got old enough he
was like I can't have you paying for my
phone so he has his own line I literally
had the line sitting there he had to do
something with it
something to be said though about having
access to a computer for gardless of the
phone or the computer but but really
just being comfortable enough to just be
around it in my home growing up we only
had one pc now everyone's got their own
laptop sure but i paused it and I was on
aim all the time I became a faster typer
more crying and talking to people I I
was able to play around with stupid
little things and I was more comfortable
to computers now I ha get from my little
brother and I don't know if he's as fast
of a typer as I am go know this game it
thinks you know and also there are
benefits to doing your homework now you
cannot you need an internet connection
they expect you to have you no computer
access at home now if you want to
succeed so you don't want to set your
kid back by not giving them the best
yeah I mean it the way it's just like
it's just like when I was growing up um
you know we all didn't have computers at
first and we just went to the kids house
who had it so it's not it's not a
question of them not having you know
accessibility they will get their hands
on it yeah at least this way you can
govern it you can monitor you can set
the parental play and they're gonna talk
anyways there's lorians online my son's
you know five nights at freddy this
finite my he has like every five nights
at freddy figure but he's afraid to play
the game it's the funniest thing yeah he
goes it from other kids I cannot believe
how much they've license out that brand
that's crazy um you guys feel you don't
know the game five nights at Freddy's
I'm not cool no has nothing to do with
that don't worry better what do you guys
think about tablets for kids do you feel
comfortable with a child having a tablet
yes I suppose one at what age like well
anyway clearly as soon as possible well
I mean they're always at the preschool
games yeah totally now I mean yeah like
Jordan started with monkey preschool
lunch box there's a lot of educational
games you know shapes colors math it's
not just pick it up and put a movie on
sure it depends on how you utilize it I
mean like for long drives we have like a
little DVD player would have liked a
little Einstein stuff up right you know
what shapes and colors and words and
stuff like that I like the parent
controls they have nowadays you can set
timers to have it like be like oh you've
spent yeah I think I think when you when
you when you say it's okay you gotta
kind of explain so exactly it's not just
like some people like oh you think are
here take it and why can't watch get the
netflix or nick jr. on
can't say that I'm not a little I don't
know turned off by the notion of like
like I have a friend who all he does is
just give his kid I felt like a phone
all the time how is this different than
watching for how is this different than
watching TV all summer like I did that's
how I grew up I just I decided I think
it's now that the TV just comes with you
right like I was buried in Game Boy my
entire adolescence and childhood so like
sega game gear yeah like i don't know i
don't there is no right and wrong it's
whatever works for you just you know i
used to kill the mold mattel hand hill
football I be social media stuff you got
to be careful because if you open up the
app store but anything yeah um what
about games are you guys I know three
months is that's out of the question
even for me it's add the question he
jordan's lego dimensions my kids eat you
bought it himself with his own birthday
money well that's nice likes lego
dimensions okay that's cool yeah I can't
do games just yet like my dog and my kid
are actually at like the same cognitive
level right now but realistically rather
build with the leg old and play it yeah
and but he likes to TV on in the
background while he's building okay um
Netflix does Jordan consume a lot of
streaming stuff he it's funny YouTube he
wants to be a YouTube star he's
literally said it like I mean I should
have given Brian this segment he did on
his the somme free makers Lego he built
it so what is he like reviewing stuff is
he literally with his iphone he videoed
he made a youtube video for youtube
about the Lego that he built describing
it saying look at the detail doesn't it
and at the very anybody that at the very
end he goes subscribe click right below
subscribe right now I created and you
know that brings me to another point um
since we're talking about it i created a
YouTube page for him but I don't use you
to that often and I want to be really
familiar before I put anything of his up
there don't spoke to people around here
like disable comments yes like that
young heroes yeah talking to your kids
so I but he has it but the one thing I
wanted to bring up is and this is with
like the emails like Gmail and also it'd
be nice if they allowed you to create a
sub email for your kid because in in
creating his email account actually had
to lie about his age because you have to
be
certain 87 email I kind of wish they had
a parental email where you can kind of
make a sub email underneath it because I
did that for multiple really have to be
13 yeah something like it but he's only
eight I created it form because we're
not gonna don't worry no one's gonna
watch well no in the iphone in literally
on YouTube no in it but because of the
iphone that's why i created it because
he's logged into my apple ID but i
created his own I cloudy I got 35 games
inc also clean I don't want all this
crazy youtube homemade videos cover
myself are okay with their younger kids
going on facebook to that mean like I
but I've spoken to parents who have kids
who were 11 years old 10 years old now
it's supposed to be 13 but they way that
they approach it is is my kid mature
enough because everyone in their class
is already on it lying about their age
so you have to have the conversation you
know going all right you have to do the
computer in the family room and you know
I had to be your friend yeah it's stuff
the last thing I want to talk about and
we kind of already discussed a lot of it
do you think there is an age I mean
obviously Facebook YouTube have ideas
about what that specific age is but do
you think it's there is an actual
realistic age where someone should be on
Instagram Facebook or Twitter I think
all that comes with the parents Jimmy's
discretion maturity and the it the
network matters like what benefit is it
for a kid to see Instagram unless
they're really into taking photos but
they're gonna come across all the all
the stuff is they don't need to come
across yeah that's it's tough I that's a
new job like I don't have a kid and I
don't have to worry about you will you
want the thing you will alright this has
been a great conversation we're going to
take a break and we'll be back with some
really cool stuff make sure you check

here we go is the end near for Nexus
phones Google may no longer make phones
under the Nexus branding at least that's
according to a report from the website
androidcentral sources told the blog
that Google wants to put more of a focus
on Google branding and move away from
the Nexus name also the Android
interface may even come with some extra
software instead of the usual pure no
fluff Android experience free of
bloatware this isn't the first time
we've heard reports of Google changing
up its phone plants earlier the summer
The Guardian reported that Google is
making its own branded phone to be
released by the end of the year if it's
not called Nexus what could it be called
the google phone the G we'll have to
wait and see meanwhile the parent
company alphabet is also shaking things
up in the smart home world by taking
some nest developers and moving them
into Google that's according to a report
from fortune nest labs makes
internet-connected thermostats and smoke
detectors and it sits under the alphabet
umbrella as you may recall when Google
purchase nest in 2014 the company
promised that nest would remain
independent but now hmm the report says
Google is absorbing some nest software
engineers to work on Google home which
is Google's competitor to the Amazon
echo that's it for this tech news update
and a big thanks to all of your lovely
messages while I was out on maternity
leave support from fans like you makes
it easier to come back I'm Bridget Carey
you can stay on top of the biggest
stories at Cena
calm / update hey welcome back everybody
still jaffe with me is still Bridget and
still Joe yeah we're going to continue
our segment that we debuted I think it
was last week we debuted it's something
that we like to call Joe and tell oh
there he is mr. Kaminski what are you
showing us this week what the hell is
that this first of all like to thank
Alan and and Nicole and and kind of
science in setting this over this is
actually a prototype this is an early
release of pong bot yes it's currently
on Kickstarter right now okay your pawn
yes oh my god so so it's it's it's like
beer pong just you load the cups in stop
it your load you load it with your love
oh this seems like it came to be after a
drunken night of you load up your
favorite alcoholic beverage you you can
make it beer if you're if you're
underage you can make it fruit punch
fruit punch oh oh it actually has two
modes if you move that if you toggle
switch to the right it puts it in an
automatic mode which is rare move around
Oh in it and then you can't detect a can
detect the edges or you can get in
manual mode where when your opponent
shooting you can move it around and yes
you cannot run off here so you can mess
with somebody and see if they can get in
that is so see I have loved to have this
so now that we go one thing i will have
i've gone crazy well that's the one
thing i will say with pong ba pong bot
will not fall off the table but it will
knock this it will knock the ball couple
off the table because it's got another
day yesterday a laser shooting down but
not on the side so yes and you can
control it with the little remote oh
that's cool mode pong ball where were
you 10 years ago so cool teen years ago
go the cool I mean one cool thing I wish
they would do and I hope they do it in
the final is maybe have it come in
different colors so you can have it
match or college license out like all

little expensive yeah I'm not gonna be
super bummed when I accidentally it's

have on your floor in your table that's
not really bad no I know except for the
ball that bounced it but I mean also
christine you know does it come in like

little thing on top could come in like a
larger capacity I'm doing isn't your
problem or is really sick up I mean

creative ideas and i think it's it's
it's good they get their recognition
excellent well thanks for bringing that
in mr. Joe of Joe and tell my showroom
do we have any other question before we
say goodbye oh yeah we had a lot of
questions thank you so much everybody
being in the chat first off Bridget we
had so much love for your return in the
chat today Michael right off the bat
said welcome back again Bridget missed
you um down a little further Kili wrote
back she is back and in caps as well
during the clip on a break Oh
awesome and for those who didn't notice
Michael is rocking Deadpool on his shirt
let's see it I I likes that shirt that's
pretty badass good for work good for
sci-fi yeah we also had some comments
from our first segment at leroy past
says actually not bringing phone but not
to own one yet let kids enjoy their life
when they're young because they're
missing a lot jilin said you do not need
a smartphone but you can have an
emergency communication device with gps
tracking vento stuff i think that one
hour and a day of screen time like
Tabitha's ok for kids kailash kids
should have all the tech in the world as
they can they shouldn't study they
should use tech day and night ok maybe
nathan says no how could one have too
much tech especially kids kids were born
in the generation of technology some of
those comments made me start to think
that you know i was earlier making the
argument that you want your child to
have the advantage but maybe if everyone
has a screen for their face the
advantage is to think differently
outside of the screen and to run around
and they'll have the vantage yeah while
they're looking at their phone you can
take their place it's also our job to
say hey get up let's go to the park or
let's go play boy sure let's go ride our
bicycles and not just give him the phone
we've got a doubt like and that's
something we didn't even touch on
earlier I feel like you know I I was
playing as much Nintendo and and pc
stuff as any kid could possibly when I
was young but I also played a lot of
hockey and like that's super important i
like played a lot of basket and if
you're not moving around like you're
you're basically dead because if you
don't get any exercise when you're a kid
it's not gonna just work out for you
know they'll get older so uh you i can't
stress that enough and i don't care who
you are you can't argue with that no I
definitely gotta get him out yeah I can
argue about certain I was like you know
um Eric challenge me and I still gonna
because I got sick but I got to finish
it all the 22 push-ups yeah my son got
down I started doing them with me so
funny because you like who's going to
break his little limbs try to do as many
pushups his dad but definitely they got
to stay active and on and I mean it's up
to us to keep the back for sure you take
them outside and what
one of my sons outside he doesn't pull
his phone out right it's if he's sitting
at home or something like that and his
phone and sit on the side us maybe if
he's building something or was Lego said
he looks up like a a video or a little
funniest a one time you wanted a Lego
set and i said i don't i don't know
where to get that he went on ebay and
found i said looking get it here yeah
yeah ghost active knowing how to
interact totally and with the face to
face you know as I just had I contact
yeah it would've think it is a skill for
sure I'm hearing we have some more
comments and questions from Mike in the
control room yeah guys so Dwight wants
to know what your thoughts were about
this morning's announcement of Samsung
taking back recalling the note 7 phone
oh man I could not believe I mean look
it happens but this is unprecedented but
do you think do you think with 35
reports of batteries catching fire that
apple would have done a massive recall
or would have been another you're
charging it wrong yeah yeah fires weird
where you live and they would probably
say bring it into the nearest apple
store will confirm whether your models
one of the defective right yeah hey
Bobby probably sugar-coated like that
yeah so they didn't sugarcoat it they
they said everyone gets a new model
that's a big deal right so are they
replacing the entire phone or are they
just replacing the battery well they
haven't given details on how you get it
fixed but they are offering replacements
was the phrasing to everyone so what do
they were every single phone that was
bought yes whoo it could be about a
million phones right ohm is only out for
two weeks that's it yeah so that's what
we think about that is that all there my
car we are there anything else oh just
thank you again everybody else for being
in the chat we also have a couple
shoutouts heightened know an andre larry
caliente frijoles James Adron Nathan and
Jeanette apparently her first time in a

editing for the pong bak video he did

came up with the whole show and tell yes
Brian God platform evg honestly this
this show or anything in his room
