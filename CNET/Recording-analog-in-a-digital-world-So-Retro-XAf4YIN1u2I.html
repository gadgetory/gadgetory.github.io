you actually have recorded to take a
place like this allows you to make music
by hand my name is Adrian young and
we're at Lanier labs
there's one form of media as it pertains
to music that has not died and that's
vinyl this is the equipment that they
use to make those records for the last
20 years I've been building a studio
that exemplifies what I love about music
I came up with these chords you may be
gonna add some to it
when you're hearing a recording from
linear labs you're not hearing any
plugins you're not hearing a bunch of
retakes you're hearing exactly what it
is
this equipment allows you to create
music with full resolution there are no
computers here there is no digital
recording here it's all recorded to
analog tape you're not hearing a bunch
of retakes you're hearing exactly what
it is you're hearing how to actually
capture a moment in time if you're using
a compressor you're using a real piece
of hardware if you're using a mic preamp
you're using a real class a discrete
preamp made from the 50s or the 60s
you're using something that was built by
hand
my name is Ali Shaheed Muhammad and I am
an artist on linear labs I could even in
Oakland I'm your host Ari Shaffir my
hamid as advances we have gotten in
technology we're now capturing things at
192 so there's a clarity to it
but there the warmth is not the same as
something that is recorded to tape
something that came out of actually
adrian and i meeting over twitter the
digital world is good for anything
that's good for joining us you know
Adrian and I formed a group called the
midnight hour while we were working on
the midnight hour we were hired to
compose music for Luke Cage Marvel
Netflix series and we recorded all the
music um the scored music for season one
and season two I was able to work with
people like Snoop wu-tang scoring Black
Dynamite and I always say to people that
if you want to get close to an artist
get their records
it's as if we're looking back to look
forward we're looking back in time when
the equipment in the studio was the best
the greatest and we're using that
equipment to make music for today
