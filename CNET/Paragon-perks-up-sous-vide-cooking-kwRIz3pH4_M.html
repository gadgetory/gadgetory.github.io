method to try a lot of countertop
devices we've seen start at about one
hundred and fifty dollars and can be as
much as five hundred dollars and most of
these devices only have one use now the
Paragon induction cooktop from first
bill is a sous vide system but it can do
a lot more the Paragon is made up of an
induction cooktop and a Bluetooth
connected temperature probe what happens
is that the temperature probe talks to
the induction cooktop based on the
temperature that you want the contents
of your pot to reach the temperature
probe will talk to the induction burner
and say hey how r this burner up more or
lower the temperature a little bit now
the Paragon is great for sous-vide
cooking but you can use the device for a
lot of other cooking methods you can
deep-fry using the temperature probe in
the induction cooktop you can also just
use the cooktop as you would a regular
burner and I even tried slow cooking on
the induction cooktop and it worked out
great for my cheese dip now the Paragon
isn't perfect the system is only two
parts which makes it seem like it would
be pretty easy to store but the base of
the induction cooktop is 17 inches
across at its widest point which can
make it hard to find a place in your
cabinets for this device and the Paragon
is still two hundred and ninety nine
dollars which is less expensive than
some of the other systems we tested here
but it's still a lot of money for one
countertop appliance but the Paragon
will be a useful tool if you're
interested in sous-vide cooking but you
want to make sure that you have a gadget
that can be used for other cooking
methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
