the 2014 new york international auto
show things are kind of winding down you
so we thought we'd take a few minutes
and give you some of our favorites I'm
Tim Stevens I'm Wayne Cunningham and I'm
antuan goodwin and so what's a while
extravagan Antoine what was your car of
the show this year well mazda made a big
deal about the 25th anniversary of the
miata and well known that the mazda
miata is my favorite car so obviously
that's going to be my pick and in their
booth it was pretty awesome they had 25
925 20th anniversary 12 classic still a
lot of meiotic Miata yeah they had the
number 14 number 15 and number 16 Miatas
the three diatas that were actually at
the debut at the 1989 Chicago show the
actual ones that were on the stage then
they had the 25th anniversary of the
current generation of a Miata that's a
special edition especial because it's
got like a derailleur scheme it's got
yes basically SOS great package so red
Miata but they're only making a hundred
of them for the North American cuz
there's never been a red Miata before
well yeah the really cool thing though
was there a skyactiv chassis and that is
a preview of the fourth-generation
reality which we should be seeing
announced any month now and it showed a
lot of really cool things about how the
next one's going to be smaller it's
going to be lighter and it's going to
move the engine further back into the
vehicle so you can improve the balance
and dynamics I'm really excited about
getting a chance to look at and drive
their next one I saw that chassis and I
was thinking that it Mazda forget
something to forget to bring something
to the show don't forget one of the
wheels was on backwards and so the text
made a big show of it today flipping the
wheel around so the trades were facing
the right direction but I mean it's just
a preview someone's getting fired back
in back in last HQ so uh that's kind of
the similar thing that Subaru did for
the appraiser launched a little while
ago they showed the chassis obsession
for a long time they show the Chancellor
with like a clear body sitting on top of
it before they finally unveiled the body
and everybody kind of groaned hopefully
the reaction will be a little bit more
positive I mean the me I'd have been
getting bigger yeah here's an heavier so
for them to get back to what they are
projecting to be the original weight of
the first generation Miata it's going to
be a good thing for the vehicle is going
to help it be more efficient and more
fun to drive but with a lot more power
how much power to the original Miata
have the original you go ahead Thunder
hundred right yeah it does under a
hundred horsepower and yeah they're the
point now where they're about 170
underneath I'll be nice upgrade yeah
sure we don't lose power in the next
generation well we're seeing a lot of
automakers this year debuting cards with
less power than the 2014 model year but
then also saying hey we're late our car
is also a couple hundred pounds lighter
so you're getting about the same
performance but more efficiency have a
forced-induction uh that we're going to
see that they're probably going to be a
four-cylinder naturally aspirated just
like every motto worth its salt has ever
been with the exception of the
mazdaspeed which was the turbocharged
man than me production yeah they have
the engine on that chassis I was
checking that out earlier I couldn't
tell if I was good i think it's gonna be
direct injection from what i was looking
seen on the head on there it's kinda
hard to tell with that type of game that
have a format but you know that might be
something in front of the whole skyactiv
technology yeah the whole skyactiv thing
is direct injection lighter weight
component less friction so pretty much
all of the changes that we've been
seeing on the mazda3 on the new mazda6
we're going to see those on a different
scale and mazda miata i'm excited i'm
excited too i'm more excited about the
Alfa Romeo 4c they had that car on the
show floor and normally be thinking out
for ramaiya there they're not in the US
but I've been seeing this car and
european auto shows for the last couple
years and it's beautiful and the fact
that it's here means is their way of
saying hey we're gonna sell it here in
fact that will come out in June and it's
a stunning looking car its carbon they
use carbon fiber throughout carbon fibre
tub no carbon fiber you know yeah
spoiler all sorts of you know components
in there so lightweight actually the
european version is under 2,000 pounds
this one's going to be 12 2,200 pounds
for the US market which is just so light
for a car these guys are heavier so
we're heavier bad
yeah I think its first Americans uh you
know I think it's the safety equipment
actually that goes into it you know
required airbags isn't all the kind of
stuff they want to fit into it to not
only make it fit us regulations but also
make it desirable for people or so they
don't think they're gonna get in a death
trap things that I thought that was more
desirable is that when it debuted
actually they had those multi-segment
sort of insect I headlights the ones
that are on the show floor here have
more traditional looking headlights that
actually don't look at bat and it's good
to see that alpha looked at the sort of
like that people did when the 4c first
debuted is that you know what we're
going to give you a choice of having
some more standard looking light from
this really good-looking part yeah it's
a great car and I love that it's just a
little simple to seat rear-engine car
you know not a lot of complexity to it
you know it's it's been knocked a little
bit forward simplicity I think the
limited interior and everything else is
it feels a lot like a lotus I think in a
lot of ways but I think that's a great
thing and you know it's always been said
that if you were a true car guy you have
to own an ALPHAN someone your career so
this could be the one yeah it could be
the one yeah it certainly could be and
i'm definitely eager to see how it does
here in the US i hope that they find
success I got to be honest though I
don't know don't know how much faith I'm
gonna put in there making big big sales
here in the US well one thing that might
hurt amongst the the real car guys who
are all like into manual transmissions
now is it's not going to come with a
manual it's only going to come with a I
think the six-speed dual-clutch
transmission so paddle shifters you know
I mean probably better performance than
a manual but I mean everybody now is all
about the the three pedals the older I
get the more than my left knee starts to
bother me the more I I become accustomed
to the double clutch think so maybe
work out okay yeah yeah i sat in the car
and it was it was a tight fit but it was
a you know felt like it'd be fun on the
track but our helmets in there yeah I
think there's enough room yeah I think
it depends on how tall you are yeah I
was usually there's definitely that too
what's interesting is to see them coming
if they're coming back into the US
market coming with a sports car a small
simple sports car instead of something
with more a more of a broad appeal yeah
something like julieta or one of their
the set lomito something that they could
fill for you know not a lot of money
that you can get actually out on the
road and get more people seeing the
badge instead they're going with sort of
exclusive exotic small sports car
aspirational product yeah although it
might be the herald for a lot of alpha
males to follow that's kind of idea they
want to reintroduce the brand to the US
so maybe we'll see the Mito which I
would like to see that car too because
that's actually a pretty quick
nice-looking little compact inexpensive
so Jim you know even cook weariness but
so what's your favorite yeah everyone
last because I can't really make up my
mind i'm still going back and forth you
but we're sitting in the GM booth so i
guess i should go on the gym way i guess
i'm going to go with the corvette zo6
convertible which which was unveiled
here it's you know not a lot different
from the normal 06 but that's a good
thing you know normally with a
convertible they lap the roof off then
they had to put in a bunch of extra
structural stuff and then they make 200
pounds added weight for the motor for
the convertible they're saying this will
not be that much heavier than the normal
is yo 6 which is good still 625
horsepower from the ridiculous
supercharged v8 they did finally give us
a formal 0-60 time a 3.5 seconds which
is pretty ridiculous and it's the
fastest car around their test track that
they've ever made so it seems like it'll
be no compromise convertible and of
course the normal corvette is got the
target ops you can pop that off but it's
probably be even better for cruising but
and even more headroom if you're a
little bit taller like me and you need
to go to the track in the wear a helmet
yeah I like the targa top on the coupe
version the convertible I was reading
about that they said that the the body
is so stiff the chassis is so stiff that
yeah they didn't need to make many
structural changes to do the convertible
and that's really amazing and I could
believe it having driven the standard
Corvette I mean that body is so stiff it
just handles so perfectly so well it's
it's like nothing's going on you know
mess it up yeah yeah the other car that
I was really seriously considering was
Aston Martin the the Vantage GT which is
their low cost 99 thousand-dollar v8
version of the car stripped down
interior very fast it's got paint
schemes inspired by their Lamar racers
which is a little bit loud for the road
but pretty cool but the way i think that
the Corvette's going to make some ways
I'm here to see what the sales foot is
between convertible and then a normal
coupe and the sill split between the 06
the normal car to they haven't given us
or pricey I'm in 06 though which is a
little bit curious give us every other
spec we can we can want all right so I
guess we'll wrap things up here from New
York I hope you enjoyed our coverage
this year definitely check out our
gallery of all the cars here on the show
floor and let us know what you thought
of our coverage and we'll be back from
the next auto show where the next
lecture we go on a pair of snacks we are
going to Paris yes that is in October
October so a little early October of the
summer off and then head to Paris so
make sure your passports are in order
folks and we'll see you out there Paris
again I'm Tim Stevens I'm antuan goodwin
and I'm wind getting it and we're here
in New York thanks again everybody look
