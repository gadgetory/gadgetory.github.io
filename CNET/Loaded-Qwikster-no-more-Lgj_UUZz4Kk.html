Tang on CNN com and it's time to get
loaded the netflix spin-off quickster is
no more when netflix announced it would
split its DVD rentals and streaming
movies into two companies the stock
plummeted consumers shared outrage and
it became the butt of many late-night
jokes including a spoof on SNL Netflix
said it would continue to operate one
website for both services CEO Reed
Hastings said in a statement consumers
value the simplicity netflix has always
offered and we respect that there is a
difference between moving quickly which
netflix has done very well for years and
moving too fast which is what we did in
this case more than 1 million iphone 4s
models were pre-ordered on friday apple
reported that breaks the first day
pre-order record previously held by the
iphone 4 which was 600,000 units but
what likely got those numbers up this
time the iphone 4s is available from
three carriers instead of just ATT as it
has been in the past google has released
a new web programming language called
dart with the goal of becoming an
alternative for JavaScript Google showed
off an early preview of the coat at a
Denmark conference this week google said
dart is designed to be a flexible
language for small or large projects
some media giants are vying to be the
new owner of Hulu but it probably won't
be Yahoo although Yahoo started the
bidding talks by offering 1.9 billion
dollars for hulu The Wall Street Journal
reports it is changing its offer that
comes as no surprise since Yahoo itself
is looking to find a new owner right now
DISH Network's Google and Amazon are in
negotiations but it's not even clear if
who lose board will want to accept any
of the other offers nothing can stop the
Man of Steel well nothing except
kryptonite and angry book retailers fans
won't find much on Superman Batman
Wonder Woman or other DC heroes and
barnes &amp;amp; noble stores anymore the
retailer pulled 100 DC comic titles off
the shelves in response to a deal DC may
with Amazon to put digital versions of
the coms exclusively on the kindle fire
barnes &amp;amp; noble's response if we can't
have them on our look then we won't
carry them in our stores a bookstore
without Superman talk about bizarro
those are your headlines for today I'm
Wilson Tang for Sienna
