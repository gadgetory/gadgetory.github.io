Google ishes for all the Google that we
can pack inside of the show each week
let's get to it and the googs just
dropped a really cool update on us with
some of the latest developments for
their self driving cars now they've
shifted their focus to mastering city
street driving and a video released
shows how the vehicle can navigate
through things like construction zones
or railroad crossings they even show how
its able to detect a moving bicyclist
watching this example when the cyclist
holds up his arm our software detects
the hand signal and predicts his
movement into our lane look it even
recognizes those people on bikes that
don't know where they're going half the
time but think they own the road so
instead of driving through them the
self-driving car waits for them the
examples this video shows are really
impressive and their vehicles have now
logged nearly 700,000 autonomous miles
see in the near future you really be
able to do your makeup and drive at the
same time now we've talked about some of
the new interface tweaks and refreshes
to apps and icons that we are expecting
at Google i/o and a new report says the
g men and women are planning to expand
the capabilities of ok Google and
introduce new navigation buttons android
police reports that you'll be able to
say okay google anywhere in android and
specific actions will appear on screen
depending on the app you're using so if
you're working in the Photos app you can
share some of those pictures now here's
screenshots of what authorizing that
feature might look like the report says
it will be limited to Google Play and
Nexus devices that are all running a
pure Android OS Android police also say
it might be able to provide suggested
actions if you're doing something like
emailing someone and at that time it
offers you to reply to them on the spot
so we'll probably continue to hear new
information like this with google i/o
still in late June there's also a lot
happening around Samsung after they sent
out a teaser for what's believed to be
an announcement for the rumor two
galaxies k the obvious successor the
galaxy s4 zoom here Samsung's Instagram
teaser showing an optical zoom into the
red dot Museum in Singapore so we'll
follow up with the details from the
event next week hey
korean giant continues to diversify its
product offering this time with a new
line of headphones called samsung level
there will be the level in in-ear
headphones the level on lightweight
wired headphones and the level over
cable free headphones that connect over
bluetooth see the theme here and I
shouldn't forget their level box that's
their own bluetooth speaker box they'll
be available for sale online and in
retail stores in mid-may but there's no
word if there will be headphones
inspired by the Cartoon Network show
level up
because everyone would want a pair of
those and in samsung rumours a report
from sammobile claims the galaxy s5
prime will launch in june this will be
the long-rumored beefed up s5 that's
been talked about over the past few
months featuring a quad AC display at a
2560 x 1440 resolution and the device
could debut a new octa-core processor
with an integrated LTE modem a variation
of the galaxy's s5 model number has
appeared on Samsung's official website
and that same device appeared in
graphics of benchmarking software with
the higher resolution display now seems
to be a little odd timing to drop a
prime edition right after the s5s
release in there could be some backlash
but we'll wait and see but before they
do that maybe they should work on that s
5s camera killing bug Samsung has
acknowledged that a bug that looks to be
more specific to the verizon version of
the s5 completely breaks the phone's
camera as a user is hit with a camera
failure error message leaving your s5
camera completely dead that's right no
selfies
the cause of the issue is yet to be
determined but Samsung is taking
responsibility and says a limited number
of s5s are experiencing it and pointing
people to their customer support number
alright guys it's going to do for this
week email us at Google licious at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong they so
much watching we'll see you guys next
week for some more of that Google Isha's
