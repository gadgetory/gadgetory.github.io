a kid there is no pure form of time
travel than playing those games again
but even if you've got the games and got
the console in some dusty old box how do
you get that all connected to today's
modern TVs well I'm gonna show you how
all right now if you're working with the
console from the early 80s like an Atari
2600 you're likely dealing with an RF
video output the simple fix for this is
to buy an adapter this is an RF to
coaxial adapter lets you plug right in
to the antenna or cable input on the
back of your TV make sure your TV is
tuned to channel three so you want to
take the cable is running out from the
back of the Atari plug-in that adapter
that adapts it for a coaxial input now
back here you're gonna see that antenna
input or cable input just want to screw
this on well screwed on now
alright the great news here is that you
can resurrect your extremely vintage 80s
video games the bad news is that the RF
video output coming out of this thing is
about as bad as you're gonna get the
other bad news is that by making use of
the antenna input or the cable input on
the back your TV you're excluding the
ability to use your actual cable that's
how you're hooked up you can invest a
few extra bucks though and getting an AV
switcher box that way you can switch the
cable when you want it and switch to
your retro console when the mood strikes
you alright moving down the line a
little later 80s here you've got the
Nintendo the original NES you're gonna
have a better option here than you had
with the Atari you still got that RF
video output on the back if you need to
make use of it but they do you one
better and they give you composite video
output along with a mono audio output so
you can use this with a standard RCA
video cable you're gonna plug yellow
into yellow red into red and then you're
gonna do the same thing on the back of
your TV using the a/v input switch short
video inputs and then go AV 1 boom
skater died the Nintendo lives check
this out this is one thing you're going
to notice with a lot of these old games
on the new TV it looks great this guy
doesn't for this the video game looks
great and it's filling up the whole
screen and that's not what we want the
original systems here we're all standard
definition so this TV is kind of
tricking us and stretching the picture
it's think it thinks that's what we want
but really let's fiddle with the TV
settings to get the picture size down to
a 4-3 standard definition aspect ratio
might not fill the whole screen but this
is true school this is how you want to
do it
all right now after you've gotten your
fill the 80s it is time to move on to
the 90s my representative here is the
Nintendo 64 once you get to this era a
lot of manufacturers started using a
swappable cable when it came to the
video output so you can kind of match
the video output for whatever kind of TV
you've got what kind of inputs on the
back in this case the cable that came
with the Nintendo 64 was a composite
video cable but if you look on the
aftermarket you can get up to an s-video
quality which is gonna give you slightly
better resolution than you get with
composite with the composite video cable
though you can pretty much use the same
system that we use for the Nintendo
except the added advantage is that
you've got stereo audio out instead of
the mono audio from the Nintendo yellow
and that yellow and green connection
right here and then now we've got stereo
audio so go red red white to white boom
all right now even if you don't have any
of these original consoles but you still
the games and you want something to play
them on there's something you should
know about this thing is the super retro
trio by a company called retro bit
seventy dollars gives you a system lets
you play Genesis Super Nintendo and
original nes games all in one box you
get two controllers you get video
connections for composite and svideo
this thing would have made me a ton of
friends in the 80s and now you can have
it it's pretty great
alright so there you go that's how to
get your vintage video games up and
running with your modern TV now I needed
my boom box in my top gun soundtrack and
I'm back in the 80s there you go Pat me
get some ghost
