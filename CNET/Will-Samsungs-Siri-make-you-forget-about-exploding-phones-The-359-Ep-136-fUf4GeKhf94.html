i'm sick as a dog but these guys aren't
it's Roger Cheng and Alfred hang on the
359 podcast episode 136 what are our
topics today happy Monday everyone we've
got a couple of great topics for you no
surprise with the elections tomorrow
we'll be talking about some election
talk but first will lead off with
Samsung reportedly baking in its own
digital AI digital assistant similar to
Syria Cortana the next up will be
talking about Donald Trump losing his
Twitter privileges and lastly just take
a look at some of the various moves up
the tech companies have made to get you
to get out and vote tomorrow so as
always if you have any questions buying
these topics leave them in the comments
section Brian will pick out the the best
questions we'll try our best to answer
them let's get started and here we go
for the recording in three two welcome
to the 359 when we talk about the top
tech news of the day and all the crap we
want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Alfred Aang Samsung is back in the news
and no it's not for recalls the company
will report launched an artificial
intelligent assistant in its upcoming
Galaxy S eight phone it's not huge
surprise since Sam some purchased an AI
startup last month but is this enough to
get people interested Sansa again I
don't get why they're making their own
AI I mean they're on Android and there's
good there's Google sister Google
assistant has amazing reviews for it
already I think it might be because
they're afraid they're gonna get shut
out yes of the assistant ecosystem
that's true right now I mean the only
phone that can run Google assistant is
the pixel not a samsung phone so you
know that's a that's an issue but even
without it I mean like ok Google is
still perfectly functional on you know
any on my samsung s7m rice right and I
don't understand why they want to come
out with their own thing I mean it has
to be much better than you know all
these other than Cirie then you know
Alexa which is only on amazon it does
smack of the sort of Samsung of old like
with the galaxy s4 the s5 when the copy
really felt like they needed to have
their own versions of everything whether
it was a samsung translator or Samsung a
search function all these features that
were already available on android
samsung went and replicated and put it
into their own phones it just sort out
them so kind of snacks is that is very
sounds really similar sort of like yeah
well apples got Siri Microsoft's got
Cortana we've got to have something to
it's all that stuff that like drives
people away from Samsung devices I
remember when I was picking between like
a Nexus device and a samsung at the time
it was just you know there's always
bloatware on it work okay well now I'm
gonna have you know google translate and
samsung translate and i can't delete the
samsung translate so it is just like all
these things that made me just want to
go with yeah the nexus I mean to be fair
Samsung has gotten better over the years
sort of curtailing some of that but it
does seem like this is kind of a return
to some of that blow where I don't know
maybe viv is awesome I mean it's the
startup was created by the folks who
created Siri they've obviously learned a
lot since series come out so maybe it's
something that like series also like
hasn't been doing that while compared to
Google assistance so it's just one of
those things again where why don't what
just stick with what's working yeah and
part of me wonders if it's just sort of
a turf battle at Samsung I'm just going
that's what we got to have our own thing
that seems to be the the most logical
reason I think they're like paranoid
they're gonna get shut out of it would
you I mean paranoid might be the wrong
word i think it's likely that you know
they could be but all right next up the
new york times reported that Donald
Trump has lost his Twitter privileges so
I guess no more 3m tweets about beauty
queens look I this happened to like way
too late in the campaign run i mean it's
it's what election day is tomorrow and
yeah they decided to do this around like
last a week or so i mean the the man's
been shooting himself in the foot for so
long now with his tweet he's been
staying on message though staying on
message and like for this to happen now
I I would just have loved to be in that
room where that happened like a grown
man running for president has to be told
that he can't tweet well it definitely
gives you I mean it's it's an
illustration of the power of Twitter
right like it can make or break a person
make a break a a world leader so I don't
write lastly if you haven't made plans
to vote tomorrow you should do so a ton
of tech companies are taking the get out
and vote efrain taking a digital
for example you log into gmail today
it'll it'll give you a prompt asking you
if you want know where to vote YouTube's
got changed up their icon to promote
voting same as Spotify uber is even
volunteered to send folks to the polling
places to vote so we think I think a lot
of good use of you know the major part
of technologies to make your life much
easier than it is you know you know
Google assistant all these things have
been helping you make your lives easier
uber getting rides and now it's kind of
like this is the first time that I've
seen you know a massive concerted effort
from all these tech companies doing that
yep yep no it's uh it's finally obscene
again if you haven't if you haven't made
plans to vote please do so you should
vote tomorrow we don't care who you vote
for peace really you should really vote
either way all right for more about
these stories check us out on cnet i'm
roger cheng I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening I like to just put my two
cents in there and agree it is a right
and a privilege to vote and I'm gonna
leave it there there you go everyone
there's no hipon mic at one point
hopefully that didn't screw things up
that's how powerful the message was we
gotta do it again no I was so angry yea
vote yeah so we got a question yeah do
you know if the Samsung assistant is
coming for all devices I mean can i
download it somewhere we have no idea at
this point like it's you know it is a
startup they just purchased last month
so it which seems kind of weird that
they would integrate this so late in the
game because usually takes about 12 to
18 months to create a phone the fact
that the next essay will probably come
out life everywhere early March that
doesn't give it a lot doesn't give
Samsung a lot of time to integrate it
but my guess is it will only be on the
s8 you know they'll probably have to
create specific hardware for door
hardware and software for it that may
not be backwards compatible can you even
download assistance no not the word
usually uh they're pretty baked in yeah
yeah just like the bloatware yeah it's
true which our friend Michael hey
Michael thanks for joining us again he
said I remember going from Samsung s3 to
the s5 and because of the bloatware
moved from the iphone 5 to the iphone 6s
just a that's a that's a real deal
breaker these days absolutely hey
bloatware it's it's the worst thing yeah
but it's interesting that Samsung gets
so much
for those apples got just as much blow
we're always at ya to let you delete
them now though yeah they'll eat them
hide them yeah I thought you could
delete them out and they still stay on
the back end ah all right there is a lot
but the icons don't hog up your screen
space I guess yeah bout it out of sight
out of mind I guess know when you're
paying for that storage space true all
right still looking um are you guys
going to vote before we come into work
tomorrow because should we need to
reschedule this show um somebody asked
that Wow no no no I'm asking my task as
I'm I know I do plan on voting in the
morning but i'll be here in time for the
podcast okay i'm so try to figure out my
plan i don't know if i should work if i
should come in and write my morning
stores you know bends around go vote or
they're gentle comments have been as
well my plan is to get done before i
come in because it's right around the
corner from my house oh i don't think it
should take me too long but i'll be in
touch just in case just in case all of
you are gonna miss me that's right I'll
miss you Brian Knight well Ben and the
chat wants to know do you think Samsung
Willie shut out of Android completely
eventually no sorry straight answer is
that Reuben alright that bfr uh no look
I think that might have been the case I
don't know four or five years ago when
they were taking with ties in and that
seemed to be you know a legitimate
alternative operating system but
everyone's so hooked on Android now like
no one can quit Android it just it
wouldn't work that's why it makes no
sense to me that they're making their
own AI this is gonna flop and by then
what line it'll be gone the reason why
they're trying to build their own ai's
the dilemma that all Android vendors
face that if you're just using Android
if you're just using Google's core
services how are you different from
anyone else right like every all these
companies feel the need to justify why
they're different they've been selling
themselves on hardware a lot haven't
they yeah the hardware isn't enough that
this yeah I know yeah like having the
curved edge phones and all that stuff is
nice but like they they feel almost a
compulsive need to make sure they their
entire experience stanza yeah you know
it's not just the hardware it's when
you're when you're turning on a samsung
phone as a
yeah so a voice assistant usually takes
a lot of money to manage do you think
Samsung will go so big to actually rival
the big dogs I mean if there's any
company that has a resource it's
definitely Sam's yeah right they've got
tons of money they still make money hand
over fist on like 10,000 things they
make so they definitely the resources
historically those Samsung hasn't been
that strong on software right we keep
talking about these below the bloatware
and that's a great example of why
they've suffered so I don't know if you
know they they've got the talent to kind
of propel a digital assistant to the
wires useful I think the voice assistant
will rival you know Siri and Google is
sure to keep the talent yeah just just
on the scale of the fact that Samsung
has this like strong hold on pretty much
like every electronic out there where I
think if they can get the voice
assistant also also integrate with you
know their TVs their washer change their
for it you know there's smart things
platform yeah yeah yeah I think if
that's if they can do that then yeah I
think they definitely will be able to
rival them here's a good question do you
think Samsung has made any further
modifications to viv in any way or where
they sell it the same way we saw in the
recent demo semi recent I would imagine
they'd make some modifications probably
not a huge amount because it's not a lot
of time it seems like given that we're
only like three or four months away from
a new phone but it's it's gonna become a
plug-and-play thing and maybe eventually
evolved to be more sure custom to
samsung phones but yeah it's not time I
didn't see the demo what are we looking
forward to I didn't see the demo either
oh geez yeah Alfred I did not see this
demo we are the wrong room right now are
my colleague stephen Shankland did see
the demo um so you guys are really
interested we can we can fall back with
answers yeah we'll check in with him
yeah um do you think that Samsung needs
to fix the explosion issue and that kind
of goes without saying cuz a lot of
other brands of smartphones are blowing
up to Samsung is not the only one very
good point true oftentimes when a phone
overheats though is I almost a it's a
user's fault often it's it's the phone
structural integrity is compromised in
some way that that kind of gets the
barrier to go volatile in this case
Samsung's case like people weren't doing
anything weird and they blew up that's I
think that's why they got such a bad rap
and it was relatively more consistent
and recurring yes yeah there which is
important there are far more incidents
of this than than any other phone scene
and yes Samsung a plane needs to fix
this issue samsung needs to be
completely transparent this issue right
this we still don't know what happened
right yeah as far as we know that we
know this person battery manufacturers
we know the first version was
battery-related we don't know what
happened with the second one knows yeah
they don't either yeah so no I mean I
think it goes without saying that they
should probably fix an exploding phone
though yeah yeah that seems seems pretty
I don't I don't know if you know their
solution though will be you know one
size fits all for the rest of the
industry though where you know he's
right samsung isn't the only one where
it's happening to me but I don't know if
like it just because they figure it out
for their phones it'll help Apple or you
know these other android phones where
it's happening on here's another really
good question do you think Samsung will
continue to be the Android big dog or do
you think someone else has a chance of
jumping in at their faults how is google
pixel not already Andrew well i mean
it's it's still kind of a niche phone
right like really you think i don't know
i don't think it's a nice phone right
maybe not nice nice she's not agree yeah
but it's not it's not that i don't think
it's a massive seller thats a no yeah no
it's not iphone it's not a number one's
hands right now right partly because of
distribution yeah it's not it's it's
available unlocked but you can only get
through four right yeah so that's that's
an issue um you know I would say guys
like Lenovo and huawei might have the
biggest chance to dethrone samsung these
are companies that most Americans
probably haven't heard of but they they
sell really well in China the world's
biggest market and there's they're
increasingly starting to do well
overseas lenovo they've got the motorola
name as well no i don't know how much
value that that has now another really
good question do you think there will be
any changes to voting in the near future
example voting via app that's a
fascinating idea i'm terrified at the
throng of where that could find heart
though i don't think that's going to
happen anytime soon however they're all
kind of security consume any liability
um I
there was a conference on you know
voting fraud and voting security that I
wrote about where they briefed with FBI
members and things like so right now the
only reason why you know elections
haven't really been tampered with that
much it's because the technology is so
old yeah yeah that like you know hackers
can't really like break into it and like
adjust it like you can do it but like
you'd have to go into like where the
voter registration stuff not
registration your polling station is and
then like it be some straight-up Ocean's
eleven times yeah yeah like take out
like the computer and like replace it
with like a chip on the inside like
that's how old they are so it's like in
a sense it's possible but it's extremely
difficult to do it right and you can do
in a wide scale no yeah because they're
not none of the none of those devices
are like connected to internet or
anything like that so it's just one of
those things where it's like yeah you
have to be there in person and do it and
I think that's you know the best
security measure for it just be offline
um so I I i think if you want the most
secure in like fraud free election
possible I don't think it's gonna happen
on a nap anytime soon I keep it
old-school that being said though people
are really lazy so that demand micro it
so think about that's the merit of it
yeah right everybody virtually everybody
would be like all right easy enough but
on the flip side the down part to that
is everybody right including the trolls
and not even people who are necessarily
trying gonna have actually gonna have a
president boaty mcboatface well yeah
well stephanie is shaking like a better
candidate of everybody though there's
also do you remember last week when you
know there were these trolls that were
trying to trick hillary clinton voters
into voting online yeah it wasn't
possible at all of course on some people
they can't educate themselves enough i
guess they're just by text 335 844 to
vote for Hillary like it's American Idol
or something that's the society we've
built though so I like to answer the
question I think it could be possible
but like I don't think people are gonna
bite on that it's very much an
intriguing idea yeah oh yeah I am
legitimately a fitter eight of the out
in a perfect world it would be pop it
would it would definitely be there in a
perfect world where there's no trolls
people are everyone is an educated voter
and there's no such thing as hackers
that's thank ya but um but by and large
I think we're about like ninety-four
percent jackasses out there so thanks
for ruining at America there is a
company and not it's not just America
trolls are their global man
international you're everywhere they
need their own Island that's right all
right uh let's go ahead and call today I
guess ya know it's right like again
another reminder go out and vote
tomorrow or if you haven't well I can't
do absentee now it's too late so go on
vote please register for next year
however you want to yes just just do it
just vote go out get involved yeah do
