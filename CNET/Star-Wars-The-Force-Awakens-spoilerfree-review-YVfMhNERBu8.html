it's true
the wait is over the verdict is in with
me as my cnet colleague returned home he
has seen the force awakens and he's here
to offer his expert opinions now we are
avoiding plot spoilers here and rich is
well aware of the consequences of giving
too much away now that reminds me
actually there's this really good bit
right in the end so force awakens put
star wars back on our screens but
decades after the original and with a
new director rich does it still feel
like Star Wars well well well the force
is strong with this one you'll be glad
to hear it very much goes back to the
original trilogy the original Star Wars
trilogy and the kind of the classic DNA
in fact it's almost like a greatest hits
of Star Wars really it starts off with
it a young dreamer on a desert planet
you've got a plucky droid entrusting the
important information and even though
the empire was destroyed at the end of
Return of the Jedi you still got armies
of stormtroopers and you've got snooty
aristocratic officers and then the bad
guys are led by this masked black-clad
denizen of the dark side it feels very
much like classic Star Wars so in the
prequel trilogy there was perhaps an
over-reliance on computer effect that
didn't go down terribly well with lots
of Star Wars fans so tell me rich about
the look and the feel of the new film
well I mean obvious there is a lot of
CGI in there but again they have gone
back to the classic feel a bit of the
original trilogy so there's this
cavalcade of great creatures and aliens
and monsters and and robots that are all
done in a very physical way in camera
there's lots of great prosthetics and
makeup and all that kind of thing and it
looks absolutely fantastic the real
old-school field so it feels really
really real you really covered in that
world with one unfortunate glaring
exception I can't say too much because
it's something has not been in the
trailers but there's a very major
character who's done entirely in CGI and
it really really stands out from the
crowd of the other the creatures have
done so well and so so kind of so
physically which is a real shame I think
so force awakens introduces new
characters alongside old familiar faces
from the original trilogy what are the
new characters like and could they ever
be as beloved as Han Chewie and the gang
yeah I think so yeah I mean it's
absolute fantastic see the old faces
again it's great to see Harrison Ford
and Carrie Fisher
step back into their old roles it's
almost like they've never been away but
at the same time yeah these are the new
characters they're really really
interesting they're there they're fun
and they're compelling and they've got
interesting stories of their own and I
think it's gonna be really interesting
to see how those stories unfold and kind
of carry this new trilogy forward into
the future okay we're so to sum up
having seen force awakens how are you
now feeling about a new trilogy and a
new generation of Star Wars films well
I've got a good feeling about this so
that's what rich thoughts you can catch
the force awakens in theaters
galaxy-wide and when you have seen it do
let us know what you thought alright
that's all for now on stay tuned to see
