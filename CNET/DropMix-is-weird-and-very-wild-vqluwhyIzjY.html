it a bath was something moves and is
pretty freaky drop mixes pot game pot
toy for a hundred bucks you get this
board and this deck of cards
thanks to 21st century witchcraft each
card holds the power of a song element
like vocals from see a chandelier all
the drums from Childish Gambino's
heartbeat you put up to five elements
together and drop mix DJ's it to somehow
not sound like a good coffin this map
there are three modes in drop mix this
clash a competitive card game that
creates some insane background music
party where you and friends work
together to meet requests from the crowd
and then in this free style where you
have free rein to mix and match whatever
cards you want and just hope to god you
don't accidentally open the seven gates
of Hell it sure was a big hit in the
scene that office
but even if it is fun and it is a whole
lot of fun there are some issues $99
will get you a drop mix board and your
first deck but you'll need more cards in
the mix to keep the throws coming there
are 4 booster packs you can get right
now and each of them are $15 plus you'll
need to bring your own tablet or
smartphone as well as a good set of
speakers there's no denying it drop mix
is a mind-blower but I question the
longevity you'll get out of the game
especially if you're not conversant with
all the songs that offers and the price
of admission is a bit higher for more on
drop mix head back to c-note calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
