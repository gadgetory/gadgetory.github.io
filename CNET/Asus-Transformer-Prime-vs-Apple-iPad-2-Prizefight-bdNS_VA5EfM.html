and this is a battle between the two
hottest tablets on the market today it's
a prize 5 punch out between the asuste
transformer prime and apple's ipad 2 now
our judges will despite our senior
editor Donald ding ding Bell senior
editor Eric the tank man Franklin and
myself really dig tome will take all
three judges blind scores and abs them
out to the nearest tenth each round the
final price fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system it's six rounds of ground
and pound first one is designed the
asuste transformer prime brings the
sexiest and sleekest android tablet
we've seen the date with a higher
resolution display at 1280 by 800 and a
unibody design that manages to be a hair
thinner but also has affected its Wi-Fi
and gps performance in some cases now
the ipad 2 still brings the sexy with
the design that's only a groundbreaking
industry to finding product that others
have tried to mimic unsuccessfully its
lack of a widescreen design is also an
advantage that's a more natural feel
when you're holding it Apple gets
perfect five and a sous gets a 4.3 next
round is controls and user interface the
transformer Prime's ice cream sandwich
update has provided a more elegant OS
that adds functionality and is simple
enough to use with a little learning
while adding complexity for those who
want it it's still the most customizable
OS with widgets and we love the easy
screenshot setting and data usage
utility Apple's iOS is still the most
intuitive operating system that's easy
enough for two year olds to use it with
success is strength lies in its speed
and simplicity but it's added more
complexity with multi-touch navigation
gestures and double tapping the home
button for quick access to settings this
one will probably come down to your
personal preference but we give the iPad
to the edge with a 4.7 and the
transformer prime gets a 4.3 so after
averaging two rounds Apple leads by six
tenths of a point round three is
features
if you're looking for the most
feature-packed tablet the transformer
prime is the one for you it's quad-core
Tegra 3 processor is a beast you'll have
a micro SD card slot for additional
memory and micro HDMI support androids
marketplace is now respectable and
continues to grow but if you want to
take things to the next level it
supports a $149 keyboard dock that can
transform the experience into a laptop
and adds additional battery life a USB
port and a full SD card slot it's a
little top-heavy but it's a beauty that
would make Optimus Prime proud now the
iPad tues hardware features are
underwhelming on paper in comparison
with its dual-core a5 processor and a
1024 x 768 resolution the iPad has hdmi
out support with a $39 adapter but
there's no storage expansion at all it's
airplay compatibility makes viewing your
content a breeze if you have an Apple TV
but it's ecosystem is its greatest asset
with its robust app store that is still
superior to Android's offerings and apps
like iMessage FaceTime and iCloud ties
everything together the transformer
prime shines though and takes this round
with a 4.7 and the ipad 2 gets a 3.7
next round is web browsing a multimedia
the transformer prime brings a
significantly improved experience with
the Chrome browser that's just as
responsive as Safari both browsers don't
support flash but chrome also syncs with
your bookmarks on your desktop now
androids marketplace for media content
is now a real legitimate rival that's
close to what Apple has to offer for
content but still iTunes brings a larger
library with plenty of exclusive content
that puts it ahead here now the
transformer prime is 8 megapixel rear
camera takes the best-looking photos
from any tablet and also captures 1080p
video plus I'm a sucker for the built-in
panoramic shooting mode now the iPads
rear camera quality is embarrassing but
it's 720p video capture looks great
video on both devices look stellar but
the transformer prime has to get the
edge with its wider screen and higher
resolution with 1080p playback the
transformer prime is finally competitor
in this category that's been dominated
by Apple and we're calling this round a
tie with 4.3 points for both sides so
after averaging four rounds as Seuss's
closed the gap and we're now
at four point four points a piece round
five is performance the transformer
prime stock settings gives it the best
in class battery life for Android
tablets at nine point six hours of juice
from our own cnet tests it's OS is
snappy to use and it's gaming
performance is ridiculously good even if
there needs to be more games to play
it's inconsistent Wi-Fi performance and
GPS issues are actively being addressed
and it's improved but it's still
disappointing now the ipad 2 is the gold
standard when it comes to battery life
for tablets at eleven point nine hours
of juice in our lab tests and there's a
peace of mind that comes from never
having to really worry about charging it
its interfaces even snappier than the
transformer primes and it's faster Wi-Fi
performance is important to apple takes
this round with the 4.7 and the asuste
gets a four this fights almost over and
the final round that decides it all is
value the transformer prime retails at
499 for its 32gb model compared to the
ipads for ninety nine dollar price tag
for a 16 gig version now if you're
wondering who can do more at that price
it's the transformer prime but the ipad
2 also holds on to its value better than
Donald bells honda accord this is
another round that's too close to call
and we're calling it tied at four point
seven points so let's average out all
six rounds and in a slugfest where the
ipad 2 took an early lead the
transformer prime fought back to bring
it even but it just wasn't enough and
the ipad 2 takes this battle 4.5 to 4.4
and is your prize fight winner this was
another fight to the finish but we
finally seen an Android tablet in the
transformer prime that's an equal
competitor with the ipad 2 and the
tablet that's the best we'll come down
to you i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
for another prize by flip flops
