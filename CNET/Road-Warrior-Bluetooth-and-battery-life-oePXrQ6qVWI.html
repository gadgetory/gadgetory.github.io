and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go
coming up its batteries in Bluetooth
I've got a Bluetooth headset and a
Bluetooth car stereo and I've got a
battery life tip for you but first
something small just because the mobi
blue cube 2 is so small it's practically
a choking hazard for the plays of video
so how do you get it on there
watch the top here this is the headphone
jack but it also serves as the USB
transfer port comes with a special USB
cable right here this is not too common
out there but it plugs in like that and
that's how it goes and in order to
recharge it and you transfer it tracks
and other media to it you're gonna have
to have this cable so don't lose it
James is one of those do as I say not as
I do kind of guys next up Nicoli has a
Kyocera bluetooth headset with an LED
display shows caller ID and you can
browse through your phone's contacts
through this it also displays battery
strength signal strength probably the
first thing you've noticed it's just
really large a loop on top here it
actually houses the battery for the
headset you can charge it through the
charger jack on top of here and this is
the indicator light
Nicole rightly points out that you can't
see the LED screen when you're wearing
it but looks nice right right anyway
some practical advice you can save on
your battery life by shutting off your
Wi-Fi radio on your laptop when you're
not using it if you don't have a simple
button to do that here's how right click
on my computer choose properties select
the hardware tab press the device
manager button select network adapters
then double-click the wireless adapter
different adapters will have different
ways of shutting the wireless radio off
shutting off other peripherals like you
say your DVD player and such can also
save on battery life finally kevin
Massey shows how the Sony NEX BT 5000
car stereo can stream music wirelessly
from your phone we have a Nokia 5304
here and if I select the source as
Audio bluetooth we've already paired
these two together the phone and the
head unit I should be able to press play
on the phone and stream audio from the
phone via the head unit through my in
car speaker Kevin says that's what the
BT and BT 5000 stands for Bluetooth
those clever Sony people that's it for
this edition of road warrior I'm Tom
Merritt check back next time for more
gadgets that keep you armed and
dangerous ly productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
