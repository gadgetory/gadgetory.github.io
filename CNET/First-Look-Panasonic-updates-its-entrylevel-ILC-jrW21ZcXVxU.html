gf5 it's the company's replacement for
its GF 3 entry-level interchangeable
lens camera and while the GF 3 isn't
perfect I really like it as a step-up
model from a point and shoot for people
who are ready for something faster and
better than what they're using the most
important physical change is the new
grip the GF 3s was very slippery and
this larger rubberized grip is a huge
improvement especially if you need to
shoot single-handed buttons are also
bigger though the controls remain pretty
much the same to go with a higher
resolution LCD Panasonic redesigned the
look of the touchscreen interface and
it's a lot more attractive than before
it also incorporates the flyout tab that
debuted in the gx1 as well as interface
hints there aren't a lot of new
capabilities Panasonic's added a handful
of special effects and will now offer
suggestions of effects that can make
your photos even more interesting when
you're using one of the intelligent auto
modes and the camera is updated to shoot
1086 di video in both a vc HD and mpeg-4
though it's the same resolution as the
GF 3 the GF 5 incorporates a new version
of the 12 megapixel sensor with an
updated version of its image processing
engine the images I shot with the
pre-production model look ok but
Panasonic still needs to tweak its noise
reduction in JPEG processing a little
before it ships still as long as you
don't peer too closely at the high ISO
sensitivity images they look pretty good
but even this pre production unit is
faster yet than the already fast GF 3
and in every day shooting it feels
almost instantaneous even with raw plus
jpg the camera will come in black white
and red in a couple different kits one
with this the 14 to 42 millimeter power
zoom and another cheaper kit with the
older 14 to 42 millimeter lens I'm still
not a big fan of this lens mostly
because I never find the zoom switch on
the first try I end up fiddling with the
manual focus which instead and wonder
why it's not zooming
it does look like the GF 5 will be
better than a GF 3 and it's better
optimized for snap shooters looking to
step up I'll be back with a full review
of it when it ships later this year I'm
Laurie grinning and this is the
panasonic lumix dmc gf5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
