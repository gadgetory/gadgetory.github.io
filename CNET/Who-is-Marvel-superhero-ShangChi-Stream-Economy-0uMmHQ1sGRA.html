bit under the weather this week but the
show must go on everybody
and deadlines exclusively reported this
week that Marvel is fast tracking none
other than shang-chi to be its first
Asian superhero Li after the wild
success of Black Panther Marvel is
hoping to do something similar with
shang-chi and it looks like they already
have a writer on board but we'll get to
him in a minute
so this movie isn't actually official
official but it's likely Marvel isn't
going to make anything official until at
least phase 3 closes out with the next
Avengers movie now if you aren't a huge
comic book geek you might not be
familiar with shang-chi so here's what
we know shanky made his first appearance
in December of 1973 he's a creation of
Steve Englehart and jim Starlin and made
that first appearance in special Marvel
Edition number 15 happy birthday
shang-chi you don't look a day over 20
even though you're 45 years old he is a
half asian half American hero who
actually until recently did not have any
special powers except the ability to
master many different types of combat so
why he's called the master of kungfu he
was taught by his father foo manchu who
ends up being a little bit disappointing
as far as dads go which lets all be real
here is a classic trope
he's been affiliated with the Heroes for
Hire he's been on the Avengers and he
also is kind of a lone wolf a lot of the
time it's prequel and then also a few
years ago in Avengers vol 5 at number 38
he gained the ability to replicate
himself which could also be a power he
ends up having in the MCU also fun fact
this isn't the first time Marvel has
considered making a movie starring the
master of kung-fu all the way back in
2005 before the MCU had even began
Marvel announced it had raised hundreds
of millions of dollars and planned to
make ten movies based off its comic
characters and shang-chi was one of them
as for the script I mentioned Marvel is
already looking at a writer and that is
Dave Callaghan this is a
chinese-american writer and if you're
wondering about his geek street cred
well don't he co-wrote Wonder Woman 1984
and he's also co-writing the sequel to
spider-man into the spider-verse
this guy knows his stuff and he can also
speak honestly to the cultural
experience as well as easily avoid a lot
of stereotypes that we tend to see in
kung-fu movies which will be really nice
now where could we see this movie well
it's likely that we will not see it
until at least phase 4 maybe the start
of phase 5 but I'm guessing if they're
fast tracking it like deadline says it's
gonna be phase 4 and Kevin Feige
Marvel super producer extraordinaire has
had some things to say about the
direction of phase 4 he said quote there
are all sorts of adventures to be had
unquote within the quantum realm in a
recent book about the first 10 years of
Marvel Studios but he's also cautioned
fans not to get too crazy because Marvel
isn't entirely 100% going in a cosmic
direction so this might be a really good
movie to keep the MCU grounded here on
earth
now as to why this movie is being
fast-tracked well it's no secret that
2018 has seen a huge boom in Asian LED
filmmaking by Asians for Asians with
Asians just look at the success of crazy
rich Asians or the fact that countries
like China have been investing heavily
in the film industry for years not to
mention the Chinese movie-going audience
is a huge source of revenue or
potentially any way for any studio that
can tap into that market so now that we
know all the facts let's let's speculate
a little bit let's fan cast shall we I
think it's just as important to figure
out who could play shang-chi and his
father these are both key roles
shang-chi is only 19 years old in the
comics but it's possible they age him up
just a little bit so they can cast a
wider net for the role not for nothing
but my personal choice for shang-chi
would be Ross Butler who's on Riverdale
honestly you guys this is a no brainer
just cast this kid he's he would be
amazing I think he'd do a great job in
my humble opinion
now as for Shang Chi's father foo Manchu
isn't technically an original Marvel of
creation not to mention the name carries
a lot of not-so-great racial
stereotyping bag
in Hollywood so no likely modernize this
character with a new background and
likely a new name as for who could play
this role I think you have to go in the
direction of casting a legend in martial
arts film which brings me to my three
picks Jackie Chan gently and Donnie Yen
these are amazing picks I think it would
be a great nod to martial arts cinema of
yore
these are all icons in their own right
they would all be excellent at this role
it would be a meaty thing for them to
dig their teeth into and I think any one
of them would be great okay so now that
we've talked about the characters let's
talk about who's the badass director to
tie it all together amazing Chinese
director Chloe Chou is already helming
Eternals so she's probably out crazy
rich Asians Jon M Chu might be pretty
tied up with the sequels to that movie
but he'd still be a really good pick if
he could make his schedule work Marvel
could also decide to bring hulk director
Angley back into the fold but i wonder
if they'd rather have someone younger
and fresher which brings me to what i
feel is the most obvious choice and that
is fast and furious director justin lin
i mean how do you not hire this guy to
direct this movie he's even directing an
untitled shaolin temple remake he was
made for this you guys and our final bit
of speculation is how shang-chi might
make his way into the larger Marvel
Cinematic Universe aside from his own
standalone film of course there's going
to be some post credits scene or some
direct mention of him in one of the
movies leading up to it so my best guess
on how he might show up in the MCU has
to do with a villain called midnight
midnight is an African child raised
alongside shang-chi who ends up carrying
out fu-manchu's orders when he grows up
could midnight be the antagonist in a I
don't know Black Panther 2 maybe I think
it's a good idea I'm also not Kevin
Feige and I'm not in charge of the
larger MCU but I am sure we will have to
learn more about all of this and Shang
Chi's standalone film after the events
of the next Avengers movie as we get
into phase
for now until then I'm sure Saros has
something to say hey Sara take it away
so with thank about Marvel it's there
and it's just quite a elation in it like
like I saw opera so we just set the
other and just weave from the commit and
then what's the my name before that one
was good but why wasn't it good oh I
can't even find the energy figure I
agree a bit Marvel it's just part of my
life it's like peeing a bump sleeping
and go to Tahoe and there are we man
just like woman oh I'll get a cold or
being a cop partying I'm gonna drink ask
Marshall mushrooms everywhere
Marvin's omnipresent Marvel was Lord and
Savior when the ball drops and we're all
Dustin Hershey's Marvel is there it will
always be there it's been there before
you were born and it will be there when
you are dead last year thank you so much

until we go on a holiday break so be
sure to come back next Saturday morning
for an all-new episode of stream economy
and check out previous episodes over
here and I want to hear your best shaky
theories down in the comments so get to
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
