traditional desktop PCs around why is
that it's because of virtual reality
those big new headsets the oculus rift
in the HTC vive required desktop PCs
99.9% of laptops will not work with them
of course with that comes VR sticker
shock of course the headsets are
expensive $5.99 for an oculus $7.99 for
vive and chancellor you're gonna need to
buy an entirely new gaming ready PC for
it while oculus at least says they're
gonna find you a configuration that
works for as little as $9.99 so if
you're looking for that $9.99 oculus
ready PC here it is it's the Dell XPS
8900 special edition it's regularly 1199
frequently discounted but if you get it
in conjunction with an oculus rift
headset even go back and buy it after
the fact they give you a $200 off coupon
that gets you down to the $9.99 now
here's the catch this is the low end of
the oculus recommended specs it's an
Intel Core i5 processor it's an Nvidia
970 desktop graphics card although a 970
desktop graphic card is still plenty
fast for playing you know regular PC
games today just casual gaming
it actually looks great playing at 1920
by 1080 you can crank a lot of even new
games like fallout 4 up to ultra feels
fantastic
but VR is gonna be very challenging
we're into VR tests on this valve has
their own is it ready for VR test we've
ran that and we got a cautiously
optimistic score out of it it does meet
the minimum specs oculus has their own
tests we ran that one also that just
gives you kind of a thumbs-up
thumbs-down because this system was
built specifically with oculus in mind
it gets the thumbs up from oculus there
just be aware you're buying a VR system
on the low end of the recommended VR
specs so I can't guarantee it's gonna
stay fresh for the second or third
generation of really ambitious VR games
that's the Dell XPS 8900 special edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
