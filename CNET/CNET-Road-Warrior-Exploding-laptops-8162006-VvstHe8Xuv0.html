and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a super fast
cell phone a USB cupid device for mobile
gadgets and exploding laptop batteries
let's start with the Nokia e6 t1
what's that a sweet productivity cell
phone Bonnie Shaw has the rest of the
story as you can see it's a pretty slim
device it's a smart phone it's got this
nice roomy keyboard he's still kind of
stiff but they're not too bad it's got
this gorgeous screen really sharp and
bright colors look great in text as well
lots of productivity apps for business
users you can edit and view Word
documents and Excel documents and
PowerPoint presentations the e61 comes
with Wi-Fi and bluetooth but it's not
fast like this LG see you 500 something
looks kind of familiar it looks a lot
like the Razer same white bodies in slim
silhouette it is the first care offered
HSDPA phone which means that you can
connect up to 1.8 make up its per second
in download speeds which is one of the
fastest speeds that cell phones can
offer these days the Cu 500 also plays
mp3s and streaming video what happens if
you want to hook up your digital camera
to your iPod or maybe to music players
to each other hmm
you don't need a computer if you have
the cyma hitch USB transfer device
really is like a cupid for gadgets
because i'm connecting an ipod here on
one side and say a digital camera on the
other side and it's very easy to
navigate the backlit screen is pretty
cool it's very lightweight so what I do
up here you have the here and then there
and I can switch between the two and
what I can do is navigate through you
know let's say the folder of the digital
camera and get the pictures over by
pressing send and I'll send it this way
the device can connect pretty much
anything that uses USB finally exploding
laptops you may have heard that dell is
recalling millions of laptop batteries
but even if your laptop battery isn't
being recalled are you safe
we got our laptop expert Michelle
Thatcher to give us a tip to help keep
your laptop battery in good condition
number one of course you don't want it
to get too hot that's gonna lead to
instability so to prevent that you don't
want to leave it plugged in so once your
battery is done charging unplug it and
if you're gonna sit at your desk with
your laptop on and work on it for a
while and want to leave it plugged in
just pull the battery out Michelle has
more tips from battery safety in our
insider secrets feature at Sina tv.com
